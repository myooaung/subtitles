00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
Hey,

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.850
guys,

3
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.420
In this video,

4
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.440
we will start wiring up or registration form with our database objective off this video Is

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.710
that we when we submit our form the data that is displayed on the success that PHP page

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.000
will also get submitted so over,

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500
attendee table in over days of this.

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.990
Now this process starts with modification off our course.

9
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.300
We go back to visual studio code on.

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.200
Then what we want to do is create a new file in our DB folder some winter creating you file

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.300
click on the DB folder,

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.600
create new fire on them.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.190
Going to call this one carod dot PHP No crowd is an acronym for Create,

14
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.670
read,

15
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.840
update and delete.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.120
On the purpose of this file is the store all of the function or functions are all of the

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.460
court associate ID with those operations.

18
00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.160
This will also represents our first step into using an object oriented approach toe over

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.790
THB development.

20
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.950
So the first thing that we want to do as usual in any PHP file is create or PHP block on.

21
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.370
Then inside this block,

22
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.200
we're going to define a class on the class name.

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.520
I usually meet my class name reflective off the file names.

24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.900
That way I know exactly what class is represented by a what file?

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.350
Someone to call this class fraud.

26
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.710
And if you're not very familiar with what I'm doing here with class and objects and so on,

27
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.190
it's fine.

28
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.910
You can just stick with me and I will explain it along the way.

29
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.460
But this is object oriented approach to programming.

30
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.470
No,

31
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.290
I'm going to define private attributes and I would supply this one db on.

32
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.390
Then I went to define a function.

33
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.330
But this is a special function that every class has our chan have,

34
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.830
and it's called a constructor.

35
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.240
Someone to read the word from John on.

36
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.340
We would have looked at how we defined functions before and impeach Be all have to see is

37
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.720
the word function on Give it that name.

38
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.890
So it's a form son,

39
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.160
and then this is how we define a constructor.

40
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.650
So it is two underscores and in the word construct,

41
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.540
So that's underscore Underscore con stroked on door construct.

42
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.620
Er is going to take a parameter on that.

43
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.910
Would you call this parameter con?

44
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.130
So essentially,

45
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.800
when you're initializing an object off a class,

46
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.110
you can actually upped to do it without any objects without any parameters Or if you

47
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.850
require a permit that this is where you would have defined that a parameter is required or

48
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.980
some value is required any time you're initializing an object off that class,

49
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.470
that so I'm going to take a parameter called upon on.

50
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.660
Then I'm with a sign water value came in to this con apartment off to or private variable

51
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.000
called DB.

52
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.280
So and then I want to say this,

53
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.150
which is a key word in most programming languages,

54
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.200
which just means in this class in this class file that I'm in.

55
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.150
So this is just a short way of saying I'm home.

56
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.840
All right,

57
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.570
so this gives me access to all the private and public attributes off this class file.

58
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.270
So in this case,

59
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.670
I want this db to get the value that con us.

60
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.650
All right.

61
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.710
So in other words,

62
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.530
wherever I'm going to use Devi throat discuss,

63
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.950
it should embody whatever value came in upon.

64
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.330
All right.

65
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.170
So I just went ahead and added some comments so that we have a bit more context as to what

66
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.460
is happening with each line off court.

67
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.570
Now the cool thing about the classes that you can put as many functions and variables are

68
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.780
inside of that class.

69
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.230
And wherever you need to reference it,

70
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.620
all you need is a instance off the class on you just make reference to the function that is

71
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.980
there.

72
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.450
So we are going to be using this class toe house all off the functions associated with

73
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.260
creating a record in Ardis Abi's retrieving airport for more data bees or beating a record

74
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.830
in our data Bees on did the meeting at report in our database.

75
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.370
So for this video,

76
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.780
we will focus on fleshing Oh,

77
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.150
it's the insert function.

78
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.730
So I'm going to say function.

79
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.990
But then I have to qualify this one as public.

80
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.240
So I did say Private here on die also have option off public.

81
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.680
So what this means is that if I declare an object off class crowd,

82
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.780
there is no way for me to interact off BB because devious,

83
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.110
private to the class.

84
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.310
So the only way I can interact with DB is from another function inside off the class.

85
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.070
However,

86
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.700
when I do see public,

87
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.120
then it allows me toe interact with it outside off this.

88
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.120
So I'm which is a public function on.

89
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.190
I want to simply call this insert,

90
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.540
and I just read that function body on,

91
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.200
then insert No.

92
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.390
Is supposed to get some parameters so that it knows what it should be inserting.

93
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.590
So I'm going to define parameters here inside this insert function that will be able to

94
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.230
accept all off the values that are being passed in the post action.

95
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.350
So let me,

96
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.710
let me say that the different way,

97
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.560
remember from or form?

98
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.180
We're collecting a bunch off,

99
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.440
Beat up one's name,

100
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.890
first name,

101
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.280
last name,

102
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.800
date of birth,

103
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.330
etcetera.

104
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.930
So all of these data points are going to get submitted.

105
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.320
When they get submitted,

106
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.870
they go into the success dot PHP page,

107
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.780
which is our action on.

108
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.000
We can access them all using the post variable.

109
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.220
What we can't do,

110
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.670
however,

111
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.330
is actually put them in the database,

112
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.210
at least not yet.

113
00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.570
So I'm going to define a function inside of my crowd file that is going to be waiting and

114
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:09.080
willing to accept values that would be coming from the post function article starry.

115
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.220
So in other words,

116
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.720
I'm goingto create a perimeter.

117
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.940
Her data points Someone tohave 14 1st name and I'm going to kind of reacted shortened,

118
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.290
so they don't have toe necessarily reflect the exact name someone to shorten it.

119
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.900
But at least I'll know what f name means an L name on.

120
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.550
I'm just declaring some variables that will actually holds all off the values coming back

121
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.450
and specialty.

122
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.340
Okay,

123
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.050
So they so once again,

124
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.120
when I call this function to inserts,

125
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.010
the expectation is that I'm going to be passing a value per parameter aan den operation

126
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.950
that I carry out inside of the function will use those values to complete the insert.

127
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.310
No,

128
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.000
unto the fun part inside of my function,

129
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.100
I'm going to start off with a try and catch,

130
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.510
so I can actually just write the word try and impressed up twice.

131
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.180
And in visual studio just completes the entire try.

132
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.390
Catch for me.

133
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.310
Let me do that again at this.

134
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.460
Wrote the word try first top twice if it select.

135
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.750
If you have both speakers,

136
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.690
make sure the 2nd 1 is one that is in focus on breast up twice and then you will get your

137
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.970
track judge block automatically.

138
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.010
If that doesn't work for you to understand this.

139
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.080
Or try open brace close brace,

140
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.460
Catch open parentheses on open,

141
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.050
open and close braces.

142
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.640
No.

143
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.380
Once again,

144
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.530
the track catch block sees that I'm going to try and do something here.

145
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:50.410
But I'm watching to see if I get an error so that I can take a particular action with this

146
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.190
air and this logical exception handling.

147
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.100
So and I just added a community here.

148
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:05.280
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create a variable called SQL on this

149
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.190
variable is just going to play host to my SQL insert statements.

150
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.610
I'm going to give you guys a little trick.

151
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.560
If you're not so comfortable with SQL statements,

152
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.300
then you can actually go over to your database in PHP.

153
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:27.940
My admin Click on your table on then Goto sq Well on then click insert And it kind of gives

154
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.850
you a little template as to what an insert statement needs to look like.

155
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.360
So,

156
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.420
following this guy,

157
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.310
we know how we need to type out our statements.

158
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.310
On the whole,

159
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.190
we're going to put them into PHP.

160
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.900
But once again,

161
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:48.450
if it is that you want to develop your esque you'll and database development skills.

162
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.020
Then you need to check out my course,

163
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.580
which is my SQL database development.

164
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.050
Andi mastery.

165
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.060
So,

166
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.910
back in our cold,

167
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.760
where did you spend type so together?

168
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.460
Someone to say Insert into So those air SQL keywords on Ben.

169
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.870
I am going to specify the table name,

170
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:12.150
which in this case is a 10 B because I'm about to insert a report into the attendee table.

171
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.090
Andi,

172
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.830
I have to specify which columns now They're two schools of thought are two ways to do this

173
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:17.830
.

174
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.560
You can specify all the problems.

175
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.350
You don't necessarily have to,

176
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.240
because if you put the column values sorry,

177
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.090
if you put the values in the exact order that they would have appeared.

178
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.670
If you said value,

179
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.080
then you don't necessarily have to do this part of it.

180
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.180
Someone to skip that part of it.

181
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.110
And I'm just into right.

182
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.690
It's the more you know,

183
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.480
the Foster Lee.

184
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.850
So the first column would be first name,

185
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.410
last name,

186
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.210
date of birth,

187
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.780
email address plant that number on Dwell.

188
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.230
Remember,

189
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.180
we had specialty idea and not just a specialty,

190
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.230
so we'll get to that.

191
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.130
But that's the order you don't need to put in anything for attendee i d because it's an

192
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.870
auto incriminating primary key.

193
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.010
So after the would be list,

194
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.060
off columns comes the word values.

195
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.950
So we would have had attendee and then listing out all the columns and then we say values.

196
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.330
But since we're not listing the columns,

197
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.220
I just removed that.

198
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.840
So if you're listing the columns,

199
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.650
you have the parent disease.

200
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.240
If they're not,

201
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.460
they don't need them on,

202
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.380
Then we'll save values.

203
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.960
But here is the crazy part.

204
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.120
So with a regular sq,

205
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.180
a statement,

206
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:33.360
you would have stipulated of value that corresponds with each one of these.

207
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.630
So if I just feel this right now,

208
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.110
I would have put something like the static value.

209
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.050
Mary Andi Poppins,

210
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.820
etcetera,

211
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.130
Right?

212
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.690
I'm not going to fill out all of this,

213
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.870
but that's what I would have assumed in so everybody can see.

214
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.510
All right,

215
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.610
so that is what I would have been putting in if I was writing this statement manual.

216
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.890
And if you were using that my s killer in my school I date Ah,

217
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.130
ap I Then that's also whole.

218
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:11.230
You would ever over the dangers off doing directly like that in PHP it opens you up to

219
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.070
watch because SQL injections which are very,

220
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.240
very nasty kind of attack that you really don't want to entertain.

221
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.840
Okay,

222
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.920
So as as a guard against that PDO requires that were active particulate away on,

223
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.590
then it will execute it.

224
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:32.190
So the particulary way that we're going to write it will have us actually using like

225
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.410
placeholders.

226
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.400
So instead of seeing the value,

227
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:41.320
understand To put colon on a placeholder toe correspond with what should be there.

228
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.070
Alright,

229
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.030
someone to say colon f name fallen l name on.

230
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:52.530
I understand you reuse all of those variable names from the parameters So really and truly

231
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:52.530
,

232
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.020
once again,

233
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.090
these are place holders,

234
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.630
they don't have any values right now.

235
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.000
So at the end of this exercise,

236
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.370
you should have these please holders.

237
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:09.780
Once again I give them similar names to each variable that I know they will correspond with

238
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.870
You didn't have toe boat for consistency.

239
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.250
I I recommend that you do so we would have created some very,

240
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.410
very abstract form often sqs demons.

241
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:29.280
The next step is toe Prepare this SQL statement Someone to be clear on mother variable on.

242
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.560
I'm going to call this one s d MT that short for statements.

243
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.630
So that's just my naming convention on.

244
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.660
Then I'm going to see this.

245
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.970
And then this is so we actually access or private variable devious.

246
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:48.720
Remember that TV represents the PDO connection or the connection on we would have already

247
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.470
defined or connection from inside off con on this is our PDO objects,

248
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.440
which represents connecting to the database.

249
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:04.680
So here it within the class crowed This is an obstruction off this connection.

250
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.380
So PDO exists here.

251
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:12.800
But what we intend to do is pass it into the crowd class and it will get stored as DB.

252
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.920
So the only way to access DB is to see this.

253
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.920
So it's not the same this on then We use that operators.

254
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.230
So that's a dash and greeted aunts and our listeners.

255
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:35.050
And with a narrow on this arrow is basically hole We reference reference attributes or

256
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.950
properties or functions within from a class aren't are from an object.

257
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.680
So this represents the object off class screwed on.

258
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.550
Then we're accessing the property,

259
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:54.220
our attributes dd so we say db on then inside off db,

260
00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.550
we have another function someone to use that arrow again on this function is called Prepare

261
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.000
on,

262
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.890
then prepare takes a parameter which would be the SQL statement.

263
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.380
So we could have just done this.

264
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:15.590
We would have said this R o D B r o prepare and then just write that skill statement inside

265
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.290
off the parentheses.

266
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.050
But I like segmenting its like this or that.

267
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.850
Eat step off the way it is clear what is happening.

268
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.980
So we gonna defined rs your statement first on.

269
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.900
Then we went ahead and prepared it for execution later.

270
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:38.130
The next step is to actually bind over placeholders to the actual values to remember that

271
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.820
these with the Poland's here inside off our SQL statement,

272
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.400
I really place all us what the rial values are expected to come in through these parameters

273
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:47.400
.

274
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:54.930
So we need to have a section where we see STM tea on an arrow on that we call a film song

275
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.170
called Bind Param.

276
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:03.380
And then this function takes two parameters in the experimental number one which is our

277
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.350
placeholder.

278
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.370
So F name is the first place holder on.

279
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.110
Then we have a comma on.

280
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.650
Then we see What do you want?

281
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.940
Oh,

282
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.690
buying this place holder to on essentially what this would do.

283
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.920
We see that within this statement that is being prepared,

284
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:26.480
I want that these placeholders gets replaced with these values Now it may seem tedious it

285
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.860
may seem Monday,

286
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.600
and especially if you're used to just writing SQL statement any insert into.

287
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.860
But once again,

288
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:38.730
this is an added level of protection against the SQL injection attack.

289
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:43.910
So you are going to do that for each placeholder and understand to duplicate these lines

290
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.320
and understand to change what I need to change parents,

291
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.750
they can to stop in peace than kind of expedite that process on.

292
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.590
Here's one of the advantages with using the placeholder,

293
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.740
making the peaceful that looked just that available name.

294
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.850
The changes can occur more quickly,

295
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.100
So I'm just going to go ahead and change those votes.

296
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.750
All right,

297
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:09.520
so I'm finished binding all off my placeholders and everything looks good to go on the

298
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.850
final thing to do or sorry,

299
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.770
I I made a mistake with my object name.

300
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.700
I had the cord written somewhere else and I copied in pieces,

301
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.150
so I've gotten that corrected.

302
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.790
All right,

303
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:29.840
so I know that we've boned all off the placeholders with our actual values.

304
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.600
The next thing that we want to do is actually execute.

305
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.440
So we cst empty Onda we on.

306
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.860
Then I use my arrow on.

307
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:46.760
I'm going to call a function called execute on this one deep snow parameters.

308
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.300
And then after we write execute,

309
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.380
I'm going to write return True.

310
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.820
So at least if he gets this fire and it returns true,

311
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:06.220
then we can take this as a success indicator that our statement was executed successfully.

312
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.740
Now,

313
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.580
on the negative side off the fence,

314
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.940
we want to actually handle any era that might come up.

315
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.700
And at this stage,

316
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.150
we really want to see any error that comes up.

317
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:22.530
So I'm going to replace this terrible th with PDO exception.

318
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.190
So remember that we're tearing oughta PDO operation here.

319
00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.590
So the more,

320
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:32.990
more slightly exception to occur is with the PDO operation on,

321
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:39.040
I'm going to assign any error object that comes back to a variable called E on then well,

322
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.630
I'm going to do down here is echo to the screen.

323
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.820
So I'm not one to throw.

324
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.110
Those throwing would stop the execution altogether,

325
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:55.130
but I went to echo e r o get to message so we would have used E ira.

326
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.700
Get message before Andi.

327
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.290
I'm sure you're wondering what that iro meant.

328
00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.870
So I hope that this exercise has brought more context to what this area is because he's

329
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.410
really just an object off a whole class on.

330
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.350
We just established that within a class,

331
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:13.660
those with access what is in the class is to use the arrow operator on.

332
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.410
Then we can actually interact with the other functions.

333
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.040
So est GMT,

334
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:28.350
here is an object off off db Prepare on then the SD empty object has a function bind Param

335
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.000
on the function execute.

336
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.560
So in the same way e dollar sign e represents the class or an object off the class video

337
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.230
exception on one of the functions of illiteracy is get message on then if on a released

338
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:48.760
carts on so not throwing but printed to the screen and we want to return falls.

339
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.930
So then then this is just an indicator to say it was not successful.

340
00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.940
Now that we have me those changes to our crowd page or crowd file.

341
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.400
No,

342
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.610
we have a few changes that we want to make toe our connection file The first thing I want

343
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.500
to do is at what we call attributes toe the PDO object.

344
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.260
So I know it's connecting to the database,

345
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.420
and it's often and dandy.

346
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.520
But when we were doing this exercise,

347
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.050
we did not set attributes on those actually says I really want are,

348
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.060
like a remote.

349
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.550
So in other words,

350
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.870
PDO will always try to behave itself and be not unintrusive.

351
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.660
But then you can force it to behave a certain way by setting the attributes on a certain

352
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.390
way I wanted to be here is that if there's an exception,

353
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:41.440
I actually wanted toe stop all execution and show me that there's an exception.

354
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.710
So what I'm going to do here is reference a PDO object on.

355
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:54.430
I'm going to call the function inside this object called the set attributes on.

356
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.780
Then I'm just going to type these oh,

357
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.090
quickly off screen,

358
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.260
and then we just review them.

359
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:04.060
So these are the two attributes that I want to set on their both as it relates the era.

360
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.380
So I'm sitting this attributes on the era more is exception.

361
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:08.750
All right,

362
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:14.200
so essentially this attribute is you're saying that whenever there's an air I want to see

363
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.940
that there's an air.

364
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.860
Don't behave yourself.

365
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.110
Tell me that there's an error because the last thing you want is doing the bullying.

366
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.330
You think it's all well and fine,

367
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.730
and then you push the production and then nothing works.

368
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.950
So we want to see when there's an error.

369
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.510
So that's what this line is seeing.

370
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.760
That's change Number one.

371
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:37.890
The next change that we want to me is to actually reference our crowd file from right here

372
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.400
in cod in Khan.

373
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.190
Andi,

374
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.790
I'm going to explain why we're going to do it this way.

375
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:47.950
Remember that in our pages we are a frenzy are con not PHP.

376
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.050
Instead of having to reference conduct Ph.

377
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.740
B and then reference crowed.

378
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:59.350
Why I'm going to do is after setting up a successful a successful connection,

379
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.170
of course,

380
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.880
because the only way will get this fires.

381
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.760
If no exception is thrown,

382
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:13.260
I want to include or what I can require on I'm only going to require once.

383
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.690
Andi,

384
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.210
I want fraud dot PHP notice.

385
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:24.670
I don't have to put db slash Croat because this is the con file that is requiring the file

386
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:24.670
.

387
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:29.480
So if I look at the four the level They're both on the same level in the DB folder.

388
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.050
So I don't have to say db slash crowd.

389
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.080
So if you're a db slash card,

390
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.720
I didn't work then trying to remove the d v slash and it should work some referencing crude

391
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.890
that PHP on.

392
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.620
Then I'm going to define ah whole new object on.

393
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.930
I'm calling it crude on to define an object I'm going to see this is the name off the

394
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.440
object.

395
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.290
And I wanted to be equal to a new instance off my class.

396
00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:02.840
And remember that the class the finally mr dot PHP the class they missed red dot PHP on the

397
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.400
object name is crawdad ph with screw.

398
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.960
So everything is cross everything looks uniforms.

399
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.560
So the new instance off crowed on,

400
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.320
then crowd requires on here.

401
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.360
Visual studio code is telling me that there is something that needs to go inside off the

402
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:19.880
parameters.

403
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.330
And that's because when we defined our constructor,

404
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.260
we defined it to accept some value.

405
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.100
All right,

406
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.760
so the value that is expecting institution in our context because we're the ones building

407
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.820
its we know that the values expecting is some connector.

408
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.890
Someone to pass the PDO object in tow,

409
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.060
my parameter.

410
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:52.090
So PDO so know what will happen is that for each time that we actually include or require

411
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.270
the con file,

412
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.950
the connection will be established on this will be done once.

413
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:04.160
And then it will just reference or profile so that any operation you want to carry out,

414
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.310
we need only reference the crowd object on whatever function.

415
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.000
So at this point,

416
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.420
we only have one function so anywhere we actually have fun referenced on any page.

417
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:27.200
We can actually just go ahead on reference Dollar sign crude on then using our operator,

418
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.880
we can look at all the other phone sons in there.

419
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.300
So armed with this new knowledge,

420
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.670
what we need to do is actually start setting up our success speech to be able to call our

421
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.990
crowd function.

422
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:51.080
So step number one is require and I'm just into require once on,

423
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.100
we're going to put on the db slash con dot PHP.

424
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.110
So when this speech Lords,

425
00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:03.720
it's going toe require this file which is going to go ahead and initiate a connection on,

426
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.910
then it's no going to require or crowd file on defined a new class on,

427
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.750
then anything we need to do on the page,

428
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.970
we can receive object crowd on,

429
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.270
call the function.

430
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.870
So this way we're segmenting the court and we're keeping everything.

431
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.760
One place we're not putting too much PHP are too much,

432
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.470
too much database,

433
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.950
too many database operations,

434
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.480
mixing up with our HTML all the time.

435
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.660
And it's a nice,

436
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.080
cleaner way to have your court.

437
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.780
Now that I have completed that activity,

438
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.000
I'm going to start writing some more.

439
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.370
Ph.

440
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.470
B Chord on.

441
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.980
I'm just going to use the block that's there already.

442
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:49.050
So what I want to do is check if this if this page is being loaded on a post action on now

443
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.540
context,

444
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.180
realize that,

445
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:58.200
remember that we can always go to our application and just see locals that tenants slash

446
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.560
success that PHP all right on because it's opposed.

447
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.130
We don't have any off those parameters.

448
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.210
We don't have a question,

449
00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.530
but and when I do that,

450
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:13.060
I'm going to be getting a bunch of errors about undefined variables on that is really

451
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:20.050
because it it is trying to print values from the post action.

452
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.400
If there was no post option meaning,

453
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.560
I'm just browsing to the page casually.

454
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.950
I didn't actually submit a for him to get there then these variables don't exist.

455
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.250
So before we attempt to put anything in the database,

456
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.380
we probably want us check.

457
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.300
If such a variable exists,

458
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:48.220
and if at least one out off all of the's exists that we can assume that the that arrest off

459
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.090
them exist.

460
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:49.810
Alright?

461
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.240
No.

462
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.050
When we were designing our form,

463
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:58.280
I had put a name on the submit button and this is why so a lot of the times you see that

464
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:05.400
people put a name on the submit button on what they'll do is check if the submit variable

465
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.050
exists,

466
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.370
because this would have come over in the post variable along with first name,

467
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.830
last name,

468
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.230
etcetera,

469
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.600
etcetera.

470
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.010
Even though it has no value,

471
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.190
it really it exists.

472
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.340
It's like an empty variable on the post action.

473
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:27.480
So what we want to do is start off by checking if that submit value exists.

474
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.010
So I can say if a NASA is set.

475
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.390
So that's a function to say doesn't exist on inside the set.

476
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.010
We passed in a variable,

477
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.420
so this is a nice way to check if a variable exists on a page,

478
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.570
someone to check if is set square bracket on submit.

479
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:48.480
So once again,

480
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.960
this is not checking for our values.

481
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.710
Just checking.

482
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.560
Does this variable exists?

483
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.490
Whether it's empty or not is irrelevant.

484
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.060
Does it exist on the page on?

485
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.510
But if it does,

486
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.160
then we want to carry out an option.

487
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.780
The red lanterns there because I missed this cynical and cerebral that all right,

488
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.860
so we say if it's set post summit,

489
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.380
so if the Post submit variable exists,

490
00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.090
then we want to proceed with our operation.

491
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:22.420
So I'm going to define another variable,

492
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.300
and I'm going to call it.

493
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.460
Success equals on.

494
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.750
The reason I'm doing this is I'm about to call the crowd function insert.

495
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.120
And remember that insert is a value returning function causes either returning through our

496
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.670
falls.

497
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.480
So that means Well,

498
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.570
I probably can call this is success instead of success.

499
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.480
So this is asking a question.

500
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.400
Is it successful?

501
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.330
Drawer falls?

502
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.100
Is it a success on?

503
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:54.050
Then I'm going to assign to this variable whatever is returned from the phone shown.

504
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.360
No,

505
00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:03.820
because we defined are we required baby slash corn dot PHP on Remember that it initialize

506
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.320
is some object for us called crude.

507
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.630
I have instant access to this object called fraud on then,

508
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:21.680
inside off the crude object I want my insert phone son on this insert function is defined

509
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:27.700
the except in this order these values first name the last name date of birth,

510
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.120
email,

511
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.420
address,

512
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.940
contact and specialty.

513
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:37.130
So I'm actually going to go ahead on and fill in these values using the post values.

514
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:42.780
So one pattern would be the Adidas past the post value directly into the function.

515
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.630
I'm not particularly fund off that I prefer to define my variables.

516
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.210
So I'm going toe have f name.

517
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.370
So within the context,

518
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.530
off success that Ph.

519
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.230
B F game didn't exist,

520
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.810
so I can reuse it here.

521
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:59.450
So F name is equal toe post first name.

522
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:05.280
And I'm going to do that for each off the values in the post.

523
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.740
On going to do that,

524
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.310
all screens,

525
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:13.170
you can go ahead and do that all rights of added all of the's values from the post.

526
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:17.540
Hurry on some comments so that we know exactly what's happening.

527
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:17.980
Adede.

528
00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.950
Step on,

529
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:26.200
then what I'm going to do is call the insert function on pass in the required parameter.

530
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.760
So it's F name l named.

531
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.110
You'll be email in that exact order.

532
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:36.620
So I'm going to see the Assign F name as the first parameter.

533
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.870
The sign l name Andi.

534
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.520
I'm just going to do all of them.

535
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.760
Just make sure that they all line up.

536
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.670
All right?

537
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.110
So once that is done,

538
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.210
let me just recap.

539
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.020
What What happened?

540
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.780
So when this page is loaded,

541
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.150
it will check if the Post,

542
00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.920
if one off the post variables exist on.

543
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.490
We're working with the assumption that if one exists and the others exist,

544
00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.910
So if one exists,

545
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.760
then we want to extract other values from each one on.

546
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.500
This is done because maybe you get in the valuable.

547
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.270
You want to manipulate it before you put it into the database.

548
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:13.890
So that's why this is always a good idea before actually calling the insert function on.

549
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:18.270
Then at the end of us that we check if it was a success.

550
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:18.530
Well,

551
00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:25.570
we passed those values into our insert function on Then the result of the insert function

552
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.950
will get stored in this variable is success.

553
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:36.080
So then this comes in handy because if we want to print a specific message if it was

554
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.420
successful versus appeals.

555
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:43.050
A failure than this gives us the ability so I can see if its success meaning if this was

556
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:43.580
true,

557
00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.700
then do something else.

558
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.000
Do something else.

559
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.150
So right now what we're doing is printing a nice alert on ice success message when you have

560
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.910
been successfully registered up until no,

561
00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.640
there wasn't any real operation to me to make it a failure.

562
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:08.530
So what I'm going to do is did this h one tug on actually echo this each one tug if it was

563
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.090
a success.

564
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.420
So if is success,

565
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.700
then we will see that success message being printed to the screen else.

566
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.860
We're going to echo the opposite someone to reuse that cold.

567
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.210
But I'm going to change this text danger which will give us read text on then that we will

568
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.100
see there was an arrow in processing.

569
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.760
There was on arrow.

570
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.850
All right,

571
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:33.770
so once again,

572
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.830
we're checking to see if we got true.

573
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.670
Are falls returned from this insert function.

574
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.890
And if it is true,

575
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.080
then we want to give them a success message.

576
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.330
And if it was falls,

577
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.530
then we want to show them that.

578
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:45.910
Hey,

579
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.750
there was an arrow processing your registration.

580
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.380
No,

581
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.520
we have one additional and very major change to make.

582
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.940
And that is as it released our specialty.

583
00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.640
No,

584
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.590
up until this point,

585
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.430
specialty has been coming across us.

586
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.870
Text.

587
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:03.080
We have a select control here,

588
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.800
A drop down list giving us each specialty on when we submitted it on the success speech.

589
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.080
When we printed the value,

590
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.800
we got a text.

591
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.850
You got somebody off text now?

592
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:21.800
The problem with that is we designed our database to accept a specialty I d.

593
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.860
So we have a specialty stable,

594
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.020
which is empty right now,

595
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.390
so we can always feel this with data on,

596
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.510
but the attendee table is taking the i d relative.

597
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.190
So the specialties in this table.

598
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.220
So first they need to insert,

599
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.610
at least Well,

600
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.310
I'm going to insert one for this video,

601
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.910
so I'm going to insert the database,

602
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.640
add mean specialty.

603
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.430
So I go.

604
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.790
So I click on my table specialties.

605
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.700
And then I clicked on insert on.

606
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.640
Then I'm going toe,

607
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.580
not give it on.

608
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.220
I devalue because I can't.

609
00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.410
But I'm going to give you the name,

610
00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.030
database,

611
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.790
admin and then go.

612
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:08.540
This will show me that it's about to execute an insert command on the bottom of page.

613
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.670
I can click go again on then that inserted.

614
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.340
So when I look in that database by just clicking on the table,

615
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.370
it will always show me what's there on.

616
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.900
I see that they did a double entry.

617
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.960
Okay,

618
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.310
I can remove one.

619
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.190
That's fine.

620
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.860
But no,

621
00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.320
I see that I have at least one record here on day.

622
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.470
I have database admin on the I d hear history,

623
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.220
which means because we set off that constant on the table,

624
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.010
I can put in an I d value here that doesn't exist in the table.

625
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:44.440
So whatever I'm about to insert into my database needs too much with the Wisconsin train.

626
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.570
So I went to force this.

627
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.810
So we're going to me this more than I am because you go along.

628
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.600
But for no,

629
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.730
I'm just going to force the value associated with this option to be three.

630
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.420
So we'll just make sure that Mary Poppins,

631
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.110
for example,

632
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.770
see selects three on.

633
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.880
She's a database admin on.

634
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.670
When we submit what the expectation is that three will be printed here on the two or three

635
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.660
will be passed over in the post on.

636
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:18.100
Then three will be the value that is received here in specialty Onda ultimately put into

637
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.050
the database.

638
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.330
All right,

639
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.180
so I'm going to try and submit the form and let's see if we get any URLs and try and

640
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.060
whether through them,

641
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.080
so I submit.

642
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.700
I'm seeing that I'm getting a few Arabs here on the 1st 1 is saying that there's an

643
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.000
undefined index date off birth and they give me the line number in the file.

644
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.280
And when I look back,

645
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.600
they are right because it's not get off birth.

646
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.760
It's actually deal be.

647
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.960
So that's my mistake.

648
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.730
So just meet that correction.

649
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:47.950
The next arrow is seeing that I have on on defined method call to get Massad.

650
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.500
So that's a spelling error on my part.

651
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.850
So on crowed that PHP on line 30 weekend go ahead on me,

652
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:59.350
that correction So that's get message on.

653
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:02.700
Then we can try and resubmit Andi,

654
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.450
I expect to see ares again because all right,

655
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.210
there we go.

656
00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.090
There was an heroin processing.

657
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:17.030
So what this did was it attempted the operation I specified and it returned falls on then

658
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.210
because he returned falls.

659
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.910
We're printing all that bread text seen.

660
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.660
There was an arrow processing.

661
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.650
There was an error in processing.

662
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:31.110
But then we're also echoing the message because we did see gets message to be should be

663
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.990
echoed on.

664
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:37.040
What we're echoing is saying that the insert value this does not much something,

665
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:37.870
something something.

666
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.680
And that's because the data,

667
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.890
the word database Adminis still coming across instead off the i.

668
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:43.250
D.

669
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.900
All right,

670
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.080
so let's try that again,

671
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.500
and the era was because I did not refresh my page.

672
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.150
I just resubmit to the form.

673
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:56.460
So let's try and fill up the form once again on then we can proceed to submit,

674
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.120
All right,

675
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.200
so I'm still getting the error.

676
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.160
And if we read the RNC and that the value list does not much the column list.

677
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.840
So that that is because,

678
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.190
well,

679
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.410
it seemed that there's some cola mismatching with the values that we provided.

680
00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:14.730
So what I'm going to do is just modify my insert into and be very,

681
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.790
very explicit on.

682
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.480
I'm going to see a long first name.

683
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:24.430
Last name dates off birth.

684
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:30.670
So these are the column names as they appear in the database design.

685
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:36.690
So just you can always just remind yourself as to what the columns are by clicking on the

686
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.150
table itself and then going to structure.

687
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.680
And you see,

688
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.240
first name,

689
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:40.750
last name,

690
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:41.360
date of birth,

691
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:41.780
email,

692
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.110
address,

693
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.020
contact numbers.

694
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:43.720
We have to be very,

695
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:43.950
very,

696
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.220
very sure that you're spilling them.

697
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:46.590
Right,

698
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.320
So that's date of birth.

699
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.980
Email address.

700
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.740
Contact number on specialty.

701
00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.900
Underscore I d.

702
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.540
So we can try this one more time,

703
00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.040
so I'm going to go back to my form.

704
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.790
I went to refurbish Once again,

705
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:08.420
Philip totes on Submit and I have success.

706
00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.050
All right,

707
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:14.030
on then you notice that there's a three coming back here in this in this printout,

708
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.780
as opposed to the word database,

709
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.200
I mean,

710
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.880
so that that's fine as we go along with refine it.

711
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.350
But the important thing is that after all of these changes and activities,

712
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:28.980
we have finally registered somebody successfully not validate that the person has been

713
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.010
registered successfully.

714
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:34.770
We can always go back to PHP my admin click on our attendee table on.

715
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:41.890
We will see over record their Mary Poppins on you see that the date off birth came across

716
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.150
zeros on.

717
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.180
That's because of a former thing issue.

718
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.440
But we will start that.

719
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:46.840
Oates.

720
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.970
But right?

721
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:48.180
No,

722
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:53.920
we have Victor because we have successfully submitted or 1st 2 records in the database corn

723
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.660
egrets.
