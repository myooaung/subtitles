1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
Hey,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:01,910
guys,

3
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,940
Let me start all this video by congratulating you for making it this far.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,920
By this time,

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,630
you should have already completed your THB forms application as well as all of the crowd

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,920
operations that are required for supporting it on in this video,

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,590
we will be uploading all of for hard work to get up.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,730
So just to review,

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,800
we would have built this entire application and we know want to put it into a remote

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,650
repository.

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,840
No.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,230
While I'm doing this at pretty much the end off all of for work,

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,370
it is actually advisable that you do this as early as possible because as we were working

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,920
on it before,

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,230
machine crash would have only had one copy of it and that would have been on our machine.

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,790
There's also no tangible way to track all of the changes that we've made the files on.

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,560
Any changes that may be our colleagues or co workers would have also made so get being a

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,060
source control mechanism is an excellent way to track all the changes and keep ah spear

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,840
copy off your project at all times and especially with the availability off remote

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,600
repositories such as Get tub.

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,950
We can have multiple copies off our project as we work towards the end.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,950
Now,

24
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,660
in this video,

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,920
we're going to use ghetto for desktop so you can just find that on by No,

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,590
I'm assuming that you would have already installed and configured that in Get up,

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,150
Best up.

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,350
I'm going to goto file on.

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,820
I'm going to add local repository.

30
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:40,360
Now I'm going to navigate to the project that we have So our project is in season Ishi

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,840
docks are wherever you installed some but in HD docks is where you should have had your

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
attendance projects or Justin to select that folder on.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,930
Then it's going to warn us that there is no repository in this folder.

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,390
Would you like to create one?

35
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:01,330
And we will just take that Created on dso We get this screen where we can just go ahead and

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,500
click create.

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,780
Once that operation is done,

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:12,350
our get repository is created locally and then we'll be asked if we want to publish it.

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,860
Toe,

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,630
get up So you can just go ahead and click Publish repository.

41
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,720
We maintain the name and I'm with the antique The part that keeps the school private

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
because I wanted public.

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,430
So everybody who has followed these lessons can have access to the court.

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,480
And then we publish Repository.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,390
Now I go to get hope Web on drug in,

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:42,000
and I will see my repository listed right here for access so I can just click it on.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,130
Having done that,

48
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:52,890
I will see all off my files nicely put down on this remote storage space while we're here,

49
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,110
though,

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,420
I'll just use the time to add a quick description to the project so that when you come

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,580
across that you know exactly what it is.

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,110
All right?

53
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,710
So we just added our I decided a description real quickly.

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,710
Andi,

55
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,000
I think that's it.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,090
That's it for adding or project to get up to.

57
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,040
Remember that from here we can track all changes.

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,470
So I didn't make a change,

59
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:23,140
and the change I didn't make was to add the button for a buck to list toe our edit pitch.

60
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,790
So I'm going to meet that change,

61
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,060
right?

62
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,550
No,

63
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:32,440
on what I'm going to do is duplicate this button on with the TECO Bt and block because I

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,690
don't want it to stretch right across But then this one I'm going to have back to list to

65
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,300
the left on going to the save changes to the right.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,050
And this one is going to be BT and default.

67
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,260
Onda.

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,250
Well,

69
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,900
well,

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,260
actually this should all be an uncle Tug.

71
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,090
So there he just changes quickly.

72
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,750
All right,

73
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,770
so change the button.

74
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:00,720
Completely toe on Ankara tug On day the truth will be back toe the listing speed riches,

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,490
viewer cars or PHP on.

76
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm using the class beating and Bt and default.

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,160
So it retains the look off a button.

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,210
Onda,

79
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,900
What I'm going to do is save all of this on then refresh the page and that's what it's

80
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,910
going to look like.

81
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,950
Someone toe have my edit page on then my link to go back on day the other one to see if

82
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,390
changes are so.

83
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,780
I just made this change.

84
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,770
What's going to happen?

85
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,920
No is that it is tracking these changes on once again.

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,000
This is the benefit off using ghetto.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,500
It is tracking these changes.

88
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,980
So when I bring up,

89
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,320
get up.

90
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,320
This up is showing me what was changed and what it was changed to Andi.

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,750
I can commit this the master Master being that final branch that you know it's production

92
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,200
ready.

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,880
Andi,

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,750
I can no push the origin.

95
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,500
No,

96
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm going to have a different tutorial on how to manage gets using branches on promoting

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,030
court.

98
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,510
But in this situation,

99
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,930
since we're the only ones building this,

100
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,270
we can always push the master.

101
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,570
You know,

102
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,490
that's not the best idea at all times on DSO having done that,

103
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,050
commit on push toe origin are pushed to get up.

104
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,570
If I go back to my repository and I refresh then looking at the edit page will show that I

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,290
just didn't edit 32 seconds ago.

106
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,930
All right,

107
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,910
so once again this is a great collaborative to where everybody can see what changes are

108
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,250
being made along the way.

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,490
Having done all of this,

110
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:37,380
the next step is to publish our websites toe Hiroko So stick our own as this chapter is

111
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,350
coming to a close
