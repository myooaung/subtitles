1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey,

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:01,920
guys.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,950
In our previous video,

4
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,900
we went through modifying our form submission toe.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,520
Actually,

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,030
Goto another page once of data was submitted in the form on DTI to display the data being

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,560
submitted.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,360
So just as a quick recap where distance of quickly,

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,210
Philo this form.

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,680
And I'm just going to use values that were there before to expedite that process.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,190
And then when I click submit,

12
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,580
we go to the next page where everything that we just filled out is there on display.

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:38,620
Now we looked at using one and action and to the method get onda get method actually puts

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,650
all off the values being submitted in the form right there in the Ural in Plea Insect.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,350
You don't want that if you're dealing with sensitive information,

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,130
you don't want that.

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,780
The earl will be a source for anybody who has malicious intentions to just come and get the

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,090
data.

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,350
It shouldn't be that simple.

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,910
So for certain applications,

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,170
yes,

22
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,710
it's fine.

23
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,960
But then when you're dealing with sensitive data,

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,940
you want to use another method which is called post,

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,070
and that is what we will be looking at today.

26
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,180
No,

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,100
get on post are very,

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,050
very very similar.

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,230
So the changes that we need to make toe or farm and tore action peach will be very,

30
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,570
very minimal now.

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,920
The first change that we would make is to change the method.

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,790
So we did say,

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:28,080
Get what we want to say this time is post Andi that is half off.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
The work completes right there.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,800
So just by changing the method from gets to post the form,

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,740
behavior will be entirely different.

37
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,540
And I'll show you.

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,640
No,

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,540
you notice that there is a difference.

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,060
So I'm getting an error here,

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,370
and it is seeing that I have undefined indexes on do other things.

42
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,060
So it's looking for the values that should be there,

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,690
and it's not finding it.

44
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,290
Also,

45
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,350
you notice that my girl does not spots over any values.

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,960
So then you're probably wondering,

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,450
OK,

48
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,850
where are the values?

49
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,620
So if we go back to our action page,

50
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,910
which was success that PHP,

51
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,260
we would have written quite a bit off course,

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,480
we we took this from bootstrap Society Does get that card on.

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,120
What we were doing was echoing get on each index off the get.

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,570
So what happens is that because we're not passing over the values in the get method anymore

55
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:29,570
.

56
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,600
The Super Vera before get is not getting any values.

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,720
That's that's pretty much what's happening here.

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,090
So that is why we're getting these errors.

59
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:45,100
That undefined index first name because they get Super Variable is looking for some value

60
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,440
with the index first name.

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,670
Same with the last name on every other one.

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,250
So this no is a way to introduce the other super variable,

63
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,920
which works with the post method on that one is post.

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,080
It's that simple.

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,150
So I'm going to leave this court and actually just going toe comment out this score,

66
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,960
or at least most off this court,

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,500
because after coming until the PHP manually.

68
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,350
So I'm just going to commented thoughts.

69
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,920
Andi,

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,620
I'm going to leave a notice above it.

71
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,550
So we all know what this code was for.

72
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,650
All right,

73
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,480
so I just throw this little guy to see that this spring Sol values our past toe the action

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,570
be using method equals get so that we know that that's what this section off court was for

75
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:34,570
.

76
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,270
However,

77
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,130
I'm going to duplicate this section of code.

78
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm just going to make some modifications like I said Get on post are very,

79
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,980
very similar on the big difference is that instead off seeing get,

80
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,190
I'm going to see dollar sign on the score.

81
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,310
Post on that is half of the work on Peter's.

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,390
I'm just going to leave it with first name on.

83
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,970
Then I am going to go back now.

84
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,150
Another thing is that because the values are not here in the early,

85
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,080
it's kind of visiting the backgrounds.

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,380
It's like it has Tofik retransmission,

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,410
Ari submission.

88
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,280
If you try toe,

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,810
refresh the action,

90
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,400
Peter.

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,740
So when I continue notice,

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,710
know that Okay,

93
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,830
in the midst off the noise,

94
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,050
you see the word mirror,

95
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:25,170
and that's because the Post post super variable is actually seeing a value called first

96
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,420
name.

97
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,730
It's It works in the same way as against if you understand what the get works literally

98
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,150
just changing the method from get to post on where you would have said get you see Post.

99
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,790
That's the major difference.

100
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,860
But then I want toast.

101
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,530
I appreciate the fact that the behavior is also different because no,

102
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,040
we don't have that query string.

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,020
We don't have that question mark with all of the values like we saw with the gets.

104
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,720
All right,

105
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,160
so one where we post data,

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,560
it happens in the background.

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
So the sensitive data are potentially sensitive.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,090
Data is not being passed in the URL as it was with the get.

109
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,150
However,

110
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,650
as much as it is obscured from the user's eyes,

111
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,250
we the developers know exactly what is happening because we know we're the ones pulling the

112
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,720
strings.

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,430
So I'm just going to go ahead and change all of these,

114
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,270
get references into post,

115
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,010
and then I'm going to refresh the page,

116
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,880
which is going to ask me if I want to.

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,100
You know,

118
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,140
it's going to say the page I'm looking for had some information.

119
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,320
Do I want to resubmit?

120
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,700
Right.

121
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,940
So that's what Crume is asking.

122
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,390
Understands?

123
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,890
It could continue on do that.

124
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,520
Then we snap right back to normal.

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,160
So all of the data that I just passed in the form is no.

126
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,450
There it is there no more errors,

127
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,500
but notice one.

128
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,720
No data is being passed in the URL.

129
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,460
However,

130
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,940
we are able to access it in the back in nonetheless,

131
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,030
someone to start from scratch.

132
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,110
I'm going to just go back to the form and then went to submit a brand new record.

133
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,320
So I'm going to make up a new person.

134
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,220
Agnes Walters Onda.

135
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,620
On a dead end of this exercise,

136
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,060
we're going to fix this date picker,

137
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,090
and then this person is a software developer.

138
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,820
Andi.

139
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,750
She's a Walter's at gmail dot com.

140
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,410
All right,

141
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,880
that's not the proper evening address on the number is one through night.

142
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,270
All right,

143
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,120
I know when we submits notes,

144
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,020
nothing in the world,

145
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,030
the early screen cleaners.

146
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,590
Also,

147
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,320
however,

148
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,650
all of her data is there for display.

149
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,880
So once again,

150
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,110
that is because we're no using the post method.

151
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,380
No,

152
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,110
I did see.

153
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,230
Just know that we're going to fix the date picker and let's do that together.

154
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,490
No.

155
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,210
So I'm going to go to the DJIA query You.

156
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:55,240
I references for the Deep eaker on going to see what options are available.

157
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,630
So I go to the website.

158
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,190
I find it picker on.

159
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:05,050
Then I'm going to see over here if they have any adjustments.

160
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:12,850
Are customer custom ways to display the date picker that is more conducive to my user base

161
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:12,850
?

162
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,510
All right.

163
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,840
And I found the one it's display month on dyear menus So you click on the example and you

164
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,170
see that it allows you to select the month,

165
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,620
select the year and then select the date on.

166
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,630
That's much better than the one we had previously,

167
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,650
which is the default on where if I was born in 1950 I would have to click.

168
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,490
That's not practical,

169
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:36,710
right?

170
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,590
So no want to modify it.

171
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,850
So I'm going to look at the example cord to see what it is that makes that one difference.

172
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,630
And then the major difference that I'm spotting here is in the function,

173
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,810
So we know we call date picker.

174
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,550
But what we did was call date picker and open and close varies.

175
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,380
What they're doing is passing in some values here.

176
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,560
So I'm just entity those values because that's all I really need,

177
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,890
cause I have the rest of the court.

178
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,390
So they want to copy all of this and replace what seniors are.

179
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,460
You just copy the relevant parts and replace.

180
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,140
I'm just stopping in the relevant part on.

181
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,580
Then I'll go back to my court,

182
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,900
where my date pickers defined which the function was being called in my footer file.

183
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,130
Onda,

184
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,890
I'm going to just modify it with the new values.

185
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,870
Alright,

186
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,100
Under Spend some time fixing my indentation.

187
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,980
Alright.

188
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,250
On DSO my date picker No has some parameters being passed in.

189
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,330
Okay,

190
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:41,340
so this is why you're court needs to look like if if you have the same concern that I So

191
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:47,300
when I go back and I refresh my page and I reload my date picker No,

192
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,130
it looks like a more user friendly.

193
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,310
We alot my users to select their deeds.

194
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,610
I can know comfortably Scroll on then you see,

195
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,900
it's limiting which year So that's another adjustment that will probably want to meet so

196
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,030
back to our court.

197
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:13,550
I'm going to add one more attributes on this one Will set the year range on the attributes

198
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,150
is literally here.

199
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:22,480
Range on then Colon Sanders following the same pattern as the previous ones on.

200
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:33,310
Then the value for this could be I think it's negative One on Dredd on call on plus zero.

201
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,180
All right,

202
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,090
I'm going to see that and see what it looks like.

203
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:43,170
And when I reload on take a look at the years available to me in this drop.

204
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,100
Don't I see?

205
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,540
I have up to 2019 on as far back as 100 years.

206
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,250
So let me just explain that when I set year inch and I said minus 100 colon plus zero,

207
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,540
it means I can see upto 100 years ago,

208
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,390
but nothing beyond this year.

209
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:02,850
All right,

210
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,520
so this will be a moving target off course,

211
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,050
because next year 100 years ago would be 1920 as opposed to 1919 as it is.

212
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,410
No,

213
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,520
on also close ear would be 2020.

214
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:22,420
So that is how you would go a boat sitting the range off yours that is available for

215
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,550
selection from your calendar control.

216
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,070
Ultimately,

217
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:33,140
the goal of this tutorial video was toe help us to understand whole weekend submit data

218
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,170
from a form to the other page using the post method.

219
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,900
So we already have the get and you still have the court reference scored above on.

220
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,160
No,

221
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,460
we know how to do it with post on comparably,

222
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,900
Each one has its own purpose.

223
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,450
Each one has its advantages.

224
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,750
I just use them wisely
