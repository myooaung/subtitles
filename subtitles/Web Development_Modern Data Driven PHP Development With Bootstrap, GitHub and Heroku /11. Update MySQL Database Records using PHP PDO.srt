00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,350
Hey,

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,720
guys,

3
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,330
In this video,

4
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:07,070
we will be looking at how we can go about adding functionality toe edit our records.

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,640
The context for why you would want to edit your records are well up deity in terms off the

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,420
acronym fraud,

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,490
which would be the U for update,

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,600
would be that maybe in current information was was entered initially,

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,940
and you need to make a change.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,840
So,

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,220
for instance,

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,970
with the Mary record,

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,360
if we view the details,

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,270
we see that the date of birth is 00000 It's a bunch of zeros on that might be wrong.

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,850
All things might be incorrect.

16
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,690
Maybe her name was built in currently,

17
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,820
or the email address.

18
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:36,980
What?

19
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,520
The fact is,

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,950
you want to be ableto update the report from this screen.

21
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,870
So in this tutorial will actually be going ahead on adding an edit button on building off

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,040
that functionality.

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,810
Now back in our view record speech,

24
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:59,820
we would have already added off column that said actions and this actions column is really

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,120
just going to be holding all off the buttons that would effect actions.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,860
So the first action that we would have worked on is the view auction,

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,890
which we have a line here by this anchor talk.

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,830
But what I'm going to do is expand this problem.

29
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm just into Indian so we can see where the problem starts and stops.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,680
So inside of this TD,

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm actually just going to add another button or another anchor tug.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,080
So just duplicated this land with control de on.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,530
Then the second anchor tag is going toe.

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,510
Have edit dot PHP instead on then what we want to do.

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,150
We want to retain the father.

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,780
We're printing all this idea as part off the link because it will be necessary on we are

37
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,920
going to change the class from BT and Primary made.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,050
My anybody would be art and someone to say warning for an orange button on then that takes

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,480
that is printed should see it.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,420
But if I go back to my page and refresh,

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,390
then I should see my new button here,

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,780
which says that it on the link should look very similar to the viewing where we're seeing.

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,050
And it's not Ph.

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,310
B.

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,460
And in the query string,

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,940
I d equals two.

47
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,630
Next,

48
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,420
we need to do the edit screen.

49
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,640
So back in visual studio code,

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,110
Understand?

51
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,440
To create a new file on this one is going to be called reddit dot PHP.

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,100
Now,

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,290
usually the edit screen looks just like the create screen,

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,110
and we can policy here for a little context.

55
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,470
Our registration form has all of the fields that need to be filled votes.

56
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,350
I'm just going to go back to a registration form which,

57
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,730
remember,

58
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,550
is our home and we see first name,

59
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,500
last name and all of the values that need to be filled out on.

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,790
Then we submit.

61
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,810
Essentially,

62
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,580
these are all off the values that we also need to be able to update it just in case.

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,630
So really and truly,

64
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:55,010
our edit page is going to look just like our registration page.

65
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,790
Maybe Beiring the title.

66
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,320
So having created the edit page,

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,150
I'm actually just going to use my code real quickly,

68
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,160
and I'm going to go to my index page,

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,150
which is very destruction form.

70
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,330
I went to copy all off this on then,

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,820
with the pieced it in the Edit start PHP page.

72
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,940
We need a few changes.

73
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,430
Of course,

74
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,180
I'm going to change this one toe edit record for that's name off this speed,

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,580
that's a title on.

76
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,920
I'm also going to change that each one tug,

77
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,910
tow,

78
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,510
edit record.

79
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,060
So if I navigates toe reddit dot PHP and I can just go to the girl and type in PHP,

80
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,550
then I will see that it looks identical.

81
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,890
But the Texans any record the title is different,

82
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:48,360
and we can change that text in the submit button to see if something like Submit changes or

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,630
save changes on maybe use a different button color on now.

84
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,380
Use success to get a green button.

85
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,710
All right,

86
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,140
so that's what are edited Page looks like.

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,200
Oh,

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,250
are edit page looks like,

89
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,820
So I'll go back to my list on the expectation once again is that once I click this edit

90
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,070
button,

91
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,940
it will navigate over on.

92
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,740
We see that is already party in the chorus to know what we need to do is actually execute a

93
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,510
quarry that gets the record with the I d.

94
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,090
Being passed in on.

95
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,850
Actually,

96
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,610
Prince,

97
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,820
these values here for us to see now back in or cold,

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,730
we need to get busy with some PHP.

99
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,570
Firstly,

100
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,480
we're getting results on this results,

101
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,740
variably storing the old put off this function.

102
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm just going to remove this coming from the speech.

103
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,680
All right,

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,600
so we're getting the old put off our crowed get specialties and remember that we need this

105
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,190
function and the results to populate over drop down list for all the specialties that are

106
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,500
in the specialty table.

107
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,360
However,

108
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:58,690
what we also need is the add some function call that is going to call the function that is

109
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,210
going to return the one rule that we're looking for.

110
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,980
So if the I devalue off to is passed in to this page,

111
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,490
then we need to bring about the record with i d volatile on actually prints the values toe

112
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,390
first name,

113
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,000
last name,

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,500
etcetera,

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,080
text boxes so that they actually appear inside off our form for editing.

116
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,660
So we already have a function that we would have defined instead of for crowed file on.

117
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,140
We call it,

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,650
get attendee details,

119
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,680
so we call to get attendee details on what we're really doing is just getting the I d.

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,700
On getting back.

121
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,650
Whatever details there were about that attending this function can actually see the Syrian

122
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,410
purpose.

123
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,790
So the same function that got us the details can actually serve the same purpose for 18

124
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,680
because we really need are the data points from this query.

125
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,990
So back in or edit page I'm just going to create another variable.

126
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,670
And I'm going to call this one attendee.

127
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,280
So that's attendee.

128
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,850
Meaning this is the data for the attendee on.

129
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,460
We're going to call our objects crowd on.

130
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:13,280
We're calling the function Get attendee details on then Well,

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,660
I skipped a step So before we can you do that?

132
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,240
Because remember,

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,900
we need to actually pass in this parameter apartments are there.

134
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,660
So what we need to do firstly is check if they were flipping over during the bad first

135
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,800
sourcing If is not,

136
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,500
he's set gets on We're looking for the parameter i d.

137
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,700
So once again this is seeing if they get super global Variable does does not have a

138
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,950
subscript i d.

139
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,900
So that's what this is in.

140
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,110
Does that exist?

141
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,230
If not,

142
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:55,020
then I want to print some error message seeing arrow So I get back to this end Make it

143
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,170
fancy later on aren't else What do you want to do?

144
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:07,210
Is go ahead and gets the attendee data All right,

145
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,930
so firstly we always use a variable first,

146
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:17,310
so I d is equal to And then we're getting that value from the get super global called idea

147
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,590
with the subscript idea.

148
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,150
So we get that value,

149
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,250
we store it in this and then we're passing that as the parameter.

150
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,920
So once again,

151
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,440
we get the value from the get parameter.

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,960
We start in this variable,

153
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,680
and then we passes variable into our function.

154
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,390
Now,

155
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:44,110
what we also want to ensure is that we only see the form if if we actually got an idea in

156
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,760
the parameter.

157
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,210
So I have the if statement to see echo on arrow.

158
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,770
If the perimeter doesn't exist else,

159
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,360
we want to actually start a process on then printed forms.

160
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,190
I'm just going to move this closing breeze from this speech B block on,

161
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,850
then create another Ph B block at the end off the form to close that statement.

162
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:13,470
So that means all of what happens in between If the else statement on this closing briefs,

163
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,940
it will only ever happen if the gets parameter,

164
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,050
the I d parameter actually exists in or forestry.

165
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,360
So we closed the brace.

166
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,530
Close our PH B block on,

167
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,640
understand the fix my indentation,

168
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,610
Andi,

169
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,780
so we can proceed.

170
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,770
So let's recap.

171
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,500
Once again,

172
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,490
we have our I devalue coming in from our parameter and then were running the choir to get

173
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,520
all the choir details on.

174
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,120
Then we want to store that result inside off a variable called attended.

175
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,100
So what we want to do to actually get these values printing out inside off the creditable

176
00:08:52,100 --> 00:09:00,650
reasons of four form would be to echo inside off the value attributes.

177
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,350
So inside off inputs for first name,

178
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:10,470
I'm going to put value is equal to on.

179
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,680
Then inside off this,

180
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,630
I'm going to create a PHP block open and close on.

181
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,270
This speech we blocked will have a core overact,

182
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,330
Indy variable.

183
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,680
And remember that this variability is acting more like an area.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,480
So we need to specify which part of this area it is that we intend to print on since we're

185
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,710
in the first name textbooks.

186
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,320
Then we intend to print the value coming back for first name.

187
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,150
And then once we do that,

188
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,880
we see if we just refresh our page,

189
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,240
we see that Mary will appear because it was Mary with I d to if I put nine and refresh,

190
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,510
then that Clarence again.

191
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,840
And then we see the new value for record night so we can just go ahead and do that for each

192
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,020
off the text boxes at the very least,

193
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,240
second of Skopje,

194
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,910
the Value section.

195
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,600
And then I'm going to piece that inside off last name.

196
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,650
And then instead of her friends in first name,

197
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,230
I'm winter reference last name so relative to whatever the textbooks was far.

198
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,980
Do you want a reference that corresponding value?

199
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,760
All right,

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,920
So I proceeded to do that for all off the text boxes on Defy Refresh.

201
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,650
Then this is what it should look like.

202
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,750
You should see the corresponding vice if you get any era.

203
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,550
Just make sure you check your spelling on the series in the CART column names.

204
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,140
And if you see a Miss much ensure that your friends in the car it's column inside of the

205
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,750
cart.

206
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,030
Creditable reason.

207
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,540
No,

208
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:41,130
What I didn't do was bind the era off expertise from the drop down list to the one that's

209
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,440
coming back from,

210
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,180
or Query.

211
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,850
So do recall that our quarry and I just jump over to Ph.

212
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,690
FEMA admin.

213
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,970
If I around that quarry I will be seeing specialty I d three.

214
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,790
So let me enemy edit this.

215
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,190
We're looking at record nine here,

216
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,110
so I'm just going to see where it's equal to.

217
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,740
Nine.

218
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,870
There will go quickly on then.

219
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,140
This one is bringing back.

220
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,360
Well,

221
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,250
it's database.

222
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,260
I want to find an attendee who wasn't a database at MIT and that would be attending number

223
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,000
six.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,640
All right,

225
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,940
so let me just reload this page with I devalue being six.

226
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,690
So you know,

227
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,090
what is that?

228
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,870
The database admin did not change everything else she in just relative to the new record

229
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,130
except the drop down list when the drop down list,

230
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,760
in fact should change,

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,980
since the specialty ideas really six and Web administrators should be what is selected in

232
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,300
the drop down list.

233
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,680
So we have to make sure that the selected value for the drop down list looks like it's it's

234
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,950
clearly representing the cart one.

235
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,760
So we're going to have to get a bit creative with our select section on.

236
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,410
What we're going to do is for each option we're going to have to do on each statement

237
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:01,390
subject if they specialty I d being printed by this wild group is equal toe the specialty.

238
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,470
I d being returned inside of this attendee.

239
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,230
Hurry!

240
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,780
So to get this process started,

241
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,750
I'm just going to bring some lions here,

242
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:14,120
someone to echo in the next line and then put the option below that so that we can see

243
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,800
exactly what is happening.

244
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,990
Clearly so inside of this stop option tug.

245
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,310
Where?

246
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,590
Open adoption target.

247
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,270
I'm printing that.

248
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,540
The value should be specialty.

249
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,710
I d I'm going toe after that quotation marks,

250
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,370
start another PHP block and then inside the speech B block,

251
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,090
I'm going to have an if statement.

252
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,530
So this is just highlighting the dynamic nature off beach.

253
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,140
Your whole dynamic your Web applications can be when you can insert Ph.

254
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,890
B at will for whatever purpose.

255
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,690
So in this case,

256
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:55,130
we're going to see if on our statement is going toe ask The question is our specialty I d

257
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:04,070
some person to copy this if this value that is being returned from this very subscript on

258
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,350
this iteration off the while loop,

259
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,660
if it is at any point equal to and I'm just going to reuse that.

260
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,850
But I'm checking for attendee this time.

261
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,340
So if at any point,

262
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:22,470
The value that is being returned for this particular iteration off the while loop on it is

263
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,830
being stored in our specialty,

264
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:31,770
I d if at any point it is the same value that is being brought back by this attendee record

265
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,170
and if that is the case,

266
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,470
then we want to echo.

267
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,780
And we're just echo the text selected because in regular HTML,

268
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,910
if we wanted on option to be selected would have just literally typed the word selected

269
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,680
right here inside that option.

270
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,510
So that option would be the selected option.

271
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,850
So what we're doing is seeing that if this condition is met So this highlighted your

272
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,390
statement.

273
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,970
If this condition is met,

274
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,700
then we want to just echo the word selected on were still inside off the option tout.

275
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,180
So it would be echoed in a fashion light.

276
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,360
This So having written that chord,

277
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,320
I'm no one to go back to the issue of pitch on when we refresh for idee equal six.

278
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,550
We see that know the selected value is Web administrator.

279
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:29,350
So if I go back to view attendees on Die click edit on Mary its database at me if I go

280
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,530
again Andi believe it waas the last one or the second to last one.

281
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,180
Right now we click edit,

282
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,620
then we see Web administrator being brought back.

283
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,280
So that means our if statement is actually looking to see what specialty I d came back with

284
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,350
this person's record on.

285
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,470
Then it is seeing if it is the same value that is being printed because it's printing four

286
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,450
values right now.

287
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,690
If the idea that is brought about much is which of ideas being printed just made that one

288
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,530
the selected one.

289
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,110
So it appears here.

290
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,610
Now that's half off the battle done.

291
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,660
If you want this fire,

292
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,830
that's excellent.

293
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,630
Now the objective off this would be to make sure that when we change the beats like,

294
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,170
for instance,

295
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,250
we will have the date here being 0000 where they establish that that's not really what it

296
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,840
should look like.

297
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,470
So maybe this person should be born in 1973 on October 2nd.

298
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,530
Part on.

299
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,070
Obviously,

300
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,400
the first name doesn't mean what,

301
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:35,620
since ah changes the Archibald on this last name would be Thomas On the email address would

302
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,120
be a Thomas at gmail dot coms off course.

303
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,390
All of this is fictional,

304
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,970
but I want to show you what the update is really four.

305
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,900
So at the end,

306
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,050
off making all these changes on putting in a more realistic contact number,

307
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:58,570
I expect that when I click save changes that when the next speech is going to show me that

308
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,150
all of the changes that I just need were meat and registered inside my detail bees.

309
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,970
So,

310
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,890
in evaluating our next steps,

311
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:13,960
we need to remember that what we're doing is using a form on the form uses a method on also

312
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,610
some action.

313
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,940
So success,

314
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,340
not PHP is the action,

315
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,350
meaning once we click submit,

316
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,600
it will try to never get the success that BHP No,

317
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,950
we already established that success,

318
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,500
not Ph.

319
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,050
B is the auction page for our registration,

320
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,730
meaning after they fill the form the first time,

321
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,390
Then they should go to the space.

322
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,240
So what we want is a different action page for our edits.

323
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,530
Some just want to create a new file,

324
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,540
and I'm going to call it Edit Post,

325
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,480
not PHP.

326
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,720
On the purpose off edit Post that Ph.

327
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,220
B is just to receive the data from our post actions.

328
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:59,420
So that means on the edit page on when to set the action to be edit Post Doc.

329
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,820
Ph.

330
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,930
B on what happens is that we're going to send over all of the data that was entered on this

331
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:14,100
form imposed on edit courses going toe except this data on Then run the database operation

332
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,610
toe,

333
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,760
insert the records or obey the records in the database after it does them that operation.

334
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,930
We don't need it to display anything.

335
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,250
So we're just going to redirect toe.

336
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,920
Our index was not in expiate our viewer record speech.

337
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,830
So I did some comments so that we have a guide as to what is being done at each point.

338
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,270
No,

339
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,760
firstly,

340
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,360
getting the values from the post operation.

341
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm actually just interview school that their authority.

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,150
So I'm just going to jump over to the success that PHP peach on then really just wins a

343
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,940
copy All off this cord listed here.

344
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,410
So the thing is,

345
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,760
we're using the same form on,

346
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,500
but we didn't change any off the names off the elements on this forms all of the names,

347
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,720
the email on the car,

348
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,720
on the phone for reds.

349
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,480
That's the name right all of those things remain the same.

350
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,460
So really and truly the same Holstein cool that we used for success on the registry.

351
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:21,320
Some pH we can use that same post scored for the action on the edit post off course.

352
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,980
I still want you to appreciate the fact that if you make any changes to the forms may be

353
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,000
left out one of the fields or your added feels or whatever it is you did,

354
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,240
you need to be ableto understand and appreciate the differences on the nuances between the

355
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,530
two,

356
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,650
but for nowhere,

357
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,660
reusing most of the cord so we don't have to make many adjustments.

358
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,160
Another very,

359
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,440
very,

360
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,820
very,

361
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,230
very important thing we always should have on our edit page is the i D.

362
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,360
So the actual I devalue that we're getting here,

363
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,760
we need it because we need to actually send it over in the post action.

364
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,490
Because when we're doing that update query,

365
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,000
we need to update where I d is equal to whatever record it is that we were anything.

366
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,340
So the easiest way to get that I d.

367
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,650
And you don't necessarily want to display this.

368
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,010
I devalue to your users because on the form putting I random six.

369
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,840
This is I devalue six.

370
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,820
So you want to put a random value six somewhere here.

371
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,010
They really don't need to know the I d off this person.

372
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,350
But what you can do is use a hidden field.

373
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,700
And that's a very common practice of user hidden.

374
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,280
Sorry.

375
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,610
We use our form elements off type equals shouldn't on.

376
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,070
Then we can set the value just the same way we set the value for every other ones.

377
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,880
I'm just inte Bara.

378
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:49,700
This scored from the first name block set the value and echoing attendee I d instead.

379
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,810
All right,

380
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:55,770
so we have the value off or hidden inputs.

381
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,220
Sorry,

382
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,500
I don't know why attempt for him input.

383
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,000
Apologies for that.

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,380
So we have input type is hidden on.

385
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,930
We have the value being attend the I d on.

386
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,080
We can disclose that so that when we post our data,

387
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,040
we actually are maintaining the value going across the pages.

388
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,260
So a lot of the times people leave Oh,

389
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,300
the or neglect the father.

390
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,620
You need the i d.

391
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,010
In the speech and then went to get to the posting.

392
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,740
It's not working and they don't know why.

393
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,170
So I'm just going toe either.

394
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,880
So that's one of those minor adjustments that I'm going to make than that's the difference

395
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:29,880
.

396
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,890
One of the differences between the create on the edits because upon creation there's no I d

397
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,480
but orbit prior to creation or other.

398
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,240
There's no I d.

399
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,290
But upon anything and I d would have existed already.

400
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,310
Some just want opposed this.

401
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,770
Oh,

402
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,490
when setting up the elements,

403
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,370
we need a name,

404
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:57,510
so name is equal to number soon to call it i d on dso when I'm posting ideas equal to post

405
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,950
super super variable post subscript Heidi.

406
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,120
So I modified my statement.

407
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,140
All of this needs stopping inside the statement If if if the post exists,

408
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,070
then we want to extract the values,

409
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,770
call the crowd and redirect else.

410
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:19,280
We will print that arrow court so I'll get back to printing the era Court on.

411
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,910
On that note,

412
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,010
I hope you've realized I'm neglecting to print early each time because they neglected to

413
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,770
printed here and I'm neglecting to printed here.

414
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,380
The fact is,

415
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,850
we can probably make an include speech,

416
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,450
right?

417
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,240
That just has,

418
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,460
you know,

419
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,720
a standard arrow message that we know,

420
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,050
print across the speeches,

421
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,580
so we,

422
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,840
instead of printing echo each one every time we have an includes or with the sprint echo

423
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,980
each one and then we just included right here in the else statement.

424
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,660
So at the end of this activity,

425
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,520
I'll actually do that on opiates.

426
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,900
All the side are the pages in our website with that coat.

427
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,760
Now we need to call our crowd phone,

428
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,040
son,

429
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,400
but there is no code phone son for anything.

430
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
So,

431
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,830
like all the times you have to go over the crowd on,

432
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,850
then I'm going to create a new function.

433
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,080
So those are to get someone to create a function right on unease,

434
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,420
Insert attendee,

435
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,890
and I'm going to call us on public function it it attendee on.

436
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,850
Then we're taking a parameter i d.

437
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,530
And then inside this function,

438
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:28,500
what we really want to do is just right on update SQL statement with the placeholders on

439
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,460
the value.

440
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,670
So I did say only I d.

441
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,150
But I d is not the one a perimeter.

442
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,180
We actually need all of those values coming over from the form which would be F name l

443
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,580
Neiman,

444
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,320
all the other ones.

445
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,330
So I'm just going to copy these parameters.

446
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,050
Since they're the same parameters,

447
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,850
the same set of values on I'm going to include them in the perimeter,

448
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,950
listing with ideas.

449
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,520
So have I.

450
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:57,830
D and all the other fields that were expecting inside off our table on then because at the

451
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,340
end of the day,

452
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,090
we really don't know which one is going to be edited.

453
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,060
I don't know which field the person is going to change in the edit field,

454
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,310
but once I click save changes,

455
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,490
I need to be prepared to make sure that any changes made across anyone off these will be

456
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,700
captured Onda stored.

457
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,210
So I'm just interested An updated statement.

458
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:25,380
So we always start off with an SQL variable and then we have the update statement and then

459
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,280
I will be realized.

460
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,250
I know also that SQL is not really case sensitive.

461
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,950
So sometimes I'm writing in uppercase.

462
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,430
Sometimes in lower case on off course.

463
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,760
Once you're in adults,

464
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,970
you can always go over till your PHP My admin,

465
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,900
Onda,

466
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,980
Look at what it would look like as an upbeat statements.

467
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,270
They opened this up.

468
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,680
You goto attendee can go over two sq well on then you can click on the orbit on,

469
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,550
then the update statement.

470
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,050
Can they?

471
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,710
Can I give you that template?

472
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,180
Well,

473
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,630
you can copy this on Pace it inside off the SQL variable off course,

474
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,260
replacing each value sex son with the placeholders.

475
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,800
And so I'm actually going to just do that.

476
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:12,000
So I copied that on inside of the SQL statement on pasting it earned on.

477
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,230
Then each place I have that value in square brackets.

478
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,980
I have the place older.

479
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
So the thing is,

480
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,230
though,

481
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,990
this can be misleading because we're not updating.

482
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,110
We're not setting a new value for idee.

483
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,650
So according to this update statement,

484
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,630
it's asking to set attendee I d to be equal to some value.

485
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,640
We don't need that because we're not setting that in the value i d.

486
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,710
What we need I d for is the wear clothes or we say,

487
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,580
where one We need to say we're colon ideas.

488
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm using a placeholder there,

489
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,590
but the update statements is basically the word update than the table to be updated on.

490
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,800
Then we say set.

491
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
I know these are not single courts,

492
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:00,220
so I would have used them in a previous but video where I copied it from from PHP my admin

493
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,220
.

494
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,580
And then you would have seen them.

495
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,850
Those are not single courts.

496
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,570
Those are what you call apostrophes.

497
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,250
All right,

498
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:15,140
So the foster is basically are a little secret talking inside off my sq als SQL syntax.

499
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,950
But they don't conflict with double courts are single courts arts.

500
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,540
I just want to everybody to be clear on that.

501
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,270
So we up the it the table,

502
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,610
and we set column is equal toe value on value.

503
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:37,120
Here would be cool on f name Andi for as many columns as you're sitting values.

504
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,870
You have them distance.

505
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,190
So we're doing it for first name.

506
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:45,260
We're also doing for last name on each one is separated by a comma the date off birth.

507
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,300
I'm going to set this place order to be deal be on email address sitting the placeholder to

508
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,250
be email and I do the others so quickly.

509
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:03,910
Once again albeit table set column equals placeholder Kama Kama column equals placeholder

510
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,840
fires militants as you have columns and values are place holders to be set on.

511
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,050
Then we end it all with a where clause were something So we want to see where a 10 d

512
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:21,020
underscore idea is equal toe the placeholder I d.

513
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,080
So this is no going toe.

514
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,930
Find this record with that idea water I devalue.

515
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,320
It is our passing in,

516
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,770
which is the I devalue that would have been hidden in our form on post it over on,

517
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:42,560
then passed into our phone shown on Then it's going to find that record on then update all

518
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,850
of these columns with the values that would have been coming across in our parameters.

519
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,090
So now that we have that SQL statement written,

520
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,520
we need to do the binding.

521
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
Some just go into this.

522
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,400
Copy this because it's pretty much a CNN cord.

523
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,310
All right,

524
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,990
on,

525
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,610
I'm just into pieces here and then,

526
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,950
just like we did before,

527
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,760
over creates our insert attend.

528
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,200
You did a track that so I'm actually just going to do a try catch because it's good.

529
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,650
Practise the trans action on,

530
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,860
then catch the exception in case there was an error.

531
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,860
So I'm just going to rattle that try catch block on,

532
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,350
went to try to do all of this,

533
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,700
and if it was successful,

534
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,760
I returned True.

535
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
That speaks my invitation on.

536
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,910
Then I'm just going to literally Skopje all of this because pretty much were just repeating

537
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,790
on a number of things on DWI.

538
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,550
Want consistency with whole.

539
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,650
We look for errors and deal with them should they arise.

540
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:47,680
So you'll see that your edit on your inserts operations tend to look very similar in terms

541
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,990
off the fields that are being captured and the options being done.

542
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,970
The only difference is maybe the SQL statement on the father.

543
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,670
You have to account for the i D.

544
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,470
Passing between fields or between screens when editing.

545
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,410
So know that I have my crowd function defined.

546
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,860
I can go back to edit post on actually call it.

547
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,700
So I left out of step.

548
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,550
I did not make reference to my connection file.

549
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:21,200
So in every other page that we made some database call I had required my devi con I did not

550
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,290
do that here.

551
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:22,470
No,

552
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,560
I didn't need that Ah header file because,

553
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,080
well,

554
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,940
this speech is not really supposed to be displayed.

555
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,920
It's like edit and it's an intermediary.

556
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,320
So it just does its operation and then read ARATS so you won't really see the edit.

557
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,850
Poor spit.

558
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,500
So that's why I'm not making this much of an effort to actually have the aesthetics there.

559
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,520
So I'm going to make reference to my d.

560
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:45,690
B.

561
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,150
Khan because obviously I'm going to be doing some database operation.

562
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,920
And I remember that once this file is in view off the page,

563
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,600
we can just call on our crude objects.

564
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,990
I'll see results equals on.

565
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,260
I went to call on micro object on inside crowed.

566
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,410
I'm going to call my function,

567
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:14,000
which is edit attendees and understand the copy all of this Andi piece here.

568
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,480
So because I'm using the seam variable names as a permitted you see,

569
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,430
it's easier at the Skopje and paste,

570
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,790
so you don't have to.

571
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:28,180
But I'm just showing that made this this probably five minute operation off,

572
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,740
typing out all of this into 30 seconds.

573
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,080
All right,

574
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,570
so once we do all of that,

575
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:40,450
we can then see if on going toe check if result,

576
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,420
remember resulted store in the old put off.

577
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,930
This function on dysfunction is returning to a force I'm seeing if results meaning if this

578
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,420
is true,

579
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,810
so this could be rewritten as if true.

580
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,510
All right.

581
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:00,010
But I'm just in to see if results then we want to redirects to the index speech or redirect

582
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,570
code looks something like this where we say Header on,

583
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,220
then hitters,

584
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:10,400
a function that takes a link So the link is index dot PHP.

585
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,850
So if this was successful and we want to redirect to the list else,

586
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,160
we can probably print on Eros,

587
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,510
so echo error on,

588
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:28,760
we will revisit setting up these generic error per insult printouts on standardizing them.

589
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,460
All right,

590
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,110
so once this is in place,

591
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,880
the expectation,

592
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,550
once again is that once you click,

593
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,040
submit on this speech are,

594
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,490
well,

595
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,000
our button sensitive changes.

596
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,290
But it's still a summit,

597
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,500
but it's in the same.

598
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,900
Is going toe posed over all of the data that may or may not have been modified but had been

599
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,160
present as values inside off each of these controls on.

600
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,710
Then it's going to hit this page as the action where we connect or databases get all of the

601
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,800
values and then go ahead.

602
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,340
Andi,

603
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,070
call our operation,

604
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,970
which is going to run the opiates statement in our database on if that was successful than

605
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,580
we just redirect to the home screen.

606
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,140
Otherwise,

607
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,050
we print some form off arrow message So let's try that.

608
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,060
So I'm going to go back to the form and I'm going to re fresh and I'm going to me.

609
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,220
These changes some putting Archibald Thomas on the other details,

610
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,000
changing his date of birth toe 1965.

611
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Whatever it is.

612
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,800
So I'm just making some changes to make sure that I can see them reflected after I click

613
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
save changes.

614
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,350
All right,

615
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:44,420
so because they're using email as the data type here or the input type,

616
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,190
it's telling me that my email address is wrong.

617
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,870
So I had a common set of a full stop.

618
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,740
Let's try that again.

619
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,310
Are we're getting a PDO error here and it's seeing inviolate perimeter number.

620
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,530
Oh,

621
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,320
I know why I've boned everything but the ideas.

622
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,470
So because I copied the buying programs from the top part,

623
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,730
I didn't remember that I have this additional parameters that needs to be boned.

624
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:11,040
So I'm just going to duplicate that line and change this the I d and bind it to the idea

625
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,420
coming in on.

626
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,410
Then I'm going to just try that again.

627
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,710
So if I f i V will say that the form re submission will take place meaning it sent up to

628
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,670
reports the data,

629
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,150
and then we continue.

630
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,660
I understand to go back.

631
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,470
Andi,

632
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,880
I'm going to look at my cord.

633
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,830
Ah,

634
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,140
the location.

635
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,500
So sorry that we should have said location,

636
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,150
comma,

637
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,960
colon index dot PHP my butt.

638
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,570
So the header tix the text with the word location Colon on,

639
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,870
then the page.

640
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,580
All right,

641
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,490
So everything was successfully able to dinner you,

642
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:43,770
Derek.

643
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,630
So let's try that again.

644
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,400
Someone to resubmit this form on git redirected to the index speech.

645
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,900
So I had forgotten that the index pages actually the registration,

646
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,110
please.

647
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,500
That's not what we want.

648
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:04,090
We want to goto view records that PHP and we see here that the required was indeed edited

649
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,750
so we can be confident in the fact that our edits court works.

650
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,930
But I'm just going to change that.

651
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,160
Read,

652
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,700
Eric,

653
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,440
because I wanted to go to view records dot PHP.

654
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,190
All right,

655
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,970
so once of me that change the fact teams mirror pop ing's,

656
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,570
I'm going to edit Mary Poppins.

657
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,900
And she is really a software developer,

658
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,610
not a db Admin on guy.

659
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,720
Say that change.

660
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,130
Then when it comes back,

661
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:34,860
it redirects toe our view records and I see Mary Poppins with her new specialty.

662
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,850
So that is so.

663
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,650
You go about adding any functionality to your PHP application.
