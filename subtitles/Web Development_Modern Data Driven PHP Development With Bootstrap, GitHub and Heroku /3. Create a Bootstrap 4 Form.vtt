00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Hey,

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.130
guys,

3
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.700
In this video,

4
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.220
we will start the saying or first form using PHP and bootstrap on the Schimmel and all of

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.920
these wonderful things that come together toe allow us to collect data from users.

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.950
Andi leading towards storing it's for later use.

7
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.790
So we already started designing.

8
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.120
Our site we created are full of structure putting our fathers and our references.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.620
And we kind of segmented or cord toe have that kind of Leo's who can feel so know what

10
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.570
we're going to do is start modifying over index speech to be,

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.750
ah,

12
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.850
form that collects data and we look at using the get submission for or form.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm just going to start modifying the contents off the page on I'm going to instead of

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.100
printing Hello world.

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.790
I'm going to see registration for a conference.

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:04.720
So we're creating on I t conference or districts on form where we want all of the would be

17
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.530
attendees to start putting in their information and declaring all you know,

18
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.920
I'm a DBS so this we get an idea off.

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.200
Who is that going to attend or conference on?

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.720
We can store it up for analytics later on,

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.670
so I have this.

22
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.260
Each one tug at the first thing on the page,

23
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.550
and it's always good to have on each one tug not only for readability by the user to know

24
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.160
where they are,

25
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.040
but also for search engines and love.

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.810
Each one times on pages on you get higher around kings for these kind of things.

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.520
I also want this each want out to be in the center off my pit.

28
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.150
So if I take a look at what happens here,

29
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.660
I just refresh.

30
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.890
No,

31
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.880
I have it seeing registration for I t conference.

32
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.080
So instead of just seeing that I'm going to or instead of having it to the left,

33
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.660
I'm goingto center align.

34
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.080
It's a bootstrap as a class on Do you can always go and look at the documentation for

35
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.110
yourself I've been using for us.

36
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.300
It has kind of become a part of me,

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.140
but always feel free to go back to the bootstrap website.

38
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.220
Look at the documentation.

39
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.990
If it is that you're not sure hotel complex something.

40
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.140
So I'm going toe center,

41
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.570
line it,

42
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.430
and while I'm here,

43
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.460
I just try and find that reference.

44
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.550
In the documentation our city will go under utilities and look for text.

45
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.070
Then the first thing that you see sticks alignments.

46
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.480
If it is that you want to move your text their own with it to the left,

47
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.080
to the center,

48
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.870
to the right,

49
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.460
or you know that different ones.

50
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.750
Then they give the court example,

51
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.250
so you can use a class text left to push it to the left tech center to push it to the

52
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.920
center,

53
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.380
etcetera,

54
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.780
etcetera.

55
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.960
So it's really simple.

56
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.950
Want to catch on?

57
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.150
You remember them quickly,

58
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.850
so I want to send our lines,

59
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790
understand to see a text center.

60
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.640
Another thing that I want to point out is that even though the example may have been with a

61
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.260
pita,

62
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.570
it applies to anything that is text.

63
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.140
So it's a pita example.

64
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.520
Yes,

65
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.230
on were using it on an H.

66
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.800
One time you can be used on almost any tug that has to do with sticks.

67
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.320
The fact is,

68
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.560
it will take any content off that on the center,

69
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.020
align it,

70
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.450
are aligned it accordingly.

71
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.170
All right,

72
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.180
so I don't have to worry about the example versus the type of tug you're using and what did

73
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.300
it.

74
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.730
I just highlighted this and you shift upto push everything back to the left column.

75
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.120
I'm just a sick stickler for for indentation.

76
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.100
So next we're going to do ah form.

77
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.840
So to do a form,

78
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.050
we have Italian,

79
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.730
a general called form Onda.

80
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.140
Understand toe open and close this quickly as forms can have quite a few things,

81
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.610
and you don't want to forget to close your tacos.

82
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.710
That can lead to some annoying and irritating debugging issues.

83
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.450
No,

84
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.080
to design my form using bootstrap classes understand too quickly.

85
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.710
Jump over to the documentation on find.

86
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.320
I think that would be in components.

87
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.870
Find references for forms.

88
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.480
There we go.

89
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.820
So they give us some sample forms.

90
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.290
They say,

91
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.710
You know,

92
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.980
if you use my classes,

93
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.570
this is what they're foreign can look like with relative ease aren't and they tell you the

94
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.200
different controls that you have a Nikon style on the size ings.

95
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.870
They have quite a few options.

96
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.100
If you go through on,

97
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.730
you can get quite a bit off.

98
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.750
Inspiration for a formal layout are designed from their examples.

99
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.350
For today,

100
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.780
however,

101
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.820
we're going to keep it simple,

102
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.640
so I'm just going to go back up to the first example that was there where we have the label

103
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.640
,

104
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.800
what does he want?

105
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.490
And the specific control for it up to the submit button.

106
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.210
So I can actually just take a look at this score and see how it's done.

107
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.900
I'm actually just want a copy.

108
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.750
This scored.

109
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.110
Go back to my site and replace the form times that I just so cheerfully puttin on.

110
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.850
I'm going to replace them with all of that court on.

111
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.890
I'm just going to spend a few moments here on d get all of my indentation proper so that I

112
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.340
know where everything starts and stops.

113
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.740
All right,

114
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.000
so I have my form talk,

115
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.090
opening and closing here on.

116
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.960
Then you notice that there bunch off,

117
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.650
gives in between.

118
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.120
All right on,

119
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.260
then,

120
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.630
if you look inside off the dibs,

121
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.110
you have the label,

122
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.300
which is the word that is printed.

123
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.550
Seeing this is what I'm prompting for.

124
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.360
So this one was the from for the email address,

125
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.150
and then we have the input type.

126
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.000
Andi,

127
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.180
initial five.

128
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.940
You you have quite a few types available to you.

129
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.860
In this case,

130
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.060
that type is e mails that actually runs specific validations on the email.

131
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.830
Just to make sure that you're putting in an email address out of the box without any

132
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.730
additional cord.

133
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.850
Andi.

134
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.600
Some other attributes.

135
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.010
And then they give you a small where did give you a tip.

136
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.210
So if you just look at the court versus the example,

137
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.500
then you kind of see where everything is.

138
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.760
So we have email address on that was in the label section you have the the text box on.

139
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.120
Do you know that one has in ah,

140
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.820
placeholder.

141
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.170
This is enter email.

142
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.820
So that's on attributes Placeholder that uses that kind of greedo takes that disappears

143
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.140
when text actually goes in on.

144
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.080
Then under here you see that there's a little town here that says you never share on.

145
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.180
They show you the cord to get all of that.

146
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.330
So the fact is,

147
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.150
you copied it.

148
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.050
You may not need it.

149
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.050
You can remove underst reform as needs be.

150
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.980
No,

151
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.550
I just added a few comments here,

152
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:42.560
or one be coming here with the different fields that we intended toe collect from our would

153
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.250
be attendees aren't so wants to call it the first name last name the date of birth and will

154
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.550
be using a date picker will take their specialty on because and these are the specialities

155
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.850
that we're catering for.

156
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.330
Andi another's at other,

157
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.350
just in case.

158
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.140
All right,

159
00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.700
on then.

160
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.210
We want the email address under contact number,

161
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.710
and that is what or form should be designed to collect from our users.

162
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.240
All right,

163
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.150
so,

164
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.460
no,

165
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.250
we'll start butchering or start modifying.

166
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.550
I'm not,

167
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.340
say butchering.

168
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.010
We'll start customizing this code so that we can accomplish our mission.

169
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.560
No,

170
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.930
I'm good.

171
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.020
I'm giving a template.

172
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.480
Be as creative as you need to be.

173
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.720
If you want to try something else,

174
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.270
that's fine.

175
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.450
If you run into difficulty,

176
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.370
always feel free to reach out to me.

177
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.280
I know there's certain things about this school that I'm going to retain because that is

178
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.350
just how bootstrap I lows us to take advantage off its design.

179
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.790
So,

180
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.490
for instance,

181
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.060
you notice that you always have a diff class called form group on inside this Div.

182
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.390
Then you have whatever else goes in tow that form group,

183
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.860
meaning the input type on the label for it and anything else.

184
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.210
So each one of these would get its own give with class form group.

185
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.440
So I need I already have email address.

186
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.230
I'm not going toe delete the email address.

187
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:11.750
But what I'm going to do is copy this form group and then went to create another one.

188
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.680
All right.

189
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.010
And then I'm going to modify this other one.

190
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.560
So I have email address here already.

191
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.010
I'm not removing email address,

192
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.880
but email address is not the first thing on the list.

193
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.950
It's like the second to last.

194
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.300
I still have at least four other things above it.

195
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.360
So I'm going to keep on putting things above the emitters until I get there.

196
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.730
So I'm going to change the label.

197
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.890
Firstly on,

198
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.510
Do you want to change the lead before on the i d.

199
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.970
Because what happens is that in html five,

200
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.450
they give the label for an I.

201
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:42.770
D.

202
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.210
Thing.

203
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:43.710
Well,

204
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.830
really bootstrap,

205
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.070
because when he quit the label,

206
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.200
it kind off highlights the contra widow to clicking the control itself.

207
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.240
So watch as I take the word password.

208
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.750
This highlights.

209
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.690
So you want that label four on the I d.

210
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.650
Too much to get that kind off effect.

211
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.290
And you don't want to repeat the ideas.

212
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.610
You never want to repeat the ideas off your elements.

213
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.950
Gerald,

214
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.690
Your your your website.

215
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:13.350
So I'm going to change this one to something more meaningful because I'm doing first name

216
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.390
Andi.

217
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.680
I spelled first wrongly.

218
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.170
So you want to make sure you get all the spilling squarely on day?

219
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.520
So that's the idea.

220
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.760
I'm going to change the label.

221
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.600
Four attributes toe first name.

222
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.130
I'm going to change the labels.

223
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:36.110
Text from the military's toe First name Andi.

224
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.240
I'm going to change the anything here that had to do with email and basically going to

225
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.600
change.

226
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.880
Thought relative tow it being used for a first name.

227
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.630
So the input type here is email.

228
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.080
First name is not an email.

229
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:55.230
It would be more text Onda,

230
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.430
I'm going to change this Emir,

231
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.200
Help toe say first.

232
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.180
I am actually I've never I don't think I need this.

233
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.440
This attribute is not absolutely necessary.

234
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.930
So I'm just going to remove that one.

235
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.880
I don't need that one.

236
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.310
All right,

237
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.900
I want to remove this This this small text Alright,

238
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.960
I don't need that so pretty much if you just want a label on the text box.

239
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.930
This is what is going to look like.

240
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.900
You have your live with form with class formed a group and then you have your label,

241
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.940
and then you have your input,

242
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.640
and I'm going to change the placeholder text to see Inter.

243
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.120
First name on,

244
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.410
really?

245
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.090
And truly I don't need placeholder text if I have a label.

246
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.810
So once again,

247
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.420
it's up to you on your design.

248
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.200
All right?

249
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.800
I don't I don't like seeing a placeholder when I already have the label Someone to remove

250
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.350
that one.

251
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.050
So this is what it looks like.

252
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.510
If I want a label on that takes box on this is for the first name.

253
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.250
No,

254
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.470
to call it the last name would be pretty much identical to understand,

255
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:08.790
To copy and paste this on change everything out to be relative toe Last name.

256
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.550
All right,

257
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.880
so no,

258
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.170
I'm collecting for last name.

259
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.390
I changed the label text.

260
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:20.100
I changed their the four attribute value and the i d off the text box so that they work

261
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.750
together.

262
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.210
Andi know I'm collecting for last name.

263
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.840
Next.

264
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.350
We want date off birth,

265
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.790
so date off.

266
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.310
Birth undergoes Quintal.

267
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.660
Continue along the same line on the four is going to be on understand.

268
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.150
To read you will be for short.

269
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.790
The idea here is deal be did off birth.

270
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.180
The label text says,

271
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.950
Did it off birth,

272
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.550
birth within a on.

273
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.810
Then the type can be.

274
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.700
Actually,

275
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.660
it's picker because html five actually has will beat.

276
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.060
Sorry.

277
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.350
So the data type the input type date actually gives us a date picker on.

278
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.080
We're going to look into if this is the best way to do it or not,

279
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.950
but for no,

280
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.870
that can work.

281
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.510
All right.

282
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.290
Next,

283
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.350
we need another control because we have specialty,

284
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.820
which is going to be more like a drop down box,

285
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.750
allowing us to select.

286
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.790
So if I use a drop down,

287
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.820
obviously you can only select one off their above.

288
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.050
Who could use a radio button on diffuse the check box.

289
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.940
Then it would be a loss,

290
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:36.530
a select all at least one are all off the potential values.

291
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.360
So that's up to you and your conference for my conference.

292
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.720
I believe that your specialty is only once I'm going to give you a drop down box.

293
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.070
All right,

294
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:52.180
so I'm just going toe copy this once again on I'm copying and pasting the Suspiria miss off

295
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.730
retyping things that I don't have to re type.

296
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.150
Right?

297
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.350
So this one,

298
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:01.220
the labor is spare shell T Onda.

299
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.010
I'm going to see a specialty,

300
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.120
our area off expertise.

301
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.870
I can always meet my labels as worthy or not,

302
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:18.120
as I want that the text that is being printed to the user I'm going to change the I d.

303
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.590
Well,

304
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.400
I'm going to change this.

305
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.870
Who will control?

306
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.360
Because a drop down box wouldn't be involved using an input,

307
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.350
Jack someone to just go over toe bootstrap and see what they have for me in terms off drop

308
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.010
boomboxes.

309
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.350
And there they actually have it.

310
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.190
They have the foreign control section where they're showing me a drop down list,

311
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.220
and that's what it looks like.

312
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.790
Once bootstrap is applied.

313
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.460
All right,

314
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.180
on the example for it is right here.

315
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.480
We have the form groups,

316
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.110
so that's basically our constant they have the label on.

317
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.530
Then what we have is a select tug with options in between.

318
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.650
So I'm just going to copy this out because we have everything else,

319
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.320
all right.

320
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.550
We have everything else in police,

321
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:07.860
understands a copy of that select section and then spend some time fixing our indentation

322
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.490
here on then I'm going toe leave this class.

323
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.970
You notice all of them Have that class form dash control.

324
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:16.390
Right.

325
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.500
So with all the foreign dash control,

326
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.320
they wouldn't look as dynamic as they do here.

327
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.690
They don't.

328
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.480
They don't have that bootstrap look and feel,

329
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.100
and we'll look at that later.

330
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.940
So I'm going to select administered a tug I'm with to change the i d.

331
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.800
Here till a specialty.

332
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.850
Right?

333
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.860
So that's the label knows to work with it.

334
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.330
And then I'm going to put in my options.

335
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.140
And my options once again were database admission.

336
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.960
So data base add mean ah,

337
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.180
software developer on Web administrator and other.

338
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.270
So just type those in quickly.

339
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.190
All right,

340
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.670
I know that is done.

341
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.240
So we have or drop down list.

342
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.670
I know we haven't been looking at it.

343
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.260
I don't know if you have been,

344
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.790
and that's good.

345
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.190
If you have been I haven't.

346
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:13.330
So we're this building blindly and hoping that everything snaps together as we would like

347
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:13.470
it.

348
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.540
And if it doesn't really just fix it as you go along.

349
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.040
So nowhere at the email address.

350
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.270
And once again because we took that example,

351
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.130
we already have email address I'm just into sure it upward.

352
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.530
Change it up a bit because it's a bit too wordy for me.

353
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.660
So label for email on the controls ideas,

354
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.540
no one to be email so that these two Noto work together.

355
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.500
Andi,

356
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.050
I'll just leave everything else here on this would actually be a nice little disclaimer.

357
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.890
We'll never show your email with anyone else because you ready stuff for my conference.

358
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.190
I'm not.

359
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.090
Want to use your email maliciously.

360
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.490
You know,

361
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.160
you could use this little all right on.

362
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.010
Oh,

363
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.270
so this idea and this attribute go hand in hand.

364
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.770
See that?

365
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.560
So I I didn't remove it from previous times,

366
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.340
but here is why bootstrap would off kind off.

367
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.080
Put that there are taking experiments with them.

368
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.480
The next thing that we want after email is the contact number on.

369
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.860
I'm actually just going to routine the email cord on going to reuse it for four number

370
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.510
because,

371
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:20.900
well,

372
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.890
I'm going to show you Why So for eso the label for his fall,

373
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.570
the forms,

374
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.890
the controls I d is full on,

375
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.190
then the labor is going to see well,

376
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.850
contact number.

377
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.480
All right.

378
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.260
I believe that there is.

379
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.910
I'm going to use text.

380
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.290
So there were still me.

381
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.620
The text box looked like it's supposed to collect a four number,

382
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.990
but we're not there yet,

383
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.110
so I'm just going to use text on going toe.

384
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.970
Remove the placeholder on.

385
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.350
I'm going to do the same for the placeholder above.

386
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.240
Once again,

387
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.710
I don't like having both the level and the placeholder.

388
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.550
I think they should be used interchangeably.

389
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.660
That's personal,

390
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:00.980
though.

391
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.450
On I'm going to leave this help text that I'm going to say full help instead off email help

392
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:14.220
on the CME here on then I want to leave this help text and I'll say,

393
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.430
Well,

394
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:21.880
never share your number with anyone else So we have to privacy disclaimers here that we're

395
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.720
going to minty in the privacy of your phone number and your email address are no,

396
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.230
that we're finished with our form because we have everything that we require.

397
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.080
We can the screen of the rest of the court.

398
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.210
So I think part of the example that we took also had this text box for password,

399
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.150
which we don't need,

400
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.260
at least not yet on this check box for an example also,

401
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.420
so we can remove that Onda,

402
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:53.150
We have a button which is off type submit which involves a submission attempts to the to

403
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:58.130
the browser on we have class equals VT and Bt and dashed forever,

404
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.050
which gives us a nice blue button on the submit form.

405
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.850
All right,

406
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.310
so you could always customize the secret changes.

407
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.700
Start green button by saying beating that success and see register.

408
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.530
It's up to you.

409
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.040
Personalize it as you wish,

410
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.980
but for no,

411
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.170
we're going to go ahead on a preview orbit.

412
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.990
So this is where we left off on little See where we are.

413
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.580
No on Look at that.

414
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.600
That is lovely art so ever each one time nicely center line.

415
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.940
We have our first name.

416
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.140
I notice when I click just the label each control kind of lights up Once again I was the

417
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:39.190
label for and the the i d at work on then That is what our form looks like.

418
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.230
We just built a form,

419
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.420
and all we did was doing the way bootstrapped it and look at the beautiful.

420
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.180
Oh,

421
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.580
come all right now I'm just going to play around a bit and show you other things that we

422
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.620
could do Firstly,

423
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.980
if I take all the form,

424
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:59.610
control class reference that make sure you what happens then our textbooks looks like this

425
00:18:59.610 --> 00:18:59.610
,

426
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.520
which is just the standard and default.

427
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.970
So that is why we have in that form control class so that it takes on the bootstrap

428
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:13.460
attributes its understand to introduce that if I wanted my button to not be so small.

429
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.030
All right.

430
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.840
It's kind of lost all the way down there.

431
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:22.680
Then I have a class beating dash block on Bt and dust block meets the button stretch right

432
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.760
across the peach.

433
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.460
Alright,

434
00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.750
Andi,

435
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.270
I want some space between my submit on my copyright,

436
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.400
so I can probably put in a few br tags,

437
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.070
so understand,

438
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.280
to put in a boat about four or five on,

439
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.470
Then you notice that you have that space so we can go back and fix the footer later.

440
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:50.050
But just to show you that whatever content you put in the index space between the hander

441
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:57.410
the header includes underfoot includes it will render that we are on.

442
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.400
Then if we look appear in our title,

443
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.250
we see attendance dash index,

444
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:08.820
And remember that we're sitting that value in the in this top section of the site on hitter

445
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.510
is just making reference to its No.

446
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.720
One more thing I want just to look at is our DEET control.

447
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.950
So we had used for date off birth the day it ate a type.

448
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.250
All right on.

449
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:23.400
Then,

450
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.600
if you just take a quick glance at it,

451
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.710
you actually see where it looks different from the regular textbooks on If we try to change

452
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.710
these values we see that were confined or restricted to only put.

453
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.080
Indeed,

454
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.670
it's related,

455
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.690
but there's other takes.

456
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.390
Can't go in there,

457
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.560
and that's perfect.

458
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.170
The danger,

459
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:39.750
however,

460
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:45.800
is that this eight control is going to get rendered differently relative to the boroughs

461
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.040
are being used.

462
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.850
So in this situation,

463
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:54.810
our chrome browser is going to give us a nice control calendar control on.

464
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.850
We can just let the date,

465
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:56.310
however,

466
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.180
in my edge,

467
00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.680
explore when I click this,

468
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.260
I'm getting a different type of control,

469
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.010
all right?

470
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:03.800
No,

471
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.490
they all.

472
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.490
They both work,

473
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.500
so it's not a matter of functionality.

474
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.070
However,

475
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.180
they work differently.

476
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:09.730
Andi.

477
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.550
I can see where this is going to lead to user experience issues or even support issues,

478
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.990
because if you are used to seeing your website in cruel and somebody cause in seeing it's

479
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:23.910
not working properly an edge then That's a design issue as far as I'm concerned.

480
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:32.000
So we want consistency across over website on in all browsers Now what we need to do to

481
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.230
maintain consistency across all browsers with our date picker or did control used to

482
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:44.260
actually reference a deep picker and that one of the more popular and easy to use one's

483
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.700
would be from Jake Worry you I it's understand to gula Jake,

484
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.320
where you I and it will just go to the website on here.

485
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.900
They have a bunch of what you call widgets.

486
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.950
You can get a kardian controls auto,

487
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.660
complete all sorts of things.

488
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.950
So the one that we're interested in is the date picker.

489
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.960
So we just look at how we go about including that on.

490
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.530
Give us a quick example where you click and you get a date picker control,

491
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.200
no matter what the bro's er this is how it's going to look on.

492
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.280
That is what we want.

493
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.890
So we just click view source on,

494
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.480
then the show us kind off what needs to be included,

495
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:18.840
right,

496
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.200
So we need a style sheet on.

497
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.850
They actually give us some seedy and links.

498
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.440
So we need a style sheet and we need to script files.

499
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.680
I need a reference toe.

500
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.170
Jake,

501
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.000
Worry on.

502
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.160
Then.

503
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.520
We need a reference to Jake.

504
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.460
Were you y know what happened?

505
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:40.480
Is that when we took the example from Bootstrap in our footer one of the scripts being

506
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.520
referenced is J query.

507
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.330
So we don't need toe include the Jake or again,

508
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.870
what we just need to do know his reference the Jake where you I sections.

509
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.200
I can just copy this,

510
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.380
Andi Well,

511
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.130
back to my foot or cord and paste it another space it as the last thing.

512
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.780
So once again,

513
00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.570
order mutters,

514
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.580
we need to make sure that we don't place it above the original geek were friends.

515
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.400
Because there are things in this that rely on court from this.

516
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.360
So this has to be rendered first.

517
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.840
Before this,

518
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.610
we can start to work next,

519
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.340
we can take this script example.

520
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:22.000
This scored block where what it is doing is invoking a function on it is looking for some

521
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.190
elements of the I D date picker.

522
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.530
So want to see the hashtag in general scripting Means is looking for on elements with idee

523
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:29.950
on.

524
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.700
Then the idea is looking for would be,

525
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.290
in this case,

526
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:33.900
the speaker.

527
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.920
So we're just entity it.

528
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.780
That and we're going to paste it underneath the reference to the J quarry called So once

529
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.160
again order marchers.

530
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.530
I can't stress that enough.

531
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.100
All right,

532
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.520
So if you don't follow the order than you're probably going to run into problems problems

533
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.720
and referencing problems on,

534
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.370
then I'm going to change this because we don't have any element of the I d date picker.

535
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.450
What will you want?

536
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.370
He is to get our element called the OBE.

537
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.800
All right,

538
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.390
So the enemy with I d d o b that is rule on the date picker.

539
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.210
So I'm just going toe change this I d to deal be so we'll look for the element Do you will

540
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:16.170
be once any pages loaded on it will tried to invoke the date picker class,

541
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:16.870
which is Ah,

542
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.040
sorry function,

543
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.400
which is a form shown being called from this scored which has dependence is on stuff in

544
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.890
this.

545
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:28.290
So that is why the order marchers once again on then if we look into the rest of the

546
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.240
example we see here that the input type is text,

547
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.180
not be it.

548
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.500
So we don't have to set it.

549
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.960
A deity can be text on the i.

550
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.870
D was there picker.

551
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.880
So I already can establish the father.

552
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.100
We need to change the i d.

553
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:46.190
What I'm going to do now is change the type from date toe text.

554
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.640
So here it is debt on.

555
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.640
I'm changing that to text on dial.

556
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.120
Save on one more thing that I didn't take over is the style sheet.

557
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.480
All right,

558
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.640
so this style sheet actually is what will make this look like this?

559
00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:58.890
Right?

560
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.250
So we have to include that stash.

561
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:00.810
It's understand,

562
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.040
toe,

563
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.750
take that chord on.

564
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.330
That's a Cdn linked to the stash it somewhere.

565
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:10.480
And I'm going to go and pieced it inside off the header,

566
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.180
and I'll put it after the bootstrap stash.

567
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.120
So have this bootstrap star.

568
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.970
She didn't have the Jake or stash it,

569
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.790
and then we have over personal stash eat.

570
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:22.370
All right,

571
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.220
so when we re fresh and try,

572
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.870
we would notice that it is not working.

573
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:27.310
All right,

574
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:32.640
so when we want to debug when our like javascript on stuff is not working.

575
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.290
We can always right click in the empty space and click Inspect on then.

576
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:44.220
That kind of brings up this this debugging section where we can go to console and see what

577
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.360
errors are being printed on the area that is prevalent here is that it is saying that there

578
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.480
is something that it is trying to access from the geek or U F.

579
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.680
That is not available.

580
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.150
So remember,

581
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.780
housing order mutters,

582
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.940
we have to make sure we re friends The pier and file which is ghee clarified before we were

583
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.590
friends the you I file which we did.

584
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:09.620
But it is seeing that it cannot find certain things on one off the aero seriously and that

585
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:15.260
being picker is not a function on it is referencing this J quarter file that we have

586
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.400
already included.

587
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.620
So what is happening here is a is a matter off version.

588
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.620
So we have the latest geek wear,

589
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.650
which is three point something point something.

590
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.870
Whereas if we look back at the example,

591
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:33.570
we see that it is relying on J query version 1.12 point four.

592
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.930
So that is the root of your problem.

593
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.240
So in other words.

594
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.780
It is saying that you're trying to reference something that is not in the current version.

595
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.490
And that's fine.

596
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:46.110
So what we are going to do is just make sure that we reference this as the example would

597
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.780
have indicated.

598
00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.520
So we're going to take this reference.

599
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.250
We're going to go back to our cord on.

600
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.350
I want to put that reference right here above the G query reference.

601
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.090
So this is our Jake.

602
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.500
Where you a reference.

603
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.740
I'm putting that one right above it.

604
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.340
All right,

605
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.310
So we have the latest version,

606
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.140
which is a query 3.3 point one on that is being referenced.

607
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.290
First on,

608
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:15.640
then this one is being referenced afterwards on just in time to load the Jake worry you I

609
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.300
and then all of these references occurring alot date picker or should l o date picker gun

610
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.320
control toe work.

611
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.940
So if I go back and I refresh,

612
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.330
you know what is that?

613
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.130
All off my console Arrows are gone.

614
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.190
I have no that The website is not complaining about anything.

615
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.550
No,

616
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.770
on then if I click in date off birth,

617
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.970
I get my control.

618
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.980
All right.

619
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.600
On that is what we really wanted.

620
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.400
So if I go back to Internet Explorer and refresh,

621
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.150
then my control,

622
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.290
my Collender looks the same way.

623
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.350
And that is what we want.

624
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.300
That level of consistency,

625
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.020
Andi,

626
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.290
accountability to our users are on.

627
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.360
The great thing about this is that it doesn't follow any of the keyboard input apart from

628
00:27:59.360 --> 00:27:59.910
maybe numbers,

629
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.100
but they can't put text are very,

630
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.430
very random things in there.

631
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:09.970
So you can actually kind off prevent bad data from going into your application using these

632
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:10.760
controls.

633
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.870
All right,

634
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.980
so that's it for setting up our form.

635
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.760
Andi,

636
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.640
I hope you had fun.

637
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.890
I hope you learned something.

638
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.320
And if you run into any difficulty,

639
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.350
just let me know and I'll be sure toe reach out to you.
