1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
you guys in this video,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,870
we're going to start modifying our applications such that unauthorized users won't be able

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,550
to see certain parts off for website.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,790
Now,

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,940
the scenario is that this registration form for conferences,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,030
public facing everybody should be able to come on a register on move along.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,680
However,

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,660
nobody should be able to view attendees and meet modification store databases at will.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,150
So what we want to do is kind off put in mechanisms such that you have to get authenticated

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,880
to make sure that you're authorized to see the speech.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,680
Andi,

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,870
do any further modifications to the data now back in our code?

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:44,990
Um,

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,340
we'll just start our modifications with our con files.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,880
So I'm going to switch over to my development database,

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,160
um,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,340
distant comment about the remote database connections and on comments,

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:05,400
the local database connections that I'm creating a new file inside of my DB folder on I'm

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,340
calling its user dot PHP and then use it up each.

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,420
Be no has on start up with a Ph.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,600
B block on.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,390
It has a class called user.

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,620
So class user on,

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,770
then we're just going to go over to crow dot PHP and borrow the first bit off court,

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,110
which is where it initially initialized a private variable called DB and then use the

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,430
constructor to give it the values.

27
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,620
So this is generic.

28
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,130
This needs to be done regardless so that we can keep the same object or into dynamic across

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,580
all our files on.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,740
Did I just borrowed that?

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,750
Put it there on the next mission will be to implement some functions.

32
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,390
So the first function I'm going to put in is public function.

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,450
Insert user.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,450
All right,

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,680
so inserts user.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,080
Well,

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,270
that's function one.

38
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,230
I haven't defined the user table yet,

39
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,250
so I'm not going to proceed with that just yet.

40
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,120
But I want another phone shown.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,860
That's well,

42
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,890
maybe get user.

43
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,800
Alright,

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,490
some just swear framing of this class for no on.

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,700
We'll just leave it at that.

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,110
So I don't want to insert use.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,840
I want to get user at some point,

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,790
but what we also need to do is actually define or user table.

49
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,350
So I'm going over to PHP my at mean taking my attendance db and creating beauty with

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,700
quality users.

51
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,480
Andi,

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,410
I only want three columns you can put in more if you want what my three columns are really

53
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,400
going to be i d which is going to be my auto implementing primary key.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,990
Andi,

55
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,180
I need using him on the password,

56
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,250
and these two will be var char and I'll give them a size off 50.

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,590
All right,

58
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,420
Once I've defined those that can just go ahead and click save create my my new table on

59
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,190
then No,

60
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,310
I know I need using human passwords.

61
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,480
So whatever columns you put in,

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,670
I'm sure you put in more,

63
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,100
but at the very least,

64
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,220
you should have using him and password.

65
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,950
Or maybe use email address on password,

66
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,500
but you need at least these two have ah,

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,620
sensible user till our so know that I need I know what columns I need.

68
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,820
I can better define my functions.

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,210
So I'm going back over to my phone,

70
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,020
shines and insert a user.

71
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:37,260
I can expect that I'm going to get the user name on the password off the user to be

72
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,950
inserted.

73
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,120
So I just put those in use any imposter word.

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,730
Those are my two parameters on,

75
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,950
then to into an insert.

76
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,540
I can go over to crowd.

77
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,260
Now we can borrow the same logic that was used to insert our attendees understand to take

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,000
this entire block off court on.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,410
Then we're going to make some slight adjustments relative toe our new context.

80
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,240
First change I'm going to make is to the court so we can retain the verbal name SQL.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,610
But then the quarry should be inserted into users,

82
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,830
since that's our new table name and inside off or user class.

83
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:24,000
So inserting to users on the columns that were inserting into our user name on the password

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,680
and remember ideas also implementing so we don't need to provide a value for i.

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,040
D.

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,610
I don't have all of these.

87
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,360
Maybe you do,

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,940
so you can tweak it accordingly.

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,850
But I don't so remove them.

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,430
All right on then,

91
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,620
values on the values are the parameters that go into the values are using human passwords.

92
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,130
I'm writin the colon and putting back the same using human password on.

93
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,870
Then I'm going to remove all off the extra parameters to be boned on.

94
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,070
Just make sure that I retrofit all of this school to be used.

95
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,460
The name on the password.

96
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,800
All right,

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,670
so that's so you can reuse Cool that you've already we already did quite a bit off,

98
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,910
quoting instead of crowd,

99
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,870
I know we need similar court instead of users unders.

100
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,110
We're using it,

101
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,910
Andi,

102
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,760
Essentially,

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
what we're doing is the same thing.

104
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,070
We're just inserting a user so this could be used when somebody's registering for your

105
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,770
website the same way that we accepted all of this data from somebody.

106
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,280
Sorry,

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,730
insert into attendee were accepted all of these theater points,

108
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,850
and already it was inserted into the table.

109
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,060
That's essentially the same thing you're doing with the user.

110
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,130
So any time you have a database interaction where they put something in the database,

111
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,550
let this be a general template as the whole it can be accomplished.

112
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,270
Next up,

113
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,390
we have get user,

114
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,730
and this first gets user.

115
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,270
I want to get the user with a using him on password that much,

116
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,010
whatever is being passed into our parameters.

117
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,950
So I want the user name and password to be passed into the apartment is,

118
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,830
and then I want to check if there's a user with that somewhere to go about two credit and

119
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,450
see if I have any a similar function to this and I do in the form of get attendee details

120
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:09,790
granted,

121
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,930
it was on the i D.

122
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,340
But the concept for me is the same.

123
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,690
Someone to copy this cord on the east.

124
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,460
It's here and then we just modify.

125
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,220
So we say Select star from on going to kind of clean out everything after the table said I

126
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:33,620
wouldn't have a confusion so it selects star from or users table were on then The first

127
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,990
part of the wear condition is the user name should be equal toe the parameter user name.

128
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,860
And so we want this use or whatever user it finds most have.

129
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,720
I use the name that much is whatever is coming into the parameter Onda password matching

130
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,730
whatever's coming into the past the department or so password column as a value that much

131
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,580
is the parameter password on then I already have the prepare command.

132
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,840
I have the buying power Rambo to spending for I D.

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,730
So I don't want to buy and for idea I wanted to bind for user name on the value should be

134
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:19,890
looking for is using you from the parameter on also for password on the values looking for

135
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,900
is from password on.

136
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,490
Then we executes then we fetch the results.

137
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,130
Meaning if a user is phone we fetched that user on.

138
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,360
Then we store it in results and will return the details about that user toe.

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,150
Whatever was calling that function.

140
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,720
Now,

141
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,750
having don't know that I'm going to introduce one more function and this one is going to be

142
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,090
get user by user name.

143
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,130
So I'm going to on the knees.

144
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,610
Get user Just introduce a new function.

145
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,250
Public function gets user by using here,

146
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,740
and I'm passing in the using in value Oh,

147
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,210
our parameter on.

148
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,390
Then,

149
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,670
inside this function,

150
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm going to kind of do the same.

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,460
Try catch on.

152
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,400
This time I'm just fetching for user names.

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,660
I'm going toe just we write this scored quickly on then what we're doing in this one is

154
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,620
where selecting the number off users where the use any much is whatever is passed in the

155
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,300
parameter.

156
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,800
So let me say that again,

157
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,090
or select Parisienne Select won't star and I mean you could use a column name there,

158
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,190
but we just say star cones has no meaning.

159
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,820
Return A column called gnome,

160
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,340
with our value off the cones from the user stable,

161
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,890
were there is a user name.

162
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,000
That much is whatever use the name is coming in through our parameter.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,430
And then,

164
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,340
of course,

165
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,250
everything else kind of looks just like that.

166
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,460
Get user function territory executes,

167
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,220
and then we fetch the results on store it.

168
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,050
Return it,

169
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,480
art.

170
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,800
So the purpose of this one,

171
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,220
this dysfunction,

172
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,970
is to make sure that we don't enter tool users of the same user name.

173
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,710
All right,

174
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,700
so this is really it could return a true or false.

175
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:13,920
What?

176
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,260
I'm just going to leave it as is on.

177
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,120
I'm going to kind of modify this this this insert user function toe always call this

178
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,280
function first on,

179
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,020
then,

180
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,890
based on what this function returns taken action.

181
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,340
So if he returns anything other than zero meaning zero would mean that there is no user by

182
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,150
this user name.

183
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,760
Then it should go ahead and insert if it returned something other than zero.

184
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,850
Meaning there is a user by that using here,

185
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,100
then we just don't do anything.

186
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,670
All right.

187
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,360
Someone to retrofit dysfunction on.

188
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,410
What I'm going to do is introduce a variable,

189
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,990
and I'm going to call it results on.

190
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,450
It's going to be equal toe this so because we're in the class after user,

191
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,090
this keyword so that we can access the sibling functions on When I say this arrow,

192
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,130
I'm going to call,

193
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,380
get user by user New.

194
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,570
All right,

195
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,850
So my intelligence self made a little bit there on then inside off this parameter and

196
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:23,490
passing in the same user name that the requests just came in to create the user record for

197
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,320
All right,

198
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,760
So what's went up in his once I call insert user passing and using him on password.

199
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,840
It's no going to meet this phone Sean Call,

200
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,200
which is supposed to check the database Azzawi designed on here to see if there's any user

201
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,060
with that user name and return home.

202
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,500
Many.

203
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:48,640
So then what we need to do is see if our results and result is what storing that won't

204
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,160
right,

205
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,350
You've result.

206
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,010
Onda results would represent the whole roll,

207
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,840
which has ah,

208
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,610
column called gnome.

209
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,260
All right,

210
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,670
remember,

211
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,140
we said we wanted to return some results set with a column called Gnome Worth of value Off

212
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,660
phoned.

213
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:10,740
So if if the value inside off results square bracket gnome is greater than zero,

214
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,220
which means that there is a user by that user knew.

215
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,150
Then what we can do is this return falls.

216
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,600
All right,

217
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,970
so we just returned falls if that user exists,

218
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,910
And essentially we don't want to do anything without falls,

219
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,260
because ofall serious,

220
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:26,950
but ah,

221
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,070
false here is bad.

222
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,580
So we just returned falls on.

223
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,310
Then we just see else we want to proceed with all of four beautiful,

224
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,320
wonderful court that is actually creating our users.

225
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,480
Just fix the farm.

226
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,440
Utting indentation there.

227
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,560
All right on then,

228
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,130
at the end off all of that.

229
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,780
One second.

230
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,050
What's going to happen is that we call in certain user passing to user name and password.

231
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,020
It's going to first meet that check to see.

232
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,770
Okay,

233
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,910
give me back home and users have this user name.

234
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,860
If there is at least one,

235
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,560
then we don't want to do anything.

236
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,460
Otherwise,

237
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,740
we want to proceed with the user creation.

238
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,190
Now,

239
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,830
one more modification I want to meet to this.

240
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,400
Dysfunction is the way it handles the password.

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,060
So the pastoral as it stands,

242
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,310
would be whatever pillion takes the user types into the form when they're logging and so

243
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,570
sure it's obscured from over eyes because you know that in HTML that's come up or some

244
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,230
simple scallop instead off words,

245
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,930
but then wanted passes over here.

246
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,770
It's playing text.

247
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,760
It's really just,

248
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,550
you know,

249
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,590
as you typed it when we start in the database,

250
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,850
we don't want anybody to be able to look into the database and just see Oh,

251
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,710
that's what the pastor it is because we didn't obscure it.

252
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,350
So we want to introduce over call encryption,

253
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,650
which will obscure the way the password looks in the database and make it fire more

254
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,330
difficult for somebody to sit down and figure out what to your password is.

255
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,510
So I'm going to above the else before I even get into the SQL statement,

256
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,490
I want to define a new verbal on.

257
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm going to call its new on a square password on the new password will actually be like a

258
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,740
concatenation off password on what we call assault on.

259
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,080
And that's salt,

260
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,370
as in salt.

261
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,520
All right,

262
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:33,610
so assault is like a random block off text that we used to further up obscured what the

263
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,900
password might be.

264
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,620
So sometimes people define a static salt,

265
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,070
and then they use the static salt toe upend our pre penned every password.

266
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,100
So every time somebody typed in the password,

267
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,950
it's used as a qualifying agents.

268
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,890
Um,

269
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,560
I want to be a bit more dynamic someone up in the user name.

270
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,990
So this password text are so by using the user name toe up end to the password,

271
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,630
it's far more dynamic.

272
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,480
There is no static.

273
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,420
Salt is somewhat off at the salt,

274
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,050
which is used.

275
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,170
The name changes every time it's a different user on.

276
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:07,370
Then,

277
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,730
even if they use the same password to password should never look alike in the database

278
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,680
because the salt would have been different.

279
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,390
Because we're you know,

280
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,290
every user name,

281
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,670
at the very least should be different.

282
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,080
So having upended them on seeing new password,

283
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,440
the next thing I'm going to do is actually encrypted,

284
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,640
because right now it's still playing English.

285
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,920
It's just two words,

286
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,250
so I'm just going to say MD five,

287
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:39,180
and I'm wrapping this concatenation text inside off the parent disease on this is an

288
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,330
encryption function,

289
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,670
so it's probably the most prop popular.

290
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,620
PH be built in encryption function there,

291
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,460
quite a few.

292
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,290
This is very popular on It is probably the least secure,

293
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,510
since it's so popular,

294
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,420
But off course you try your best to me.

295
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,920
Whatever it is you're encrypting as dynamic and foolproof us possible.

296
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,540
So they're moving forward.

297
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,030
It's harder to crack.

298
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,940
So let's go through this again.

299
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,600
I'm defining a new variable called new password Andi,

300
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,620
I am hushing are combined text off the password on the user name some combining using him

301
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,680
and password in tow.

302
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,980
One continuous string on.

303
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,200
Then I'm using MD five toe hash it on.

304
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,500
Then I'm storing all of that inside off new password,

305
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,930
which then means instead of passing password as the Param,

306
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm going to pass new underscore password.

307
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,570
So this is what will get stored in our database.

308
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,650
And this is what needs to be often today authenticated against each time going forward.

309
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,220
So then,

310
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,130
of this exercise,

311
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,670
I'm feeling pretty confident that we can insert a user.

312
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:55,630
We check and make sure that this user name doesn't exist before Andi We,

313
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,650
if it does,

314
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,760
does not exist.

315
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,240
Then we can go ahead and create a hash password and insert this new user with its brand new

316
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,780
secure password.

317
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,960
Now have a few more changes I'm going to make and I'm going to meet them to the conduct PHP

318
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,360
file where I'm actually going to Winston.

319
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,010
She it first requires understand,

320
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,770
require once users dot PHP.

321
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,520
So I'm just requiring that new DB file Andi in that same Vietnam went to declare a new

322
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,780
object off called user off type user.

323
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,280
And it's getting the C M PDO object that curdles getting,

324
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,620
which is why we re used the constructor bit off cord from crowd because we expected to be

325
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,150
here the same way that crowd behaved.

326
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,010
All right,

327
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,590
no conduct PHP is included on every page,

328
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,190
which means that if we need to access something for the user,

329
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,940
we can access it.

330
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,200
If we need something from crowd,

331
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,580
we can access it and every other objects that are class that we build that should interact

332
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:03,790
with the database will also could also be included right here in the conduct PHP and

333
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,030
utilized according to their different patterns and different ways.

334
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,760
Often in this,

335
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,300
this is just one of the paths off least resistance so that we can understand the foundation

336
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,840
off it.

337
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:21,950
Now the last teams are going to make is I'm going to call the function insert user,

338
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,830
which is inside off my user objects.

339
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,180
Right?

340
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,090
So we just declared the user objects on same time.

341
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,250
I'm going to put it to use,

342
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,580
and I'm going to call the insert user,

343
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:39,070
which takes a user name on I'm putting this as admin onda password off.

344
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,380
Well,

345
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,150
password.

346
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,420
So it's a very simple,

347
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,700
um user.

348
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,470
So our admin users admin imposter know the reason putting it right here inside the con file

349
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,260
is that the confines gets loaded on every peach.

350
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,290
When we go to the index speech and the Khan forgets loaded and it loads all of this,

351
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,300
it's no good to insert the admin user insert.

352
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,030
Users want to call the phone,

353
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,570
son,

354
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,500
get user by using him to make sure that there is no other user by that user name on then,

355
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,880
Well,

356
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,260
it's going to be our first user,

357
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,190
so there will be no other user by the user name admin,

358
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,820
so this will get executed.

359
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,700
You will go to another page and it reloads and it recalls dysfunction.

360
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,010
What will happen the second time when it passes in admin as user name on.

361
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,670
Then this reviews that there is.

362
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,450
I use a by that name.

363
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,640
It will just return falls and do nothing.

364
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,010
So this user should get created at least once.

365
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,420
Well,

366
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,350
should be there once.

367
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,210
Andi,

368
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,840
if he gets deleted once the website is Lord and he will get recreated so you could do it

369
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,330
one time and then commented Oh,

370
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,560
sorry.

371
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,760
Could leave it because we already quoted in a defensive manner.

372
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,600
So this user should never appear twice in our database.

373
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,240
All right,

374
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:01,910
so if I make all these changes and save and then go ahead and re lord or form man see whole

375
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,450
our changes fear,

376
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,180
it's understand to refresh this page.

377
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,860
And as you can see,

378
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,850
everything loaded,

379
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,770
nothing seems to have happened.

380
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,250
But if I go back to pitch me,

381
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,790
my admin Andi,

382
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,860
reload my user stable.

383
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,340
Then you'll see that we have a new user called admin on.

384
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,440
If you look at that pastor,

385
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,840
the looks,

386
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,210
nothing like the word password.

387
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,730
All right,

388
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,300
so that's our hushed password.

389
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,030
And if I never get to another page on,

390
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,040
come back to homes,

391
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,380
remember,

392
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,750
each time we never gets loading Khan and it's making that function call.

393
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,800
If I go back to my user stable,

394
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,740
I'm still only seeing one instance off admin.

395
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,410
If I delete admin.

396
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,340
Andi,

397
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,250
I just removed.

398
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,730
That means so there is no user by the name at me,

399
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,750
and I go to another page on day I go and refresh.

400
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,720
Add.

401
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,650
Minnery appears with a new I D.

402
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,080
Yes,

403
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,230
but the seam add mean using name and password.

404
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,740
All right,

405
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,560
so that exercise was just to show you how you could go about putting in at least one user

406
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,160
so that when we start locking down our pages,

407
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,760
we actually have a user to use toe log in.
