00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
Hey,

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.060
guys,

3
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.780
congrats for getting this far.

4
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.900
I hope that you have been enjoying the journey.

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.600
And don't worry,

6
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.890
it is going to get even more exciting in this video.

7
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.370
We start looking at life after the form.

8
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.220
In other words,

9
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.930
when we actually click submit,

10
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
we expect something to happen because there is no form on the Internet that when we click

11
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.180
submits,

12
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.110
nothing happens.

13
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.320
Something always happens,

14
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.050
and today we're going to see what happens and learn how to control it.

15
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.970
Going back to our court file,

16
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.020
we will start making modifications to the form tug so that we will said two things.

17
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.120
Well said a method on on action there.

18
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.620
Two forms of mission methods.

19
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.400
One is get and one is posed in this video.

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.750
We will be looking at the 1st 1 as get I'm going to modify my foreign tired and I'm going

21
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.290
toe add on attributes and this one is called my third on.

22
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.050
The value for this attributes is going to be the word get.

23
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.920
No,

24
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.670
you're probably wondering what is posed,

25
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.400
what is get on.

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.620
Why is this relevant?

27
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.080
And I'm going to bring you on a little field trip toe kind of context Realize what get does

28
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.080
.

29
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.160
So let's goto a popular Web site like youtube dot com.

30
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.730
Now YouTube is a very powerful and very popular video streaming site on.

31
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.260
As a beginning developer,

32
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.820
somebody wasn't worked on any projects off any real magnitude.

33
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.540
Up to this point,

34
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.670
you're probably Can't you two been wondering Wow,

35
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.010
how do they do what they do?

36
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.000
So I'm going to break it down into simple terms.

37
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.440
Andi will see contextually what they get.

38
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.060
Those and whole YouTube uses what we're about to explore.

39
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.560
So up here you have the search on.

40
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.010
Maybe you've realized by no,

41
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.010
or maybe you knew before.

42
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.800
But this search is really just a form.

43
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.310
We are creating a form.

44
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.460
We have a text box and we have a submit button.

45
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.940
You,

46
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.330
too.

47
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.450
They have a text box and ever submit button they to see him Concept.

48
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.490
If I search for video on puppies,

49
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.170
I'm typing in that value.

50
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.260
And then I click the search button,

51
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.020
which is like picking or submit button here.

52
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.700
What happens is that it goes to another page,

53
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.810
this other pages,

54
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.270
what we call an action.

55
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.860
All right,

56
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.560
so we're going to look at the action and where also can't get.

57
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.450
So the next page that comes after submitting your form is called the Action Page.

58
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.500
And then,

59
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.290
if you look in the browser browser,

60
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.710
the text in the brochure.

61
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.090
Sorry,

62
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.980
then you'll see this question mark,

63
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.250
and then you see some value and you'll see some.

64
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.810
So you see a question mark and you see some values.

65
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.350
What this is is a result off our get action.

66
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.070
So they get sorry to get method.

67
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.850
So the action is the next page that comes after the form.

68
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.520
All right,

69
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.570
so in other words,

70
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.700
when we click submit,

71
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.400
we expect to navigate away from the form,

72
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.490
toe another patient,

73
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.150
See a you're successful or something like that,

74
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.500
right?

75
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.710
That's our action.

76
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.620
However,

77
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.660
the values that you're seeing here would be,

78
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.530
as a result,

79
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.780
off the values that were submitted by the forms.

80
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.640
In our case,

81
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.980
we wrote puppies to be submitted.

82
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.980
All right,

83
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.450
so puppies was submitted.

84
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.910
When we click search on,

85
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.670
then what you see is what you call a quarry result or a query.

86
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.030
Sorry that the word is slipping,

87
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.700
but these these are quarter results appearing in the U.

88
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.950
R.

89
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.040
L so when we use get it actually creates that question mark and then it passes every

90
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.880
variable that was in the form as well as all the values.

91
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.570
Alright,

92
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.140
so that's a practical way off.

93
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.150
Whole get is used on whole actions work.

94
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.970
So we're going to be modifying our form such that when we click submit,

95
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.280
we move away to another page on.

96
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.780
Also,

97
00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.250
we will see what happens in our Earl wants the get method is being used.

98
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.280
So we modified and we use the method get The next thing is that we want the action.

99
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.120
So I'm going to say action as another attribute on.

100
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.250
I'm going to say the action is success that PHP So the action page?

101
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.480
Well,

102
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.810
one,

103
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.700
we need to create it because up to now we only have one ph b pay just really doing anything

104
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.550
I understand to collapse all of these folders.

105
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.390
So we see that we really only have one page,

106
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.210
which is index.

107
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.240
So we need to create another pitch called Success that PHP.

108
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.650
So what happens is that when you click submit is going to see what page should I go to next

109
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.650
?

110
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.260
And we would have defined that page right here.

111
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.830
Success that PHP.

112
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.740
So I'm just going to go ahead and create it.

113
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.850
I'm just going to go over to my explorer pain and click new file.

114
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.090
And then I'm going to say success that PHP on,

115
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.600
then just the same way I want on my pages.

116
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.700
Pretty consistent.

117
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.750
I'm going to take the require court from Index,

118
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.600
and I'm going to pay sitting success.

119
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.230
All right,

120
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.080
So I don't have to do much work to meet my pages look alike.

121
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.350
And I'm just going to do the same here.

122
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.170
And I'm going to copy these br tugs.

123
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.990
And as we go along,

124
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.110
we refined the design,

125
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.630
So just work with it for no on.

126
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.400
So in success lot ph.

127
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.650
B.

128
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.270
I'm referencing the header on the footer on.

129
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.400
I just need to change the title here because this is the success.

130
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.410
Paid someone to see success here.

131
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.680
All right,

132
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:36.590
No one more modification is I'm going to put on each one tag here on this is going to just

133
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.040
print.

134
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.340
You have been registered.

135
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.310
So when they fill out the form and then they click submit,

136
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.960
we want to let them known that they were successful.

137
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.660
So we're just going to say you have Bean Mr Bean registered.

138
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.090
All right,

139
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.020
Andi,

140
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.770
once again,

141
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.460
I'm just going to use my bootstrap to easily move my content.

142
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.450
Our own someone to see takes the center.

143
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.540
Andi,

144
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.250
I believe that bootstrap has something for green text.

145
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.860
So,

146
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.250
you know,

147
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.090
color coding kind of helps give visual cues as to what?

148
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.270
When something is an era versus when something is good someone to use text dash success

149
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.840
which I believe should give a green old put on we can We can always test that theory.

150
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.510
But essentially,

151
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.880
that is what our success speech should print.

152
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.300
So lets us see what happens when,

153
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.950
after doing these modifications,

154
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.170
go back to my registration page.

155
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.960
I'm going to refer,

156
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.090
So he gets the latest cord on.

157
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.270
Then I'm going toe fill this boat.

158
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:44.970
So Mary Poppins on her days off birth is probably and notice that this this is not a

159
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.310
limited at the date on the time or the money,

160
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.630
specifically from the year.

161
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.200
So we're going to modify that does.

162
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.250
This is going to be irritating to users.

163
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.710
If they're born in the fifties,

164
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.850
you can see the problem.

165
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.290
There And so I'm just going to go ahead and work with this date Onda leave for as a

166
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.950
database.

167
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.820
I mean,

168
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:12.020
I m pop at gmail dot com on her number is 12 something random.

169
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.350
All right.

170
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.710
And then when I click submit Look what happens.

171
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.780
You have bean registered.

172
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.790
Isn't that lovely?

173
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.890
So that is how we start seeing a whole forms work.

174
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:29.140
So when we submit the next page that it goes toe would have been defined by us in the

175
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.660
action.

176
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.170
Alright?

177
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.650
Success that PHP.

178
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.790
I noticed that the question mark is appearing because it's said to get so because we're

179
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.340
getting that question Mark is already there,

180
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.560
But nothing is coming after the question marks.

181
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.920
So no,

182
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.840
we need to make some more modifications,

183
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.250
toe or form to start getting content to appear in,

184
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.810
or you are oh on.

185
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.930
So we know that the get is actually functioning properly now going back to our core the

186
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.120
next modification that we need need,

187
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.330
need,

188
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.450
need need need to make on Really This is in the context off PH.

189
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.940
B and certain other service I languages.

190
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:13.470
We need toe actually give our input controls what we call the name attributes so right?

191
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:13.650
No,

192
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.900
they have idea and ideas mostly used by Jake,

193
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.240
Ori and CS sister,

194
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.930
you know,

195
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.270
name our control.

196
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.920
So using the i d.

197
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.320
Like we saw in the case off date off birth,

198
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.920
we could actually say that the script should tar get any element with the i d date off

199
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.240
birth.

200
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.150
So we see that I d can be useful for the visual side of things,

201
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.130
but for the server side of things,

202
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.260
we need to use a name attribute.

203
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.610
So when we use the name attribute,

204
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.950
it's like we're simulating variable.

205
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.400
So the same way we can just declare a variable here and give it a value,

206
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.250
and we can echo that variable and it's all nice and dandy.

207
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.940
The only way that PHP can actually access the value inside of for control is if we access

208
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.140
it by its name on.

209
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.370
The only way to set the name for our control is to give it the name attributes.

210
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.180
So I'm going to go ahead and give first name,

211
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.220
the name attribute and the name can be the same thing.

212
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.070
So you don't have toe worry about what you're going to name it.

213
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.950
You can have the ideas first name and the name is first name just for consistency.

214
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.170
See?

215
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.920
All right.

216
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.940
So you can actually just copy and piece.

217
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.890
The idea is going right across,

218
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.570
and it has changed from I D to need.

219
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.220
All right,

220
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.340
so whichever method is easier for you,

221
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.110
and I just do this for a few onscreen,

222
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.800
but our continent the lesson,

223
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.160
and you can do it on your own,

224
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.500
um,

225
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.960
four year old edification.

226
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.130
It's also a good idea to give your your submit button name.

227
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.960
Andi.

228
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.560
I'm just going to do that.

229
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.180
So I've given all of the other ones names,

230
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.460
and I'll just give the submit button and name also because sometimes you want to actually

231
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.810
call it by name by PHP to dynamically,

232
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.830
um,

233
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.270
accomplish things with it.

234
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.350
So every thing that is in my form,

235
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.960
that is a foreign element.

236
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.530
Once it's collecting data or it is interacting with data and the submit button would fall

237
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.920
into that second category,

238
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.890
I am giving it a name.

239
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.510
No,

240
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.260
I want to go back to my form on refresh on.

241
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.850
I'm going to fill out this form.

242
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.110
Some were using Mary Poppins information on.

243
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.870
Then I'm going to submit Onda.

244
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.290
We went our action,

245
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.630
but take a look at our you are Oh,

246
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.660
so you can see that for each element.

247
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.840
Whatever name we gave the element.

248
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.030
We're seeing those values there.

249
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.690
Alright,

250
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.570
so first name last name,

251
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.330
you'll be specialty email on phone,

252
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.660
and you also noticed that you're seeing the values that were put in.

253
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.490
So first name equals Mary.

254
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.840
Last name equals Poppins,

255
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.080
you'll be equals.

256
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.440
And this is kind of four months because of special characters.

257
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.100
Slashes aren't really alone in the euro,

258
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.530
so it's compensating for the slashes,

259
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.150
which is what it looks.

260
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.180
A cryptic but specialty database,

261
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.950
plus admin.

262
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:08.290
That's the space right there on email in pop once again special character gmail dot com,

263
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:08.730
etcetera,

264
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.060
etcetera,

265
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.050
etcetera and submit which,

266
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:11.570
well,

267
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.820
it had no value.

268
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.620
So that's fine.

269
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.910
So it will put the value.

270
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.860
Whatever the value off some it would have been,

271
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.840
it would be there.

272
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.760
But the point is,

273
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.800
for every name that you would have defined in your form,

274
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:33.150
the values can be seen by our server side aren't so they get action is actually putting the

275
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.790
get method.

276
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.890
Sorry is actually putting all of the values here.

277
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.680
And this is what you call a query string or quarter results,

278
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:39.960
right?

279
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.020
Anything after the question mark,

280
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:47.300
No contextually for this registration form.

281
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.410
This is harmless.

282
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.900
If you are doing a using,

283
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.570
if you're doing a registration form where they can use any amount of postural answer and

284
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.130
sensitive datum data,

285
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.730
you wouldn't want to use the quarry string here.

286
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.520
All right,

287
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:05.460
so that is when we look at the other method that does not pass all off your values on all

288
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.330
of your valuable information right here in the URL.

289
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.690
Publicly accessible.

290
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.230
All right.

291
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.070
No,

292
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.960
the next thing is,

293
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.650
what if I wanted to reprint the information that was just submitted in the form on the page

294
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:17.650
?

295
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.790
So the context is that Mary just signed up and we just want to show her that this is the

296
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.550
information that she entered while affirming that she's successfully registered.

297
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:33.170
So what I'm going to do is modify my action page on I'm going toe,

298
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:38.390
actually print coat everything that came back from the form.

299
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.270
So on our page,

300
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.050
we're going to start using PHP code.

301
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:44.350
So,

302
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.010
firstly,

303
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.190
I opened up my PHP tag.

304
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:52.610
All right,

305
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.230
on,

306
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.900
then inside off this tug,

307
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.750
we're going to start using a specialized function on,

308
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.810
uh,

309
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.800
this one is called get.

310
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.150
So this is what we call like a super variable in PHP.

311
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.550
So I'm going to say a dollar sign,

312
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.480
underscore,

313
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:16.550
get all right and then open square.

314
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.360
So it's really like a super ari super variable.

315
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.250
Meaning on because I'm using the square brackets can tell you scenery,

316
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:32.960
but then each subscript is really going to have the name off the controller that you define

317
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:32.960
.

318
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.850
So they literally the name that you defined is a subscript off this Get Ari.

319
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.700
All right,

320
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.450
so let me put that into context if I see get first name.

321
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.170
All right on.

322
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:47.350
Well,

323
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.690
this is just going to get the values,

324
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.870
actually want to print it.

325
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.080
Oh,

326
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.910
so I'm going to have to say echo,

327
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.750
get first name.

328
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.900
All right.

329
00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:02.100
So when I go back to my page on that form Phil,

330
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.150
it'll on,

331
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.410
then click.

332
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.550
Submit.

333
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.380
Then I'm going to see Mary being echoed to the screen.

334
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:18.070
And it's printing Mary because it's getting the value that is associated with first name.

335
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.770
All right,

336
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.210
so then that is whole.

337
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:25.300
You start getting back the values that are being submitted in the form you click submit it

338
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.190
passes the test.

339
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:33.230
Somewhere on that somewhere is into this super variable pretty much on you can segment this

340
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:40.150
super variable by using the name off the control that you intend toe get the value for All

341
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.390
right.

342
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.350
So once again,

343
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:47.070
this is just one big variable or Ari and you just get the specific ones by using the

344
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.750
subscript name that is that corresponds with the control.

345
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.220
You're trying to get the value off.

346
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:59.650
So then that means I can actually use this and get all the other values understand to

347
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.100
duplicate that line and see get last name.

348
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.640
I want the deal be that is being submitted.

349
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.020
I want what else is there was a specialty.

350
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.950
They can go ahead and just feel these old off screen.

351
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:14.940
I'll do it all screen.

352
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.050
I need it on your own time.

353
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.170
All right,

354
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:17.450
So,

355
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.500
having done that,

356
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.740
if I go and refresh,

357
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.160
then I'm going to see them all being printed and off course.

358
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.780
We know how the Echo statement works.

359
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.340
It's not when toe try and space anything for us.

360
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.140
But that's pretty much know the wonderful thing about the get once against that,

361
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.390
I didn't have to go back and submit the form.

362
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:41.780
It is just whatever is in the URL is available in the get here at all times.

363
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.900
So just because I refreshed on the values are already there.

364
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.740
Then it just got about the values on.

365
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.310
Look at this.

366
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.260
If I change this toe my name and then I refresh the page.

367
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.650
No,

368
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:57.030
sorry.

369
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.490
If I change it to my name and then press enter,

370
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.270
not refreshed,

371
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.940
you will refresh the page.

372
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.370
We reload the page on because the variables are still there in the world.

373
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.700
He would just get whatever value is in the variable being referenced.

374
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.300
So once again,

375
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.280
this could be useful.

376
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.750
We see that a big web site like YouTube uses it,

377
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.050
but they're just using it to show you the search results.

378
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.050
They're not using it to pass over sensitive information at all.

379
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.210
No,

380
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.440
I have in another window example.

381
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.650
So this is boots nip on.

382
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:35.060
People come here and make you know little snippets that you can take inspiration from,

383
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.140
if not bar altogether on here.

384
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.540
I'm just They can't a simple,

385
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.450
uh,

386
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.070
profiler representation of somebody's information,

387
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.270
and I'm going to use this as inspiration toe style hole over pH.

388
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.350
Here we look for anybody who has just registered.

389
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:56.320
Now I'm going to go to bootstrap site and I'm I'm going to use the card component,

390
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:03.300
and I went to you draw inspiration from this to represent the the registrants.

391
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.190
Information on this success speech aren't so.

392
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.040
I'm just going to kind of draw inspiration from home.

393
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.540
Wants to look they didn't submit any profile picture,

394
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.230
and that's fine.

395
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.780
I'll leave that alone but at least lets us see whole best.

396
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:24.790
We can represent their data using inspiration from this control our components.

397
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.850
Just I'm wondering to look at all of the templates,

398
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.860
and I see here that this one is simple.

399
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.350
It's designed just for text,

400
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.570
and all we have is text.

401
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.950
So we're just going to copy this on.

402
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.720
Then we go back to our success speech,

403
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.410
so I'm just going to paste this up of all of the PHP,

404
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.390
spend some time doing over indentations,

405
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.340
and then what we're going to do is just modify all of this.

406
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.910
Remember that out of the box this court will work,

407
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:04.620
but we want this This representation toe actually have the Dita coming in from or form.

408
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.050
So this is what we have so far,

409
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.210
we have the car title and a subtitle,

410
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.350
and then we have some stuff.

411
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.270
Some text are.

412
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.970
So what I'm going to do is put the registrants full name here,

413
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.610
where it's his car title.

414
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.820
So I'll just do that change and we just do it side by side.

415
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:29.170
So what I want to do is Sprint first name and last name in this section for this age five

416
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.940
talk.

417
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.350
All right,

418
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.980
so remember that we have multiple ways we can do this.

419
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:39.160
The simplest way to me is toe put in a PHP block.

420
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.980
Alright,

421
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:49.080
Some superimposing that in between the h five tug I want to echo on.

422
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:59.050
I'm going to be echoing the value for first name on a space on the value for last name.

423
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:03.510
And then remember that really and truly this space is not going to exist.

424
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.520
So I'm just going toe,

425
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.270
put them in quotation marks,

426
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.850
use my interpolation.

427
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.200
All right.

428
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.490
And then what that is going to do is just create one long,

429
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.350
contiguous block off text.

430
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.400
Andi,

431
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.580
with my semi colon,

432
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.120
and I think there's something wrong here.

433
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.310
Okay,

434
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.070
so then this and we're getting a red line.

435
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.590
And if I look back at my page,

436
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.410
I see that the peach has broken for this error.

437
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.450
So the D about the debugging is quite clear,

438
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.950
and it's sending us where Which file has the arrow on dawn?

439
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:36.530
Which line?

440
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.500
And that's lying 11.

441
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.680
And that's our line here.

442
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.440
So if that won't work,

443
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:47.460
then I'm going to instead removes the quotation marks on.

444
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.140
I'm going to use some concatenation here,

445
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.720
someone to conquer tinny.

446
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.320
It's the tool variables,

447
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.390
some echoing first name.

448
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:03.550
And then I'm going to con Captain eight a blank space onto last name.

449
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.040
All right,

450
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.120
so then we get that one long printing.

451
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.960
So sometimes you may have an idea of whole to write code like I just did on.

452
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.380
Then it may not work coat,

453
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.010
and that's fine.

454
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.110
You can always you know,

455
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.790
all the techniques.

456
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.630
He can always refresh its and regroup and try it another way.

457
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.220
So when I refresh this,

458
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.610
then we see our values being printed as they are in here.

459
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.270
So I don't like being called puppets.

460
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.690
Understand?

461
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.450
To rename changes,

462
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.470
but to Mary Press enter and then we get Mary Poppins.

463
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.130
Alright,

464
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.710
so that's that's the first step.

465
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.370
Next,

466
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.800
I'm going to change the subtitle.

467
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.230
Toby her provided specialty.

468
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.280
So she says she's a database admin.

469
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:53.040
So I'm going to change the text here for the subtitle in the same way.

470
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.020
So no,

471
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.510
we're seeing that we can just copy this,

472
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.670
and I'm just going toe create a space.

473
00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:05.150
So we get two lines here so we can see what each six starts and stops on what is inside h

474
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.480
six,

475
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.040
which is our beach b block on.

476
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.200
Then.

477
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.550
I'm just going to change this to Specialty.

478
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.910
Andi,

479
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.350
that's all I need printed.

480
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:21.300
So I'm just going to remove all of that on then when I refresh my page the Mary Poppins

481
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.120
database at all right.

482
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.490
And then I'm sure you get the idea.

483
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.990
You can go ahead and change out.

484
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:31.000
So we took inspiration from an existing controller on No,

485
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.140
we're making it our own.

486
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.750
Now we're making dynamic because the values here are relative to what is being submitted in

487
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.450
the form.

488
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.160
All right,

489
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.160
so as many changes as you make,

490
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.240
you can see them reflected here so I'm just going to go ahead and steam rule through the

491
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.380
rest of the changes here.

492
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.400
And then we just look at the final product art.

493
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.600
So I made all the changes,

494
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.440
all that it was.

495
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.280
Take the P class.

496
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.400
That's a car text,

497
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.700
and I just made each one itself.

498
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.750
And then what I'm going to do here is be explicit.

499
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.270
So date of birth,

500
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.420
colon for each one off them.

501
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.850
I'm just going to make sure that the static text is there.

502
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:17.060
So this is all we start merging static text with dynamic text because each time date of

503
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.580
birth is going to get printed email address is going to get printed.

504
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:26.070
But what is on the next side off the colon is always going to be relative toe what is

505
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.610
submitted.

506
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.060
All right,

507
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.150
So when I do all of this on day,

508
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.230
I'm going to take all these uncle tugs because I really don't need them,

509
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.690
right?

510
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.310
No,

511
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.840
I don't need them in the profile,

512
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.880
but off course,

513
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.330
you know,

514
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.250
make it your own.

515
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.210
You customize its whole you wanted.

516
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.660
And then when I refreshed my page,

517
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:51.470
I see here that I have ah slight error and it is seen that I have an undefined index called

518
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.550
Contact and determine the line number,

519
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.150
and that's because the indexes phone on,

520
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.110
not contact.

521
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.810
So you made me those mistakes,

522
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:05.390
and PHP will always be alert to them to keep you in line on when I refresh.

523
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.550
That's what I end up with.

524
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:12.910
So a nice little contact card to show Mary Poppins all of what she just submitted.
