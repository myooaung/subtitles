00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Hey,

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.720
guys.

3
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.490
In our previous video we created or user stable,

4
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.250
we created some mechanisms that are close to at least create the user on doll on,

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.130
find a user with a matching using human passwords.

6
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.670
So what we need to do know is actually start creating our log in forms so that we can

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.850
create.

8
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.950
I use their session Onda a low authentication across other pages on actually start imposing

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.950
restrictions on or Peaches.

10
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.570
Now step one is going to have me create a brand new file,

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.880
and I'm going to explain what the purpose off this fire is.

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.290
So I'm going to create a new file inside of my includes folders.

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.670
I click includes creating file on.

14
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.750
I'm calling this one session dot PHP No,

15
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.650
in order for us to handle.

16
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.240
Ah,

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.150
let's see toe pervious user information across our website.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.590
Once you have love being,

19
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.480
we have to use over call a session or cookie or their certain super variables that are

20
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.740
there.

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.360
So a cookie stored on the person's machine a session is stored in the server for under

22
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.880
server.

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.340
So we're using sessions.

24
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.310
Andi In order to get the use off sessions in Peachtree,

25
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.110
we have to run a directive on Doyle.

26
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.140
It's really a function.

27
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.590
And that function is session.

28
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.410
Underscore.

29
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.500
Start.

30
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.110
All right,

31
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.850
so the reason I put it in its own file just for this one line is that we can include this

32
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.920
file everywhere.

33
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.080
So I'm going to go ahead and include this fire this file on our header dot PHP,

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.380
Pete.

35
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.420
So instead,

36
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.230
off includes that us.

37
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.610
Fine.

38
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.050
Ended up PHP on the first thing that should be done on the header dot PHP is include our

39
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.090
session dot PHP file.

40
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.690
All right,

41
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.220
so I did that and I included some amount off some some comments,

42
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.190
so you know exactly what's happening there.

43
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.940
All right,

44
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.590
so we have a recession that pH be included on our hitter file on once the header is

45
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.200
included somewhere session dot PHP is implied.

46
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.980
Onda,

47
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.350
we can utilize over session variables across our website.

48
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.420
Next,

49
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.500
I'm going to make some modifications toe to this.

50
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.320
Um,

51
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.280
first,

52
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.690
to fix that spelling error.

53
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.820
Andi,

54
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.150
I'm going to make some modifications to this love bar where I want section toe the right.

55
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.090
Another spring it up.

56
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.910
So over here,

57
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.670
we want a button that's is logging on if the person has loved being,

58
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.200
then we want to change it to,

59
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.470
like,

60
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.140
a welcome message and the Lago.

61
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.820
But so I'm going to me that modification here.

62
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.490
So you know what I accomplish that we need to modify how the lives look.

63
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.450
Admittedly,

64
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.030
I didn't find this very easily on the bootstrap documentation.

65
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.930
Somewhere is going to do it here on.

66
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.000
If you want to go on double,

67
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.270
check it and you find it.

68
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.540
Then please show me the page.

69
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.530
But I'm going to do it.

70
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.830
So I know it's done in bootstrap for after much rigor and experimentation.

71
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.960
So I'm going to modify this first day of class with nav bar enough.

72
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.550
And I'm went at another classes says Empire Dash auto.

73
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.140
So this is my way of saying I want you to always be on the left hand side on.

74
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.340
Then I'm just into copy and peace because I need a similar construct.

75
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.110
But then this one is going to say M l dash auto aren't on.

76
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.660
Then if I just reload this page very quickly,

77
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.880
we're not done.

78
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.720
Number three loading,

79
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.700
So you can see.

80
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.060
Then we see here that we have are two original links.

81
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.540
These are the m r audible than we know have to the right.

82
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.630
Inside the same tooling is because,

83
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.860
well,

84
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.090
we copied on piece of them.

85
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.910
So we know we have a section to the right,

86
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.800
and we have a section to the left on.

87
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.970
No,

88
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.810
we can dictate what happens on the right hand side of four PHR.

89
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.470
Someone to remove Well,

90
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.360
instead of removing,

91
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.800
understands,

92
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.400
modify.

93
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.720
So I have the link that says home.

94
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.240
But this one I'm going to make it see lugging all right?

95
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.990
And then I went to make it.

96
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.370
Never get to log in that PHP.

97
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.870
So if somebody is not love being then they should see the button.

98
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.970
So the rights that is Le Guin on.

99
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.120
Then I can refresh on.

100
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.710
Then we will see the log in button and if we try to navigate or getting an air because that

101
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.870
does not exist.

102
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.590
So we need to go and create our log in button.

103
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.040
So I create a new file at the root on this one is going to be log in that P H p no for long

104
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.040
.

105
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.730
In that ph.

106
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.020
B,

107
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.140
it's going to kind of share quite a few things with the other pages.

108
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.600
Understand?

109
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.270
To go to maybe edit on.

110
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.900
I'm going to copy the first part of the PHP block place.

111
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.690
Over here.

112
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:07.950
We change the title on this is logging page or will user speeds Logan on?

113
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.340
We're including the same files on I don't need any of thes query sergeants.

114
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.650
Remove those real quickly.

115
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.320
All right,

116
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.750
so that's the top off our log in page.

117
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.970
No,

118
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.060
I'm going toe expedites this video and I'm going to just ah,

119
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.470
go ahead and create the form.

120
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.750
And then we come back and we dissected together.

121
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.690
All right,

122
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.480
so I went ahead and created this form pretty quickly.

123
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.510
And I'm going to walk you through some off the differences between how this form will

124
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.750
behave and hope our attendance registration form will behave.

125
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.850
So,

126
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.340
firstly,

127
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.990
I'm echoing the title because,

128
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.240
you know,

129
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.250
I'm just going on each one tug or the each one time would take Centre has the echo

130
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.130
statement in it for the title.

131
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.500
And so over.

132
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.240
Titles being printed at the top user log in.

133
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.030
We also see it here in our title bar.

134
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.700
Next we have Oh,

135
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.390
are sorry about that.

136
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:13.290
We have our form with an action that looks entirely different from what we have seen upon

137
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.210
to this point,

138
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.530
but or method is still equal to pull,

139
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.720
so we'll get back to the action in this form.

140
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.840
I use the table to help with my layout.

141
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.790
So I'm using one TD for the user name or for the label and one for the the text box.

142
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.630
Onda.

143
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.220
The value here has quite a bit of text,

144
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.000
which I'll get back to on.

145
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.490
Then I'm putting in some some share a message with the army and I use that.

146
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.080
Let me take it all from no for no to avoid any confusion.

147
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.480
I kind of got excited when I did all of that.

148
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.890
I'm sorry,

149
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.990
but I'll put it back and we can go through together on then.

150
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:58.470
I'm using another role for the labels on the controls for the password,

151
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.470
and then we have or submit Button,

152
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.270
which is beating primary beaten block under a little forgot password link,

153
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.160
and this is what it renders.

154
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.220
All right,

155
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.580
so that is what all of that court renders.

156
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.510
And this is our new lugging form.

157
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.100
No,

158
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.390
What we need to do is where it up so that when the person clicks lugging,

159
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.920
it moves to appeal.

160
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.500
Those verification on then takes an action.

161
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.630
I don't know if you've ever noticed,

162
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.420
but when you click when you're using a log,

163
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.450
inform you cannot behaves differently from most other forms with a little forms.

164
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.340
Move on to another.

165
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.680
PH,

166
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.730
like we did with our registration on success speech aren't in terms off the log.

167
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.810
Inform it.

168
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.010
Kind off was sit on the CMP essentially the same information you just tried to enter until

169
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.010
you get it right.

170
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:55.770
So that is the reason for this particularly unique looking action code,

171
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.010
and I would explain it.

172
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.810
Firstly,

173
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.470
we have a super verbal called server,

174
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.680
which allows us to say PHP self meaning that I want this page.

175
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.070
The action should be this same page,

176
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.270
aren't so inside off action.

177
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.830
If we go back to our index page,

178
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.770
we had success that PHP,

179
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.840
which means move I had on go to the speech.

180
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.260
I want in on the circulation,

181
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.390
regardless off what this speech is called.

182
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.920
In this case,

183
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.820
it's PHP.

184
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.560
It's logging that PHP,

185
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.710
but which the server PHP self will just say.

186
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.170
Reload this page and do the posting action on this speech,

187
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:36.810
which means that we have quite a bit off quarter rise on that is actually very possible

188
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:42.860
because we can actually reload the same page on do other verifications that we did on the

189
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.150
success that PHP.

190
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.560
We can do it on the CMP to the form and then taken action afterward.

191
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.450
So that's what we'll be doing with Log in On because it will be reloading itself.

192
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:58.540
That is why I have this this block of text inside off the Value section for using him.

193
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.550
We're seeing if the request Methodists post,

194
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.140
meaning that if the pages loading because off a post action,

195
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.810
as opposed to meet us clicking the link,

196
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.580
then I want to reprint whatever using name was entered.

197
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.330
So that's why when you click submit,

198
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.650
you may see the password section blank haute notice.

199
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.510
Pastor doesn't have that same code,

200
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.510
so the pastor sexual Blanco,

201
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.200
but you use anymore email address or whatever it is is still in the textbooks waiting for

202
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.620
you to enter the card password.

203
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.850
So that's what we're trying to accomplish here with this score.

204
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.000
Um,

205
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.370
I just realized I didn't finish explaining the PHP self.

206
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.780
So where were posting back?

207
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.440
Toe the page with the pH?

208
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.200
Be self.

209
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.030
But then you notice that this entire super verb is wrapped up inside off this function.

210
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:54.230
HTML entities on what HTML entities does this kind of strip the text that is going to be

211
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.250
produced by this it strips it off any special characters and potentially militias

212
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:05.490
characters that would alot Attackers still kind off inject whatever malicious school they

213
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:05.950
could want.

214
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:11.310
So this bites of has the pH piece of the server pH piece of has some vulnerabilities that

215
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.280
can be exploited.

216
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.330
Andi ph.

217
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:13.410
B.

218
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:19.150
Has given us this function to kind off reduce the possibility off that exploitation.

219
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.610
All right,

220
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.920
so know that we have a better understanding off all of the school.

221
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.840
You can always just replay this and you can posit and go ahead and rewrite your form.

222
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.550
So there you write it just like me,

223
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.740
or you have your own way off writing it at the key parts that I want our that you get the

224
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.350
action section rate and whether the value section is actually optional.

225
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.980
We'll make sure you get the action.

226
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.000
Six generators,

227
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.750
what we're about to do this sparks is very vital.

228
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.250
All right,

229
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.280
so our next task is toe check.

230
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.030
If the data was submitted by,

231
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.530
ah form post requests.

232
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.860
So,

233
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.670
like I said,

234
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.310
we could navigate to the to the page just by clicking log in.

235
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.320
Or if I click the submit button,

236
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.690
it will also reload.

237
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.830
Say,

238
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:06.160
noses.

239
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.490
I click.

240
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.510
It is reloading the page.

241
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.220
That's because of the PHP self.

242
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:15.990
So I need to check if it was a long in button that was pressed or if I just navigated there

243
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:15.990
.

244
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:21.920
So this is another way off checking that we did it in the index page where we checked.

245
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.080
He set or did sorry in the success speech,

246
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.190
Right?

247
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.000
Sorry about that.

248
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.570
So in the success page with checked is set post submit.

249
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.850
So that's one way of green.

250
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:38.490
Another way of doing it is using or server super variable,

251
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:38.790
some,

252
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.270
actually just in the bar of this entire if statement,

253
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.120
as it does a very similar thing.

254
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.500
Except it doesn't rely on the presence off that that that value.

255
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.850
So this one relied on the father beers are post variable called submits coming over.

256
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.100
If there was no submit than this would have failed.

257
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.740
However,

258
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.980
this is far more generic.

259
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.350
Where it's seeing is there opposed?

260
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.410
I don't care about what variables may or may not be.

261
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.320
There was their request method called Post,

262
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.850
and we already told it that the method is equal to post,

263
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.350
which means once you click,

264
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.400
submit it will trigger a post.

265
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:11.870
Andi,

266
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.750
it is going toe.

267
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.210
The action is itself.

268
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.680
So no,

269
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.450
we're checking.

270
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:21.530
Is it being loaded because the submit button was pressed on then if it was,

271
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.260
that means somebody was trying to log in,

272
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.840
which means no,

273
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.690
we need to take some amount of action.

274
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.700
So the first action I want to do is get the user name on day.

275
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:36.820
I'm going to use to so string manipulation functions there,

276
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.220
some using str to lower and true.

277
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.730
So what I'm doing is removing all white spaces from the user name that is coming through

278
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.680
the post on.

279
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.760
Then I'm making everything lower key so that the chances off the user name matching in the

280
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.030
database are much higher when you kind off,

281
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.200
you know,

282
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.650
manipulated and massaged.

283
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.430
So it looks as as clean as whole.

284
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.920
You'd have stories in a bit of Eastern on,

285
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.100
then that's being stored inside off using him on.

286
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.600
Then we take the password,

287
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.300
which we want to take exactly the way it was typed.

288
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.930
So I'm not going to try toe fix the password in any way,

289
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:12.640
shape or form,

290
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.180
because this person should have type the password.

291
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.520
The exact we that it was entered into the database the first time.

292
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.950
Then I'm going to build a new password.

293
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.100
All right,

294
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.020
so I'm going to introduce any variable.

295
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.920
I'm calling it new password,

296
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.150
and we would This looks very familiar.

297
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:41.740
We're hashing the password on use any combination like we did inside off our user dot PHP

298
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.130
on.

299
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.670
The reason for this is that if we're about to check the data business,

300
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:51.480
see if the posture discourage and we can't be checking the database against the password

301
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.860
that the person would have entered in the log inform our So if I goto the log in former no

302
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:57.860
,

303
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.590
I typing,

304
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.930
admit I'm literally going to write in the word password because that's what I set my pastor

305
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.350
does.

306
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.950
However,

307
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:09.350
we know in the database that the text password is not what is stored there.

308
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.610
That is what the story there.

309
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.560
So whenever we're going to check after I click,

310
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.850
log in and I'm going to check the database.

311
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.770
I need to make sure I'm checking the hush off.

312
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.630
Whatever was entered against the hush off,

313
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.770
whatever is stored,

314
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.820
you don't want to do it,

315
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.280
Universe,

316
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.480
you don't want to try and the are on hash.

317
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.270
We switch over,

318
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:28.780
discard.

319
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.900
You don't want to decrypt the password,

320
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.600
and then try and check it against the plain text.

321
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.440
You want a hash?

322
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.550
No plain text on.

323
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.370
Then check it against what was stored.

324
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.150
The two will.

325
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.420
The two hashes should be equal.

326
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.490
And only then you will know that this user exists.

327
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.720
So having our new password,

328
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.850
the next thing is that we want to call our user objects.

329
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.180
All right.

330
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.670
So,

331
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.170
user arrow on,

332
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.280
then the function I want to call is get user.

333
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.890
All right,

334
00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.090
so let me just make sure I'm making the right function call.

335
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.510
So it's get user with the user name and password.

336
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.470
So,

337
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.270
in Logan,

338
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:11.870
I'm calling.

339
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.190
Get user with using name and password on.

340
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.410
It wouldn't be password,

341
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.310
but it would be new password.

342
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.970
All right.

343
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.320
So as the function doesn't look here If it's getting the plain text or it's getting

344
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.780
gibberish,

345
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.050
it just wants to know what he got.

346
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.550
Two parameters.

347
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.320
One for the user name and one for the password on.

348
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.890
Then it will go ahead and do its verifications where it checks to see if there's a using

349
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.470
him with that user name and password with that password,

350
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:40.120
which would be the hushed password that were passing in at this point.

351
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.530
All right,

352
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.370
so off course it's returning a result.

353
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.370
So we need toe.

354
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.550
Same result is equal to,

355
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:52.730
um there is whatever comes back after this function car on.

356
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.010
Then after we meet that function call,

357
00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:03.280
we need to see if I understand to see if not results.

358
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.350
So went through this already.

359
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.570
We can district the negative first.

360
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:15.550
So if not results meaning it's going to return was going to return falls if nothing and

361
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.430
results.

362
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:22.600
So I can I can probably modify this up it.

363
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.010
So if not results,

364
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.410
then we want toe echo.

365
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.460
If we can error.

366
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.140
So understand,

367
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.090
to put eco developer danger use anymore.

368
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.250
Password is in carats.

369
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.520
Please try again on.

370
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.090
Then I'm going to see else.

371
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.300
Andi,

372
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.800
my else is going to have me set off a session for the user.

373
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.660
So the session is already created.

374
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.030
Way started this session when we said start session.

375
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.520
Know what we need to do is set up variables inside of decision.

376
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:04.310
So our session actually gives us some super verbals that allow us to set values so I can

377
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.590
super variable session.

378
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:07.680
All right.

379
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.570
I noticed that all the superheroes have that dollar sign on the score on then our caps just

380
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.130
on the server decide the post and get etcetera.

381
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.830
But Sessional owes me to dictate what subscript I want someone to say.

382
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:20.590
User name,

383
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:28.230
session using name is going to be equal toe the value off whatever user name was just

384
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.330
authenticated.

385
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.000
All right,

386
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.110
so this is a part off the authentication.

387
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.880
So it's the using him that was very fired.

388
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.230
Rather So it's verified that it's in the database on the card pastor does provided so we

389
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.050
can create a session with that user names.

390
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.410
So this session variable will Alois the store to use any in so that we don't have to go

391
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.600
back to the database anytime we want to use the name.

392
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.340
But we can just reference decision wherever we want in our court.

393
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:53.900
All right,

394
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.880
so we create one for the user name on.

395
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.950
I'm just going to create another one.

396
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.570
Sorry.

397
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:10.940
On when to create another one for the i d so session I d is going to be equal to on.

398
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.110
We just got back results,

399
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:19.650
so I can actually just say results on Look for the subscript i d and store that inside of

400
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:19.890
that.

401
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.920
So once again,

402
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.610
our session variables are like a temporary holding era for anything that we want on.

403
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.420
We can let them persists throughout users sessions.

404
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.370
All right on.

405
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:32.610
Then,

406
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.840
after we verified the user and we set up the session,

407
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:45.630
the next thing we want to do is reall redirect our user from the log in page on someone to

408
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.990
see Loki Shun Colon and then my destination.

409
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:54.310
Let's just save you records dot PHP are.

410
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.540
So once this user is verified on decision is created,

411
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.090
then we can redirect them.

412
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.560
So the view records that PHP.

413
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.090
All right,

414
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.780
So know that we've done all of this work.

415
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.780
Let's see if our cold,

416
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.060
you know,

417
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.220
it's test our theory as we always do.

418
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.280
So we have the log in page.

419
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:23.640
And the expectation is that when I stop in admin Onda password then click logging that we

420
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.340
should be verified against the database on,

421
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.900
then redirected toe our view records that 50.

422
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.800
So when I do that and click log in,

423
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.900
we were redirected.

424
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.680
So it happens that lining fast.

425
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.640
You didn't even know that all of the core that we just wrote actually came into play.

426
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.850
So what happened is when I click Duggan,

427
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.780
he reloaded itself.

428
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.100
The page reloaded itself on then at the top of the page or the sea.

429
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.060
Is it opposed?

430
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.310
Yes,

431
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.660
it is.

432
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.930
Our ads Get me the user.

433
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.850
Name the password.

434
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.900
Hash the password Check if there is a user on.

435
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.810
If there is,

436
00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:04.210
then we when we do all this fancy nous So on the flip side,

437
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.170
I'm going toe.

438
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.900
Go back to logging on.

439
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.520
I'm going to put in a user that doesn't exist.

440
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.360
Alright on then.

441
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.210
When I click log in,

442
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.080
we see that the page loads.

443
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.720
We get this alert.

444
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.920
Seeing used a name or password is incorrect because we put in that statement that if not

445
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.350
results meaning we didn't get back anything positive from this call,

446
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.500
then we just want on alert that is using a more possible using parts.

447
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.460
Generally speaking,

448
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.470
you don't want to tell them which one is encouraged because you don't want to solve half

449
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.530
proposal for them,

450
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.000
right?

451
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.020
So we just give them that alert on If you notice that the user name value that was typed in

452
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:48.510
remains inside of the text box on that's because off what we did here with the value if it

453
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:56.820
is opposed action then reprints the user name value that is there aren't so that is part

454
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.320
one off our battle solved.

455
00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.740
Now,

456
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.920
another quick model we need to do to me is to change this logging.

457
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.150
So I have lugging.

458
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.420
And if I'm love being this textiles and changes,

459
00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:14.500
I want to contextually show the word logging or the link to logging versus hello user name

460
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.240
and a logo.

461
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:22.460
But so I'm going to go back to my header that PHP file on guy actually started that process

462
00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.160
already where I have the lugging link.

463
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:33.230
But what I'm going to do is wrap it are owned on if statement that is going to check to see

464
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.770
if the session exists,

465
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.750
are not so we know how to check if something exists.

466
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.680
Um,

467
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.030
first,

468
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.550
then went to fire up a little Ph b block.

469
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.300
All right,

470
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.040
we know we need those for your statements on.

471
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.730
Then we see if on we shouldn't know that to check your something exists are not so I'm

472
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.140
going to say not is set.

473
00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.830
All right,

474
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.280
so I'm checking if the session does not exist.

475
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.130
Alright,

476
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.300
so I'm going to see session Super variable Onda.

477
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:08.760
Uh,

478
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.740
I have idea of using him,

479
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.900
so I know that my decisions that I'm creating inside off my logging are using him.

480
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.320
Andi,

481
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.380
I'd be all right,

482
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.770
so I can check against either one.

483
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:25.620
Because the only time these get created is when somebody has been verifying in the database

484
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:25.620
.

485
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.680
Andi gets passed along.

486
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.180
All right,

487
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.000
so in the header file,

488
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.270
I'm just going to say if there is no session by the name off idee and I'm not going to

489
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.470
qualify this a bit more,

490
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.820
I shouldn't say idea what to say,

491
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:39.290
user,

492
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:39.770
I d.

493
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.010
All right,

494
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:46.690
So there is no session by the name user I d or whatever you call it your session,

495
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.400
Then I want to take an action.

496
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.650
Someone to kind off butcher of this speech being called?

497
00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:54.830
No.

498
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.660
So this statement is going to say me the chick.

499
00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.960
All right,

500
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.900
Andi on.

501
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.990
Then I'm going to print my anchor tug.

502
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.280
So if there is no session,

503
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.610
I want to print the anchor tag.

504
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:14.680
And then after close that after open up another PHP block.

505
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.340
Just the clothes that that open brace.

506
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.280
All right,

507
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.200
so this opened This girl's brings much is this one,

508
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.610
so that's just going to be wrapped up.

509
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.170
So there are many ways he could that you could have just called this line by itself.

510
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:28.740
That's fine.

511
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.210
But then if you have quite a few uncle tiles and so on echoing,

512
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.270
they might get tedious.

513
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.870
So that's why I didn't choose that route.

514
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.320
So if the session does not exist,

515
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:47.450
then display the log in on then I'm going to see else and then open up another.

516
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:53.240
If will calibri early brace block which understand too close.

517
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.610
Same time because I don't want to forget.

518
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.360
All right,

519
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.100
Ana,

520
00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.240
put in the wrong.

521
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.420
All right,

522
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:07.330
so the else is goingto happen between this speech B block on this speech.

523
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.010
We all right?

524
00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.630
So that's between 9 30 It online for two right now.

525
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.280
What do we want to display?

526
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.100
So once again,

527
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:14.810
we're checking.

528
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.800
If the session does not exist,

529
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.690
then we want to display the lugging.

530
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.750
If it does exist,

531
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.360
then I don't want to display the log in button.

532
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.270
Instead,

533
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.880
I would probably display the anchor tug on.

534
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.770
This one is going to say log boat about PHP.

535
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:45.540
So it's a law goat on Kurtag for it on going to display some block off text and I'm putting

536
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:52.440
it in a spun Spanta is a nice way to just inject some text somewhere on.

537
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.810
I'm going to say hello on day.

538
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:02.880
Using him that I want is going to be stored inside of the session using names to remember

539
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.640
that in log in,

540
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.820
we created a session variable with using him.

541
00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.510
So instead of me having to go to the database every time after this to find out what the

542
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.370
user name is,

543
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.620
I can just use this value toe,

544
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.670
represent using him,

545
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:20.670
So I'm just going toe span Hello on den.

546
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.680
Put in a quick PHP.

547
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.440
So that's a great thing about PHP blocks.

548
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.290
We can just insert them almost anywhere on dime saying hello.

549
00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:38.170
And I went to echo whatever value is inside off the and the session using him on the I

550
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.170
understand to put an exclamation saying after this.

551
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:41.760
So,

552
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.400
in other words,

553
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.800
it should print Hello.

554
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800
Hello?

555
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.400
I mean,

556
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.930
with an exclamation side Pirates and all of that would be inside the spun on the spine

557
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.950
would be adjacent to the law global.

558
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.290
So we haven't created the logo peed just yet,

559
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.810
But let's see if that makes any difference.

560
00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:59.230
Understand?

561
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.130
To re fresh.

562
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.200
All right,

563
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.810
um,

564
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.030
going to try and log in.

565
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:04.850
I mean,

566
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.710
password again.

567
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.660
All right,

568
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.630
so we see that we're getting some amount of action.

569
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:13.570
It's not elegant,

570
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.530
but we see Hello.

571
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.660
We see admin and we see a logo put.

572
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.530
All right,

573
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.930
so we can go back and style Hello and admin.

574
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:25.180
But I'm going to create the logo button first just to make sure that we have our bases

575
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:25.790
covered.

576
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.470
So I'm going to I have loved in the PHP understand?

577
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:30.690
To create a new file.

578
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.080
Call it logoed start PHP.

579
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.130
Andi just went ahead and put in the court.

580
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:44.860
So the lago dot PHP is really a simple page you don't need any header and footer and so on

581
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:44.860
,

582
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:50.000
so that the cool thing is that we created that session that PHP we have to include the

583
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.580
session.

584
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.340
All right,

585
00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:57.220
so I can just included directly without having the header there aren't on.

586
00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.850
Then I need to call the function that's his session.

587
00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:01.450
Destroy.

588
00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.960
So we started session session start,

589
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.870
and then we have toe destroyed.

590
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.420
So it's irony that we have to start the session that destroyed.

591
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.170
But the good thing is that once a session,

592
00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:11.920
it started.

593
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.720
If this is called a second time,

594
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.870
will know it was started.

595
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.080
So that's why we have to call it here.

596
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.260
So it knows that okay,

597
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.280
a session is already in progress on.

598
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.240
Then it will destroy whatever station is in progress on,

599
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.100
then just relocate Ari directors.

600
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:35.160
So the index ph are so if I go ahead and click law goats than expectations that this entire

601
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.330
section is going to see Hello,

602
00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:38.110
admin.

603
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.970
Sorry,

604
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.660
It's going to see a log in once again.

605
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.300
And there we go.

606
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.870
So log in is restored,

607
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:50.890
we click log in and we go ahead and put in a user that exists Admin password log in and

608
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.260
then we get a context to a 1,000,000.

609
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.090
So that's a nice,

610
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.310
quick way to get up context.

611
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:02.640
Your menu on that menu will exist for every other page until we click Love boats.

612
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.270
All right,

613
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.720
Alright.

614
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.800
So back in the header file,

615
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.930
I just made a quick change where I replicated that same on Qatar.

616
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:11.550
Glink.

617
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.750
So instead of having our span for one said and then the appetite for another said,

618
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:22.640
I just included the same uncle talk and I put that span takes inside off the anchor tug on

619
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:30.160
then in the e True if I just made it on us with the hashtag sits a dead link.

620
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.980
All right,

621
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.120
so then when the many lords,

622
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.790
then we see it's it looks more sensible than it did before,

623
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.170
All right,

624
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.040
And even for cricket,

625
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.670
nothing happens.

626
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.640
There is a link,

627
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.250
but love boat still works.

628
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:42.790
All right,

629
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:49.780
so that concludes our first or second part off setting up our user authentication after

630
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.850
this organ to start.

631
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.550
Actually,

632
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:56.670
Tung Ping Doan on which pages require log in Ondo,

633
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.090
which ones Don's
