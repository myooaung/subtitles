00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Hey,

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.740
guys,

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.470
In this video,

4
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.440
we will continue our path towards creating a full crowd application in PHP.

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.720
And today we will be looking at how we can go about seeing records that have been submitted

6
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.690
to the database.

7
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.230
By way off recap,

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.130
we would have created a database called attendance DB On inside off attenders db we have a

9
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.010
table called attendee,

10
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.720
which is where our records for each attendee will be stored,

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.860
meaning each person who registers on this page should get stored in this database once they

12
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.250
click.

13
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.550
Submit now to accomplish this,

14
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.170
what I'm going to do is add enough bar to the top off this page,

15
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.050
which will allow me to navigate to another page to view all the records,

16
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.950
someone to go to bootstrap dot com and see what they have in store for me for nuff bars.

17
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.440
So I go to get bootstrap dot com on die go to components in their documentation on knave

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.730
bar.

19
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.830
And here I see some sample code for enough bar.

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.950
And if I scroll by,

21
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.050
I can see the different options available to me.

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.890
Someone to go with this snuff buyer ally.

23
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.510
The way it looks.

24
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.710
It simply enough on the court.

25
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.430
Looks simple enough to understand.

26
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.820
Understand,

27
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.240
to copy it on because this is enough.

28
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.270
By that I want to show up on every single page in this application.

29
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.750
I'm going to add it to the header file in my project.

30
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.590
So remember that header should be above everything and whatever goes in the head of means

31
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.330
that that it's at the top off the beaches,

32
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.740
at the top,

33
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.240
off any each in a document I gets rendered.

34
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.220
So if I add enough by here,

35
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.050
the expectation is that every page that includes Hitter will have the nut bar being

36
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.730
displayed.

37
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.450
So I just fixed mine up my indentation and then we're just going to go back to the

38
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.050
documentation underside on dissected of it.

39
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.290
So you see here that they're opening a tug called Nav,

40
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.900
and we have a few classes,

41
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.040
a few classes that kind of give it some character RBG dash lights so that music can change

42
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.520
what color scheme we want.

43
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.090
We can look at that later on.

44
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.770
Then we see that they have enough bar dash brand,

45
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.040
which is a word and have bar so we can change that someone to go back and change that in my

46
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.510
court from Nav bar Toe I t conference.

47
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.970
All right.

48
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.800
On DSO Usually this is the name of your sites,

49
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.090
right?

50
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.550
So similarly,

51
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.800
they would have used the same court in their sights on But instead of using a word,

52
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.870
they use their local.

53
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.890
So whatever website you're building,

54
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.390
you can put the logo in this section or just the word off the name off the website.

55
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.710
Now,

56
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.920
this section with the button,

57
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.950
what it does is create those nav bar pills.

58
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.290
So if I reduced this in size,

59
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.830
toe the size off,

60
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.710
maybe a mobile device and you see this happening here on,

61
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.450
that's what we usually see on a mobile phone.

62
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.130
So by using bootstrap,

63
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.570
we have already got gotten what you call a responsive website on DSO that called that bit

64
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.000
of court.

65
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.410
Therefore,

66
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.880
the button it actually is responsible for making the enough bar pills.

67
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.080
That's what they're called on.

68
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.040
Then moving on this Dave,

69
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.560
which is collapsible C c.

70
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.610
That he says collapse.

71
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.070
So if you take all these classes,

72
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.580
I'm sure I can guarantee you that if you modify these class differences as they're here in

73
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.350
the example,

74
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.630
they're not by will not behave the way bootstrap would have intended it.

75
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.870
Toe.

76
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.140
So advise you if you're going to make changes to these classes.

77
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.160
Be very careful and you should be very,

78
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.010
very deliberate.

79
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.540
So this section hoses all off the links on you see that?

80
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.370
They're just regular Uncle Tax.

81
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.550
So there's nothing release fancy about them.

82
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.310
So we need to do is change the name that is being displayed.

83
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.190
The name off the link Onda also the trip.

84
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.600
So we're going to do that quickly with over website.

85
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.200
So right now we will have Well,

86
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.640
we have one page but by the end of this video,

87
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.730
we should have at least two someone to leave to here on day.

88
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.490
I leave this as home because form is aching to index So I leave that they're on the air.

89
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:05.150
Traf will be index dot PHP So any time somebody clicks the home link in the nav bar,

90
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.800
it should goto index dot PHP on.

91
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.200
In addition to that,

92
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.350
I'm going to use the same link inside off this uncle talk for the for the logo or the

93
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.390
branding section.

94
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.430
I had enough by brand.

95
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.810
So you know it is that this is also an ankle tag.

96
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.050
So if we go back to Bootstrap,

97
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.440
their logo is actually clickable.

98
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.910
If I click,

99
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.340
this little weight goes back to their homepage.

100
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.600
So that is the kind of behavior I want.

101
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.330
Similarly,

102
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.710
there's ah,

103
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.250
home one.

104
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.240
So my enough bar will have a conference which,

105
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.730
if clicked,

106
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.740
will reload index on also ah,

107
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.280
link that says home,

108
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.710
which,

109
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.370
when clicked,

110
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.430
will reload the index page on then my next page.

111
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.550
I'm going to make it save you attendees.

112
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.950
So the expectation is that when I click this snuff by link,

113
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.650
I'm going to see all off the persons who will be attending my conference on the Since I'm

114
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.880
here,

115
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.490
I'll just see that the HF should be view records dot PHP.

116
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.680
So that means I need to create a page for this uncle talked to Navigator.

117
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.910
So I'm going to go back to my explorer Pain.

118
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.520
Andi,

119
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.430
I have Index,

120
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.250
I have success.

121
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:25.280
PHP I'm just going to add a new file and I want to call this one view records dot PHP I

122
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.060
know we have ah,

123
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.440
new blank file and then off course,

124
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.870
the first thing that we want to do,

125
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.430
and I'm just going to go back to index on kind off,

126
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.350
bar the cord from here.

127
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.670
I wanted to look uniforms understand to include the header on the connection on I'm also

128
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.760
going to include My Footer as well as some BR tags to put some distance between the content

129
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.380
on the footer.

130
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.970
All right,

131
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.510
so once we have done those changes,

132
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.250
we can go ahead and refresh your page on.

133
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.080
We see that now we have enough bar on because it's using the light team.

134
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.500
I don't know if it's very visible for you,

135
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.010
so we can change that.

136
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.780
Or the fact is,

137
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.500
we have the Nuff buyer showing.

138
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.860
And then if we click this,

139
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.850
it really is the home page of foot to calm.

140
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.650
It's the same thing.

141
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.310
If I click view attendees,

142
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.160
then we navigate away on you.

143
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.310
See that enough buyer is still in place.

144
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.070
So looking at these examples,

145
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.210
I can see that I have not Barn of Bar Dash Dark and BG.

146
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.160
That's primary someone to go back to my enough barcoding hitter on.

147
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.330
I'm going to make a few modifications on which is enough bar dash darks on B g dash primary

148
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.340
on.

149
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.940
That's because I want my enough bar to be blue.

150
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.650
So when I refreshed my page,

151
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.550
I get my nav bar being blue on my links clearly visible,

152
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.790
so know that we have created our new page.

153
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:59.100
We need to change the title so that the carts title will appear in our title bar in our

154
00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.660
browser.

155
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:07.270
But the next big step is to modify our or crowd files so that we can start interacting with

156
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.740
the data that we we intend to for the speech.

157
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.910
No,

158
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.830
for this speech,

159
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.530
we are going to be working on the air out of crowed.

160
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.140
Remember,

161
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.190
crowd is create,

162
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.620
read,

163
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.080
update,

164
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.280
delete when you're viewing fuzzier,

165
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.090
reading or retrieving the files so I can go to the crowd on I'm going toe the crowd final

166
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.590
story and then we're going to They find a brand new function.

167
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.610
So we already have a function that is dealing with inserting data.

168
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.830
I'm going to create another function,

169
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.900
someone to follow the same pattern public function on.

170
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.350
Then we will say,

171
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.750
get attendees.

172
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.550
So your function,

173
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.120
your function name should always be kind off indicative off what is happening.

174
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.420
So I'm actually going toe qualify.

175
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.900
This one is really insert attendees so that nobody would ever wonder what I'm inserting

176
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.290
when they see this functions.

177
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.970
If I change the function name here that I need to make sure that all references to this

178
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:11.180
function Archie is also start as quickly hop over to my success page,

179
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.330
which is where I made reference to it and change it from inserts the US insert attendees

180
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.950
are so backed or crowd page,

181
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.060
we are defining a phone son that says,

182
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.170
Get attendees on.

183
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.340
Then,

184
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.740
inside this function,

185
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.720
I am going to execute a quarry that is responsible for bringing back the attendees.

186
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.300
Now,

187
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.830
if you want some help knowing how that would look,

188
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.170
if you go back to PHP my admin and click on their 10 de table,

189
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.750
then you actually see that when they go to Breaux's,

190
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:48.000
they actually give you what the select statement looks like to get back everything inside

191
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.040
off your database.

192
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.880
Onda.

193
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.950
We can actually click on this create peach V chord over to the right hand side here,

194
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.670
and they actually give you that inside of a very was understand the company,

195
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.450
so this isn't really necessary.

196
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.350
It's just a guy,

197
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.150
but it doesn't help.

198
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.550
It doesn't hurt to have some help.

199
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.500
The next thing we want to do is create a variable,

200
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.280
and I'm going to call it result on the value off result is going to be this.

201
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.770
Remember,

202
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:20.680
this is our object for our con or crude that PHP file on the arrow operator toe,

203
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.550
Get the private.

204
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:28.360
The private variable that was declared here that is going to embody our connection to the

205
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.170
database.

206
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.620
So we're getting this d b r o operator on.

207
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.260
Then we're going to execute the quarry.

208
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:43.210
So it does say this DB query on dime went to pass in the actual clarify our query,

209
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.370
that joke worry which is in this variable called sq.

210
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.790
Well,

211
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:54.710
this this function is going to just return whatever comes back in results.

212
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.190
Okay,

213
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.680
Looking good.

214
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.550
So far,

215
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:03.040
the next step is to start wiring up our view record speech to actually show these records.

216
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.340
Now,

217
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.320
the most common way to show records is in a table.

218
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.230
Thb and tables.

219
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.560
They have a love affair.

220
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.210
So the first thing I want to do is actually create a table that would kind of have all the

221
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.760
columns that we need to see foreign attendee on.

222
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:26.660
We are going to write some court that is going to dynamically generate these rose for the

223
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.220
attendees.

224
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.900
So in other words,

225
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.130
we're going to have a table.

226
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.820
Some of it is going to be static,

227
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.990
the design part.

228
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.780
But then we want to dynamic a legendary terrible for each for each attendee,

229
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.340
because we don't want the money while they sit down and write the semaphore.

230
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:40.930
Each attendee,

231
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.070
that's almost impossible.

232
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.850
If you have over 1000 attendees,

233
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.150
I want to quickly do a table tag.

234
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.580
All right,

235
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:56.000
so this is some BC gauge steam out here table and then inside or table.

236
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.440
We always have a TR tug,

237
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.700
and I'm going to open and close it in two separate lines.

238
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.740
Andi,

239
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.490
before you can have any column,

240
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.360
you have to have a rule.

241
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.980
So that's just the pattern that that HTML tables come in.

242
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:18.100
So in the first TR tug what we're goingto have our table hitters because those will be like

243
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.250
the titles for each column.

244
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.960
So in inside this tr time,

245
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.740
want tohave td Andi,

246
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:33.550
I'm going to basically just replicate all off the columns from the database.

247
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.540
So if I take a look at the table that is generated,

248
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:43.480
this is actually just a table are on then These are the column headings per per well per

249
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.120
column that is in the table.

250
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.390
So off course,

251
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.730
we don't want to print back first name with no space as it is in the database.

252
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.600
So we can actually putting our design hats on,

253
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:05.910
put in readable or more user friendly column headings inside off for HTML pages.

254
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.450
So I'm just going to go ahead and do that for each column that's in the database.

255
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.290
All right,

256
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.490
So I just after finishing all of them are allies I'm using t d.

257
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.550
I should be using T.

258
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.130
H.

259
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.910
So if you're using TD apologizes,

260
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.910
should be using t it.

261
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.150
So just change out all off the TDs into th All right?

262
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.160
So th means stable header where STD means table data.

263
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.340
So for the headers,

264
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.510
when you say th you automatically gets like a it stands out.

265
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:32.880
All right.

266
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.890
So teach has a different function from TD on.

267
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.410
Then I'm going to do off a sample roar.

268
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.850
Just a show what our data needs to look like.

269
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.180
All right.

270
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.330
So I did sample rules that has created another rule,

271
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:51.060
and I just put in some sample values just to show you what our table or put is going to

272
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.470
look like.

273
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.930
So when I go back to my website and have you attendees,

274
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.160
this is what is going to look like.

275
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.640
You're just going to see this table looking that this But this isn't very This doesn't look

276
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.240
like a table at all.

277
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.950
It is not very attractive on that is,

278
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.350
in part because I'm not using any bootstrap classes.

279
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.870
So I'm just going toe head on over to Bootstrap,

280
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.420
See what?

281
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.120
They have four tables,

282
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.840
and you can find that by clicking content on tables on.

283
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.310
Then you see that in their court example,

284
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.900
they have a class four tables called tables,

285
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.360
Understand?

286
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.790
To make her friends of this glass here.

287
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.830
Andi,

288
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.640
I'm just going to add it to my existing table,

289
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.270
in my view,

290
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.180
record speech.

291
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.810
And they don't want to refresh and watch the magic.

292
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.570
All right,

293
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:40.120
so now you see that it's no kind of justified from left to right on.

294
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.400
We get a little line.

295
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.670
So if you want it with more flair you can always idea on CSS students and they actually

296
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.050
have other options.

297
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.360
You can get a dark table if you want.

298
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.690
You can get one where the table head is kind of defined.

299
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.900
You can get stripes seeking it.

300
00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.820
Ah,

301
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.110
whole bunch of things so you can personalize it.

302
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.490
You add on the other classes that you want,

303
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.180
Andi make it yours.

304
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.180
But for no well,

305
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.550
we just satisfy with referencing table.

306
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.480
All right,

307
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.710
so I just realized that was one column shorts.

308
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.790
I just fixed it on there.

309
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.420
That's better.

310
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.820
So at the end of the day,

311
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.470
this is what our table needs to look like.

312
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.650
But each role here would be the attendees data.

313
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.360
So back in our view,

314
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.300
record speech,

315
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.670
We're going to go ahead and declare a variable on.

316
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.530
I'm going to call it are.

317
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:31.860
Well,

318
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.110
that's That's right.

319
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:40.500
It Our results on the value off results is going to be whatever is returned from over get

320
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.040
attendees function.

321
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.130
So recall that we can always reference these functions by using or crowd object,

322
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.700
which is defined in our con file.

323
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.980
So crowd once Khan is included on a page,

324
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.160
we have access to this object And once you have access to this object,

325
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.290
we have access to every single function that is defined in that class.

326
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.310
So I'm going to say,

327
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.470
crowd arrow,

328
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.090
get attendees.

329
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:13.350
So back to my V records results is going to be equal to crude.

330
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.120
And then my arrow operator on,

331
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.650
then get attendees.

332
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:26.180
So remember that this former sun is returning the values on the results from that SQL

333
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.950
statement.

334
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:27.990
With that done,

335
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.250
we're going to start exploring hole pH.

336
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.650
B helps us the dynamically generate HTML.

337
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.260
So I'm going to remove my some parole on I'm going to replace this block.

338
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.170
Firstly,

339
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.100
with a PHP tag on in this speech Beetle,

340
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.950
I'm going to write a while loop,

341
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.200
so we're going to see a while and then,

342
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.530
ah,

343
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.450
while you take some condition,

344
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.780
I'm going to say our,

345
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.650
which is an arbitrary value,

346
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.630
is equal toe result.

347
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:02.250
So result is what were the results is what we defined up here.

348
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.450
So results and,

349
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:04.550
um,

350
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.350
when she's my roo operator on a keyword,

351
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.060
Fetch on,

352
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.510
then inside off this,

353
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.510
I'm going to say PD or colon colon,

354
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.190
fetch A s s l c.

355
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:24.330
I guess that's association short for association So let me explain what's happening here.

356
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:30.920
So this speech B block can be inserted into anybody off html off course he can't inserted

357
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.540
without wrapping it in PHP.

358
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.550
So I just inserted this speech we block inside off my table.

359
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.730
Onda,

360
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:46.130
I'm creating a while loop where I am going to see Give me do this operation for each Itim

361
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.550
inside off this collection.

362
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:53.270
So when results comes back from this in line it when results comes back after getting all

363
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:53.900
that in these,

364
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.850
it's going to be like an area is going to have a bunch off results,

365
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:02.330
something for each thing that came back inside off this results variable,

366
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.990
let's are embody that value.

367
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:10.340
So then we're going to say for each value we want to generate our rule.

368
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.470
So this wire loop well,

369
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.840
of course,

370
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.010
no.

371
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.530
While it is complete without its quotation.

372
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.190
Sorry,

373
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.410
it's braces.

374
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.370
So I'm going to use just the open breeze here,

375
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:29.190
and then you're going to see that this speech B block is no screaming because it's saying

376
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.610
that the previous the previous Peachtree Block has incurred court.

377
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.920
But we'll fix that later on.

378
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.740
So what I'm going to do just the same time is actually a clear another Ph.

379
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:49.750
B block on this PHP block is going to have the sole purpose off closing this wire loop.

380
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.660
So I'm opening it in one,

381
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.050
and I'm closing it in another.

382
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.980
And you can observe that the syntax no,

383
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.850
is that he's because it's a okay.

384
00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:58.270
All right,

385
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.090
I see what you did there.

386
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.870
He opened it in one PHP block and closes in on the in another PHP block.

387
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:04.590
No,

388
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.490
this is really cool,

389
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:10.690
because remember that anything that's not previously or inside of a PHP block is going to

390
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.560
be HTML.

391
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.310
So I'm seeing that while this loop is running,

392
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.630
I want to be doing something.

393
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.210
And what I want to be doing is generating a t r.

394
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.900
And I'm just went,

395
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.060
Oh,

396
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:30.590
open and close this TR on every t r has TDs.

397
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:37.240
So for each time or each record that I'm going to be getting back when I up do this

398
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.030
operation,

399
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:45.330
I want to generate a new rule in my table on each rule should have a TV,

400
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.630
someone to create.

401
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.360
I'm just going to duplicate the number of TV's I Need,

402
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:56.440
which is 1234567 So I'm just going to duplicate this on then.

403
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.660
Each TD is supposed to have a value coming back from the database.

404
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.350
So inside off the TD,

405
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.250
I'm goingto have toe echo this value of coming back from the database.

406
00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.560
Remember,

407
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:13.020
the only way to get the value from the database is to use this are this are variable that

408
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.360
we just defined.

409
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.120
So once again,

410
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:22.250
each time that the loop ITER it's is going to store our results from the set of results

411
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.940
inside off our on then through are we can actually reference whatever value.

412
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:36.320
But the only way to get that value in here is to put in a PHP block Onda We have toe EC or

413
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.870
the value from the variable.

414
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.880
So we're going toe echo on,

415
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.900
we say dollars saying are on.

416
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.880
Then remember that this is going to be like an ar e.

417
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.800
So this is an area off Ari's,

418
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.120
because one we're fitting all the results.

419
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.960
So think off all the results coming back from the database as an area or from the table as

420
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.050
honoree on.

421
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:02.180
Then each column formulates on entry into the area.

422
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.900
So the same way we could have accessed data using over a little just about to success

423
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.220
speech.

424
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:15.460
Be the same way the post variable loaders toe access each ari subscript using the name or

425
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:22.590
are value here actually allows is the access each columns value using the name of the

426
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.270
column as the sub scripts Understand to say our square bracket on in single quotation.

427
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.580
Specify the column.

428
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:35.080
So my column was actually attendance I d or a 10 B.

429
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:42.500
I actually attendee on the score idea can just double check with PHP My admin on?

430
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:42.780
Yes,

431
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.070
it was.

432
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.050
Attendee,

433
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.690
underscore I d.

434
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:52.670
So each off these columns can be accessed through this arbitrary this abstract value that

435
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.430
we created on it can be accord wherever we want.

436
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.610
So what we want to do is that for every record that is there,

437
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.890
we want to echo whatever body was stored.

438
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.740
So I know we only have one record,

439
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.840
but by the end of this video,

440
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.970
we should be able to add at least two more records,

441
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.680
see them in the database and see them on this speech.

442
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.050
So I'm just going to repeat this treatment.

443
00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.080
I can just copy this cord on I'm going to go into pace it,

444
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.180
and I'm going to write back the corresponding value per column hitter that I would have

445
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.620
defined.

446
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.140
So the next column hitter should be getting the first name value,

447
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.510
so I'll just see first name,

448
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.160
Since that's the name off the column in the database on,

449
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.880
I'm going to repeat that for each off the other columns that need data.

450
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.530
So just to recap once again,

451
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:44.430
what we've done is create a while loop and inside the while we're seeing that for each time

452
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.540
it's iterations.

453
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:51.470
We want to bring back the record in the form off available called Are On.

454
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.270
Then we're going to print oh to the different sub.

455
00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:01.000
Scripts from this are variable inside the different table Dita spaces per rule.

456
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.010
So when I mean these changes and save and refresh,

457
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.930
this is what my patients like on.

458
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.100
I'm seeing Mary's record on.

459
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.560
Well,

460
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:15.120
we're going to fix the date off birth value situation here on then we're seeing each thing

461
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.120
,

462
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.120
and we also need to address the fact that only three is going back for specialty.

463
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.760
So let's put our form to the test,

464
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.180
understand?

465
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.310
To click on my navigation bar Homelink to go back home on.

466
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.540
Then I'm going to put in Agnes Walters.

467
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.470
Andi,

468
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:36.760
see what happens when we so me turn information to the data bees.

469
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.510
So when I do all of this fellow the former and click submits,

470
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.270
I see that,

471
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.830
OK,

472
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.900
you have been registered.

473
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.450
So we know that our database connection is working on.

474
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.290
We're reprinting her values,

475
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.730
going back from the post values.

476
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.990
But then when I go to view attendees,

477
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:59.470
I actually see her information newly added to the table because she is no in our database.

478
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.600
So just the very fact.

479
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.770
And go back to my database and click bro's again on.

480
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.150
Then it will populate it with her new record.

481
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:06.280
So,

482
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.750
no,

483
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:11.660
we're inserting records and were able to view them in our website.

484
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.900
Now there are two things that we need to fix one.

485
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.510
It's the date off birth.

486
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:21.340
We notice that it's going over a 00000 even though we clearly selected at it on the second

487
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.430
thing is specialty.

488
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.580
So I start with specialty because then it kind of ties into what we're doing.

489
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:26.960
No.

490
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:34.960
So the situation with specialties is that we have a table specifically designed for

491
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.540
specialty.

492
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.430
So if I go back to pee stream admin,

493
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.780
click on specialties,

494
00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.460
I'm going to see that I have at least one special details.

495
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.290
The i D three on database Adminis admit as a value,

496
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.410
no years may not be three years,

497
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:48.430
maybe one years maybe,

498
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.600
too.

499
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.410
It depends.

500
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:49.770
All right,

501
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:53.120
on you may have added more or you may have fewer.

502
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.330
So I'm adjustment to insert as many specialties here in the database as I actually have in

503
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.390
my drop down list.

504
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:05.590
So remember to insert all we really need to do is put in the name on dso.

505
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:13.070
Just remind myself the specialties that we advertised were software developer,

506
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.250
Web administrator and others.

507
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:15.760
I'm just went,

508
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:15.980
Oh,

509
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.630
go ahead.

510
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.330
And at these on by conflict go.

511
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.210
All right.

512
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.900
And then it's showing me the actual insert statements.

513
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.720
I'm just going toe,

514
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.640
modify this insert statement and just enter other at the same time.

515
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:27.950
Oh,

516
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.470
it's saying that authority did it.

517
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.490
So I'm just going to remove this on.

518
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.160
I'm just going to use this same statement to do other.

519
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.610
All right?

520
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.320
So that's why reading is important because it did it already,

521
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.910
and I almost did it again.

522
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.240
So I'm just going to go ahead and click goal on one more Royce insurgents.

523
00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.790
When I look in the specialty stable,

524
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:52.630
I know have all four of my specialties on you don't just at the ideas here are because,

525
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.870
well,

526
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.460
I'm jumping from 3 to 5 for whatever reason it's keeping for.

527
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.610
But the point is,

528
00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:58.500
in your system,

529
00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.980
you might have different numbers than I do so in my video,

530
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.390
where I would have hard coded the option value off.

531
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.070
Three.

532
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.210
That is not the best way to do this,

533
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.750
because we want to dynamic a legendary it on option,

534
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.900
her specialty.

535
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.470
So if you had five specialties,

536
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.850
then you should be generating five options.

537
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:21.650
I only have four.

538
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:27.280
If you had 10 then your your experience or your users experience shouldn't be tied to my

539
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.540
own.

540
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.950
So I'm going to write some cord that is going to actually query my specialty stable on

541
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.320
generate the options,

542
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:41.300
her record in the table as well as actually modifying,

543
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.360
sitting the value according to whatever i d.

544
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.550
It's had in the database.

545
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.550
So,

546
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.020
as usual,

547
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:53.080
the first place I'm going to go because I have a database operation to carry out is crude

548
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.980
on I'm going toe Create a new function,

549
00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.860
public function.

550
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.500
And I'm calling this one Get specialties on,

551
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.770
then get specialties is actually going to look very similar to get attendees.

552
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.940
Because all I want is all the specialties and all the columns.

553
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.350
Understand?

554
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.530
To copy this score on,

555
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:20.260
I'm going to re freeze the SQL statement from attendee toe specialties so know that we have

556
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.590
defined a function,

557
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.670
get specialties.

558
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:29.770
We can go back to our index speech on actually repeat similar steps where we have some

559
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.430
variable called results on.

560
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:37.220
We're going to call our function inside off our crude operator.

561
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.570
Get specialties.

562
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:44.170
No,

563
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:49.410
We're going to modify over select control where we're going to actually take all the hard

564
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.490
coded options on.

565
00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.190
We're going to repeat what we did with our while.

566
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.480
Oops.

567
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.830
I'm going to declare a Ph B block on inside this Ph B block.

568
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:05.580
I'm going to say a while some arbitrary value and I'm calling it are once again on that.

569
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.070
I'm going to see results are oh,

570
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.350
fetch.

571
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.170
And that's PD or colon Colon.

572
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.760
Fetch association on.

573
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.860
Then I went toe open my calibrates on,

574
00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.760
then I'm going to just close it at the same time so that I don't forget.

575
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.000
So that's very important.

576
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.240
Guys never forget to close your current embraces.

577
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.160
Sometimes you,

578
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.880
me get carried away with the court,

579
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.550
and he really didn't remember to close it.

580
00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.710
And because of former scored,

581
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.610
happens in between you,

582
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.880
you don't realise,

583
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.040
and it spent always be Buoying over this,

584
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.180
so it's good to this open and close the same time.

585
00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:49.880
So what we want here is to actually generate an option tug for each rule coming back from

586
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.950
our specialty stable someone to declare my option.

587
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.870
Onda close it,

588
00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.390
so I really only need to do one option because it's a template and it's just going to

589
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.630
repeat it for each recorder on.

590
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:08.840
Then what I want in between option for the printed value is the PHP tag.

591
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.910
Where I'm going to echo are on.

592
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:17.770
What I want to echo from our is the value in the column name,

593
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.190
so that's what this option tag will look like.

594
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.200
But there's one more thing.

595
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.800
We also needed the value,

596
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.280
so we need the value,

597
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.710
which should be the same value as what would be in our database table.

598
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.630
So the i d in the databases,

599
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:32.780
what the value should be.

600
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.140
So I'm going to say value equals once again,

601
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.640
I'm going to Well,

602
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.610
I'm actually just want to be clear.

603
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.530
Put quotation marks,

604
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.910
but I have to use my Ph b tug on.

605
00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:51.840
I'm going to have to echo are on whatever value is in i d.

606
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.090
So let's look at this again.

607
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.850
I'm generating an option tug for each off the results coming back on each option.

608
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.540
Time is going toe have as its value the i d.

609
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.070
Coming back from the database,

610
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:08.220
Andi printed to the screen for the user's eyes.

611
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.130
The name.

612
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.100
So when I go and refresh my browser,

613
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.550
I get an error here.

614
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.490
They're saying that there's something some undefined method,

615
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.840
and I think I was spelling errors.

616
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.850
So when I go back,

617
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:19.260
yes,

618
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.270
I have a spelling error.

619
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.970
I said specialities.

620
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:22.190
What?

621
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.160
It is special.

622
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.430
She's all right.

623
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:27.990
So when I go back and I refresh once again,

624
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.520
all right,

625
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.790
So after fixing that era,

626
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.070
we see here where we still have our dropped on,

627
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.300
we still have all of our options on Just validate that these air?

628
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.650
No coming from the database.

629
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.170
If I view paid source,

630
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.160
then look at the options being the fact.

631
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.980
Then all we actually see a debug issue,

632
00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.830
anything undefined index.

633
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.840
So I think I may have referenced i d.

634
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.100
When it's specialty ideas so apologised.

635
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.360
So I just go back and me that correction.

636
00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.730
So it's always good to have you paid sources,

637
00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:03.050
See if there is anything kicking and screaming in the background.

638
00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.940
So it's specialty on the score,

639
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.850
i d.

640
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.470
And there we have value equals 34567 So whatever the value is water,

641
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.190
the idea is in the database.

642
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:19.530
That is what is getting printed back as the value on whatever the name is what we're seeing

643
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.860
in the drop down box.

644
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.400
So let's just validate that everything is going according to plan.

645
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.850
So I'm just going to add another another attendee.

646
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.340
All right,

647
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.550
so we're going to add Tom Hopkins.

648
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.230
I know Tom is fully registered on.

649
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:37.410
We see here that the I d value is being passed over Andi,

650
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.830
when we view records.

651
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.380
Sorry,

652
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.580
View attendees.

653
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.890
Then we still see this.

654
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.780
I devalue Soto.

655
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.340
Fix this.

656
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.040
I devalue.

657
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.760
We need to modify the select script so that we're getting about the name on,

658
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.230
not just the i d.

659
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.620
So I'm going to go back to my crowd,

660
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.340
file on going to modify this quarry that says,

661
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.690
get attendees on.

662
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:03.090
I'm going to do what we call an inner join someone to say inner join on.

663
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:09.430
I'm inner joining the special teas table on specialty on the score,

664
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.510
I d equals specialty on the score I d.

665
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.960
And then because where we have the same column name,

666
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.550
what we have to do is actually give the tables are in essence,

667
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:26.850
I can call attendees E onda specialties s on that.

668
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.930
I'm going to see it.

669
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:33.470
That specialty is equal toe s that specialty on the score.

670
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.950
I d.

671
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:34.410
All right,

672
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.600
So if you tend us,

673
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.710
follow this along.

674
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.970
If you need a better understanding off this,

675
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.580
you can always tickled my course on my school database development and muster on that will

676
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.310
bring a lot of context as to what is happening here.

677
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:51.130
But once we have relationships in a database,

678
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.690
then we have to be what we call inner joins where we're actually joining the data between

679
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.790
the two tables on what they have in common.

680
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.840
And if you remember,

681
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.250
when we were setting up or database,

682
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.570
we had specialty underscore ideas,

683
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:09.610
the primary key and a specialty stable on We have specialty underscore idea as a foreign

684
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.080
key,

685
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:10.490
which is,

686
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:16.590
all we're seeing is the values that correspond with the ideas from the special do stable.

687
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.690
So by doing this inner joy and I'm no seeing,

688
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:25.740
bring back all the details from both these tables and a loamy toe do with it as I wish So

689
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.340
for the display aspect,

690
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.170
since I'm no getting back.

691
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:34.900
All of the columns from the attendee table on all of the calls from the specialty stable,

692
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:43.960
including the name know what I can do is actually go back to my cord about to my success

693
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.640
isn't success.

694
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:44.800
No,

695
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.410
my view.

696
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.050
Record speed.

697
00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:46.430
Sorry,

698
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.040
Andi.

699
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:47.320
Instead,

700
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.940
offer a fencing specialty.

701
00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.490
I d.

702
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:55.260
I can no reference name because the name is a column that I know have access toe.

703
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.420
And then when I refresh this page,

704
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:02.250
I am no seeing all of the specialties that are associated with I D three.

705
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:08.700
So I'm going to go and add one more record just to drive the point home on this one is

706
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:13.450
going to be some bit off gibberish on going to change the area of expertise,

707
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.120
the website administrator,

708
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.900
and then submits on here once again,

709
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.400
we're printing by just the value because we're looking at the post value,

710
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.350
which is just the option value.

711
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.040
But then when we view attendees,

712
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.770
we'll see the actual name because we know that we're printing the name associated with that

713
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:32.770
.

714
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.370
I devalue six.

715
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.680
Now,

716
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.880
the last thing that we want to change is the fact that the date of birth is giving those

717
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.170
ears.

718
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.470
And I was mentioning that this is because off a date for marching issue.

719
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.630
So in PHP,

720
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:51.190
the date format needs to be y y y y four wise to stems.

721
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.790
And to these,

722
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.420
in other words,

723
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:52.740
year,

724
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.200
month,

725
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.680
day.

726
00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.260
But then we didn't know that the date picker,

727
00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:02.180
if we go about our farm is really giving us in the month of the year are day monthly or

728
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.210
something else are.

729
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.950
So what we need to do is tell the date quicker toe,

730
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.460
actually change the former Toby Ph.

731
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.120
Be friendly.

732
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:16.170
So I'm going to go back to my footer fire on my way to find the function that involves

733
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.800
their picker on going to add to the attributes here.

734
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:25.760
So this press comma and right date formats colon on.

735
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.000
Then I'm going to specify that the date for what I want is why,

736
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.280
why,

737
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.590
why,

738
00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:30.080
why?

739
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.020
That's four wise to ends on two D's.

740
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.450
So once of me that change,

741
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.570
I can go back and refresh my form.

742
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:43.100
And if I take a look if I selected it and I look at what is printed,

743
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.620
I see Oh,

744
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.250
all right,

745
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.810
so it's actually Y y Sorry.

746
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.970
So in jobless groups,

747
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:50.790
the date four month thing is a bit different.

748
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:51.810
So it's why why,

749
00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:52.830
mm bt?

750
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.610
So let me refresh on do that again on right.

751
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.080
There we go.

752
00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.430
So it's why why to give us the four numerals.

753
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.200
So it's kind of where causing peach beats.

754
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:02.500
Why,

755
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:02.730
Why,

756
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:02.980
why?

757
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.780
Why If you use excel,

758
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.140
it's why,

759
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.330
Why,

760
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:05.530
why,

761
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:05.780
why?

762
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.250
But in that was scripted.

763
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:12.000
So y y so you just want to be called me sent off that So I'm just went toe enter another

764
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.290
random record here just to see what this will turn out to be in when I submit everything

765
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.760
went through.

766
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.290
Well,

767
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.640
we see here the date four months is retained.

768
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.210
How when I go to view attendees,

769
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:28.530
we see here that we are actually seeing the date format because it's no saving it in a Ph

770
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.410
be friendly way.

771
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:35.060
So that's it for how we go about selecting records and hold we dynamically generate issue

772
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.010
mill based on watches in the database.
