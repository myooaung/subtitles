Hey,

2
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.360
guys,

3
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.360
congrats for making it this far In this course in this video will be just be doing some

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.000
final touches toe our application this far.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.890
Now let's just review are up quickly so we can see what kind of finishing touches would be

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.630
required on the first thing that comes to mind is the father we haven't really put in a

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.650
sensible footer upon to know on then.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.830
The other thing is that we need to publish this publicly so that our registration form is

9
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.600
available publicly on.

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.550
We need to get through those activities in this video.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.000
So the first thing that we're going to do is make a more sensible looking footer.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.470
So up until now,

13
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.490
we have our includes file and we had our footer,

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.450
not PHP file on in that file.

15
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.860
We just had a live and we called it footer on.

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.660
We just echoed copyrights on what we did to kind off create this density in the footer and

17
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.850
the rest off the page was,

18
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.860
and other sports the inexperience.

19
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:08.600
Here we put in some br tax that kind off pod the space between our footer on the rest of

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.540
the page,

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.280
know The reality is that bootstrap actually kind of gives us classes that alot us toe have

22
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.000
fixed footer.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.730
So the bottom of the page so we don't need 10 are so br tax to put space between the

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.030
content on the footer on.

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.710
Secondly,

26
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.380
we're going to be using bootstrap toe,

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.530
actually make our foot or look like something sensible.

28
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.450
So I'm just going to delete this footer tag firstly,

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.400
and then we're going to rebuild it.

30
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.430
So I'm deleting it,

31
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.780
and I'm going to probably retired some of the court that I just deleted.

32
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380
But either way,

33
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.430
we can do it together.

34
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.600
So remember that in the footer dot PHP file that this closing beef tug would correspond

35
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.160
with the opening def tie in our header.

36
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.650
So if I go back to the header,

37
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.890
then I see that you have Dave container.

38
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.020
All right.

39
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.420
Remember,

40
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.800
the container is what gives those those that margin like space or the space between the

41
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.090
left,

42
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.940
most edge and enough bar start or the contents.

43
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.600
That's what the container does are enough bars in the content.

44
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.190
I want to put the foot the footer insider content also,

45
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.920
as you can see,

46
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.530
it really is inside of that container talk,

47
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.950
brother.

48
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.560
So I am going to inside off the footer right above that closing day for my continue,

49
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.850
It'd I am going to create a div,

50
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.100
and we actually had it just know.

51
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.100
But I deleted it.

52
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.890
And that's no problem.

53
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.030
We're doing this together from scratch,

54
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.070
so I'm going to create a div on.

55
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:55.850
Then I'm going to give this def the I d footer on then.

56
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.750
Inside the same footer.

57
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.250
I want to give it a few bootstrap classes.

58
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.340
So the first class I'm going to give it is P minus tree.

59
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.150
And I'll explain what each class does that I'm going to give it MB miners to on DBI g dash

60
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.910
Andi,

61
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.230
just go back and reference the header to see what kind of BG we use.

62
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.420
So we used b g dash dark.

63
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.950
So is a dark theme.

64
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.300
Well,

65
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.790
while we use the dark nav bar,

66
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.900
we really use the color BG dash primary.

67
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.890
So in the footer,

68
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.740
I'm going to use B g dash primary to set the color off our footer on.

69
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.410
Then I went to see text dash white to make sure that we get white text on,

70
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.450
then the clincher is fixed dash bottom,

71
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.450
so this in particular will make sure that it is going to go down to the footer section off

72
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.630
our page or are stay at the bottom of the page.

73
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.800
So fixed bottom means that no matter how much or little content is under page itself,

74
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.770
the footer will always be at the bottom of the page because upon to know,

75
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.570
we're allies that if there is a little bit of content,

76
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.820
it kind of rises open if there's are lots than it gets pushed on,

77
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.350
which is why we need that to be our tugs.

78
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.870
So this class will kind of force it down to the bottom and then combined all of these kind

79
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.140
of create a nice blue footer section or give with a footer content at the bottom of the

80
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.130
page on.

81
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.300
Then,

82
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.150
inside off this footer,

83
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.560
I'm going to put some more official text where I'm going to see that the copyright I T

84
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:49.040
conference attendance system on de called the date aan den So that p tag with text.

85
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:58.050
Dutch centre should center line some amount of text in our footer footer Div Andi central

86
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.310
and off course and print the date that it is being viewed.

87
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.420
So I'm just going to see if this and then I'm just going to go back and refresh my page on

88
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.420
.

89
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.540
If you look at it now,

90
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.750
you'll see that we have a more sensible king footer.

91
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.630
Now,

92
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.610
let me explain what each class does.

93
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.290
So the first class p three is talking about the padding so we can just go back to our p a

94
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.530
drag click and go to inspect elements.

95
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.040
And then we can kind off,

96
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.090
take an antique,

97
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.200
each elements.

98
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.720
I'm just inspecting the footer itself.

99
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.160
And then we can take an unclean Kontic,

100
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.960
the classes being referenced here.

101
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.120
So text dash white is they're saying that the color of the text should be white and I think

102
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.120
,

103
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.700
why looks better against blue background and blue.

104
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.320
What off course you can customize yourself.

105
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.070
P Dash three means that the padding is applied.

106
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.390
So if you look at the difference when we click fighting versus tickets off,

107
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:02.010
you see that the parting changes each time so I can leave that on then the MBI dash to

108
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.410
talks about the margin to the bottles.

109
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.990
If I antique that you noticed that that white space that's at the bottom of the footer kind

110
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.850
of goes away.

111
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.760
So actually,

112
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.980
off all these classes,

113
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.380
I would probably want to just remove the M V two.

114
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.950
So I'll just go back,

115
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.600
remove the nb tool on you can off course,

116
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.960
find all of these references on the bootstrap websites in the documentation on you can

117
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.590
customize your footer hall.

118
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.220
You would like it to be no notice that my foot or kind of stretches right across the page

119
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.600
instead of being confined to the container,

120
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.930
right?

121
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.270
So the container would be along this margin that I'm moving my most,

122
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.440
whereas the foot Terry stretching right across.

123
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.370
And it is a common design pattern toe,

124
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.840
actually,

125
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.750
have I noticed that the footer as I scroll the footer Dusty's there,

126
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.550
right?

127
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.920
And it's a common design.

128
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.350
Patrons have the knave buyer stretch right across.

129
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.930
You never content itself is kind off within the margin.

130
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.980
So I'm actually going to just do that on about this.

131
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.120
Modify the header section on doubt,

132
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.050
eat this entire love boat off that Dave.

133
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.830
So I'm just going to put that entire now section out off the continent live and I'm going

134
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.280
to put it above that continue narrative.

135
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.900
So still of minor of everything still works as it should.

136
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:30.490
But then when I refresh you see that my nerve will stretch right across the page on then.

137
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.470
Further to that,

138
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.950
if I wanted the actual content off the knob inside the container,

139
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.190
then I can actually just go back on bond.

140
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.170
In this live,

141
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.870
I can see containers of collapse in of bark dash collapse on.

142
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:52.580
Then I can just see container on down once I do that.

143
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.100
Sorry.

144
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.050
It just personal wrong buttons there.

145
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.210
So I say container and refresh,

146
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.730
and we get something that s so the links themselves are moved in on the logo.

147
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.280
Estilo.

148
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.850
So I mean,

149
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.290
you can me that decision.

150
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.100
He wants us to look like that.

151
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.460
That's entirely up to you.

152
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.190
Um,

153
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.900
but I kind of look like the look off having it kind of spread across the top right across

154
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.580
the people.

155
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.410
So the header is rent across on the footage right across on.

156
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.750
I cannot like that Look.

157
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.890
So that's the first touch that we're making toe over application.

158
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.490
Next,

159
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.490
we want to just upload it to Hiroko.

160
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:34.860
So we're going to go ahead and check in our changes in to get hubs and then synchronize

161
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.580
with herro.

162
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:35.990
Cool.

163
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.180
On and off course,

164
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.580
we made a change where we updated the profile picture.

165
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.700
So we need to update our database also.

166
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.160
So I'm I've opened up my workbench on guy connected to my remote database,

167
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.180
and I already have the data base here with a little bit of data.

168
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.880
I don't want toe remove this entire database or remove all the tables and have to rebuild

169
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.170
them.

170
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:04.280
So what I'm going to do is just manually go into my attendee table on at the columns.

171
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.580
I can distract like attendee on.

172
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.000
Then I can go toe altar table on.

173
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.140
Then that would allow me toe Add any column that I wish.

174
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.690
So I'm just going to go back to Loca.

175
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.330
I am served my be FEMA admin on.

176
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.690
Find the field on,

177
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.120
recreated accordingly.

178
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.850
All right,

179
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.960
so one that loads.

180
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.400
I went to that in the We'll have 10 dance on the score.

181
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:38.460
Db database attendee table phoned avatar path and see that his large are 200 it alos no.

182
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.030
So I'm just going to copy the data type.

183
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.540
So I mean,

184
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.730
you don't have to copy MPs.

185
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.070
I'm just doing the second speed up this process,

186
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.460
but I'm going to call it of attire.

187
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.450
Well,

188
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.140
was it of a tire on the score path?

189
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.500
So I already built the court to look for that field in my death.

190
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.440
So obviously,

191
00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.730
whatever I'm whatever change are making to the production needs the mimic what it's looking

192
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.400
for in depth.

193
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.990
So it's a bar chart 200 on once.

194
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.560
I mean those changes I can apply,

195
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.830
but be it's my remote database on.

196
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.020
Then once the database is ready,

197
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.230
then I can do my uploads.

198
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.230
So I'm going to go to Vicky Top,

199
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:28.340
and I'm just going to check in these changes and I'll just say updated Hitter and footer

200
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.670
Andi.

201
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.440
I would have already updated the fact that I did the profile pictures to get up,

202
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.230
so I wouldn't Well,

203
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.990
that's why I only have these 21 James Fatso,

204
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.130
depending on what you may have done in your get up,

205
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.710
then you may want to add more to your comments,

206
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.100
but that's what I have done.

207
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.640
So I'll just commit to Master Onda push and then once that's done,

208
00:10:50.640 --> 00:11:00.430
we know we can go to Herro cool on log into our application on.

209
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.390
Then we just go to deploy on.

210
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.250
We go ahead on deploy brunch.

211
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.050
Master,

212
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.800
once that's done,

213
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.850
we can off course just view our application.

214
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.610
So our application is here,

215
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.400
and I'm just going to try and fill.

216
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:17.510
Oh,

217
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:22.600
this poor are selling Philo the forum Just going to choose a profile picture on.

218
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.750
Then I'm going to click,

219
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.010
submit on this,

220
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:25.850
receive everything,

221
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:32.540
works and there we go on test hero Cool on There's our fox know if I log in just the view

222
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.670
all off the application are the applicants who will be attending the conference and see the

223
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.050
information that they uploaded.

224
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.820
And I see here that add mean logging is not working.

225
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.890
So I went over to the database and I see that I literally have the user admin and the word

226
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:53.230
password to remember that we went through some amount off rigor trying to harden the way

227
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.750
the password appears on D.

228
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.800
What should really happen is that we should have the admin user Yes,

229
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.750
on the password in ah,

230
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.290
hushed form.

231
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.610
So that is not happening here.

232
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:12.230
so I don't want to do is just remove this admin user on whether I can just remove all these

233
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.800
users.

234
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.690
I don't need them at this point.

235
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.660
And then I'm just going to refresh this speech on then do remember that once we load the

236
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.190
page that the Cory should run or the Oh,

237
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.660
sorry.

238
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.550
I heard that sort of corn should run,

239
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.650
but what I didn't do was apply when I deleted.

240
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.690
So let me try that again.

241
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.830
So with workbench,

242
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.680
when you modified the data set like I just did,

243
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.550
where deleted them.

244
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.110
I need to click apply,

245
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.020
which will actually generate that quarry.

246
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.920
So I'm just going to click,

247
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.950
apply again.

248
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.790
And then the choir would ever been run successfully.

249
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.230
No.

250
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.620
When I refreshed the page and it loads that con filed,

251
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.670
then it will go through.

252
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:55.170
And it went through because it resubmitted admin and password toe the form,

253
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.410
which also appeared in my database.

254
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.180
When I read when I rerun that quarter to select star from users than I see my admin user

255
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.890
here with the hushed password.

256
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.820
All right,

257
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.470
so if you run into that difficulty,

258
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.920
which I'm sure you won't,

259
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.080
But I'm just showing you what can go around.

260
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.680
So at this point,

261
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.870
these air the attendees in our database and here is the most recent one,

262
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.560
which is test.

263
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.590
Hiroko is an administrator.

264
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.200
And then,

265
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.350
if I view,

266
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.530
then I see that profile picture.

267
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:30.040
If I go back to the list on Dive you another one who was pre profile picture than I see

268
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:36.160
that it's only loading that default picture like we would have designed it to do on our

269
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.650
local deaf environment.

270
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:46.140
So that is how we go about building are kind off into end application with PHP and using or

271
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.210
PDO libraries to help us perform crowd operations on,

272
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.600
then get up for source control,

273
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.420
Onda change tracking and finally,

274
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.830
Hiroko for Web hosting and we're teaser,

275
00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.110
Mort,

276
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.960
SQL Server and Sin Greed for using email services.

277
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.160
So at the end off the day,

278
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:13.040
that is how you go about building at PHP application from scratch up until inception on,

279
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.700
then styling with bootstrap for on hosting it on the Internet
