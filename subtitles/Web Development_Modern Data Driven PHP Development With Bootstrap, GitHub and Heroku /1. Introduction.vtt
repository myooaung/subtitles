00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.945
Hey guys, welcome to this exciting new course,

2
00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:06.390
applied web development with BHB.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.480
I am your instructor for war Williams.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.645
In this course, you will be learning the fundamentals

5
00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.155
of web application development using HTML,

6
00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.620
CSS, PHP, Apache server,

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.385
and hosting tools such as Heroku and C panel.

8
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:28.410
Of course all of that wouldn't be complete without tying it in with a MySQL database so

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.860
that we can have a fully dynamic and data-driven web application.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.510
By the end of this course,

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.675
you should be able to accomplish basic web development with

12
00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:42.424
HTML and CSS setup as XAMPP server,

13
00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:46.220
understand the role of PHP in web applications.

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.180
Build a MySQL database using PHP, my admin,

15
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.280
and all of that would help you to build a data-driven and dynamic web applications.

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.630
We'll be looking at PHP PDO and how to style

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.175
or application using the most popular CSS framework bootstrap.

18
00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:08.600
Ultimately, we would want to incorporate the use of source control through

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.960
the US github and ultimately host our web application on Heroku.

20
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.360
Most other courses will teach you how to understand PHP,

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.100
hard to do the basics of PHP,

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.775
but they don't really show you that enter and development process.

23
00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.415
And that is what we hope to accomplish in this course.

24
00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:29.540
At the end of this course,

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.270
you should be empowered and equipped with all the tools you

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.810
need to build any application that is asked of,

27
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.180
you know, before we go much further,

28
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.040
I want us to take the next few minutes to understand the tools that we'll be

29
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.070
using and how exactly they work in the whole web development ecosystem.

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.275
Now let's start with PHP.

31
00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:57.935
Php is an open source web scripting language which is used mostly for service side stuff.

32
00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:00.275
And it is short for Hypertext,

33
00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.530
Preprocessor or personal homepage.

34
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.150
Each B is designed to be fully embedded in HTML and manipulate HTML as you the developer.

35
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.425
So deserts.

36
00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:17.015
If you have any exposure to any other programming languages such as C plus, plus,

37
00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:18.425
C Sharp or Java,

38
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.845
then you'll find that it's very familiar working with PHP.

39
00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:25.040
If this is your first time working with any programming language,

40
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.655
then that's finally because we will be starting from the ground up.

41
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:32.225
The next big ticket item would be XAMPP server.

42
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:35.300
And XAMPP is really short for, well,

43
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.495
the X really means any environment.

44
00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:44.870
The basis of XAMPP server is really what we call the lamp stack, that's AMP.

45
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.120
And the L really means Linux,

46
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.785
Apache, MySQL, and PHP or Perl.

47
00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.670
So zombies really just an adoption of the lumps

48
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.155
stuck onto other operating systems such as Windows and MacOS.

49
00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:03.095
Since the L stands for Linux,

50
00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:07.745
and it is the most popular PHP development environment.

51
00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:09.080
It's a one-stop shop.

52
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.915
You installed XAMPP and then you get the Apache server,

53
00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:14.990
which is required to host the PHP code.

54
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.290
You get MySQL, which is a database server,

55
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.140
and you get all the required libraries for PHP and well pearl,

56
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.460
but we'll be doing PHP,

57
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.340
so we'll focus on the PHP libraries.

58
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.580
And more recently, the m also means Maria DB,

59
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.190
which is a spin-off of the more popular MySQL database engine.

60
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.400
Now here we take a quick look at what HTML and CSS and PHP will look like.

61
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.135
Well, this code snippet has no CSS in it just yet.

62
00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:49.939
But there you see that you have some HTML,

63
00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.425
which is the black text.

64
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:56.750
Then you have the PHP tags that were previously alluded to and some

65
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.375
cord which would print some text inside of an HTML page.

66
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:08.780
Traditionally HTML pages have the extension dot HTML or dot HTM.

67
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.655
When we're using PHP,

68
00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:13.925
these files will have the extension dot PHP.

69
00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:18.950
And PHP tags will only work in dot PHP files.

70
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.590
But as we go along and we get into more developments of then you'll see how that works.

71
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.780
Now every step of the way we will want to track our progress and we will

72
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.299
be doing this using source control and more specifically through GitHub.

73
00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:37.730
Github are by extension on

74
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.075
source control that allows you to track changes to your project,

75
00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:42.830
collaborate with team members.

76
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.285
If you have to work in a team setting instead of copying and pasting code fuzziness,

77
00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:51.920
upload to a central place that everybody has access to all of your changes.

78
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.600
We can also manage project documentation centrally.

79
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.970
Then of the big GitHub is probably

80
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.445
the most popular and also free source control tool

81
00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:07.370
that is on the Internet and it's widely accessible,

82
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.005
widely available to everybody.

83
00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:12.170
And once again, it's free of charge.

84
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.725
The last thing I wanted to mention is Heroku,

85
00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:20.270
which allows us to deploy PHP web applications in minutes.

86
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.210
And we can host the web application as well as the database all on Heroku.

87
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.450
We'll also be looking at using the more traditional routes,

88
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.770
which is C panel.

89
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.240
I didn't allude to it here,

90
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.920
but as we get into the course,

91
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.925
we will see how valuable those tools are.

92
00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:41.210
Once again, we have an exciting journey ahead of

93
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.450
us and I hope you stick around and I hope you apply yourself.

94
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.770
At the end of this course,

95
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.380
you should be able to take on any challenge that comes

96
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.980
towards you in PHP web application development.
