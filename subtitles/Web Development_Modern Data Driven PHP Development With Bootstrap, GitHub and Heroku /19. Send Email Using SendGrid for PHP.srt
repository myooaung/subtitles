1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,370
Hey,

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:01,730
guys,

3
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:07,020
in this video will be setting up an email dispatch for our i T conference registration

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,550
system.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,530
Now,

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,860
the context for an email dispatch is that when somebody feels all this form or they get is

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,240
a a success speech,

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,940
you just get a pay.

9
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,060
Justices Hey,

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,460
thank you for registering,

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,560
but they don't really have any tangible proof.

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,230
And the easiest way to give somebody tangible proof or filling out an electronic form would

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,450
be to send them an email confirming that they have completed action successfully.

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,270
And so in this video,

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,920
we're going to be configuring our attendance application.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,350
Such a.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,570
When somebody clicks submit,

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,290
they will load the success speech and also dispatch on email to whatever email address they

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,650
would have provided during the registration process.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,430
Now,

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,410
when it comes to PHP,

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,290
there quite a few options you have.

23
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,060
You can actually go into your PHP that I and I file that is phoned.

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,020
If you go to some and in the Apache row you to config on,

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,710
then you would see the PHP that I and I file on in this file.

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,220
You can actually set up some SMTP settings.

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,560
So in the NFL.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
I just search for S m T.

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,220
P.

30
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,720
On it brought me to where the male function can be configured.

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,440
You can set up that server name on the ports,

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,080
which is by default 25.

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,010
But what you really want changes local host toe on actual SMTP server on maybe went into

34
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,950
other configurations on that would allow you to dispatch leverage that SMTP server to

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,690
dispatch emails.

36
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,730
Another way would be to use the send me a library,

37
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,680
which is a popular PHP library.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,280
But once again,

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,470
this is kind of unique to your Zampa and you're leveraging on SMTP server like maybe G meal

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,280
or yahoo if not one that is,

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,590
you know,

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,670
local to your context In this tutorial,

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,110
however,

44
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,140
will be using this third party library called Send Grid,

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,610
which is actually an add on that we can get in Hiroko.

46
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,360
So remember I mentioned that we want to keep our application as homogeneous.

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,380
That's possible or,

48
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,030
you know,

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,700
a single using a singular technologies as much as possible.

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:23,140
So send grid is ah is another on that Haruko offers that allows us a few emails I'm on for

51
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,460
free.

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,080
So for the purpose off this listen will be using that free service just like aware using

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,150
Heracles free service on.

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,190
Then we'll see how we can integrate with that third party email slash SMS dispatch software

55
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,190
.

56
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,550
You know our PHP application.

57
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,040
Now,

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,110
if you haven't already done so,

59
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,390
then you need to get composer,

60
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,000
which you can get back frozen,

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,350
too.

62
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:55,480
Get composer dot org on There's a previous video seek and his head back up in the videos

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,340
where I show you how to install and set up.

64
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,740
Composer There's not much to it.

65
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,840
You kind of slick don't Lord,

66
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,750
and it will give you a ah file Execute herbal,

67
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,940
which you can just run an install composer on your application.

68
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,580
And then,

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,850
having done that,

70
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:18,410
you can always just go to the command prompt on Just type in the word composer Andre.

71
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,230
And if you get this,

72
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,700
that means it's not installed.

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,120
So I just remember that this is my recovery machine,

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,020
so I'm actually going to go ahead and install it for you to see.

75
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,000
So we back at get composer dot org can district on Lord Andi If you're on a Windows machine

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
,

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,440
just get that windows installer.

78
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,250
Go ahead and run that executes herbal file,

79
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,540
and it's pretty straightforward.

80
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,850
You just need to click next.

81
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,440
Next.

82
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,300
We'll ask you where the PHP environment is on.

83
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,850
Do you really don't need to do much except click next,

84
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,410
and once you're finished,

85
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,700
you just like finish on.

86
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,610
Then you can bring a pure CMD and tap the command you may need to re started if you had it

87
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,620
open before.

88
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,690
So once you re open it and you type composer,

89
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,630
then you will see Well,

90
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,730
once you're seeing this,

91
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,290
then you know it's installed properly if you don't see this than there's something wrong.

92
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,720
All right,

93
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,060
so now that we have composer installed,

94
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,010
what we want to do is use it toe,

95
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,490
acquire the code that will help us.

96
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,720
The access that third party service called send grid,

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,050
which is a part off Heracles.

98
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,960
Um,

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,350
I don't offerings.

100
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,190
No,

101
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,450
the purpose of composer is package management.

102
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,210
All right.

103
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,220
So from time to time,

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,940
you may need to use third party libraries that are not built into PHP.

105
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,800
Andi,

106
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,460
they you know,

107
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,790
they're accessible over the Internet.

108
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,080
But then,

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,390
instead of going and hunting them down and trying to integrate them what composer lows you

110
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,040
to do is just run a few commands here in the command line.

111
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,050
And actually it was Go out.

112
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,620
Source.

113
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,350
The latest version off that third party delivery.

114
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,950
Ondo.

115
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,280
Nobody's into your project.

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,850
So to get this process started,

117
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,550
we need to find our way over to our product,

118
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,430
which is in C zam,

119
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,500
at least in my context.

120
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,020
It seeds some HD docks on,

121
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,640
then inside off HD docks.

122
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,290
It's attendance.

123
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,510
All right,

124
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,170
so know that I mean attendance.

125
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:25,210
I'm going to type the command composer require on the name off the library is send Grid

126
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,990
will just say that sin,

127
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,500
greed slash send grid And then once we press enter,

128
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,450
you can watch some magic happen.

129
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,870
Now,

130
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,040
if you see if you get this kind of result where it is installing and 100% that means that

131
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,540
that process was completed successfully.

132
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,090
If you bring up your project in visual studio code or if you bro Stewart and explore,

133
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,290
then you see that some new fast have appeared.

134
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,890
So you'll have a composer dot Js on file,

135
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,780
which is Well,

136
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,630
this is our package management files,

137
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,430
so essentially what we can do it Each time we you use composer to acquire 1/3 party library

138
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,430
,

139
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,230
it will add a line to this file saying that this is a library that we know half All right,

140
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,220
So if I wanted a lesser version,

141
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,790
I could change this version and then run a composer file,

142
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,740
and it would automatically go and source the version that I wanted and,

143
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,380
you know,

144
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,650
discard this one and acquire that one.

145
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,450
So composer makes sourcing libraries on versions very,

146
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,250
very easy.

147
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,580
So we get a composer,

148
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,790
Jason file.

149
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,910
We got a composer dot lock file.

150
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,630
You have to spend much time trying to understand what's in this.

151
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,810
And then we also got a vendor folder,

152
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,070
which has another folder with all off.

153
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,950
The dependence is for our our send grid activities.

154
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,920
All right,

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,300
so know that we have don't loaded the library's locally.

156
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,540
Let us head on over to Hiroko on add this library to our ups,

157
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,870
understand the type in here.

158
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,030
Oh,

159
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,550
cool.

160
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,210
Not com on.

161
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,100
Go ahead and log in.

162
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,590
All right.

163
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,190
So I'm going to select the up that we're working with,

164
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,560
which,

165
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,240
in my case,

166
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,940
it's PHP dash attendance on.

167
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,230
Then we go ahead and configure ad on So on the overview PUC installed Adan's and you can

168
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,210
click Configure Adan's On.

169
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,970
Then we can Search Send.

170
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,320
Great now.

171
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,460
Once that comes up,

172
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,300
we can district provision in on Douala No sin.

173
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,240
Grady's apart off your hero Go up.

174
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,510
But we still have a few steps,

175
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,350
so we have to click on send grid which will launch a new tab.

176
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,940
Andi,

177
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,800
I love us to go into the send grade dashboard.

178
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:48,450
Now the senator dashboard will actually ask you toe verify your activities here.

179
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,420
Identities.

180
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,950
Andi Well,

181
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,180
we can skip to the party.

182
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,800
And if it doesn't,

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
then if you go to settings on,

184
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,590
then FBI keys,

185
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,150
which is what we're really interested in,

186
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,670
it will prompt use IR I already have on a p I key,

187
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,100
but it will prompt you to verify your email address.

188
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,410
And then that may take a few moments.

189
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,040
You wait on that email and you verify yourself,

190
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,830
and then you can follow these steps again.

191
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,350
So once you're in centigrade,

192
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,790
what you want to do is goto settings on a P I keys on.

193
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,780
Then I'm going to discard this a p I key on.

194
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,590
I'm going to create a brand new one just for us to complete these activities.

195
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,820
So on this page where it says getting started with a P.

196
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,210
AKIs,

197
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,210
you go ahead and click create a P I key,

198
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,980
which is in the top right corner.

199
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:39,010
This will launch a little mortal asking us what what exactly you want so we can give the A

200
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,840
P I key and name someone to just call it email.

201
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,390
Something simple doesn't have to be a fresh name on.

202
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,780
Then I'm going to use restricted access because I really don't need every single feature

203
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,090
that they have the offer.

204
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,830
I really just want the simple stuff to send an email.

205
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,520
So I'm went toe thick,

206
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,790
restricted restricted access and then under access details,

207
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,710
I'm going to drop down mail send on,

208
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,730
then I will select meal sinned on.

209
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,720
Then I'm also going to select email activity and I'm going to click that one.

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,140
So once it becomes blue,

211
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,930
you know that you have selected it on then at the end off that I'm going to say create and

212
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:25,890
view on then this speech here displease my a p I key so you can just click in this space to

213
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,290
copy its by clicking.

214
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,280
It will copy it,

215
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,450
but they do say for security reasons they won't show it again.

216
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,940
So make sure you store it somewhere safe.

217
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,380
Otherwise,

218
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,880
you're going to have to repeat that step if you lose this key because they won't show it to

219
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,340
you again.

220
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,610
So either copy it and stories here,

221
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,780
or if you forget that you have tow,

222
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,400
discard it and then do it over.

223
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,760
All right,

224
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,270
so once I have that copy,

225
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,290
I can click done.

226
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,800
And I'm just going to store that somewhere safe for future use art.

227
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,020
So Backdoor project.

228
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,970
I'm going to start off by creating a new file on.

229
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,190
I'm going to call this file.

230
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,190
Send e mail dot PHP on,

231
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,380
Then I'm going to go ahead and put in my customary PHP tags on the first line of this fight

232
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,140
is going to be a require on.

233
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,840
We're going to require a new file that would have come with or composer called Also Lord,

234
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,860
which is found in our vendor folder.

235
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:25,240
Know that we've included over composer files and this file will actually give us access to

236
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,420
certain Send greed specific files,

237
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,090
which you'll see a Z go along next,

238
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,920
I'm going to create a class on.

239
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm calling this class and email just like the file this class.

240
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,710
I won't have an instructor,

241
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,820
but that construct,

242
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,200
er sorry.

243
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,360
But instead I will have a singular function,

244
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
which I'm going to make static someone to say public static function.

245
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,190
And I'll explain what static means in a bit on.

246
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,970
Then I'm going to call this function,

247
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,230
send mail,

248
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,290
not send email,

249
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,250
but send meal.

250
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,800
No,

251
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,620
a static phone shown pretty much it does not require us toe in Stan.

252
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,250
She it on object on object off type,

253
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,280
Send email.

254
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,920
All right,

255
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,350
so if you remember,

256
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,990
every time we use the class,

257
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,350
we had to see classes or some object is equal to a new instance of that class,

258
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,400
and then we can access the functions when we make a static function instead of class.

259
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,640
We don't have to do that whole new part,

260
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,880
but we can just call the class name and then use a local a scope resolution operator to

261
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,230
just access the Function directory.

262
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,350
But we're going to see that as we go along.

263
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,340
No,

264
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,480
to keep our phone son dynamic,

265
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,810
I'm going to put in three parameters.

266
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,650
We want the two,

267
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,320
which is where this email should be sent to.

268
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,510
We want subject on.

269
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,500
We want content.

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,710
No,

271
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,630
The reason I'm doing it this way is that I want this function to be generic enough that

272
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,150
it's used in multiple,

273
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,950
you know,

274
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,810
operations.

275
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,730
So maybe when we create a new user,

276
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,910
we dispatch an email to that user who has been created.

277
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,430
When we create.

278
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,560
When somebody registers for our event,

279
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,920
we can use the same function to send off that email so I don't have to write the court

280
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,070
every time we need it.

281
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,400
What?

282
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,070
We just call it a static functional.

283
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:19,300
We take the two as a perimeter we can send over and you subject based on the context.

284
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,090
On Dwell,

285
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,770
the content of the email can be dynamic.

286
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,040
Also now,

287
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,100
in this function,

288
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,810
the first thing I'm going to declare is the is a variable for our key.

289
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,430
Now they're probably more elegant ways to do this.

290
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,950
But I'm just using apart off least resistance,

291
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,410
so I'm just defining the key in this variable on.

292
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,850
Then I'm going to use this key to send the access in grids process are part Fung son.

293
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,980
I'm going to use this key to access send grids,

294
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,850
send email function,

295
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,500
but the first thing that we need to do or will the second thing you need to do is build on

296
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,880
on object off type new on.

297
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
We're going to use a backslash and say Send grid,

298
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,080
or is it a forward slash?

299
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,810
I'm not sure which one that is.

300
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:18,040
What Sin grid slash meal slash meal open and close parentheses.

301
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,940
So this is a class that we know have access to because we included our auto loaders Ph.

302
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,130
B.

303
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,150
So we can no access this glass,

304
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,700
which came over through our composer installed off.

305
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,940
Center it on.

306
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,560
No,

307
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,250
this email object is an instance off our sin grid meal.

308
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,550
Klaus.

309
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:49,860
So next we can say email annuities are narrow and then we sit the from So you say,

310
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,500
You know what email addresses this coming from You can pretty much put anything there,

311
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,870
so I'm going to put my own email address.

312
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,160
So if if we were running a real conference,

313
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,420
then you probably put the email address off the conference or the Enterprise putting on the

314
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,160
conference,

315
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:16,780
and you can put on something here to see the name off the person or the enterprise friend.

316
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,430
So if it was a no reply,

317
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,210
but you didn't want no reply to show up,

318
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,180
you could still write I t Conference Enterprises.

319
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,250
But it's a no replies that I t can conference dot com,

320
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,620
you know,

321
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,030
just for argument.

322
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,310
See?

323
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,160
All right,

324
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,940
The next thing that we want to do in email is set the subject so we can say Set,

325
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,850
subject.

326
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,770
And then right here we can just pass in our subject.

327
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,980
Whatever coming is coming in as a parameter value here,

328
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,650
we can pass it into the set subject on.

329
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:57,780
Then we can do the email object again and then add to where we're adding to.

330
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:05,180
So whatever we're whatever value came over as the email address to be dispatched for the

331
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,170
email to be dispatched.

332
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,090
Tow was in this parameter on.

333
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,950
Then it gets added to the emir object,

334
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,840
using that phone son,

335
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,620
and then finally,

336
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,650
we can add content.

337
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,860
No,

338
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,820
the content variable requires tool parameters.

339
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,830
The 1st 1 is the type of content so I can see text slash playing.

340
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,690
If I'm just sending,

341
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:31,920
you know,

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,330
like a regular sentence or regular string if it was supposed to be HTML than I would have

343
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:37,970
to see,

344
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,250
like text slash html instead.

345
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,200
All right,

346
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,180
so you can choose what kind of content you're sending over.

347
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,480
Just not if you choose text slash playing,

348
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,430
but then you send additional content.

349
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,210
Then the channel will not render in the email,

350
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,490
so people will actually be getting tugs on each one times any charters.

351
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,360
If you chose text slash html and sent over a shingle,

352
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,490
could you will actually form at the HTML such that it gets rendered in the person's email

353
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,650
just the way you intended it to be rendered.

354
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,830
But for this example,

355
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:17,620
I leave it a stakes slash plane on I'm going to then give it the contents that would have

356
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,950
come over in that phone call.

357
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,860
The next step,

358
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,460
having built over email object,

359
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,960
is to call our send grid class.

360
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,840
So I'm going to create a variable.

361
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,620
I'm calling it Send really can call it the variables anything you really want.

362
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,810
But then it's new,

363
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:43,370
and then it's slash send grid at Scepter s Capital G on.

364
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,560
Then we're passing in that key value.

365
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,550
All right,

366
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,060
so you see a number of examples online.

367
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,730
Some people create what you call an environment file and then put the key in the file and

368
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,050
then load that through the modified auto.

369
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,190
Too low that environment,

370
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,740
key in tow,

371
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,640
Arson grid.

372
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,660
So their number off ways to accomplish this.

373
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,850
What?

374
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,250
Once again,

375
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,200
I just want the nice Quick,

376
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,800
quick,

377
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,040
quick.

378
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,140
So I'm just helping you to phonics to this service quickly.

379
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,220
So as usual,

380
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,800
we put in our try catch to make sure that and if anything goes wrong,

381
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,300
we catch that exception and we can debug it.

382
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,830
So I'm just going to leave exception as generic.

383
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,460
I won't these special guest.

384
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,600
What kind of exception?

385
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,500
We're looking for Andi.

386
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,800
Off course.

387
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,400
What we want to do if we catch an exception,

388
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,250
is echo the exception on the message.

389
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:38,550
All right,

390
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,410
so this in this one of a bit more verbal someone to say.

391
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,330
Email exception.

392
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,130
Email exception.

393
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,720
Cots.

394
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,550
All right,

395
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,850
so then we print the message and return falls,

396
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,910
so whatever it's called in dysfunction,

397
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,470
otherwise we want to try on.

398
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:02,890
I'm going to call a variable called We'll create a variable called Response on.

399
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,830
Then this response variable is going toe have send greed iroh on the phone shine,

400
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,660
Send on What we're sending is our email object.

401
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
So let's go through this again.

402
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,190
We have our key because this key will give us access to our FBI.

403
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,380
So don't share this key with anybody.

404
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,350
And by the time you're doing,

405
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,780
this tutor of this key won't exist anymore.

406
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,050
So I suggest you get your own and do it yourself instead of trying to copy this one.

407
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:41,810
But you said the key on then you build the email object by in San sheeting a new object off

408
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,190
sen grid meal on meal on.

409
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,120
Then we set the from we set the subject.

410
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,660
We said the tool and you can add as many tools as you need so you can have multiple,

411
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,050
too,

412
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,140
Um,

413
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,520
cause with different values hopefully safe,

414
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,620
you have to send the multiple persons at once.

415
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,030
You could at as many as you need to on.

416
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,420
Then we add the content,

417
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,570
and once again the content can be clean or can be.

418
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,580
HTML is understand.

419
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,590
To copy this on comment,

420
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,670
it'll just to show that we could send html also on,

421
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,840
then we Instead,

422
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,760
she it send grid as a new object.

423
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,820
And then we call the function send and understanding that inside off response on what I'm

424
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,850
going to return is the response Object.

425
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,660
No,

426
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,270
Http has different response courts.

427
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,440
The most common ones are 404 which is when you have ah,

428
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,130
request that was not phoned or 200 when everything was okay.

429
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,790
I think sin grid was sent back to to,

430
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,160
which is also an Okay,

431
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,580
that's like,

432
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,860
that's a good response.

433
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,450
Tohave.

434
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:55,130
So we will be looking for a tool to response upon a successful function car or our action

435
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,060
from this function call.

436
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,450
All right,

437
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,190
on.

438
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,760
If we get anything on that until two,

439
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,670
maybe 300 or 404 100 is better quest in case something is wrong.

440
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:11,210
So we'll be looking out for all of those things Now the next step is to modify our success

441
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,500
paid.

442
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,700
So I'm just going to go and find success that PHP on dine need toe off course,

443
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,120
make success aware off for a new kid on the block which is send email a PHP so I will

444
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,160
require send email under the DB con.

445
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:31,410
I'll just change that old send email that PHP on then,

446
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,760
having done that,

447
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:42,500
I can just modify the court that says his success meaning has the attendee Bean added to

448
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,120
the database successfully.

449
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,310
If yes,

450
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,020
then we will show the success message.

451
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,310
But I'm just going to dispatch that email right before.

452
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,550
So no,

453
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,760
I can say Send e mail.

454
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,500
All right.

455
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,600
Suzie Intestines is helping me along on then my two Coghlan's,

456
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,030
which is that operator I mentioned earlier on that we can just call the function send meal

457
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,030
.

458
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:12,760
So this is me doing calling that function in this class without needing toe.

459
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,880
Create a whole new object.

460
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,430
Andi operate that way.

461
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,790
All right,

462
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,260
so that's the advantage of our static class.

463
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,300
So the send meal form Chantix three parameters,

464
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,690
it experimenter one,

465
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,930
which is the two.

466
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,950
So I'm just into passing or variable email,

467
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,490
which is where we want to send the email toe it takes.

468
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,970
Let me just remind myself quickly it takes a subject.

469
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,660
So I'm going to write the static text you have successfully,

470
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,000
all right,

471
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,410
that she instead I'm sorry.

472
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:56,400
So it's welcome to AT T Conference 2019 for the subject on then our content will what text

473
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,000
you want?

474
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,680
You have successfully registered for this year's I T conference and notice Have that back

475
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,790
slash onda a posture well,

476
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,440
single court here because without the backslash,

477
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,990
it would kind off miss up the flow off my string.

478
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,510
So when I want to put a single court inside off text,

479
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,540
that's starting and ending with single puts,

480
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,440
I can use my back slash.

481
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,940
All right,

482
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,380
So the expectation is that once somebody has filled out the form on,

483
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,620
they've moved on to the success speech that we find that success well,

484
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,210
fire that email onda that would be transferring to the user.

485
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,150
They would just get that success message.

486
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,760
Anyway,

487
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,380
One thing I'm going to fix,

488
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,600
though,

489
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,680
is that specialties because specialty showing that I d.

490
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,980
Based on the data base,

491
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,230
I'm actually just going to fix that quickly before we test this.

492
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,140
So to quickly fix that,

493
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,630
I'm just going to go over to crowd Andi.

494
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,440
I'm going to find the function.

495
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,840
Well,

496
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,280
I think I would have to create a function to get specialty by i D.

497
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,400
So I have one that says,

498
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,540
Get specialty someone to quickly create one just to get the specialty by I d.

499
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,280
All right,

500
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,230
So I call this one,

501
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,600
gets specialty by I d Pass again and I d parameter modified the SQL statement a bit to see

502
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,070
you get from get start from specialties were special.

503
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,110
The idea is equal to just I d on then I did.

504
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,670
Although the wonderful things that you do where you prepare,

505
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,630
bind all parameters and then execute your statement,

506
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,340
Andi Then in the success speech,

507
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,170
I modified it Obits toe include the phone shown called right under the East Success That's

508
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:34,650
really much.

509
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,800
Or where you put this as long as you're you're passing in earlier calling the function and

510
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,450
you're passing in that I d that it needs on then the final change.

511
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:44,690
I mean,

512
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,100
it was instead off echoing the posts like we were before.

513
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:55,950
I'm no echoing the name column coming back from that result that was stored in specialty

514
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,050
name after making that function cop.

515
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,230
So those are the changes.

516
00:23:59,230 --> 00:23:59,810
I just mean,

517
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,240
So we're going to go ahead and fill out this form on,

518
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,130
or we can just give it a quick re fresh so that everything is nice and fresh on.

519
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,290
Then I'm going to go ahead and fill out this form.

520
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:11,790
All right.

521
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,540
So Archibald Douglas has putting all of his information.

522
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,110
He's,

523
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,370
ah,

524
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,300
system administrator on his email addresses.

525
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,310
Loan procedure one.

526
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,770
Any night at gmail dot com,

527
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,790
whatever it is.

528
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,610
And then we go ahead and take submits so we can see here that at least our quarries running

529
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:27,610
,

530
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,820
cause we're not seeing the one artistry or the number.

531
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,220
But we're actually seeing the word system administrator on this would imply that the

532
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,660
operation has been completed successfully.

533
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,120
No,

534
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,880
you can give this a few moments,

535
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,260
but what I wanted to do is go over to send grid on,

536
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,550
verify that the email was despite so you can go to sin grid on.

537
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,190
If you were at the dashboard before then you can go toe activity.

538
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,450
So if you click on activity to the left,

539
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,470
then it will bring up all of the emails that were dispatched by the cones.

540
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,060
Using your a p I key,

541
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,350
Andi will show you home.

542
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,520
Any emails you've dispatched for the month under that are cones.

543
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,130
So I have quite a few here because,

544
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,580
well,

545
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,650
I use the service.

546
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,260
So,

547
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,310
you know,

548
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,190
I would have quite a few,

549
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,170
you may not see as many,

550
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,710
and if you don't see any as yet,

551
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,400
then you can refresh until you see it.

552
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,370
In addition to checking your email,

553
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,260
you may also want to check your email because it would probably go to spam.

554
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,610
So you want to if you don't see it at first sight than you want to check spam just to make

555
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,100
sure that it was really dispatched.

556
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,860
Andi.

557
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,680
If all of that feels,

558
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,720
then you may want to check your firewall because there are times when firewall settings

559
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,140
will prevent the emails from being dispatched from your local machine for maybe I should

560
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,040
say that a different way.

561
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,210
Sometimes firewall settings prevent the A P.

562
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,810
I call from being successful,

563
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,540
so that has something to me before.

564
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,640
But I usually get resounding success.

565
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,050
When I attempt this through.

566
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,700
We will,

567
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,550
having hosted application on Hiroko.

568
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,230
All right,

569
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,940
so by way of confirmation,

570
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,050
here is the email that was just sent.

571
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,530
It's seeing welcome Toe Eddie Conference as a subject that we set it sent to my email

572
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,840
address on the text that we set in the email.

573
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,550
So that's just confirmation that it worked,

574
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,100
and this was from my local machine.

575
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,740
Once again,

576
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,850
you can always check your firewall settings or published a heroic or to make sure that it

577
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,150
works.

578
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,830
So to wrap up this video,

579
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,980
I'm going to publish the heroic ooh published to get a published A miracle on Just test it

580
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,680
once again.

581
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,860
So the first thing we're going to do is bring up,

582
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,960
Get hub for that Stop.

583
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,440
No,

584
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,680
this is a few videos since I've published anything seriously,

585
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,750
that I have quite a few changes 182 to be exact.

586
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,560
It is always recommended that you make as you make changes and you confirm that your

587
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,290
changes work.

588
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,350
You check in your court so you shouldn't never get to the point where I have 182 chickens

589
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,490
to me just because you weren't checking in your court.

590
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,050
All right,

591
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,550
so that's my recommendation.

592
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,280
But for the situation,

593
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,960
I'm going to make one big check in on.

594
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,600
I'm going to have a huge summary where I added user authentication since the last chicken

595
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,640
on die also added e mail dispatch feature.

596
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,360
All right,

597
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,680
so that's that.

598
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,460
That's the chicken that I'm about to make on I'm going to push that to master on.

599
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,980
Give that a few and then after I push it the master for my local reporter push toe origin.

600
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,670
So it goes to get up itself on.

601
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,610
I just realized I remember that it that prematurely I need to update the con Fess,

602
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:40,210
Remember that Khan is looking to our local development database.

603
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:48,000
So I'm just going to come in that oh aan den on comments the settings for our remote server

604
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,000
.

605
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,510
Alright,

606
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,320
so they're more elegant way somebody Just what?

607
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,790
Once again,

608
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,820
this is a basic course.

609
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,820
I'm not trying to make things too complicated So we just un commander more database

610
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,160
connection on.

611
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,410
Then we can just go ahead and change that and you see that gets off for this up kind of

612
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,900
gives you a little takes.

613
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,900
The artists understand to work with that orbited con put come into monster and then push

614
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,810
the origin on.

615
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:18,790
Then we bring up herro coup where we go to our up I'm already in the opsec and go to the up

616
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:18,790
,

617
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,650
then go to deploy on.

618
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:30,040
Then you select the branch Will the branches early must and the new deploy branch all right

619
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,040
,

620
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,640
so we can give Hiroko a little time to cool off,

621
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,900
cause after deploy,

622
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,780
its not accessible the same time,

623
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,140
at least not on our free plan,

624
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,660
so we can give it a few moments.

625
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,410
But once you go ahead and view on,

626
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,780
I'm seeing that I haven't ever here at.

627
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,940
That's because I didn't copy over my user stable from the last few videos.

628
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,980
So I'll just do that quickly in the background.

629
00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:17,190
All right,

630
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,560
and that's done in order is restored to our application.

631
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,640
So let's try and fill oat a new user,

632
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,750
and I'll just reuse the same arch ball.

633
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,750
Less data that I had,

634
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:36,330
since that user would not be in over remote are in my remote database on Submit,

635
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,060
and I see where the operation was completed successfully.

636
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,880
And if I check,

637
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:49,310
send grid and refreshing a couple times on a couple refreshes later there we have our email

638
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,880
that was dispatched to our new registrants,

639
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,070
So I'm back in my court and I'm looking at the success that PHP page where we called the

640
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,840
email function.

641
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,390
The fact is,

642
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,220
we could kind of personalize this email we could say Welcome first name last name.

643
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,260
You know the person's name toe conference.

644
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,350
We can include virtually any information that they just submitted.

645
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:18,080
We can actually include it in our email just by,

646
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,670
well,

647
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:24,160
con fascinating are using interpolation to get that variable into our string.

648
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,860
Another fun fact is that sin greed is powered by twilio,

649
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,090
which is a powerful estimates dispatching service.

650
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,510
So if we wanted to dispatch an SMS to them,

651
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,830
we would have gotten there,

652
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,410
therefore number in the process.

653
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,990
So all of those options are no available to you through this third party service.

654
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,050
Andi.

655
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:52,290
It's all easy to duel using or newly acquired Ph B skills and heroic cool hosting

656
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,550
capabilities.

657
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,980
I hope you guys enjoy this video,

658
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,150
and I'm very interested to see what you guys will use this new superpower to accomplish.
