1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Hey,

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:01,600
guys,

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,160
In this video,

4
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,720
we continue our task off,

5
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,240
hooking up our registration form toe our database.

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,700
You know,

7
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,640
previous video we went into Petri my admin and created our database.

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,970
With two tables on in this video,

9
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:20,550
we will look into how we actually connect to this database from our web application.

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,140
Now,

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,440
to get that process started,

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,800
we'll go back to our project in visual Studio Court on What we want to do is at a new file

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,920
to this entire project on this fire will be responsible for handling the connection to the

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,830
database.

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,270
Soto get this party started.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm going to click on the folder that we created from the beginning called DB.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,880
It's empty right now when we went to select it and create a new file in there.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,690
And I'm going to call this file,

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,350
hon,

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,200
that CEO and dot PHP And that's just a naming convention.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,160
The other tutorials or other sources may have it as db conficker or something else.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,710
It doesn't really matter what you call the file,

23
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,840
but once again,

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,950
you always wanted to be indicative off its purpose.

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,340
Now,

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,390
inside this file,

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm going to start off with my Ph B thugs on.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,590
We're going to see how we build what we call a connection string on.

29
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,990
We'll be using what we call a PDO object.

30
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,360
No,

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,650
there are multiple ways to connect a data base in PHP.

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,000
They're what you call Ap eyes that alot or facilitate the connection between your PHP code

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,350
on the database on the one that we will be using is PDO Now.

34
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:47,080
The reason I'm using PDO is that it offers some more protection than other libraries

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,030
immunity So literally the letters PD or that's there video,

36
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,370
aren't you?

37
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:03,000
See other drivers like my SQL on you'll see my SQL I Those are less secure than PDO,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,900
and video is the one that people recommend you use to prevent things like SQL injection on

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,340
to prevent against other security concerns.

40
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,040
Also,

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,990
by using the PDO method,

42
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,650
you actually reduce the need to connect to the database every time you want to do something

43
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,590
against the database,

44
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,880
so connections can be expensive.

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,620
Andi,

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,670
the more your application is being used is the more connections will be there.

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,170
So off course,

48
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,400
you want to minimize how often somebody connects,

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,090
even if they have toe a lot of the times.

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,910
You don't want to multiply that.

51
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,900
So video offers quite a few benefits to the traditional my SQL In my school,

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,410
I,

53
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,470
um ap eyes on.

54
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,750
But it is what we will be using in this course.

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,870
Noto start modifying or file.

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,720
The first thing that I'm going to do is the clear on variable,

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,910
and I'm going to call it host on.

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,410
I'm going to give it a value.

59
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,050
Now,

60
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,730
the volume giving it is relative to the database server,

61
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,930
meaning my database server is sitting on local horse locals and Petri.

62
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,980
My admin is just a window into this database server.

63
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,600
All right,

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,960
but the database server is at local host,

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,170
so I have two ways I can read toast.

66
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,450
I can see the word loca host.

67
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,550
Or you may also see people refer Toho,

68
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,560
co host by I.

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,270
P has 1 to $7.0.0 not one.

70
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,040
All right.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,750
And I just put this I p address in the context if I attack this into my browser,

72
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,360
All right,

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,690
So remember what happens when I type local host into the browser.

74
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,720
It automatically.

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,430
Brose is to the sump landing Peach look what happens in a type that I p address into the

76
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,940
browser.

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,130
It also Brose is to this landing page.

78
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,050
And that's because that I p address is what the word local host results toe.

79
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,680
All right,

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,600
so you can use them interchangeably or in any time you were a local hosting dinner at this

81
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,310
I p and vice versa.

82
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,390
So if you see the i p address in any other example,

83
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,630
that's really what's this is just another way of seeing local host all right,

84
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,490
someone to leave it with the i p address.

85
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:17,450
So we would learn something new today on going to declare another very bacall db onda db

86
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,430
that we're connecting toe B b is short for database.

87
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,880
So the databases that were looking for and looking to connect toe he's the one that we

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,630
created on understand,

89
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,500
to double check and make sure that I have the name quickly,

90
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,390
which is attendance on the score db someone to type attendance on this score.

91
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,750
Devi Next we have a user.

92
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,120
No,

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,500
my my PC.

94
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,510
My admin did not promise me to log in when I was loading it on.

95
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,230
I did mention that if years prompted.

96
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,270
You could use route with no password and you would get through.

97
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,810
So by default,

98
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,630
once you install my school or Maria DB here,

99
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,390
you're given a default user called route.

100
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,350
All right,

101
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,740
so I'm just going to see route as the user on wherever there's a user,

102
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,360
there's always a request for a password on.

103
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,500
Now,

104
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,020
just a pass is equal to Andi by default route does not have a password.

105
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,920
If you were using having the my SQL Community Edition,

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,610
then you would have been required to put a password on to the roots user at the time of

107
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,490
installation.

108
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,280
But once again,

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,690
if you're using zump one mom for any of these ph B environments all in one installation

110
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,370
packs,

111
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,090
then you would have a user called Roots with no password on that will grant you access to

112
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,010
your database.

113
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,420
This is not the more secure way,

114
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,580
but this is your machine,

115
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,500
so it's fine off course in production.

116
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,350
Then you want to take greater consideration with your user name and password on The last

117
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,250
thing we're going to sit is Ah charset on.

118
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,530
This is really just see what kind of symbols we expect to be working with.

119
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,230
And I'm actually just typing this because this is a standard charge sets.

120
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,150
They don't necessarily have to remember this.

121
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,810
Just appreciate that it goes there.

122
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,260
All right,

123
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,560
so after declaring these variables,

124
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm going to declare another one that I'm going to call BSN.

125
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,060
No,

126
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,740
de Yasin is actually ah,

127
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,610
terminology used in the PDO connectivity.

128
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,740
So it's the way that it connects to the database is just another engine.

129
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,550
All right,

130
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,750
it's short for data source name.

131
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,950
So if you ever heard off jdb c r o d b c are stuff like that,

132
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:45,810
they they all ds in is related to that kind off connectivity are so we're going to do is

133
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,600
actually build a decent connection using these values on.

134
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,450
I'm going to type it out one by one and explain as I go along.

135
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,500
So the first thing that we do is the clear variable TSN.

136
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,270
It doesn't have to be called the assemble once again making variables useful in terms of

137
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,200
their naming on.

138
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,580
I'm going to use double quotation marks because I'm just going to take advantage of the

139
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,570
interpolation one some typing in the text.

140
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,250
So we have my SQL.

141
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,870
So,

142
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,300
firstly,

143
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,710
we declare the driver This is the type of database that we intend to connect.

144
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,920
Oh,

145
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,380
no.

146
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,940
PDO actually supports different databases,

147
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,780
different drivers.

148
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,390
You can use it for Oracle if you had a Microsoft SQL database working with.

149
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:40,750
So this driver is saying that I am about to connick toe a my SQL database and we see colon

150
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,120
and then we feed some some parameters in tow.

151
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,810
This connector.

152
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,150
So the first parameter is host,

153
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,170
and it was the host equals on die can actually just use my variable.

154
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,990
That I said,

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,890
is host.

156
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,350
All right,

157
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,050
so I declared host here.

158
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,750
So instead of typing,

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,470
it's old inside of this string.

160
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,210
I'm just going toe tap it here.

161
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,340
So the advantage of this is that I can always change this without having to modify this

162
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,200
entire string on Another advantage is that they were going to do this once.

163
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,760
So it's not something that you do every time you want to connect with it.

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,880
Every time you're about to build a site,

165
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,320
then you have to do this.

166
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,970
But for the purpose of this website,

167
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,090
we only do this activity one time.

168
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,840
And in this file All right,

169
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,240
so I'm connecting to the horse that I just referenced.

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,950
Variable.

171
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,610
Next parameter is DB name on.

172
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,750
We declare db off top on.

173
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,950
We give it the name.

174
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,950
All right,

175
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,470
So I'm just making reference all of these things,

176
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,860
and then the other thing is charged it on Once again,

177
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,620
we call in the char set,

178
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,990
So this would have constructed on O.

179
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,190
D.

180
00:08:52,190 --> 00:09:01,090
B C like connector four or my SQL instance that's sitting on local host as a as the value

181
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:07,230
here suggests on we want the database called attendance TV on the chance that that we're

182
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,350
working with is this universal and standard one.

183
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,030
In the next line,

184
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm going to do what we call a try,

185
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,510
catch statement.

186
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,650
So try Catches are used for what we call exception handling.

187
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,630
So I see try And then I opened the curly breeze on.

188
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,470
Then after the second appear to bring someone to see catch on.

189
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,290
Then we opened up two parents sees,

190
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,730
and then we have the curly braces again.

191
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,600
So let me just walking through the track.

192
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,650
It's what this block does.

193
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,700
Is it attempts to do something that will be defined in between the open and close for the

194
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,820
try on.

195
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,480
Then if that feels,

196
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,960
then it You can specify what you want to happen here,

197
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,420
where they want to throw an exception.

198
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,020
You want to stop execution or just want to show a nice,

199
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,250
friendly error message that sometimes things happen and you would see a im im aero pop up

200
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,440
unexpected error.

201
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,880
A lot of the times this is what is happening.

202
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,590
They have tried.

203
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,710
They tried operation that you requested.

204
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,600
You didn't work.

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
So they say unexpected error.

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,140
So what we want to do is to try to connect to the database someone to declare on objects or

207
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,450
another variable on.

208
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:27,410
I'm calling a p d o on in PDO and win today find or declare a new instance off a PD or

209
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:27,940
class.

210
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,070
So this class is built into PHP.

211
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:39,280
So we're looking at some object oriented stuff on the inside the parent This is for the PDO

212
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,900
function or class.

213
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,340
Sorry.

214
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,850
We'll be passing in the values D S n So we're passing in Whatever value is inside of that

215
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,350
variable d s n.

216
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:58,680
Then we'll be passing in the user that was defined So we didn't use user initially on,

217
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,730
then were passed in the password on Dwell.

218
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,080
There are other apartments is that could go in there,

219
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,250
but right know that that's all we need.

220
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,750
So we just need the DS in the user on the past.

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,530
Now you notice that there is,

222
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:16,940
Ah,

223
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,320
little Red Line under the capture nets because we need to put what kindof exception we

224
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,530
intend to cats so you can actually go with those apparently sees in a lot of languages,

225
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,260
and it's just a generic catch.

226
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,350
But in this one,

227
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,410
you need the parent disease,

228
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,490
and you need to specify what kind off error you're looking for.

229
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,520
So in this situation,

230
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,660
since we're trying to connect to the PDO,

231
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,710
they gave us an option for PDO exception.

232
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,790
So we're watching to see if there's going to be an arrow with the PDO object.

233
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,560
Andi,

234
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,620
I am going to assign its toe a variable called E.

235
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,450
All right,

236
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,150
so once there's a PDO arrow during this attempt,

237
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,940
then it will catch the arrow on,

238
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,010
then store all the details off the era inside off some variable called E,

239
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,520
and then in the next line you can decide what you want to do it.

240
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,500
So inside of this sketch block,

241
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,900
I'm actually just going to say something like throw new on once used the word through,

242
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,280
it means is going to stop all execution and just display an error.

243
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,950
All right,

244
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,770
So you may not want to do that all the time on your try catches,

245
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,640
but in this situation,

246
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,630
we actually want an error to see if our connection is working or not.

247
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,780
So I want to throw new,

248
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,950
and then I am going to see a PDO exception.

249
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,800
Andi,

250
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,930
I'm going to put in some cord that will get me the message.

251
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,240
So this e here presents an object,

252
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,590
and this object has quite a few functions in it.

253
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,970
So I have a phone sign that says,

254
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,990
get message on this get message function is going to actually print what the era is seeing

255
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:00,990
.

256
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,530
So whatever the area is,

257
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,030
sometimes you want actually read the arrow so that you can Deeble property.

258
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,650
Once you catch the exception.

259
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,530
You can always get the error here,

260
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,750
so I could just echo this without throwing on a new exception.

261
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,560
But once again,

262
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,510
I actually want to stop the execution for something as critical as the database

263
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,330
connectivity,

264
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,080
but you can do it more elegantly by just maybe echoing that old.

265
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,180
There's an error with this,

266
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,580
but the page would still load,

267
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,100
So that's up to you.

268
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,490
So I will leave with this cord on what's once again.

269
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,330
What's supposed to happen is that it's supposed to attempt a connection.

270
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,040
Toe A.

271
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,870
My SQL server phoned a dislocation with this database on supporting that.

272
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,360
Charset on it supposed to try that connection using a user name and a password as provided

273
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,760
here.

274
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,650
So if anything is wrong,

275
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,350
well,

276
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,560
if nothing is wrong,

277
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,220
then this will,

278
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,140
Lord are this will be okay.

279
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,580
And if something is wrong,

280
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,650
then all execution will stop and you see an error message someone to make it a bit more

281
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,060
clear when nothing is wrong.

282
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,310
Island See echo.

283
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,190
So if it tries the connection and nothing goes wrong,

284
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,980
I'm going to see Echo Hello theater basis.

285
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,510
All right,

286
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,790
so if we see these words appearing somewhere on our peace,

287
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,550
then we know that a connectivity or the connection attempt was successful.

288
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:34,190
So now that we've done up this con file and it is in this director under DB what we want to

289
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,770
do is actually include it in our page,

290
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,060
someone to go back to my form on Dougherty Road.

291
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,690
The line.

292
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,830
So what I did was see require once on dime,

293
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,790
requiring the file db slash conduct PHP.

294
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,550
So not because it's not in the includes full.

295
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,000
That means I can't include it.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,860
I have to include it.

297
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,460
Everything that is not native on the page that I want on the page.

298
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm going to have to use either require or the include to get it where it is the is,

299
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,820
though it's only a matter off finding where it is.

300
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,210
So in this situation is in the folder db on the finally Mishcon.

301
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,430
I just see require once when the db folder and get me that file.

302
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:14,990
All right,

303
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,650
So when I refresh my form,

304
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,920
the expectation is that I'm going to see Hello.

305
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,820
Database somewhere printed,

306
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,430
and I refreshed on.

307
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,140
There we go.

308
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,850
Hello?

309
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,250
Databases being echoed to our peach.

310
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,150
All right,

311
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,780
so that's great.

312
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,910
So that's some progress.

313
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,280
No.

314
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,040
What if I got some off my details wrong?

315
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,980
Like like maybe I missed upon the i P address.

316
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,890
I did once to 7.1 dot 0.1.

317
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,370
There's no address anywhere near here that goes by this.

318
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,610
So if I attempted this connection with the wrong data,

319
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,900
what would happen is,

320
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,040
well,

321
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,110
what should happen is that Hilo database would disappear.

322
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,070
So apparently 1 to $7 wonders series valid.

323
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,650
So I'm just going to take with one.

324
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,380
Let's try that experiment So I botched some detail in this case.

325
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,700
Well,

326
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,610
my attempt a budget feel the first time,

327
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,110
but let's I know for sure this won't work.

328
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,900
So let's go back and see what happens on when I refreshed.

329
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,150
Then we see that we caught this error on what we're seeing.

330
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:26,850
Being printed here is the result off us calling the gets message function inside off the

331
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,830
object aren't so.

332
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,960
That's what happens when you are at your core.

333
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,140
That way on,

334
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,840
you could insert once again instead off throwing the exception.

335
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:44,720
I could have let me just comment this oats Onda let me echo on elegant message on.

336
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm actually going to say something like,

337
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,260
Well,

338
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:54,510
I went to print in each one on I'm going to see no database phoned.

339
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,340
All right,

340
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,500
close my H one tug and I wanted to stand out and show that it's dangerous.

341
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,030
Understand,

342
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,920
added the CSS class from bootstrap class equals art.

343
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,550
And then here is one of the dangers off.

344
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,850
Using single quotation on double quotation marks,

345
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,410
I'm going to use double quotation marks on the outside instead on single on the inside.

346
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,350
Someone just made that change quickly on I went to see a text dash Danger.

347
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:29,600
So let me just refresh and show you that the paid still loaded everything still executed.

348
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,220
But the message is being printed,

349
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,750
as expected because no data business phoned.

350
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,960
So that's what I'm saying.

351
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,870
There are multiple ways,

352
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,980
the 100 year errors.

353
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,580
He can do it where it's doomsday.

354
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,500
If something doesn't work for associate,

355
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,650
give a nice message that's user friendly,

356
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,670
and it doesn't cause too much disruption to the flow of your sides.

357
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,120
Off course.

358
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,350
You give that based on how important your task is,

359
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,980
all right,

360
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,730
So I'm going to put but my exception throwing right there,

361
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,170
because if I don't cut into the database there is no form,

362
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,000
there's no nothing else will happen.

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,760
Are should happen.

364
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,600
So that's it for facilitating a connection to the database using the PDO object in the next

365
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,930
video,

366
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,270
we'll look at Hall.

367
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,050
We actually store the values in the database
