1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
no starting from scratch on Didn't deliberately haven't shown you a preview off anything

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,260
that is to come because I want us to be in this journey together on we can all work towards

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,260
,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,610
then seat as it involves.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,060
I know that we are the ones accomplishing all of this.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,070
So the first thing that we want to do is find our server folder having already installed

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,320
some on we go toe see zump HD docks on.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,860
Then we create a new folder inside off this folder.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,900
So each time we have a new site or a new Web application that we're going to be building,

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,210
we want to create a new folder on that folder will be our baseline for everything else to

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:41,490
come.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,350
So the first thing I want to do is create this folder on I'm going to call it attendance.

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,180
All right,

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,850
so that is our new project attendance.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,860
The next thing I want to do is open this project in visual studio court.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:04,220
Someone's going to open a visual studio code on get that synchronization underway Now.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,740
I had a previous project open and that's fine.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,550
You may have been doing other things that's OK but you can always get started by going toe

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,150
file goto open folder on.

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,930
Then you find the folder which is sees some Ishi docks and then you select the one that you

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,120
know.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,060
Is it going to be your baseline on?

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,800
Then you select on.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,160
Then you let visual studio cord reorganize itself accordingly.

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,720
We have a very empty folder.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,960
So this is what your interferes is going to look like at the end of it.

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,750
No,

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,510
by this stage,

29
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,230
already comfortable with the pH B pattern,

30
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,690
Andi,

31
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,460
if not you can always backtrack to my previous videos where I went through step by step

32
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,570
with whole pH.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,290
B interacts with each hole.

34
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,910
We get everything working now,

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,290
the first thing that always goes in tow.

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,550
Any PHP website is and is a PHP page called index.

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:03,460
So Index is always going to be your first file should always be your first file on that

38
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,140
would represent maybe your home pitch.

39
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,400
But once again,

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,150
every Web server always looks for a file called index to Lord first.

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,960
Next,

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,140
I'm going to go ahead and build all the full of structures because for other files that

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,610
aren't necessarily website faster don't want everything happening at the same level,

44
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,240
so I'm just going to bring them out into different folders.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,600
So I'm going to add a new folder just by clicking this new folder button here in Visual

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,410
Studio Court on the first folder I'm going to add,

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,570
is what we call includes.

48
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,860
So my includes folder will have.

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,630
Well,

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,350
we went to include and require.

51
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,210
What happens is that sometimes we have external files,

52
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,950
maybe helper files with,

53
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,350
like,

54
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,790
a Class or Leo Files.

55
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,330
We can put them in here,

56
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,970
and then we just referenced them as we go along.

57
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,670
So haven't includes folder.

58
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,050
I'm going to create a CSS folder because maybe we'll have style sheets.

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,870
I'm going to create a scripts folder on Be careful when adding Fuller's because if you have

60
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,890
the polar selected and you click new folder,

61
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,610
then it's going to turn at it.

62
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,460
Underneath that,

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,250
so is so just a click.

64
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,530
Make sure nothing is selected and then you click new folder.

65
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,030
All right,

66
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:22,210
so I have scripts because maybe we'll have J query or JavaScript code running in our sight

67
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:30,480
on going to create one and call it db db Short for database aren't because well,

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,910
maybe I want the court files that will be interacting with the database specifically in a

69
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,330
folder.

70
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,180
So that's why I'm doing this separations.

71
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,590
Anything I you see at the root here or call the route off the folder would be a director

72
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,180
upset file,

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,740
and everything else in a folder is just for referencing purposes.

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,570
But once again,

75
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,560
this delineation is occurring because you don't want everything in one place.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,340
Now the first thing I want to do is start doing my nails for my Petes.

77
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,910
So in previous videos,

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,960
I would have mentioned that you can always do ish email call on five and you get what I

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,910
call the HTML skeleton that every webpage should have,

80
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,720
at the very least,

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,190
fire.

82
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,470
But then I want to take this a step further,

83
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,800
and I want to use bootstrap for my loads.

84
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,960
So just as a reminder,

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,680
we can go toe boots,

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,250
get bootstrap dot com.

87
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,300
Andi.

88
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,520
There you will see all of the documentation relating to bootstrap chicken is Go ahead and

89
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,790
click that on.

90
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,170
When you want to documentation.

91
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,330
You see all of the all of the documentation as it relates the bootstraps,

92
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,690
so I could actually just use this skeleton where they're giving me the same tugs assist

93
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,230
under.

94
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,210
But they're also giving me the stash.

95
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,750
She references that I need four bootstrap so that once I put that in my sight,

96
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,280
any shim a piece that I have that many interference of these automatically has bootstrap

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,090
built in.

98
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,210
So I'm going to go ahead on and copy this cord from the bootstrap website.

99
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,930
Andi,

100
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,350
I'm going to replace it.

101
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,630
Use it to replace the existing code in visual Studio court on dso.

102
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,020
No,

103
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,910
I have Ah,

104
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,600
bootstrap.

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,950
Ready in decks page.

106
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,040
Now,

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,990
once again for every piece that I would like to have these styles and all the bootstrap

108
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,450
cord,

109
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,780
I would have to actually copy and paste discord each time on day.

110
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,130
One way that I'm going to reduce the need for that or eliminate the need for that is to

111
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,180
start using My includes someone to create to file Syrian.

112
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,230
Includes on going to call one hitter dot PHP on the other one on,

113
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,050
still in the includes folder on went to call their own.

114
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,530
So you can always click the folder to make sure that you're selecting the folder so that

115
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,430
when you add new file,

116
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,830
it goes directly into that folder.

117
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,430
On the other one is footer dot PHP No,

118
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,940
I want my loads to be a one time activity,

119
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,050
meaning I want to set up My reference is one please.

120
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,020
And if I have to sit up enough by,

121
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,860
I want everything to be one police so or do it one time.

122
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,130
Rather,

123
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,940
So instead of doing it every time I have a new page,

124
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,780
I'm just going to do it one time and make a reference as necessary.

125
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,980
And so I put the cord in my index speech.

126
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,340
But what I'm going to do is remove it on segmented into the relevant pages.

127
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,000
So my head adare Ph.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,450
B.

129
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,760
Should have called.

130
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,920
That goes at the top off the page on the footer dot PHP should have called.

131
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,100
That goes at the bottom of the page on this court should be called.

132
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,850
That doesn't ever change on a page,

133
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,100
so you'll notice that most of says they're consistent.

134
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,950
Every piece enough bar looks the same on the footer looks the same.

135
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,490
I had The filter is the last part off the beach.

136
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,100
Most websites are standardize that way.

137
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,220
So we're going to join that revolution on.

138
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,370
We're going to make sure all four sites are standard or or site right now is standardize

139
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,520
with awe again across our Peter.

140
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,890
Sorry.

141
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,590
So what I'm going to do is take from body because every p it starts with body.

142
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,010
What comes in between body is unique to the page.

143
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,440
Alright?

144
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,220
Someone to take from body were all the way up.

145
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,920
So from doc types of body,

146
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,550
I'm going to cut from the index speech on understand to place it in the header peach.

147
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,920
All right,

148
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,950
so every page that references header is going toe automatically have that at the top of it

149
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,250
on then in the same fashion.

150
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,100
I'm going to take everything below.

151
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,590
What?

152
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,140
Whatever contents are in our content is just Hello,

153
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,860
world on.

154
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,520
That's fine.

155
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,660
But everything below that should also be standards.

156
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,090
I'm going to take everything below.

157
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,370
Whatever the content would be caught that and place it inside off footer.

158
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,170
All right,

159
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,140
I understand the species don't a bit.

160
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:05,150
So all of these javascript files need to be referenced on the page on all of these tags as

161
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,350
well as the style sheet for bootstrap.

162
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,390
They all need to reference on the page.

163
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,750
So then that leaves the question.

164
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,200
Where are the references?

165
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:21,890
So what we're going to do is open a PHP tug at the top on inside this speech,

166
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,250
Be talk I'm going to see require.

167
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,020
So we looked at include and require on the differences that include will try toe,

168
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,720
find the file.

169
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,410
And if it doesn't,

170
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,720
you just use a warning and say,

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,020
Hey,

172
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,240
you know,

173
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I tried and I didn't find a fire.

174
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,960
So I'm sorry,

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,860
whereas require will stop your website and see Hey,

176
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,260
I can't find this file sandwiches require and then you have two options are requiring two

177
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,350
options for include which would be the once they have include once and they have require

178
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,880
ones.

179
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,460
This means that if by some mistake I accidentally required to are included,

180
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,590
two files are the same.

181
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,450
Fire other twice.

182
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,680
Then be if you will actually try to include it twice.

183
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,210
However,

184
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,020
if I say include once or require once even if I repeat this directive to require the sea

185
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,180
and file elsewhere,

186
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,390
you already included it are required it so it won't do it a second time.

187
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,310
So That's the difference between the the require and require once and the seam is for

188
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,550
include and include one.

189
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,780
So I'm going to go ahead and see require once because I really only wanted one time on.

190
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,530
Then quotation marks on I just in with a cynical done so that I don't forget.

191
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,940
But inside the quotation marks,

192
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going to put the path to the file that I'm requiring.

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,850
So at the top off the page,

194
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,250
the first file I'm need to require before anything else,

195
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,300
even if I have other things I want to require.

196
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,170
The first thing I should be requiring is my hitter,

197
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,480
because I hit her has in the top part off May each dimmer body on Bush,

198
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,570
potentially whatever content comes at the top off the page,

199
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,260
All right,

200
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:03,610
so I'm just going to require once and I'm going to say includes because that's the folder.

201
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,340
All right,

202
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,270
so the files header and footer are currently inside includes Fuller.

203
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,400
So to get for them,

204
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,990
I have to see includes on then say slash on then hitter.

205
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:22,590
Not PHP on then I can just copy this because it's the same concept for the footer on I'm

206
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,170
requiring once the footer.

207
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,810
So I'm just going to change this reference the footer dot PHP So as many times as I have

208
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,950
are as many files as I have in the includes folder that I need on a page.

209
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,500
I can just reference them in this same fashion off course at the appropriate points.

210
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,030
All right,

211
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,580
Another thing that I want to do is make sure that I'm setting the title across all the

212
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,230
pages because it's set one place here on.

213
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,280
That's a static sitting here.

214
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,110
But if I have another page like when we get to actually building the register and viewing

215
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,770
stuff and so on,

216
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,340
each page is going to have a different title,

217
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,670
they all can say hello,

218
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,150
world,

219
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,460
Someone to me that the dynamic by introducing a variable that I'm going to call title at

220
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,440
the top on I went to see Title is equal to on this Oh,

221
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,990
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,210
I'm declaring it outside of the Ph.

223
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,570
B.

224
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,310
Todd.

225
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,610
So you notice that the color coding was not There was just white takes because he would

226
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,850
have rendered in HTML.

227
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,370
So I need to actually put this in between the PHP tags All right on,

228
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:27,650
then.

229
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:33,760
I'm going to be clear it before the require on that is because remember,

230
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,720
in programming,

231
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,620
everything is done in sequence.

232
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,400
So if I referenced title inside here,

233
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,430
which I'm going to do,

234
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:49,420
I'm going to say I want to print title and I can always just pretty static text.

235
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,840
Well,

236
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,150
I can't.

237
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,860
Just pretty tight.

238
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,080
That would literally print dollar san title Softworks after I want to put my static take.

239
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,500
So this is attendance that's up Name and then I'm going to see it dash.

240
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,790
So that's a static text.

241
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,180
But in the dynamic parts,

242
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
which is title,

243
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,950
I need to wrap it inside the PHP thugs.

244
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,560
Someone to see open that Ph B Echo title on Echo.

245
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,460
So you print.

246
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,990
So I want to print to this.

247
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,460
Tug the content off this variable,

248
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,260
and I'm just going to close this quickly.

249
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,330
All right,

250
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,240
so they're all married.

251
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,860
Lines are gone,

252
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,270
so I'm going to always have attendants dash,

253
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,110
but then relative to the value off title,

254
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,900
whatever comes out to the dash is prone to change.

255
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,070
So on the index speech,

256
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,370
my title is going to be index on.

257
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:48,230
I declare it and set the value on then I require this so that by the time it includes this

258
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,190
file title would have already been declared on initialized.

259
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,620
And so it knows exactly what it is.

260
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,850
The echo in this statement.

261
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,090
Another thing I'm going to add to this project while we're on this topic is a CSS file.

262
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:08,770
So there are times when we want our or little flare that bootstrap in its native Andy for

263
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,610
state will not provide.

264
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,270
It does a number of things,

265
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,190
but it doesn't do every single thing.

266
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,820
So what I'm going to do is add my own CSS file,

267
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,070
and I'm just going to click on the CSS folder,

268
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,790
Click New File on.

269
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,780
I'm just going to call it site side,

270
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,550
not CSS,

271
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,090
And you can use any special characters in the fire naming society,

272
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,880
not CSS.

273
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,260
All right,

274
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,870
I know it's blank and I leave it blank because I haven't found any use for it just yet,

275
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,830
But I'm still going to include it in my header that BHP.

276
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,480
So I'm going toe underneath the bootstrap section.

277
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,210
Add a link link row equals style.

278
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,430
She it All right on,

279
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,970
then the interests is going to be the past to the file,

280
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,630
which is CSS slash onda fire Name is site dart.

281
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,390
CSS are.

282
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,730
And then I can close this.

283
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,430
I don't need all of these attributes.

284
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,350
These are the two major attributes that you need when you are including a star.

285
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,390
Sheets are so having done all off that When I lowered my index page,

286
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,360
I expect to see reference being made to bootstrap reference being made to my style sheet.

287
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,580
The title should be reflective off whatever value I put their aunt they were going to see

288
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,100
Hello world Onda.

289
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,460
We should see a foot or so.

290
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,710
I'm going to modify the footer a bit on.

291
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm going to add,

292
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:49,850
uh if Andi I am going toe print inside off this Div.

293
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,270
Let me see what's good prints.

294
00:14:53,270 --> 00:15:00,870
I'm just into put the PHP tug on,

295
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,350
then went to echo copyrights.

296
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,310
Andi,

297
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,780
I think I can do something like it's why.

298
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,380
All right,

299
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm going to contact you.

300
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,520
Needs used to use a full stop some printing the word copyright on then I space and then I'm

301
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,650
calling captain eating the year the deeds,

302
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,370
right?

303
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,800
The year so be it.

304
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,290
Why should give me about the year.

305
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:35,900
All right,

306
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,360
so that's what I did there.

307
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,150
And then I'm just going to close this def.

308
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:44,400
So I'm going to preview this site as it is.

309
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,790
I'm bringing in my browser,

310
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,480
open a new tab on,

311
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,450
Then I'll navigate the local host.

312
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,510
Which brings me to my some dashboard.

313
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,980
But that's dashboard.

314
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,300
I don't want dashboard.

315
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,990
The up I'm looking at is my attendance up.

316
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,530
All right,

317
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,790
so attendance on,

318
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,890
then that should Lord.

319
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,800
All right,

320
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,190
so we have on error here.

321
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,590
Oh,

322
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,850
I made an arrow in defining the deeds command.

323
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,420
The era was that I should have put this in quotation marks,

324
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,750
so I just fixed that,

325
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,950
and then we go back and refresh on.

326
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,970
There it is 19.

327
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,040
I guess 19 is 2019 right?

328
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,610
So you can look our own the the manipulation commands.

329
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,230
And I have a video on that.

330
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,800
You can backtrack to my video on the D time manipulation to see exactly how we can get

331
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,630
different values printed out,

332
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,210
has released the deeds.

333
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:47,000
Now we're going to make one more adjustment on that is toe actually not have our content

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,330
stopped onto the left margin like that.

335
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,280
So What we want to do is make use off bootstraps.

336
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,020
Uh,

337
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,070
they call it the Container.

338
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,600
So I think in layout,

339
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,770
you see something about how we can use a continue narrative class that actually,

340
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,740
you know,

341
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,010
kind of center lines are content in between the margins.

342
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,750
The extreme margins off our page aren't on most most websites kind of flew by that.

343
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,910
I don't always go extreme after extreme right there.

344
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,550
Like leaves some space in between.

345
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,960
So I'm going to just modify my header on footer to accomplish this.

346
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,290
And there is someone to do both.

347
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,430
Is this What would happen is that I could say give here,

348
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,770
Andi,

349
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,760
close the div.

350
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,670
So my content is in between these lives on.

351
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:50,030
Then I can say class equals container on what this would do is actually invoked that class

352
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,500
our own.

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:50,910
Hello,

354
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,130
Also,

355
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,680
when I refresh you see Hello world move on The copyrights did not move So my footer

356
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,610
contended moved But my page content moved the this please find this works But then the

357
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,260
don't side of this is that when I have another page and I need to seem effect after keep on

358
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,680
saying give class equals container on,

359
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,070
then put in my content.

360
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,160
So what I'm going to do is actually take this old.

361
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,820
Since this is going,

362
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,760
how is going to repeat?

363
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,320
And I always want our pages toe Have this court in it.

364
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,390
I'm going toe cut this and please it as the first thing in my body.

365
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,880
Tug.

366
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,710
So we're opening the body tug here in our hitter on.

367
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,030
Then after the body talk,

368
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,420
I would have put this contain a class anyways,

369
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,420
So I put that inside the hitter so that every time I include ahead or require the header,

370
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,850
this is implied on off course.

371
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,700
I need to close it.

372
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,150
So I'm just going toe always close it as the first thing in the footer.

373
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,580
So,

374
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,450
uh well,

375
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,190
yeah,

376
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,810
I want to put their content also get pushed away.

377
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,360
So this is inside.

378
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,500
This would be my footer.

379
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,280
So if I just give it up on i d So I know what it is.

380
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,730
A boat I'll say footer.

381
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,690
So on ideas.

382
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,290
An excellent way to identify what your elements are.

383
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:08,860
Four.

384
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,400
So I just have a random Dave Andi,

385
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,740
I just to go out to remember what it's for So if I say Dave on,

386
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,310
just give it an I D footer,

387
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,440
I'll always remember that old that's what This devious four.

388
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,170
So that's the Po off using ID's.

389
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,130
But further to that,

390
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,580
I'm going to put this closing live after the filter tive all right and understand the

391
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,940
tablets.

392
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,640
They can see where everything starts and stops.

393
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,120
So this closing give seems random in this speech.

394
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,920
But then when you look at it relative to the header,

395
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,150
it's opening here on its a glass container on its closing here in the Footer on DSO.

396
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,730
When I refresh my page,

397
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,740
I expect to see that my foot or content will also join Hello,

398
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,850
world also inside that container.

399
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,150
Alright on,

400
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,900
then just still close this out.

401
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm just going to make reference to the paid source and we see that everything fits

402
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:05,920
together.

403
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,200
Everything is snapping together as if we had one big Asian appears.

404
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,880
So all of this from line to straight up the line 17 would have been a referenced inside the

405
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,570
hitter dot PHP file and then we have our content inside off index and content content

406
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,460
content on.

407
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,320
At the end of it all,

408
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,830
we have or closing part,

409
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,700
which is all constant in our footer PHP.

410
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,660
So once again,

411
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,060
the poor off doing Leo's this ways that you can make the change one time in one file,

412
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,490
and it ripples across every page that makes reference to this one file.

413
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,300
Now that we have our Leo,

414
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,310
it's don't.

415
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,930
The next thing we want to do is start designing a form and start looking at the different

416
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,170
methods off submission.
