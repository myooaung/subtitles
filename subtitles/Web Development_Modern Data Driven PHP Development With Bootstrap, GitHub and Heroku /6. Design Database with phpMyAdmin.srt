1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Hey,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,440
guys.

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,730
In all our previous videos,

4
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,650
up to this moment,

5
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,090
we have been looking at designing a form,

6
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,550
submitting the data on being able to view it after submission.

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:17,070
The next major step to take after doing all of this wonderful work is to actually store

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,840
this data that tomorrow we can view it the day after and essentially we are creating a

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,380
registration system for a 90 conference.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,780
So at the end of the day,

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,450
we need to see a full list off everybody who has filled out this form.

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,050
The next major requirement for this to be accomplished is a database.

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,600
Our objective for this video is to start or database creation process.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,970
And we will be using PHP my admin to design a database in Maria db slash my SQL No to get

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,510
started,

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,460
we first need to launch PHP my admin.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,110
And to do that,

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:01:02,000
we just open a new tub in or browser and then we can rose toe our local host address.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,100
But the application that we're going toward the folder is PHP my I mean art.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:17,090
So that's a little the letters Ph b m y a d M i n aren't So if you type that in and it

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,930
doesn't work,

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,490
then you probably want to make sure that your my ESC UAL service is running sick and just

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,960
open zump and make sure that my SQL is up and running.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,460
Andi,

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,860
It should work,

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,470
all right?

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,860
No,

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,890
something's the note.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,670
I will say my SQL a lot because for the years that has been the default database engine

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,710
that comes packaged in Xam,

31
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,320
pour one for any off those server ph.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,250
B environment applications.

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,390
More recently,

34
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,970
there has been another version off my school called Maria DB.

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,090
And so you see them.

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,850
You used very interchangeably quite often.

37
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,110
No.

38
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,990
If you have successfully Bro's two Petri,

39
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,510
my admin than your screen would look something like this.

40
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,870
If it does prompt you for lugging,

41
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,750
then you can use route with no password.

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,730
That usually works.

43
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,400
And if you still have difficulty,

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,250
you can let me know and I will assist you.

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,860
No PHP.

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,640
My admin is a database management system designed well,

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,000
really.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,030
For my ask your slash Maria DD it's completely were based on,

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,770
and it would have been installed when you installed some.

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,140
So this is a Web based portal that allows you to manipulate the database as you need to,

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,310
without any additional overhead off,

52
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,950
opening another application and using up too many resources.

53
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,860
So it's really handy and quiet clean.

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,530
It's easy to use on,

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:52,050
so we will be using this to design our database that will be accepting data from this form

56
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,050
.

57
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,010
No,

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,440
based on the nature of this form,

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,090
I have scoped two tables in my design on It's Okay if you create wanted,

60
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,370
we could create one table to store everything.

61
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,720
So we just know that we're feeling wanted with all the information on day,

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,050
I'll explain why I have two tables when I am designing the tables.

63
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,790
So the tables that we're going tohave will be one attendee on to area off.

64
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,990
Expertise aren't on.

65
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,220
I'll explain why I'm making a table just for ear off expertise so we can go back to Peach

66
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,010
Member at men on then to create a new database.

67
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,810
We click on this new this new button over here,

68
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:39,090
that link and then that will bring up a dialog box or change appeared rather and ask us for

69
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,590
the name off the database so we'll just call this one attendance.

70
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,880
So I always name my databases.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,970
Um,

72
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,700
clearly enough that I know exactly what application it is relating to so I can see

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,730
attendance underscore Bebe art,

74
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,660
and then we're going to go ahead and click,

75
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,450
create,

76
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,770
and then it's going to then move on to allowing us to start creating tables.

77
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,000
So the first table,

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,130
um,

79
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:09,780
went to create is a 10 B on the number of columns I want because I can do all of the

80
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,220
granted.

81
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,800
I can change that along the way,

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,840
but I can just counter and say I want 123456 columns,

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,210
seconds increases number 26 and then click Goal on.

84
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,350
Then the next screen is asking me toe actually fill out what I want so well,

85
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,480
actually should have gotten an extra column,

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,350
and I'll see why.

87
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,500
So the first column that I usually put in any database I'm designing is on auto

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,050
incriminating primary key.

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,000
So the 1st 1 would be an I d.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,150
I'm going to call it a 10 d underscore I d.

91
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,160
On.

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,950
I leave the data type of int Andi,

93
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:00,330
I'm going to one say that it should be a eyeota increment Means is going to co owned by

94
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,650
itself.

95
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,340
So that means for every record that goes in this column,

96
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,500
the value in this column will always change.

97
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,380
And so that will always be unique.

98
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,520
And so this will be my primary key,

99
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:19,210
since every database properly designed it Abi's should be should comprise records that are

100
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,880
uniquely identified on having our primary key that is unique is step number one.

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,390
So the easiest way to make sure that you will always have a unique idea because based on

102
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,720
the data we're collecting,

103
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,800
there is nothing unique.

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,050
The only maybe the email address has to be unique each time and really and truly doesn't

105
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,570
because I'm not going to stop somebody from using the same email address twice.

106
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,090
So there's nothing here that really says old.

107
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,120
This person is definitely unique,

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,790
so I'm going to create my own unique value.

109
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,020
Call it attendee.

110
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,120
I d make it auto incremental ing Andi,

111
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm also going to and then that promise the addition off on index,

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,230
where they're asking if I want to make it a primary index.

113
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,780
Others go on.

114
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,470
What that did was to create the index called Primary so That's how we get the primary key.

115
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,210
All right,

116
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,780
on auto increments.

117
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,920
Just by enabling auto increment,

118
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
it's just going to say,

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,430
Oh,

120
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,200
is this supposed to be the primary key on By enabling that,

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,200
then we know we have the primary key that is also implementing.

122
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,380
So then I'll go ahead and create a column that corresponds with each data point that I

123
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,230
intend to stores first name,

124
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,890
last name,

125
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,720
date of birth on DSO.

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,850
I'm just going to feel those old in Petri.

127
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,590
My admin.

128
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,880
So our first name and then the data type for first name can't be int it.

129
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,740
It has to be something that would be like a string.

130
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,310
So we databases they're not.

131
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,120
As for giving a speech,

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,010
be with BHP.

133
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,810
The data type didn't matter for the variable.

134
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,590
I could put text number everything inside off any type of variable.

135
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,340
But in the database you have to be very,

136
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,270
very special because what kindof data will be stored inside that column.

137
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,110
So the most popular ones that you see will use are at the top on.

138
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,180
We have our char,

139
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,930
which is one used for text a lot,

140
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,940
and then we also have text,

141
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,570
All right,

142
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,550
so you can use either one.

143
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,800
I'm going to stick to barter because Varta has been around for a while.

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,020
And that's what everybody has always been using.

145
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,400
And that's the more popular on.

146
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,530
You'll always see another database engines.

147
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,650
I'll just use var char onda.

148
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,550
I'll set this length toe 50.

149
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,930
So by setting Bartsch are,

150
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,860
which is a text on the 50.

151
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm saying that I am allowing this column to store any block off text upto 50 characters

152
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,540
big.

153
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,440
All right,

154
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,180
I think I can set defaults and all sorts of things,

155
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,890
but I really don't need to sit anything else because I don't need a default.

156
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,750
Value should be getting it from the form on the other.

157
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,940
The other options don't really apply,

158
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,140
so I'm not going to put those in.

159
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,980
So I just move onto the next one,

160
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,420
which is last name and last name.

161
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,310
I'm sure you'll agree.

162
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,540
Kit can get the same treatment as first team,

163
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,360
and I also me that 50.

164
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,220
You can increase this if you wish.

165
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,270
Maybe 100 because sometimes you do have people coming with some very unique and long names

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,270
.

167
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,390
So what will happen is that if somebody feels old here,

168
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,960
form on their name is more than the number.

169
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,850
You sit here,

170
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,400
it will truncate it so it will only store as many characters as it can.

171
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:42,670
So sitting a bigger number is always a good idea in case you're anticipating that ah based

172
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,670
value is not practical.

173
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,270
All right,

174
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,050
so our first name last name next is did off birth.

175
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,270
All right,

176
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,410
so notes that this does not necessarily have to line up with the label or the name or the

177
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,040
idea that you give the control because mapping will be done in another way.

178
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,650
But you always want to make sure that you you have defined some space to store some value

179
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,820
on date off birth would not be a number.

180
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,210
It's more off a date.

181
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,900
So I'll use the date data type because I'll be storing at date inside off that column.

182
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,980
I don't need to set a length for the value.

183
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,930
So you know what is that?

184
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,050
Sometimes subtle.

185
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,280
And sometimes you don't.

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,970
It doesn't need a length.

187
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,350
They doesn't need a length.

188
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:34,850
The other two columns would be email address Onda contact number.

189
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,970
All right.

190
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,040
On both of these would be var char Onda,

191
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,280
said email address to 100 on the contact number.

192
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,410
I'm going to sit as Varta are also not int because people may come and they use their

193
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,440
dashes and their brackets when they're tapping in their numbers,

194
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:01,390
because some people type their numbers like that and then species right?

195
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,200
So you may end up with variations unless you're going to be very strict with your mosque,

196
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,150
and even then you don't want to use a number.

197
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,400
I my personal rule of thumb,

198
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,600
is don't use a number data type if you don't intend to do month on the column.

199
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,330
So we're not going to be doing any mathematics with the person's contact.

200
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,640
Numbers are leave that as Varta on the typical number is up to 11 or 13 characters.

201
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Also said this the 15 so that anybody,

202
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,820
from any reason whether use 11 digits or 13 digits are you are one extra one.

203
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,170
There's no space for you.

204
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,970
All right,

205
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,490
on,

206
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,690
we left out a column,

207
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,990
which would be the era off expertise,

208
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,780
so I'm just going to add a new column.

209
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,840
So we ran out off columns because I asked for six But I used one off the six to do

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,650
something else.

211
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,960
So at the top here,

212
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,180
I can just see odd one columns are just let go.

213
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,820
And then that just gives me another column.

214
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,200
So I'm going to say special tea.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,610
All right,

216
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,780
Onda,

217
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,940
I'm going to leave that as it on.

218
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,790
Do you see why?

219
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,260
So I'm going to say specialty.

220
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,410
I d All right on then I can choose to preview the SQL because really,

221
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:16,720
actually,

222
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,680
this is just going to execute some SQL in the background on If you are not sure about SQL

223
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,880
or the language itself,

224
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,610
you can trick or my other tutorials on my SQL development data database development and

225
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,150
mastery.

226
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:36,170
And you can also check out my other set of videos on Microsoft SQL Server for everyone.

227
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,200
So,

228
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,890
without previewing my the SQL that would be used to execute this,

229
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,690
I can district save which will actually involve the SQL in the background on give us our

230
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,960
table and then this is our table design and structure.

231
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,080
So we look and we see all off our or columns as they were defined.

232
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,560
So you see,

233
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,750
this little key indicates that this is the primary key,

234
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,100
all right.

235
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,220
And then they tell you that it's also incremental.

236
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,860
So that means for every value that goes in on,

237
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,850
uh,

238
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,090
value will be generated uniquely in this column.

239
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,850
No,

240
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,990
I did say that we would have to tables,

241
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,380
and I would explain why.

242
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,100
So you noticed that I use specialty I d.

243
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,610
Instead off specialty as a bar chart,

244
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,100
even though we're asking for Well,

245
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,680
we're showing words over here,

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,660
but we're not going to be storing words on.

247
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,430
The reason for that is I don't want to store words it to me.

248
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,690
It is useless tohave database add mean 20 times in my database.

249
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,350
Instead of doing that,

250
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,980
I'm just going to create another table for just the specialties.

251
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,750
Andi,

252
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,960
I went to reference the that table whenever somebody selects something from this drop known

253
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:51,960
.

254
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
So in other words,

255
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,540
if I had a new specialty to this list,

256
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,360
then this drop down list should automatically pull that from that table.

257
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,490
I shouldn't have to go into made into my html every time.

258
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,100
And if you remember the money or presents off adding the options and then I would have to

259
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,430
go on,

260
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,930
I don't know the option on then that that can be tedious.

261
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,910
So what I'm going to do is create a table that will have the sole purpose of storing the

262
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,890
list of specialties because we only have four on DWI.

263
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,180
No,

264
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,350
I tease our broader,

265
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,430
um carrier than just four specialty.

266
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,970
So we this will give us greater flexibility in managing our lists on wherever we have a

267
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,720
drop down list.

268
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
It's good if that dropped on the streets.

269
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,410
It's data from a table.

270
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:43,250
So I'm goingto go to new create the table called specialties.

271
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,500
All right,

272
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,440
on,

273
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,200
I need a specialty on the score I d.

274
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,540
So I always start off with my i d column on.

275
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm going to make it also implementing,

276
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
which will prompt me to make it a primary key.

277
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,100
And I just go on interned.

278
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,690
Everything else is good on,

279
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:03,900
then.

280
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,640
I'm just going to have another column.

281
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,790
That's his name.

282
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,850
So this this would be the idea,

283
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,830
and this will be the name.

284
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,580
My name would be the name of the specialty.

285
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,750
So the text value that is associated with this idea will go in.

286
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,710
This column aren't on.

287
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,690
Then I'll just meet that one of our char on.

288
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,870
I can do this 1 50 on,

289
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,810
then I'll save.

290
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,310
And so I have two tables.

291
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:36,080
So I have specialty specialties and I have attendees so know that we have this new table on

292
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,610
the block and we need to establish that specialty I d from the specialties table is

293
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,960
somewhat related to an m Just going to click on the table here,

294
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,540
attendee.

295
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,010
Unethical.

296
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,470
Suppose with African structure on,

297
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,340
we want to establish that these two are related and literally the word related applies

298
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,530
because in databases you have what you call relationships.

299
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:04,160
So we need to establish that there is a relationship between the specialty i d in our

300
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,730
attendee table on the specialty I d in our specialties table aren't so I'm going to go back

301
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,590
to my attendee table Click on the structure on that I'm going to click relation view.

302
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,460
So have table structure were relation view on Then this will know asked us to set up what

303
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,840
we call foreign key constraints.

304
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,610
No,

305
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,500
In a nutshell,

306
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,470
our primary key is a unique value in in one table meaning attendee,

307
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,950
I d is the primary key in their 10 de table.

308
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,950
However,

309
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,930
we need to reference the primary key off the specialty table inside the attendee table,

310
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,090
and that's what makes it a foreign key.

311
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,570
So it's a primary key in the specialty stable.

312
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,050
But over here in that 10 detail is going to be,

313
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,150
ah,

314
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,950
foreign key.

315
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,570
Another thing with this constant is that if I have four specialties in the specialties

316
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,040
table,

317
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,700
I can't reference value in the attendee table.

318
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,630
That doesn't take this done.

319
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,730
That said so It's another level of protection to make sure that your data is going to be

320
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,070
clean and it's going to be solid.

321
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,180
So I'm just going to add this constraint name and number one to give it a name that tells

322
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,330
me what it is for so f k short for foreign key on.

323
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,400
It's a foreign key between attendee Onda Ah,

324
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,670
specialties.

325
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,550
All right,

326
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,340
so that's my naming convention.

327
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,830
You could name this puppies if you wanted to,

328
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,920
but if you name the puppies and took a sabbatical and came back,

329
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,840
I looked at your court.

330
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,400
It wouldn't make much sense.

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,280
So the point is,

332
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,400
you want to give this a name that is actually symbolic off what it is for so my knees

333
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,600
saying that this is a foreign key constraint between the attendee table on the specialty

334
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,880
stable on.

335
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,820
I can leave the restrict if you change this.

336
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,260
The cascading means that if you delete the primary key value from the primary table that it

337
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,100
would delete every related value.

338
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,470
So I'm going to leave these for no on.

339
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,810
I'm going to add the column from the attendee table,

340
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,270
which is specialty I d on.

341
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,820
Then I'm going to select the database that this is related to.

342
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,300
So we're still in that tendon,

343
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,380
Stevie on then the table inside off attendance.

344
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,520
Db is specialties on,

345
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,730
then the column is specialty idea,

346
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,990
so it's always going to default.

347
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,360
Whatever.

348
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,060
The primary key is off the next team that you say there's a relationship with because it

349
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,170
knows that clearly air trying to relate it to the primary key.

350
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,830
So if you don't see it up here like this,

351
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,680
that means you didn't set up your primary key properly.

352
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,250
Now,

353
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,830
once again,

354
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,070
if you want more in depth understanding off databases,

355
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,990
relationships,

356
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,900
SQL all of those wonderful technologies,

357
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,650
he can trick on my other videos.

358
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,780
My SQL database development and mastery or Microsoft SQL Server for everyone.

359
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,950
Now,

360
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,980
having done all of these things,

361
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,750
we can go ahead and click Save on,

362
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:05,810
then this would actually have executed this quarry on set up that const range between the

363
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,880
two tables.

364
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,950
If you need to quickly modify your table and make something the primary keys because you

365
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,550
may have missed it or you didn't quite understand it the first time,

366
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,390
you can always take the column and click primary.

367
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,260
All right,

368
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,800
And then,

369
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,610
if you want to make it off the increments,

370
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,930
you can go ahead and click.

371
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,970
Change on that will kind of bring it back to the design view where you could go ahead and

372
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,350
write all of what you may have missed the first time.

373
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,990
That is it.

374
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,500
For over database designed for this small application,

375
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,130
you will always have access to PHP,

376
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,280
my admin and for every application that you build and you might need a database for,

377
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,220
you can always go to local host slash PHP.

378
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,910
My admin.

379
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,850
Go ahead and create your new database on all of the tables that you require.

380
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,600
