1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
Hey,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,560
guys,

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,130
in this video,

4
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,780
we're going to add some Coto our pages to make sure that we check to see if there is an

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,440
active user session.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,250
When somebody tries to navigate to that page,

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:12,920
if there is,

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,420
then we allow them to go to the page.

9
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,830
If not,

10
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,050
then we redirect them to log in screen.

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,780
Now,

12
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,780
on our website,

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,650
we have a few pages that would want this kind of restriction on on day all start with well

14
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:24,650
,

15
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,030
the view attendees.

16
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,920
So view records that PHP on Dover.

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,750
Add Andi delete and update pages.

18
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,370
I don't have any attendees here in my database right now,

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,980
so I'm just into when and quickly at one.

20
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,300
All right,

21
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,180
So I just created a new attendee on.

22
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,010
I just did that so that we could see the view at its end elite.

23
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,080
So once again,

24
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,780
none of these pages should be accessible as view records that PHP viewed our ph.

25
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,610
B reddit dot PHP and deletes that pH be The only way somebody should ever get to those

26
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,790
pages is if they are authenticated users on.

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,980
So we're going to make some minor chord changes to accomplish this on the first thing I'm

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,850
going to do is on includes.

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,020
So because it's the same kind of change that we're going to be doing across multiple pages

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,340
instead of rewriting this scored each time because the court is going to look pretty much

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,900
the same way.

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,160
I'm just going to create a new includes file on.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,330
I'm going to call this one off on the score.

34
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,780
Check that PHP.

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,380
All right,

36
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,520
so in off check off course of this customer,

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,320
we start off with our PHP tags and inside this off check,

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,260
I'm just going to do Ah similar if statement what we did in our header dot PHP files so in

39
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,880
are headed out.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,760
PHP file.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,160
We kind of didn't your statement to see if there is a session that exists on this.

42
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,960
We'll see if the session for user idea exists or does not exist.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,130
Then display the log in button.

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,730
Otherwise display the hello user name on Laval balls.

45
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,850
So,

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,930
in this situation,

47
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm doing a pretty similar thing where I'm just going to see if on going to check for my

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,890
session.

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,900
Andi,

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,150
I can use user idea can use user name,

51
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,250
so I just use user I d since of the used last time.

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,420
So if Andi I should be seeing,

53
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:32,120
if not is set So if this session does not exist because you eventually we're checking to

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,300
see if it doesn't take this.

55
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,820
So I'm saying,

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:42,430
if not is set if that If whatever doesn't exist on the thing that we're looking for the

57
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,780
existence off is or a session with,

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,030
ah with a subscript called user i d if that does not exist meaning that this has not been

59
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,450
created at any point.

60
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,080
That means the person is not love Been so I'm going to say header and then set the Loki

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,060
your son to be log in dot PHP car.

62
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,940
So this is just doing a sympathy.

63
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,160
If the center statement,

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,300
if there is no active session with that user name with that session I d or its subscript

65
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:24,620
rather then we just want to relocate Teoh our log in page and know that I have this set up

66
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,150
in the off check.

67
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,250
I can no include its anywhere that I need this check done so I can start off with viewer

68
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,990
records.

69
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,880
Andi,

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:42,850
at the top off this speech after I require hitter on Require Didi Conn and remember that

71
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:49,090
header would have included decision starts or whatever amable to do have to do after

72
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,560
include hitter because header just bring up the whole quickly.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,010
Includes header that PHP my header has the session starts.

74
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,600
Anything having to do with a session I have to do after my session start which is in my

75
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,330
session that PHP So I'm just going to see back in my view records file after I include the

76
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,430
header which would have included the the decision starts.

77
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,150
I'm just going to include with I wanting once our require someone to require underscore

78
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:30,580
once my off check on by off on the score Chick pH bees were just going to see.

79
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,260
Is there an active session?

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,810
Read Eric.

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,000
So that means after I include the header and all those wonderful things is just going to

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,190
check quickly and say,

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,680
Is the person who is navigating here authorized or right,

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,450
or is that personal well being?

85
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,720
If the person is logged in,

86
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,740
then while nothing happens if they are not meaning,

87
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,080
if this variable does not exist,

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,470
that session subscript does not exist,

89
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,550
don't want to relocate them to the log in dot PHP peach are on.

90
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,270
Then I can do this same check on pretty much every other pit,

91
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,090
so I can just sort of view that PHP and I'm going to go ahead and include it right there.

92
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,610
Success.

93
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,610
That's fine.

94
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,530
We're already deals with success we want to restrict and it some just including it onto the

95
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,150
header each time I want it on delete.

96
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,650
So nobody should try and believe a page or our record someone to do that first.

97
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,290
So remember,

98
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,030
the Leeds was very simple.

99
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,930
We didn't put it anywhere,

100
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,510
really.

101
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,360
Give it a header and a footer.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,340
You just have that peers doing that operation and relocating.

103
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,790
But then the fact is,

104
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,930
nobody should be typing in bleat passing in an I d on.

105
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,380
They're not authorized to do that.

106
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,700
Right?

107
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,750
So we're putting in this off check before it even checks for the presence off the I D.

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,660
If you remember Hole,

109
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,740
that's core was written.

110
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,380
All right,

111
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,810
so we edited Delete way changed it It,

112
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,820
um Andi,

113
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,730
I believe Owen view and view reports,

114
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,860
so that should be enough.

115
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,150
Let us refresh the page.

116
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,910
Andi.

117
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,570
Okay.

118
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm getting an error Oh,

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,850
my.

120
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,390
That was about Miss take off mine.

121
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,930
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,570
I did not try to includes slash.

123
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,140
All right.

124
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,360
So the errors that the final part was wrong.

125
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,410
So I just Go ahead,

126
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,250
Andi,

127
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,940
update all of the files that I would have put the bag.

128
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,840
According so have the includes slash off check and not just off check.

129
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,680
All right,

130
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,270
So once they do that,

131
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,840
then we should be able to refresh.

132
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,950
And then we see just by refreshing it went straight to the log in screen.

133
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,620
So let me believe from stretch.

134
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,730
So I'm I'm here on the public form And then and went attempts to click on view records.

135
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,510
The off check would have known that I am not loved Insiders redirected me So logging that

136
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:07,070
PHP If I type it in directly in the URL it's the same effect.

137
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,350
If I tried to go toe edit that PHP,

138
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,880
it's the same effect because off check is running on each of these speeches.

139
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,850
If I long in and I put in my admin user and the password,

140
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,180
then I will be redirected on.

141
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,050
Then the off check would know that I am loved in each times I tried to do something right

142
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,180
then,

143
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,290
if I love boats,

144
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,960
even Norman view records when I click Love Boat,

145
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,930
it's just going to redirect me to index on.

146
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,360
Then restrict me once again from getting to the pitch until I log in.

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,440
That's a nice,

148
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,440
quick and easy way to kind of shut down who can see what's on your website.

149
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,360
You can push the envelope a bit by maybe including rules on,

150
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,500
then in the same off check you Ken.

151
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,590
Well,

152
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,420
you probably wouldn't write that if you went into rules.

153
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,740
You probably wouldn't write all of that court here,

154
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,930
but in off check,

155
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,720
at least you're checking.

156
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
Is the person logged in on?

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,560
Then,

158
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,890
if they're logged in any kind of further logic to say,

159
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,190
OK,

160
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,030
watch role.

161
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,870
Are they in as a user on?

162
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,300
Then restrict them accordingly.

163
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,850
All right,

164
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,720
so that's a nice,

165
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,450
quick and easy way to kind off.

166
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,010
Restrict who gender what's on your website
