00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
Welcome to the first chapter.

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.480
Before we jump in, we want to get

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.280
a better overview of what a development team actually needs from us.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.810
Let's put together a list of things that we

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.600
need to prepare to get the best possible results.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.825
Throughout this course, we will then look at

00:00:14.825 --> 00:00:17.420
each point on our list in more detail and make

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.640
sure that we have the perfect setup for

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.070
a great collaboration between design and development.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.390
The first thing is obviously to give an overview of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.195
what our design looks like in all the screens that it includes.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.030
We will look at different ways to handle those screens,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.300
and also we'll look at inspect tools for all the tiny details.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.950
We also need to make sure that we communicate how

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.520
those screens are related to one another and how they behave with one another.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.920
We'll set up flowcharts and also have some basic prototype, and to handoff.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.415
As the development team basically redesigns everything you build in code,

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:55.255
they will need to know about all the details.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.795
Make sure to give all the information.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:00:59.520
That is, text styles,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.780
what font are you using,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.150
how is it used and when is it used?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.100
We're going to set up a style sheet together.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.880
The same for the colors, we're going to set up a style sheet with all the right values.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.190
The other styles you might have that will be shadows or

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.005
blurs that you use across your design also need to be defined.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.210
Then make sure to show the grid,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.060
make sure to use a solid grid system and really understand how it works.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.260
Components are basically reusable UI elements.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.710
In my example, that would be my hero text,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.795
my menu, and my cards.

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:37.180
It's basically anything that is like a template and are use more than once.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.770
In a perfect world, your page only consists of components.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.925
They're super important nowadays to scale projects quickly,

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.005
and I'll show you how to hand them off perfectly.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.500
Until here, everything we talked about is basically part of the style guide.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.425
That means it's everything that we described in detail.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:57.550
You could argue though that component is a whole section.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.390
What we also need is the so-called assets,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.840
and assets are the things that we're exporting.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.745
That's something like images,

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:06.350
or all our icons,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.055
and logos, or some illustrations.

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:11.660
We need to make sure that everything is exploited in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.740
such a way that it looks crisp on any display.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.310
The last one to mention,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.070
but probably the one that causes most trouble is to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.160
make sure that everything works well responsively.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.395
That means that all your designs need to look good

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:27.250
at whatever screen size I'm looking at them.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.740
For that, we're going to set up some responsive testing and then make

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.630
sure that we translate all our results into our style guide.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.950
That is the overview of everything that we need to hand off.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.740
But what you might be wondering is,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.750
what are the tools that you actually need?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.504
Before we jump into the details on how to prepare all of those files perfectly,

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:49.760
let's have a look at different design tools and different handoff tools,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.890
and find the right tools for your project.
