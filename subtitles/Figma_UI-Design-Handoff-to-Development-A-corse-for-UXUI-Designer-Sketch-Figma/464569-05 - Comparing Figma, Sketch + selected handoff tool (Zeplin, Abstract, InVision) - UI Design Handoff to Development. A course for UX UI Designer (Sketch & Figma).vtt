00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Okay. Let's start with my favorite one, Figma.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.790
Here's our list of the things that we saw in

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.820
the first chapter of everything we need to give the developer.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.025
So let's see if Figma can do that.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.545
So an overview and inspect.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.870
Fantastic, really nice sharing.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.030
Again said, we're going to look at all of that in

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.550
detail so if you don't understand anything, don't panic.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.015
We're going to look at each and every single one of them and how to do that.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.510
Also very important, you don't need to use,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.650
I'm going to show you in Figma,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.760
you don't need to use Figma.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
You can use Sketch or anything else but you're going to follow the same principles.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.460
Prototyping, also Figma does that wonderfully.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
You have styles, color, textiles,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.900
you have grids, you even have different grids in Figma,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.010
which I will also show you.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.720
It's really, really fantastic.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.810
You have components that you can share.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.610
You can export assets.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.970
A developer can actually export them directly himself.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.980
You have responsiveness.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.225
You have version control and it runs on Mac and PC.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:01.980
The best part of it,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.605
if you're just one user, it's absolutely free.

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:10.805
After that, its costs $144 per year currently per user you add.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.015
The thing is though, if you invite a developer,

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.270
that actually doesn't count as a user because you only need

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.610
to give him rights to view and not rights to edit.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.785
So you can work for completely free and then hand it over for the developer.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.380
So Sketch, as mentioned before,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.630
comes with a so-called Sketch Cloud.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
They started implementing handoff tools such as inspect in the Cloud.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.040
There's still a better version and so they're okayish.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.085
But also knowing Sketch that will surely be improved.

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:44.370
As you're uploading anyways and this is relatively new,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.155
it's very common to combine Sketch with an external handoff tool.

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:53.160
I picked three that I would recommend.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.720
Obviously, you don't need all three of them.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.260
You just need to pick one or any other tool that you would like to use.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.775
Generally, what I would advise you to do before you go ahead and pick anything,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:11.040
always talk to your development team and ask them if they're already using a tool.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.260
It might be that they're already paying for a plan so you could just use that then make

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.020
sure that this is compatible with the software

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.660
you're using for design so if you're using Sketch or Figma.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.160
Most of them start also working with Figma but there is still,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.110
for example, in Abstract, some limitations.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.245
So just make sure before you start that everything is working.

00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:34.020
If they don't have anything in place,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.110
then just suggest what you would like to use,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.760
but make sure they had a look at it once.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.460
So on our list, let's see how Sketch is doing.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.800
Overview and inspect. As mentioned,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.155
this is all happening through the Cloud.

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:55.065
Also prototyping, not as ideal as Figma in my point of view, but definitely there.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.360
So styles, color styles,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.370
everything you can set up in Sketch.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.170
You can make nice overviews to save.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.020
You can see the grid and you have components.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.280
They're called symbols in Sketch,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.125
but it's exactly the same.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:13.485
You can export assets directly from Sketch and you can test some responsive behavior.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.350
There's no version control in Sketch,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.715
so maybe a quick word on version control if this is new to you.

00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:23.820
Version control is something that actually comes from coding.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.780
In design, you're probably used to saving versions of a file over and over again.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.630
So you probably put the date or a number 1, 2, 3.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.310
You'll put final design,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.845
final design 2, final design 3.

00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:37.005
You probably know what I'm talking about.

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:42.300
This is rapidly changing because now we work in teams on the same file.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.540
This is moving towards that which Figma does quite well and Sketch is starting on that.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.060
You would not want to save a whole new file,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.100
you want to save a version of that file.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.540
So if you saying, "At this point,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.060
I'm going to hand this file off to the developer," you would

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.510
save a version of that file within the file.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.940
You give the developer that moment of the file and then you carry on working in the file.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.995
So for example, now you're changing a button.

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:12.390
Then you can say,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.790
"Now I'm handing you off the next feature,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.625
that button," but it all lives in the same file.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:19.350
So this is something really great.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.260
You don't need version control necessarily,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.750
but I think it's something to look out for,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.525
especially if you're working on larger projects.

00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:29.910
There's something super helpful.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.310
Sketch doesn't run on PC,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.080
it only runs on Mac.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.280
So it costs $99 one-time they say.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.470
Just be aware, one-time means

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.230
you paid and theoretically you can use that version forever.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.780
However, every year there's a new version coming

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.285
out of Sketch so you really need to be up-to-date.

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:53.325
You're literally paying every year more or less around $100.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:56.160
Something generally on pricing.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.960
Yes, it's great to have a free tool like Figma,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.300
especially if you're starting and to try out stuff.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.020
But generally, it's okay.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.565
I mean, they're charging. It's a business model.

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:06.765
If you want a good product,

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.250
it also going to cost you a bit.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.900
So you probably going to end up at

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.175
the same price using Figma and Sketch professionally at some point.

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.190
Let's look at those handoff tools that you might want

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.845
to combine with Sketch or some of them even with Figma.

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:22.860
Again, you only need one of them like one handoff tool.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.870
I'm just showing you three that I

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.480
personally really like so you get a bit of a comparison.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.355
So let's start with Abstract.

00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:31.470
Abstract has really great inspect mode.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.835
Prototyping, I'm leaving out because you probably use a Sketch Cloud for that.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:40.545
All styles, grid, components that you set up in Sketch, they're available here.

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:42.645
You can also export assets.

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:46.560
Responsive again, I'm leaving out something that you test in your design software.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.180
Version control.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.150
So this is where Abstract really shines.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.300
It's actually more of a collaboration tool,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.640
I would say and then a handoff tool.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.740
So if you're working on a large project,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.940
something a little more complicated,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.710
like app design where things change rapidly with different features,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.500
really have a look at Abstract.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.740
The only thing is your whole team would need to agree to

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.540
work with Abstract because you would integrate it with Sketch.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.190
That also means that all of you are designers would need to use a Mac and

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.330
then later the inspect should be available on PC though as well. The cost.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.215
It comes with $108 per year per person.

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:30.929
So it is a little more pricey,

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:33.330
but for large projects, definitely worth it.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.540
However, if you only setting up a small website,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.985
then this might be a little bit of an overkill.

00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:42.120
So Zeplin. Zeplin is my personal favorite.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.875
I really like how everything is working in the overview and it's very clean,

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.390
very tidy and very logic.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.355
It's also been around for a long time,

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:53.100
lots of plugs in, a lot of information about it.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.810
I would say this is a very,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.275
very solid handoff tool if you're looking for something straightforward.

00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:00.480
It doesn't really have prototyping,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.085
but it has something called flow.

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:04.890
So your developer will see where you connected

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.920
your prototype which can be really handy, actually.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.765
All starts with components obviously that you set up in Sketch you will see here.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:17.430
Also, the great advantage is Zeplin is also working with Figma.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.365
So if you're using Figma and your developers say they really want to stick to Zeplin,

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:23.955
then that is no problem.

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:26.580
Exporting assets obviously.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.845
Again, responsive not relevant here.

00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:33.015
No version control, but it runs on both Mac and PC.

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:36.090
I also really liked that it comes with a free version so you can

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.910
really try out a project and then if you're using more project,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.275
it goes up to 200.

00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:43.260
You can see the different plans it has for different projects.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.960
So our last one is InVision.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.730
InVision also comes with a good inspect mode and it also has very good prototyping.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.560
So if you have like a straightforward website projects, more company website,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.190
personal website, this is something where I think InVision

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.000
is a really good solution because you could put everything on InVision.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.765
You can have your clients look at the dummy in InVision.

00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:10.020
You can have your programmers look at the inspect in InVision.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.080
You can comment, you can share the slides.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.205
So I think this is really great for like small to medium-sized projects.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.245
I really like to use it for that.

00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:24.645
You can come with something called DSM now that's called Design System Management.

00:08:24.645 --> 00:08:27.210
So that's a little more advanced if you

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.760
want to share libraries and setup a design system.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.960
So that's also possible.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.965
You can obviously export assets in there and it runs on Mac and PC.

00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:39.540
Also important to know InVision,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.460
they have their own design tool you could also use called InVision Studio.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.930
Also it comes for the first project for free so you

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.870
can just try it out and then it goes up to 95.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.640
Again, look at the website prices vary for amounts of projects.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.925
So as you can see, there's not really a right or wrong on what you should be using.

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:03.140
But what's really important and important for any software you are using is that you

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.370
set up your designs and your components and styles in the right way.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.290
This is what we're going to do in the next chapters.
