00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Now let's talk about handled with the Handoff Tool.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.540
We're going to look at Sketch and Figma and combine it with Zeplin.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.520
You might remember this chart.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.280
We said that you can use Sketch and narrow sketch cloud.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.725
We can see all your prototyping and all your screens,

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:17.550
but in most cases is not enough and you'll probably combined with a Handoff Tool.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.020
Now Figma, as you saw it,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.370
you can just use on its own.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.735
But if you wish, you can also combine Figma with something like Zeplin.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.560
Make sure it's compatible because Figma is relatively new, but with Zeplin.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.805
You can use either Sketch or Figma to upload your designs.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:37.485
To use Zeplin go under Zeplin website on zeplin.io.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:40.730
You get this interests screen and with some videos and down

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.380
here you can see that you should download the Mac or Windows app.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.130
This is what you see when you enter the app,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.050
and then we'll just click on create a project.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.450
You can choose whether it's app or web design.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.280
We just have a web design here,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.135
so then we can name our project,

00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:59.690
and then here you can already share it.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.920
Then here you can see that you can import from Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.320
and if you really wanted to Photoshop as well,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.360
and it gives us a little instruction.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.945
Let's see how that works inside our design program.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:14.915
Let's first have a look inside Sketch.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:19.040
I set up the same website project in Sketch here as you can see.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.105
That works really well with Zeplin because Sketch has a great plugin.

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:26.600
Got to "plugins", and then you can have here your Zeplin plugin,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.480
and here you can see you can export the selected screens.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.965
You can export colors.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.730
You can export your text styles that you set up.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.740
Under Export All, you can also have symbols from current page or symbols from all pages.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.270
If you just change to your symbol page and then just export symbol from this page,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.540
and you can bulk upload all of your components

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.445
or symbols whatever you call them in one goal which is super handy.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.960
If I press this, there's also shortcut I press this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.940
control command and E. It automatically opens my app.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.760
It chooses to project that I set up and I just have to press on export.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.910
Before we move on with Zeplin,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.385
I quickly want to show you the Sketch Cloud.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:12.140
I think you'll agree once you see that it's not enough for a Handoff yet,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.500
but it is there and you might want to use it to share your prototyping,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.150
as you can see here I set up some links to show you the prototyping section.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.935
You can go up here and just click on "Cloud" and then it will

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:30.560
export your whole document or you can also select certain screens to your cloud.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.245
Let's now jump over to to Sketch Cloud,

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.560
this is what I see inside my Sketch Cloud.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.705
You can see that I have a very handy burden control.

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:40.805
If I jump into the screen,

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:44.150
here on the left I can see the activity of uploads

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.480
and on the right day is a new Beta version of inspector,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.105
you can also see that this is still

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.510
in progress or I'm sure that's going to be massively improved food.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.620
Yes, I can click here on my items and I can see them.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.580
But for me, it's not really working if you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.650
compared with the inspect mode in Figma or if you compare it currently with Zeplin.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.590
But what is handy is that you can click here on

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.975
your prototype and you'll see it will upload your loaded,

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:16.115
so you can share it,

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.690
and then you can see here these are

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.230
the active links and you can't just jump in between screens.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.335
You can see here an overview as well that you can export all assets.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:31.520
Yes, sketches definitely moving towards improving older Handoff Tools.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.160
However, you would still probably combined

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.875
with something like Zeplin or another Handoff Tools.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.080
Because as you will see in a minute that just much,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.880
much more powerful than this.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.870
Even though we talked about in Figma you don't really need a Handoff Tool.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.990
You can still combine Figma as well with a Handoff Tools

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.145
sometimes that has advantages like connecting to codebases.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:57.525
Let's now look into Figma it works almost the same as in Sketch.

00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:01.010
Let's have a look what the procedure looks like in Figma.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.970
If I choose some frames here it's exactly the same.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.605
Actually I go on plugins,

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:09.574
and I have my Zeplin plugin for Figma installed.

00:04:09.574 --> 00:04:12.605
I click on that and I can see that now I chose

00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:16.875
two frames that I am exporting two frames to Zeplin,

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.120
and there's some more options,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.720
for example that your component get put into the styleguide right away.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.410
I have to say sometimes it is a little buggy,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.620
for example exporting components.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.685
I feel that I always have to export the actual component.

00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:32.485
Doesn't really find it when it's sitting on a frame.

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:36.225
But then it's relatively new as well and besides those little bugs it

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:39.815
works perfectly fine for Sketch and for Figma.

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:44.120
Let's now have a look what your exports look like in Zeplin.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.340
We're back in our Zeplin app.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.070
If we click on our project,

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.540
then you can see that it uploaded all the screens.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.870
At the top I have two sections.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.565
I have the dashboard where I see all my exports,

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.260
and then I have here to styleguide,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.170
and this is my Local Styleguide for this project.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.645
You can see that it exports it automatically,

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:07.150
all of the colors for me,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.830
and I can just say add colors and it will save them just as they set them up.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.250
Then it also uploaded all the text styles for me automatically as I

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.555
set them up and I just say add them and then I get this nice overview.

00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:23.740
You also have a section to define your spacing.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.195
Here you have a section where it uploads

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:30.690
all your master components or symbols from Sketch.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.850
If we click on that component for example,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.520
we can see that it is a component,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.770
it has the name that we gave it.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.520
When we can also see which I find really handy older pages we used it in.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.670
If we click, for example, on a detail,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:54.090
you can see that here I am using my H2 and you also get all the information and some CSS.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.665
We jump back from our styleguide to our dashboard overview.

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:01.214
Then we see here again all the screens,

00:06:01.214 --> 00:06:04.220
and you can set up those nice little section by just

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.195
selecting some pages and right-clicking you can make your own sections.

00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:11.405
You can see that besides the screens,

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:13.590
I have one with older screens,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.360
so I would set up mobile and desktop and then I have one with

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.395
the style guide because I still like adding some additional information.

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:24.110
I just find that this styleguide right here, it's fantastic,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.905
but it's not giving me any space for more explanation,

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:31.040
and then I have my component details down here because the

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.670
same for components I just like to give a little more information.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.130
Another super Handoff Tool is that you can add tags.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.165
For example, you can see here that I set up.

00:06:44.165 --> 00:06:48.065
If I wanted to do components that are input components,

00:06:48.065 --> 00:06:49.760
then I can just sorted like this.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.480
I can see all the specs or can see all the styleguide sections at once.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.770
That's super simple, you just choose one of your screens

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.130
and then you go Command T and then you can just set up as many tags as you wish.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.965
If we jump into a screen it's the same than in our inspect mode that you saw in Figma.

00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:13.505
On the right-hand side, you get all the information here you can see the style we set up.

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:15.320
If we choose an image,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.110
and in Zeplin that's super handy it sets up

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.810
all your images automatically and JPG and PNG in 1x,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.695
2x and 3x, so you don't need to do much here,

00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:28.625
and it's the same here for your SVG with a fallback.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:35.695
I'd sometimes might it's a little buggy with my icons, so double-check that.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:39.360
As an any inspector you can obviously toggled a grid,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.865
that's really clear how your designer setup.

00:07:42.865 --> 00:07:45.450
You also version control in Zeplin,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.465
so I quickly uploaded a new version

00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:50.020
and it creates this timeline for me here on the right,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.465
so I can jump here and you can see that I just changed the headline.

00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:57.660
This is the new version, so I can jump in between different version.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.135
If you want to have a closer look,

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:02.840
you can also add comments once you're uploading this.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.855
Here you can just keep track about to changes in your designs.

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:14.015
Another super Handoff Tool is that you have this overlay feature here in Zeplin.

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:15.590
What you can do is first of all,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.990
you can just set it to a 100 percent and then you can

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.750
just see your website in the real size.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.390
The other thing was actually useful is that you

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.675
just put it a bit on opacity and then you can put it on top,

00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:29.540
on offer coded side and therefore you can see whether

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.490
your distances and everything is more or less in place.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.185
Now we talked about prototyping earlier on as well and that Zeplin aspects will flow.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.580
If you will down your shift key,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.055
you can see for example here that I link my menu,

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.985
and if I click on it, it jumps back.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:48.665
Then also a super handy in here,

00:08:48.665 --> 00:08:50.810
I can see that for example,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.560
this one is imbedded and I'm in here and I can see that this is a component.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.820
If I click on it, it jumped right back into my component library.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.565
As mentioned before you see here,

00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:06.405
and also if you click this here that you can connect it to code,

00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:09.985
so this is a really big advantage to use Zeplin.

00:09:09.985 --> 00:09:12.860
As we saw in the very beginning of this course,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.810
Zeplin is just one of many,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.370
many Handoff Tools you can use.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.380
I personally find that as an amazing tool.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.120
If you choose for Handoff Tool,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.145
my number one solution is still to simply use Figma and handed off if that is possible,

00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:26.680
check with your development team.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.555
You can of course use any other Handoff Tool as well,

00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:31.950
all the ones that we were talking about earlier.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.670
Just check the documentation and you will see that you will

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.225
find all of the things that you can implement styleguides,

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:41.330
typography styles, color styles, your component,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.680
you can have an inspect mode,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.420
all of the things you will find that all of

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.820
those tools that you can choose the right one for you.
