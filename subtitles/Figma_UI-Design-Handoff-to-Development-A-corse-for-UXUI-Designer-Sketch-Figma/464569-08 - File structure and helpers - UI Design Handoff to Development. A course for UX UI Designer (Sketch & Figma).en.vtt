00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Before we jump into the details,

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:05.250
I want to give you a quick overview on how I structure my files.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.160
There's of course, very different ways for different teams and projects,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.320
this is just a way that I over the time

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840
ended up doing it and had quite good results with.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.615
Anything that you can use,

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.075
use it as you wish and anything you want to change,

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:19.070
of course, adapt it to your needs.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.160
On the left-hand side you see that I am using the pages to structure my projects.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.900
You can do the same in Sketch.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.210
Basically, how I do those headlines is simply just an empty page.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.280
In Figma you have a cover at the top,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.230
so that will be the image to thumbnail that

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.990
everybody sees as soon as you open your project and I'll tell you in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.390
a second how I changed this from just being

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.590
a beautiful picture to something useful at the very end.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.390
The first one would be I have my section here development,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.560
so when I handed off the development noted that only this section is relevant for them.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.795
I have my screen and prototype overview.

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:56.610
Here I have all my master screen.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.975
This is where I'm working.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:02.555
This is where my final versions are and this is where I also connect my prototyping.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.220
Then I have the style guide.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.585
The style guide here,

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.640
that's what we're going to look at into detail.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.535
We have colors, typography, spacing, grid.

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.230
Everything is described in detail.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.105
Again, also the use of my images and my icons.

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.155
Then the third one here we have components.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:22.970
Components are basically living up here in your Assets tab.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.620
Here you have your local components or here you have your library.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.955
What I like to do, and what we're also going to look at in detail is that I like to

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:35.029
give a more detailed overview of my components

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.790
so you can see different states and you can see more comments,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.200
specs and also we're going to look at that in much more detail.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.470
By the way, if you're wondering about those little icons here on the left,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.160
that is just something I add so I have a better overview, is nothing you need,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.300
but if you want to use that,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.405
that's just control command and spacebar

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.445
and then you get all sorts of emoticons and you can just add them here.

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:00.390
What you might have noticed is that,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.820
I always have these headlines.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.560
So I give an overview.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.140
I said this is the website and then these are the different sections or my components.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.480
These are the components and then their structure forms and design elements.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.205
If we look at those in detail than the one where it's at the actual section,

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.960
then you can see for example,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.060
here in my colors, I have

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.790
this little stamp here that says this one is approved and the date and by whom,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.115
and I also have space work and add a link.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.780
This link could be activated by any prototype.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.110
You simply click on the link.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.615
You can also just copy like a whole line

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:38.855
of the link just to state the link anywhere here.

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:40.925
How that works is the following.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:46.020
I am using a little thing called File Management System.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.260
This is my File Management page.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.200
In order to claim any false credit,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.300
I got the idea of setting it up this way,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.400
especially with the little alerts down here.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.290
From a UX/UI designer,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.475
I follow called Femke.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:00.020
She does some really great tutorials.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.370
She works at Uber,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.540
so definitely check her out.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.385
I'm going to add a link for you.

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:08.180
I was aware of like setting up these sections which you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.720
already see here on all my overview pages.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.310
It gives really great overview if you're handing it over and someone's new to the file.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.880
But what I didn't do up to then and what I really liked and started and really

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.635
helped with foster communication with other team members or the development team,

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.525
is to add those little stamps.

00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:31.370
Here I just have instances and they just give the state of this particular section.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.910
Is the color already approved or is it still in progress?

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.670
Is the topography still in progress or is this something that we can for sure setup?

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.670
Here I just add the state and you can see that you can

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.345
just change the pretty Italy as an instance.

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:48.815
You could just change it like this.

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:51.830
You would add your initials and the date you changed it in

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.105
case someone has questions why the state has been changed.

00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:57.635
Another thing that I really like the idea,

00:03:57.635 --> 00:03:58.880
and I use a lot now,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.365
is to just add a little link.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.390
I also have a stamp here that's a link.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.190
I can add as many as I wish.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.590
This is, for example, sometimes you have,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.500
you want to link to the file of the font.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.930
Or if you're using a great system,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.810
you want to add a link to documentation.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.070
Yes, you could just copy the link and just

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.365
copy it next to it there is a common section which somehow nobody ever uses in Figma.

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:27.350
I just find it a great way, it's really clean,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.625
so how you add it,

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:31.380
it's just you click on it and then you can add a link here.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.310
You can see that in a prototype or you can also set

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.195
up the prototype section and then you see if there is a link.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:42.450
Definitely use that, it was a great help for me.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.710
Then besides those, I have some set rules,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.250
how I comment on that.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.060
We will see later in the component overview how I add

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.270
comments and these ones here are super useful as well.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.815
I add them to my wireframes and I add them to my overview.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:00.890
You will also see that this just means there is an interaction.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.050
You can add more whatever you need, like for example,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.460
to swipe or this one means there is an animation.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.790
Then my development team will see that there is something happening at that point,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.365
and they can always refer to the prototype and I make sure they don't miss this.

00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.720
Here's just some sticky notes that I used.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.540
As I said to comment section somehow,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.110
nobody really uses that much in Figma,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.850
I don't know why it's a great section,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.120
but I just had the experience that people overlook it.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.370
I just stick a sticky note on the page if I have comments or work on there.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.880
That's also really clear that this has to be taken away at some point.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.935
The last thing I build is this flowchart here.

00:05:37.935 --> 00:05:39.795
What I do with this flow chart,

00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:41.055
up here you have the cover.

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:44.275
This is like right now it's just a pretty image that you would see.

00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:46.600
What I usually do is once I'm done,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.775
I move my flow chart up here and then I delete this one.

00:05:50.775 --> 00:05:52.200
Now, this will be my cover page.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.540
The first thing everybody sees that opens this file is this Overview chart,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.770
and usually I also add a few links and just an alert,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.675
say look at the development section.

00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:07.090
Everybody knows this is the whole project.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.545
This is how everything connects.

00:06:08.545 --> 00:06:12.890
There is a prototype and I give all this overview information up here.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.250
We're also going to build this chart together at a later point.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.120
This is the file structure I use.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.680
You can also see here on the right that I'm setting up different styles for

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.820
typography and for colors and also for grids.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.160
Now we're going to run through this part here,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.720
the style guide in detail,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.440
and we're going to start with the first section, which is color.
