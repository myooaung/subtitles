00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.375
So now we have everything ready to handoff.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:09.450
We have to overview with outflow showing how all our screens are connected.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.945
We have our prototype showing older behavior,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:18.105
and we have our style guide that consists of our textiles, color styles,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:21.735
any other styles we need to grid and distances,

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.044
and our components in detail,

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.870
and we have our assets that can be exploited,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.740
so images and vectors.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.170
We also tested our responsive behavior,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.320
and made sure everything works well across different screen sizes.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.855
Obviously, I want to make sure my files are nice and tidy before I hand them off.

00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:41.650
I want to see that my pages are in order.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.640
For example, here everything is labeled

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.280
clearly that this is relevant for the development.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.145
Then if we look inside the screens,

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:52.295
I also want to make sure that all screens are named properly,

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:55.570
and I want to make sure that inside those,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.190
everything that could be is a component.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.825
So my hero, my menu,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:05.180
and then here I have groups that are also named according to what the sections do.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.125
Then within those groups you can see that everything is a component.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:11.810
So everything is nice, and clean to go.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.070
I will do the same.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.680
I would run through my styles,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.400
I would run through my components just to make sure that everything is in order.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.570
Now the other thing I want to check is that everything is correct on my library.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.810
At a library you find up here in assets,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.490
and then it's this little book icon,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.720
and in the Team Library,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.490
if you have not been using that up to now,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.900
you can save all your styles.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.150
So if we saved styles,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.495
those were now local styles like all the ones that you see here.

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:46.370
Our local styles tells you this is my typography styles,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.710
and my color styles.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.580
I can send them up here in my library,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.365
and then I can share them with my whole team.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.545
Most of my stuff is already in the library.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:56.015
Let me show you if I for example,

00:01:56.015 --> 00:02:01.265
would now change in my styles. Let me change color.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:04.835
If I would now say I am changing this color here.

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:07.880
Let's just go really wild on this one.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.725
I'm changing, that went to a blue,

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:11.960
and then you can see now it has a little dot here.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.134
I go back to my library,

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.355
and I'll say publish this change,

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:23.750
and I can say changed secondary 2,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.440
and I can publish it.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.044
Now my whole team will get an update,

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:33.380
and everybody will be notified that I've changed this color.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.925
Basically this is again,

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:36.785
a library that lives in the Cloud.

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.255
You have the same in sketch.

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:40.580
This is called a single source of truth.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.090
You would store all of your styles once they're handed over,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.235
and once they're finalized in the Cloud,

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.200
and that still allows you to make changes,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.955
but to just have everybody notified if there is a change.

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:54.200
By the way in Figma in the free version,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.490
you can save your color styles,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.735
and your text styles to the library if you want to add a components as well,

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:03.335
which is really great because then you literally have a design system up there.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:05.650
You would need to have a paid plan.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.330
The second thing you should do is to save the current version of your file,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.045
and the moment that you're handing off.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.700
In Figma we're going to use now our version control.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.110
If you're using sketch,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.930
then if you're using it was Zeplin version control there,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.835
there's different versions it stores,

00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:22.460
but I definitely recommend you in sketch to also

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.050
save a file of that moment of your handoff.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.275
Now we're going in here in Figma,

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:31.965
and we have file show version history,

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:35.310
and now here on the right you can see that this,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.260
whenever I put DEV this is my way of marking that I had a development handoff here,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.845
and the components for example that I just changed,

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:45.260
they will always be automatically saved for you,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.520
and Figma does this,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.680
and saves a version from time to time as well.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.110
But it's great if you take your control over your own version history.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.440
What we're going to do now is we're going to add a development handoff.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.615
We're going to call that DEV,

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:02.360
we're going to call that the date today,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.885
and that always give it the hour.

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:08.450
Because in that way, if I notice in five minutes I forgot something,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.370
I always know which one is the latest version.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.855
Here you can give a description of what you're handing off,

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:16.685
and then we're saving it,

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:18.530
and now you see this here.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.805
Now in your versions you can jump back and forth to different states of your file.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:26.810
Now if we only want to share that development version, and not the whole file,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.345
because if we use the share button, may appear to share,

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:31.130
then that's always the current version,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.960
and you can actually see it's quite fun.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.625
You can see different mouse pointers when people work simultaneously on one file.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:40.655
If I just want to share this version with the development team,

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.850
I need to go on these little dots here,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.630
and then say duplicate.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.950
If I duplicate I get this alert here, say file duplicated.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.830
Now I open, and what happens is that it

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.175
will open a duplicate of the version. This is my cover.

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:58.520
Then I can go back in here and I see everything in my file.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.340
Now I'm going up here,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.470
and I'm sharing with my share button the duplicated version.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.230
So that's a little complicated,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.065
but that's how currently it's recommended by Figma on the Figma website.

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:14.750
So up here you can see you can invite your development team,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.690
and then he can click rights to edit or rights to view.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.385
Rights to edit I will recommend you only give you a design team or copywriters,

00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:25.790
and rights to view is more than enough for the development because

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.645
they can still see everything as we will see in a minute ourselves.

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:34.490
Rights to view, you can send an e-mail or just copy this link here,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.600
and then send that link.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.205
Let's now see what the development team will see with the link we send them.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:44.390
Now, this is what I get when I send the link for the view.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.625
It looks exactly the same on first sight than what you have working in Figma.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:51.440
But the difference here is,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.530
let's zoom in here.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.190
If I'm going on my home,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.070
I can still get older layers.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.520
That's why it's so important that everything is named correctly

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.180
because the development will see exactly the same information that you do,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.670
the differences that I can't move anything here.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.900
So I can just see it.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.675
Also per default, you might have noticed that all my measurements are on,

00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:15.200
and my inspect tab is always open.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.165
So if I go on here for example,

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:19.505
I can see that this is an H1,

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:23.090
further down here I can also see in commenting whenever to comment

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.630
that this is a component that I called hero text,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.520
and then they can refer to the components.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.525
Furthermore, I can see all the pages so they can look into this styles overview I gave,

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.310
and into all the components,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.490
and further descriptions we made.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.400
The other thing is up here in the export tab.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.605
You can for example, if you click on this,

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.660
and now you can see it did not prepare this export,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.560
but that doesn't matter because in Figma you can just prepare that yourself.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.524
If we prepared exports,

00:06:53.524 --> 00:06:56.735
which I think we did over here in the About section.

00:06:56.735 --> 00:06:58.535
Then this is all already set up,

00:06:58.535 --> 00:07:00.770
and they just need to press "Export".

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.680
The other thing is if I press here on play,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.110
then my prototype will open automatically,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.090
and if I go back here, obviously also I have my flowchart.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.400
What I like doing is putting the flowchart actually at the very first page.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.255
So at the moment I have here my cover which is just a pretty image,

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:27.415
and the very first page you have here is your cover images is a little thumbnail,

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:29.460
you see when you open the file.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.395
That's the first thing people will see.

00:07:31.395 --> 00:07:35.560
I like putting the flow so everybody knows right away this is the whole project,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.310
this is how everything is connected,

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.355
and then they can go down here in the development sections,

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.710
and see the styles, the overview,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.695
the components, and everything we've prepared.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.965
Yes, that's it. You handed off your project, and you're done.

00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:50.250
I hope this was helpful,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.555
and if you're still not convinced with the Figma and the handoff,

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:56.780
then in the next section I'm just going to give you a quick overview of how you

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.200
would handoff with Sketch, Figma and Zeplin.
