00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
Any other styles you might have, you make the same,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.700
you just make an overview sheet and just add them

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.070
here because [inaudible] for this will be shadows or blurs,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.160
or background effects like for example,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
that your background darkens if you have a modal coming down.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.910
Let me switch on my tools will show you pretty much here.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.270
I just have one shadow I'm using,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.210
you might have several shadow effects.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.890
I save it to my effects,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.305
to my styles, and the same with blurs.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:30.160
It's saved and I am giving an overview to my development team.
