Hello and welcome to this new editorial.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.600
All right let's take a step back at what we've done so far in this part three trainings sectors like

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.490
model.

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.080
First we said all the hype of parameters and we chose a value for each of them which is not our final

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.660
decision but some values for a first try then we defined a session here by creating an object of the

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.460
interactive session class and that will be the session used for the training.

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.950
Then we loaded all the model inputs including the inputs to target the learning rate and to keep probability.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.940
And then just in the previews to Soyer we set the sequence length by choosing a maximum size of the

9
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.860
sequence equal to 25.

10
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.790
And that is because we're going to soon use our set to signal function to get our cell to say moral.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.620
And since one of the arguments of this function is the sequence length we needed to prepare this sequence

12
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.090
length variable and now just before we were ready to use this stick to sick model function to get the

13
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.160
training predictions and the test predictions we just need to get the shape of the input sensor.

14
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.410
Right now our inputs are in the tensor attentively tensor but we need to get the shape of these input

15
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.000
because again this will be one of the arguments of one specific function we'll use for the training.

16
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.080
This basic function is actually the ones that function by tens of flow that basically creates a tensor

17
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.960
of ones and the dimensions of this tensor is going to be exactly the shape that's why we need to get

18
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.360
it now is because it's going to become the argument of this future ones function will use just like

19
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.650
what we did for this sequence length which is going to be the argument of the SEC the SEC moral function.

20
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.000
All right so let's get the shape of the input sensor.

21
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.310
We're going to call this shape input underscore shape and to get this shape.

22
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.260
Well there is nothing more simple.

23
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.100
We first need to get a sense of low library and then we're going to use the shape function which takes

24
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.600
as argument a tensor and returns the shape of this tensor.

25
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.330
And therefore since the tensor we're dealing with here and what we want to get the shape of is our input.

26
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.390
We will simply enter our input and there we go.

27
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.110
We get the input shape perfect.

28
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.290
So let's execute this done in put shape created.

29
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.830
All right.

30
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.700
Perfect.

31
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.600
So now eventually we are ready to use our SEC to say well function to get our training predictions and

32
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.290
our test predictions.

33
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.160
And so that's exactly what we'll get in the next tutorial.

34
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.020
And until then I depend on the.
