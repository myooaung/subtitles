Hello and welcome back to Part 3.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,870
Training the SEC the SEC motto in this quick toil we are going to define a tense session on which all

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,010
the of flow training will be run.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:18,020
So to open a session intensive flow we're going to create an object of the interactive session class

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,930
and that object will be our session.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,610
But before we create this object we need to reset the dense flow graphs to ensure that the graph is

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,870
ready for the training.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,870
So in general when you open intense a closed session to do some training you have to reset the graph

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,630
first.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,130
So we're going to start by doing this resetting the graph and to do this we need to take the tenths

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:45,950
of the library and then applied the reset default graph function which is a function by sense of flow

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,630
that resets the tens of Faludi for graph.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,030
All right.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,730
And now we can define a session and to define position as I said we have to create an object of the

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,680
interactive session class and therefore we have to introduce a new object here which we're going to

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,300
call session because this is going to be this tense session and to create this object.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,770
We're going to take first detents library because the class is from the technical library and the name

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,970
of the class is as we said interactive session.

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,800
There we go with some parenthesis.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,580
All right so we have defined a session.

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,600
That's a good thing done.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,670
We will of course use it for the training and now and the next it's oil we're going to load the model

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:35,820
inputs using our function model input that we defined in part two when building the second PSEC model.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,020
All right so let's define the session effectively by executing the code section and I'll see you in

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,000
the next tutorial to load the model inputs until then and Joji been I'll be.
