00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,070
Highs and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,420
All right now we're going to start the whole process of removing the nuns so much frequent word of our

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,360
corpus and we want to do that because we want to optimize the training and optimize the training we

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,950
need the essential words of the vocabulary.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,060
So we're going to remove the words that appear from time to time less than 5 percent actually of the

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,100
whole corpus.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,720
And the first step of this new process of removing the non-African word is to create a dictionary that

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,990
is going to map each word to its number of occupancies.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,760
That seems natural we first need to get all the words separately and for each of these words we get

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,310
the number of and so that is the number of times they appear in the corpus of movie dialups.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,620
So that's what we're going to do in this story or we're going to create that dictionary and they start

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,430
right now.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,000
So to create a dictionary you know how to do it we first need to choose a name for that and we want

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,180
to set everything as clear as possible.

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:11,250
So we're going to call that dictionary word to count because it maps each word to how many times this

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,520
word appears there is a count of this word a word to count.

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,720
And now we need to initialize it with a pair of brackets.

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:28,210
And now we are ready to start the for loop to get all the different words and get their number of occupancies.

19
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,720
So we have two separate lists.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,410
Now we have two clean questions and the clean answers.

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,300
And so basically we're going to get the words from both these lists and for each of the word we're going

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,880
to count how many times they appear.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,790
So let's start with the questions we start with a for loop for question.

24
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,180
In clean questions of course.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,250
Right now we're dealing with the clean questions.

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,780
CONAN And now let's go inside the.

27
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:03,310
So I remind that clean questions is a huge list containing all the questions.

28
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:09,720
Now what we have to do is go through all the questions in this clean questions huge list and for each

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,500
of these questions we're going to get their words.

30
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,880
So now we need to make a second for loop that will go through all the words of the question.

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,540
All right.

32
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:30,660
So second for loop here for and therefore this time it's going to be word in question all right and

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,470
then to get the words themselves we can add that split here so that we can get the words directly.

34
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,410
So if you were question that split Collon And now let's do what we want to do and what you want to do

35
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:51,660
is now count the number of times this word appears when we go through all the questions of the clean

36
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,820
questions list.

37
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,460
OK.

38
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,740
So right now we're dealing with a specific word in a specific question.

39
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,580
So for this word either it's the first time we see it or we've already seen it and therefore we need

40
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,010
to increment the count of this word.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,400
And therefore I'm going to make an IF condition here to separate these two cases whether we see that

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,330
word for the first time or we've seen it already.

43
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,000
So I'm going to start with if.

44
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,450
If we see that word for the first time and to express this in code we can say if word if the word not

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,830
in our dictionary which we called Word to count.

46
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,790
Well if this word is not in word to count then what happens.

47
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,750
Well this word is going to get his first arguments.

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,500
We're going to count it once and therefore now we're going to take our dictionary word to count then

49
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,470
we need to enter the key which is the word because now make sure to understand that the key identifier

50
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,540
are the words and the values are the number of arguments says of these words.

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:08,610
And so the value for this word we're dealing with right now and that we see for the first time appearing

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,300
in the questions of the king questions.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,840
Well that value is going to be one because it's the first time we see it.

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:24,120
But then other games if this is not the first time we see this word in a question well we can express

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,140
it with else because this is complimentary else and in that case what we need to do is increment the

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:37,290
count of this word increment the number of occupancies because we've already seen it before and therefore

57
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,150
we need to increment its number of Ah-Q answers.

58
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,940
And so what we can simply do.

59
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:49,350
I'm going to copy this because the way to increment in Python is pretty practical.

60
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:56,880
We just need to add here plus equals plus equals one that is equivalent to word to count word equals

61
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,150
word to count word plus 1.

62
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,460
So we increment it perfect.

63
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:10,440
So that's it was this double for loop here we count for each word appearing in all the questions of

64
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,780
the clean questions huge list the number of utterances of these words and now we're going to do the

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,080
same for the answers because there are some other words in the answers.

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,410
But good news it's going to be almost the same.

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,980
I'm going to copy this for loop here.

68
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,570
Pasted below.

69
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:35,200
And now we simply need to place a question by answer very simply it's the same logic.

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,730
So there we go.

71
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,720
Let's do that quickly.

72
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,860
Answer.

73
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,400
Clean answers.

74
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:52,150
For word in answer that split if were not in word to count that's the same we used the same dictionary

75
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,180
word to word word and word perfect.

76
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,670
See done.

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,730
Wonderful.

78
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,440
Perfect.

79
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,380
So now let's execute these lines.

80
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,860
This code section to create this dictionary.

81
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,960
It's going to take a while because well no not that long because we go through all the words of all

82
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
the questions and all the answers but there we go.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,330
That's done.

84
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:22,540
We have this dictionary created which will be very useful for us to remove the words that are below

85
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,220
a certain threshold of frequency.

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,470
That was the first step.

87
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,900
Now we're going to move onto the next step which will be to actually choose this threshold and then

88
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,690
count the number of words that appear more than the chosen threshold and we will do that in the next

89
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,290
tutorial and so then and Jaideep an anti.
