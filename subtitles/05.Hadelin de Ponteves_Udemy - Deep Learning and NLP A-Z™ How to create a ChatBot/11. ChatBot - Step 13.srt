00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,300
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial and this one we're going to add the last tokens to our two previous

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,910
dictionaries that we just created.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,710
And these last tokens are the ones that are useful for the encoder and the decoder in the sector like

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,110
model which are you know the star of string that we're going to encode by as so as the end of string

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:25,440
that we're going to encode by the OS the iPad which is very important for our model because the process

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,600
turning data and the sequences in the batches should all have the same length and therefore we have

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,320
to input this token in an empty position.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,660
And eventually we will create a last token which will call out and that corresponds to all the words

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,130
that were filtered out by our two previous dictionaries.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,030
Thanks to these dictionaries we know which words are not the five percent least we can word so later

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,800
on in one or two tutorials.

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:00,130
We will use these dictionaries to replace all the words all these five percent less frequent words.

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:08,010
By this token out so that these 5 percent less frequent words are all replaced by one same common token

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,330
which will be out.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,240
So that's why it's very important for us right now to create these tokens.

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,310
And of course add them to our two dictionaries.

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,690
Questions words to end and answers words to it.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,050
So let's do that.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:31,060
Let's start by creating our list of final tokens so we're going to name that list tokens and remember

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,980
ellipses in square brackets.

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,010
And inside we just need to input these tokens so the aura is important here.

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,690
Otherwise this won't work.

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,830
Given the second Dementation that will follow the first one should be the pet inside this pair of symbol.

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,870
We input what we want and we will call it that.

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,730
All right then the next token should be the end of string which will also need to put in quotes.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,100
And these math symbols.

27
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,850
So the end of string we're going to call it.

28
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,590
Oh that's the classic way to call it.

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,490
You will see that in a lot of papers and a lot of documentation the OS end of string.

30
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,700
Then the next one will be the token by which all the words that were filtered out by our previous dictionaries

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,350
will be replaced.

32
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,190
And as we said we want to call it out as in filter out.

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,500
So out and finally the last token we need is the start of string which remember only intuition lectures

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,870
is the first token that should start in the decoding layers.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,020
You know when we decode the output of the encoder which is the context.

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,130
Well the first element of this decoding is the start string.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,370
That's very important.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,770
So that's why we need to include it right here.

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,640
Same in quotes and in these math symbols.

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,050
And we're going to call it the classic way as s star of string.

41
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,060
All right so we have our tokens and now we just need to add them to our previous dictionaries.

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,900
So now we can make two for loop one for loop for the questions worth two in dictionary and one of the

43
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,670
for loop for the answers words to any dictionary.

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,820
And this will be the same for those who will just do a copy paste.

45
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,550
Once we make the first one so for then.

46
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,610
Well we want to basically loop over all these tokens here so the loop variable is going to be called

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,180
token for token in tokens.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,110
Very simply.

49
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,180
Then call in and inside.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,340
We just need to add each one of these tokens to our questions word to any dictionary.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,720
And you know how to do this the trick is just to take our dictionary questions words and some cutting

52
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,700
this and I am pasting that here then in square brackets.

53
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,890
I just need to enter this new key that I'm creating that I'm adding to my dictionary and this new key

54
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,770
is the token.

55
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,230
We are dealing with right now in the loop.

56
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,350
So that's the key because remember the keys identifiers in the questions words to int dictionary are

57
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:18,090
the words that are the tokens and then the values are of course some integers.

58
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,820
Remember it maps to questions words to a unique integer.

59
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,020
So what integer could we choose here.

60
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:30,860
Well it must not be one of the integers created here in this previous code section in this follow here.

61
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,500
But very simply we can just take the max.

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,960
Plus one of all the integers that we created here.

63
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,010
And since these integers were added from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 etc..

64
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:51,090
Well we can simply take the length of the questions words to in dictionary because the length of this

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,130
dictionary corresponds to the total number of keys of this dictionary and that is the total number of

66
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,880
values.

67
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,390
And since we counted from 0 to number of keys well we can simply take here the length of this dictionary

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,350
plus one.

69
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:11,690
And with this will be sure that we have a unique integer for our new token.

70
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,090
So I'm going to add here Len.

71
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,860
Then I'm going to paste my dictionaries again and I'm going to add plus one as we just said and that's

72
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,280
it.

73
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,470
This loop is done because when we're done dealing with this token here in the loop we will get to the

74
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:33,250
next slogan but the length of the questions word in dictionary will have changed because we will have

75
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,940
just added a new token and therefore we are safe here the next token will have a new unique integer

76
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,080
that's perfect that works this way and simply we can move on to our other dictionary for the answers.

77
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,100
Which is answers words to it.

78
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:55,900
And as I said it's exactly the same the same logic when you just need to copy this page here and just

79
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:03,230
replace question by Answer There we go and says words to end.

80
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,880
And same here.

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,070
Answer these words to it are right and that will do it.

82
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,780
So now we simply need to select these lines and execute.

83
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,500
There we go.

84
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,560
We now have our final tokens the essential tokens for the sectors like.

85
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,970
Added to our two dictionaries.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,810
Perfect.

87
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,430
Now we're going to move on to the next step which will be actually very quick and easy because we just

88
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,440
need to create the inverse dictionary of the answers words too in dictionary.

89
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,760
And why do we need to do that.

90
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,940
That's because we'll use this inverse mapping when building the SEC to sec model.

91
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,210
So we simply need to do that quickly and then we'll move on to the last final steps of data processing

92
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,830
and we'll quickly get support to building the at the SEC SEC model.

93
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,220
So I can't wait to get there.

94
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,000
And until then I depend on the.
