00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,070
Hi everyone and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,060
This is going to be a quick video of since we're going be focusing on launching the model that we have

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,880
in the files.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,320
Intenser board.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,890
All right so quickly what content's or board do.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,530
First of all tensor board is essentially a suite of visualization tools for our algorithm.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,920
It can help us learn a lot about our data by projecting word embeddings into a 3-D space by performing

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,450
dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,720
With this we can see how our model has grouped the words together from our vocabulary.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,830
So for example we can see the nearest neighbor in the embedding space for the words.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,820
And here we have the example of centerboard.

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,910
We'll get to in a moment.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,810
And if you want to have some further information about it you can visit the following sites such as

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,650
the tensor flow dot org programmers underscore guide slash summaries and tensor board and you can also

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,960
take a look at the programmer's guide related to embeddings because really and embedding is a mapping

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,550
from discrete objects such as words to vectors or real numbers.

17
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:03,770
All right.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,540
So this is what we want to get first thing we want to do is open up a terminal.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,090
I have one running right now.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,200
So we're going to actually open a new one just for demonstration.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,110
Let me enhance this so we can see a little better.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,150
All right.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,450
And what we want to do here is if you navigate to the files we are going to be launching the following

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,150
model.

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,050
Is the train model we want and you can find it if we go to the SEC to Sec.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,230
It will be in models and train model.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,740
We want to we'll keep that.

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,820
Just move that over here real quick.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,740
I am working on Mac for reference.

30
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,700
We will use the following command the 10 surfboard log directory equals.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,940
Now we want to use our model directory since we're using this when actually just pull it drop it in

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,990
and launch it.

33
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,620
And here we have it the following local localhost we have 6 0 6.

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,030
I'm going to pull it up.

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:13,610
Let's go to a local post 6 6 just double check your local host and we will be loading the tensor board

36
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,430
from our data from our train model right now.

37
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,010
It's computing the principle component analysis.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,790
We'll let that load for a minute.

39
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,030
And there we go.

40
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,790
We have it.

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,230
And you can explore the options here.

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,170
It's just a great way to learn further about your data.

43
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,740
Take a look.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,260
I found 13 tensors you can go into the customisations over here.

45
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:42,020
You can also let's let's zoom zoom in so far let's take a following word to gravity.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:54,240
Zoom back out and let's see by word how it's Matt the nearest points in the original space.

47
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,090
And you can search it by the cow.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,390
You can go to the neighbors adjust the parameters.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,490
It just gives you a range of options to explore your data further.

50
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,900
Let's take another one.

51
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,350
Quickly let's go to correct now.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,450
We have our different variations of words how they're maps they give correct corrected correctly incorrect

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,370
and you can kind of get an idea of the mapping or in general you know how the and LP these words how

54
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,590
important are the distinctions of differentiations between the two similar meanings or how these words

55
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,410
are mapped in general and how it can have an effect on our chap our model.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,580
If you have the time take a look at this take a look at tensor board play around with the operations

57
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,790
the customisations and the options here.

58
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,130
Just because it's a great tool really working with any kind of algorithm if you can load it into centerboard

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,850
you're Green-Wood sensor flow.

60
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,390
It is a great tool to keep to explore your data further and get a better understanding.

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,910
All right.

62
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,410
If you have any questions at always please let us know be more than happy to discuss any information

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,110
related to the course and with that I will see you in the next video.
