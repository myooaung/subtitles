00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.460
Hello guys and girls and ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the deep natural language processing course

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.340
we've got five minutes on our timer and that's because today I've set myself a challenge to get you

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.370
pumped excited and super energized about this course.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450
So let's dive straight into it.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.060
All right.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.070
Get excited.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.570
So Chad but why are they the next big thing why are they becoming so much more popular with every day.

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.860
All right let's have a look.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.300
There's going to be a couple of companies which we all know.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:44.250
Apple Microsoft Google and Amazon and all of them have invested major R&amp;D funds and time and effort

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.580
into chapbooks Apple we all know Siri Microsoft and Android phones have Cortana.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.030
Google had Google now.

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.500
And recently they've come out with something even more involved is and it's called Google assistant.

14
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.840
And finally Amazon has Amazon LXI.

15
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.640
Now don't be surprised that first although it's present these are predominantly voice chat.

16
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.140
So if you can still talk and why text especially the Google one you can still talk that way text but

17
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.380
Siri on Amazon Alexa they're mostly designed as voice chat.

18
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.730
Don't be surprised when we talk about them in this in the context of this course because all of the

19
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.180
algorithms that you will learn all of the methodologies all of the deep natural language processing

20
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.190
techniques they're all applicable to both text and voice and everything that you learn how to create

21
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.890
with the texting.

22
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.770
Chad boughts same exact principles can be used for Wasn't will be pointing that out through the course.

23
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.230
So the question isn't why are these companies now investing so much time money and effort into Chad.

24
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.960
Why is that so sure big thing.

25
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.130
Well think about it.

26
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.640
Like if five years ago you woke up in the morning and you wanted to check the weather.

27
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.640
Then what would you do.

28
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.740
You pull up the phone and you would type into Google how.

29
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.130
What's the weather like for today.

30
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.760
Now you don't do that anymore you just say hey cereal.

31
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.730
Hey Cortona.

32
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.170
And you ask what's the weather like for today.

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.370
That's the fastest way and you get an answer.

34
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.900
And so that's the way where the world is going.

35
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.740
So we started off with computers where we had to type on our keyboards all the time to get information.

36
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.660
Then we moved to smartphones which smartphones were moved to Florida where you could have Internet where

37
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.730
you could look up information.

38
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.080
Then we move to smartphones with touch where you could touch and type like the keyboard actual typing

39
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.220
thing in the virtual keyboard.

40
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.890
And then we move to voice so you can see this progression of user interface.

41
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:59.010
And what we're moving towards is referred to by Satti Nadella who's the CEO of Microsoft over here.

42
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.470
Q First do it as conversation as a platform and more and more we're going to be moving in that direction.

43
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.150
So we need computers which can understand our voices or if we in some cases we need type who for using

44
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.960
our messaging app they need to understand human language.

45
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.040
And that's why voters have a problem.

46
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.940
So it's a whole shift in the user interface paradigm.

47
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.550
And one company is missing from this list.

48
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.410
What is that company why did we leave it out.

49
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.100
But it's called Facebook.

50
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.240
A massive company.

51
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.830
Why is it on the list.

52
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.280
Well because Facebook is doing something even more radical.

53
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.770
They created their own factory of chappals.

54
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.890
Let's have a look here.

55
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.040
We have one minute 24 seconds.

56
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.420
It's cold.

57
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.210
It's alive.

58
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.810
I know.

59
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.530
And if you go here you can build a chapel for your Facebook page so you have a Facebook community.

60
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.780
You can just create a child bot and program it for it for it to be able to communicate with your users

61
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.500
to help.

62
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.830
So why is this important for businesses and for communities and so on.

63
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.310
So here's a couple reasons.

64
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.890
Childbirths are telling them their fast drive conversations and are relevant.

65
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.840
Another very big one is that chat boards are scalable.

66
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.220
They're the most scaleable approach a business can take in order to interact with users.

67
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.390
GM 100 customers need one support representative.

68
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.290
Then we have 100000 customers you need Gunjan eat a thousand supporter visitors.

69
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.480
But if you have a child but you're always going to have one child and that costs a lot of costs and

70
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480
Greeces efficiency.

71
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.960
So have a look around here that's available Clive.

72
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.500
How much time.

73
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.860
Twenty six seconds.

74
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.690
Always finish off with a movie recommendation.

75
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.460
So if you'd like to get a feel for the world we're going into.

76
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.660
Check out this movie it's called her very interesting movie.

77
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.560
It's a lie to ex machina if you haven't seen it.

78
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.890
Or if you know me you know it's my favorite movie.

79
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.160
This is very similar.

80
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.550
Very interesting thoughts.

81
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.000
It's all about that Julia notice you doesn't have a keyboard or mouse here anymore.

82
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.550
All right.

83
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.280
That's how Tyrer and enjoy the course.

84
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.370
Let's get this thing started.

85
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.720
And I look for see you on the first story.
