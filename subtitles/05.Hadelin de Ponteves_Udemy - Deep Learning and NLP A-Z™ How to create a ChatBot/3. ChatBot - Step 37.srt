00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,910
Hayes welcome to part for testing the SEC to sec model and congratulations for having reached this far

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,000
indeed you built a brain you trained the brain and now you're about to chat with a chat but so congratulations.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,130
You did the most difficult part.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,760
So as you can see right now on my computer the training is still going on.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,970
I just woke up after a good night's sleep.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,360
And as you can see we've reached already the third book and I already got some weight that we can see

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,160
here in File Explorer.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,780
So these are the first weights and therefore these are not the weights of some very smart brain.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,620
Or should I say of some brain with high abilities to speak with us.

10
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,850
So we're going to have to wait some more for some better weight.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,170
And on my computer unfortunately this is going to take a couple of days.

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,680
But no we will get them.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,050
And besides in the meantime I'll give you an awesome pre-trained chat but which is my favorite.

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,370
But in the whole internet so I will show you how to execute this chat and chat with it.

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,380
But in the meantime we're going to implement part four now to test the second sic model and basically

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,930
implemented code that allows us to speak with the chair.

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,380
But in the council but as far as I'm concerned I'm going to do that on another computer because I want

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,030
to leave the training do it things peacefully on this computer.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,940
So I'm going to jump now to my other computer.

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,330
Welcome guys and welcome again to part for testing the sector to signal.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,060
So as you can see I've transferred everything from the old computer on which the training is going to

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,030
this computer which is by the way my laptop.

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,870
And so now we're going to implement part four that will allow us to chat with the chat but with the

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,530
weights that we've got so far.

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,080
After a couple of hours of training I remind that the results will be very poor because the chat but

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,620
needs to train a lot more to know how to speak like this would be the case for a child learning how

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,920
to speak but you will know how to implement the code to chat with a chat.

28
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,630
But and besides when we have better wait in a couple of days well we will load these ways of course

29
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,990
in a flashlight to have a better chat with the checkbook.

30
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,440
All right so we're going to start by actually loading these weights and running the session.

31
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:22,220
And so to do that I'm going to introduce the checkpoint variable which is going to contain the path

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,650
to these weights.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,920
And so the path is in the working directory for that which is this folder right now.

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,880
And in this folder.

35
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:40,780
Well we need to get the shot but underscore weights that S.K. Peachi and that's it you know.

36
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,070
So only this part in the weights you don't have to include the rest.

37
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,430
So jabat weights that seek it.

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,120
All right.

39
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,470
So that's our checkpoint.

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,560
And now what we're going to do is open a session so introducing a new voice won't hear session and I'm

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,280
getting a sense of flow because the session is actually going to be new object of the interactive session

42
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,100
class which we already used.

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,670
It was actually in the training.

44
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,850
So now we have our session and now we're going to do is the same you know we take our session object

45
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:22,820
and then used a run method from this object to initialize the global variables with tens of flow that

46
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,620
global variables initialiser this one.

47
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,450
And with some parenthesis.

48
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:37,280
And then after that that's where we will connect these loaded weights to the session and to do this

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,850
we'll have to create a new object.

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:47,360
This Savir object which will create by taking tenths of first then the train module and then the saver

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,310
class.

52
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,700
All right so this is just an object of the saver class.

53
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,450
And now that's where we connect the session to the checkpoint through the Saveur because we're going

54
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,190
to take our Savior and then use the restore.

55
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,590
It's like a load function.

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,050
The restore method from the saver class to connect our session and our checkpoint.

57
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,900
All right.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,970
And there we go.

59
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,080
This way we load the weights.

60
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,440
All right.

61
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,930
And no need to execute anything right now will execute everything in the end.

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,790
So I'll see you in the next tutorial for the next step which will be to make a function that will convert

63
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,880
the sequences and string in the question to sequences of there including integers.

64
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,450
We'll need to do that to set up the chat afterwards which will be our last step until then.

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,280
And again I'll be.
