00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,410
Hi everyone welcome back.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,340
In this video we're going to be running the jackpot so let's jump straight into it.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,960
And you have the files attached to this video.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,580
So if you download the files unzip them.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,130
You can also find them here.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,060
If you go through the untrain modeled on zip it you can access the files that way as well but they are

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,720
attached to this lecture.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,320
Now the first thing we want to do is we want to open a terminal.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,440
All right we have a new terminal Actually I'm going to close it out since I was already in the directory.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,870
I'm going to open a new terminal.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,740
We also need our files.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,430
This is the folder the entire folder.

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,270
In it we have this set to set chat by folder.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,600
Now what we want to do if you're in the terminal prompt We want to go to that location so I'm going

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,110
to see a minute drag and drop into it and we're to enter that directory or that path.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,760
And this is what we're looking for we want the set to sec dash chap.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,950
We're looking to use the models Cornello movie dialogue train model the one that we can set the chap

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,750
up like that.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:13,320
So we will be using that come in Python chat up my models slash Cornell movie dialogue slash train model

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,720
underscore V-1 slash best weight training checkpoint

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,220
and to go over that one more time.

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,260
So you see we have our path here will be the models.

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,550
Let's go to models.

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:38,500
Since we're in these two sec models Cornell movie dialogue train model V-1 and we want the best training

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,540
checkpoint.

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,830
And with that I'm going to close this make a little more clear.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,230
Who is this we can run it.

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,810
Here we go.

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,740
It should initialize and load all khabar load the model

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,260
has a lot of weight.

31
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,270
And there we have it you are ready to start chatting with the chatbot.

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,840
So let's test out a few.

33
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,510
Hi good.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,130
How are you.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:12,180
And you can play around with the commands the conversation fantastic and really what we can do here

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,920
which makes it even more interesting is if you explore the commands you can actually set the being like

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,080
the penalty we can set it with the flag beam lag penalty equals pick a number.

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,080
Let's try to we can also set the max answer length and you can see here that the command shows you that

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,390
it was set to 2.

40
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,780
We can do the flag for Max answer length.

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,210
Let's try five.

42
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,760
These are just as an example.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,800
You can go through the rest if you want to reset them to the default settings.

44
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,150
You will use the flag reset and you have it reset to the default settings and there you have it you

45
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,680
were able to converse with the chat but again play around with the commands.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,770
Experiment with it try and implement new things.

47
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,430
Test the conversations.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,600
It's a great way to learn with any model is just pure experimentation.

49
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,570
Also I almost forgot to mention if you want to train the model further you can actually pick up on resume

50
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,010
training.

51
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,360
Here you can find the instructions in the repository to resume the training model or an existing model.

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,920
You can run train pie with the model checkpoint path that's just for a reference if you ever want to

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,670
experiment with a further and try other data sets.

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,570
I know the core of your movie dataset is one of the go to but you can also think about using the Twitter

55
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,820
corpus the Reddit data set and any other one that you would like to test out on a last note.

56
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,320
Thank you to Abraham again for allowing us to use and explore this model.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,250
If you guys come across any ideas implementations that you would like to discuss any questions about

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,370
this model please feel free to share them in the Q&amp;A.

59
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,410
And we would be more than happy to discuss them.

60
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,800
I hope that you have enjoyed this update.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,890
I have taken away some information that you can use to improve your models further.

62
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,910
And with that we can wrap things up enjoy the jackpot.
