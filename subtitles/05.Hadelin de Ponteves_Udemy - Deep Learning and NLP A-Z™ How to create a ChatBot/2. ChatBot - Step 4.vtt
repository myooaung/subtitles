Hello and welcome to part one data pre-processing just before we start this part we're going to import

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.510
the libraries that we'll need to implement our Chad.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.270
But good news there are only four libraries that will need first come by to work with arrays.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.610
Then tons of flow.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.340
Of course to do all the deeper stuff then the our library which will use to clean the text and make

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.940
them as simple as possible for our job to learn the best conditions and the time library to measure

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.110
the training time of each epoch.

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.570
This will be interesting to see.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.500
To keep track of the training.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.780
All right so let's import these libraries and then we'll be good to start.

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.840
Part 1 data processing.

12
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.770
So let's start with the first one.

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.190
The most classic one non-pilot so to import library with python we need to start with import.

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.820
Then we enter the name of the library which is named by here.

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.820
And then we can give it a shortcut especially if we're going to use it a lot and for non-pay we're going

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.560
to give the classic shortcut.

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.910
All right.

18
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.870
Then of course sense of flow import tensor flow as T.F..

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.690
We're going to use of flow.

20
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.080
So the shortcut T.F. will be very useful then as we said we're going to import also the r e library

21
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.400
that will be used to clean the text and especially to replace some characters by some more simple characters

22
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:38.670
to simplify the conversations as much as possible and eventually we are going to import that time library

23
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.040
to measure the training time.

24
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.150
All right perfect.

25
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.960
And now we're going to make sure that you have everything installed correctly and to do this you're

26
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.910
going to select these full lines of code here and then execute to execute the trick is to press command

27
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.690
on Mac or control if you're on Windows or Linux plus enter and then you can see on the console that

28
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.820
the libraries were imported correctly.

29
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.540
If they're not imported correctly you'll get an error.

30
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.440
So make sure you get this.

31
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.660
If you get this that means that everything was installed properly.

32
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.590
And for those of you who skipped the Anaconda installation tutorial made sure to have a look at it because

33
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.100
we create a virtual environment inside which we install tons of flow.

34
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.180
So make sure we're on the same page here.

35
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.280
And if that's the case.

36
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.810
Well congratulations.

37
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.510
You are ready to start part 1 day of pre-processing.

38
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.350
So we'll start in next tutorial.

39
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.260
And until then and Jaideep and I'll be.
