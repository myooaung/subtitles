Emma's team is already ecstatic with the progress she's made,

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.830
but they're worried about their low unit test code coverage.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.320
They're moving fast and would like to add in a manual step

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.310
to make sure that they don't inadvertently break everything

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.880
and deploy it to production.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.220
With CodePipeline, a manual approval step is perfect for this kind of use case,

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
and in this video we're going to set that up.

8
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.550
To configure a manual approval action,

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.640
we will need to have an existing SNS topic and subscription.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.560
I've created a CloudFormation template that will set that up for us quickly.

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.710
It will use SMS to notify us that an approval is needed.

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.270
You just need to add your phone number.

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
Open your command line and navigate to the demo project root.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.080
Run this command, adding your own phone number to the end,

15
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.940
including the country code.

16
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.540
It's a pretty long command, so I'm not going to read it out.

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.360
Once the command is run,

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.820
it should only take a minute or so for the

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.220
CloudFormation stack to finish building.

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.840
Now go to the AWS console and your hbfl pipeline.

21
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.890
Let's add a manual approval step right before we deploy in the deploy stage.

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800
Click the Edit button.

23
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.840
Now scroll to the deploy stage and click the Edit stage button.

24
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.540
We'll add the manual approval action before the deploy action,

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.440
so click the Add action group above the deploy action.

26
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.740
Now name the action Approval.

27
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.150
In the action provider drop‑down select Manual approval.

28
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.240
In the SNS topic ARN input, select the ARN ending in hbfl‑codepipeline.

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.340
You can see there are some other fields you can add,

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.860
like a URL to send reviewers to if your app had a testing environment

31
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.530
set up, and some comments. We're done with this for now so click the

32
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.040
Done button and then Done on the stage.

33
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.010
Now we need to save our changes, so click the Save button and then Save. Now to

34
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.430
see our manual approval in action, let's kick off the pipeline again by

35
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.950
clicking Release change and then Release. As the pipeline runs, it will

36
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.010
eventually hit the manual approval action and then pause. At around the same

37
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.210
moment, you should get a notification SMS to your phone indicating the approval

38
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.920
is waiting for you. Now in the pipeline, you'll see a Review button has

39
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.140
appeared in the approval step.

40
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.540
Click that Review button.

41
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.530
Here's where you can approve or reject the action,

42
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.110
adding a comment if you want. You can also see where the

43
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.840
action comments and URL to review would go.

44
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.540
I'm going to click Approve so the pipeline can continue.

45
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.140
And now that it's approved, the deploy action will run.

46
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.720
Now let's look at a rejection.

47
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.180
I've teleported my pipeline back to the review process,

48
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.740
and now I'm going to hit Reject.

49
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.740
You can see the action shows as rejected, and the deploy stage shows as failed.

50
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.120
If you open up the details of the approval action,

51
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.510
you can see that it shows which user rejected the

52
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.890
action and any comments that were left,

53
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.330
which can be useful for bookkeeping or research purposes.

54
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.440
All of this action result information will also be there for approvals.

55
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.160
You can try the approval again by clicking this retry button.

56
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.390
This won't pull new code from CodeCommit,

57
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.000
but will use the pre existing artifacts and just retry the rejected approval action.
