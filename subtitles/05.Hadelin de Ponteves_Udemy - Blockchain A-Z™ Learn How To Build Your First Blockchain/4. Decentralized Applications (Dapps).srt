Hello to welcome back so of course I'm blogging.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,320
And today we're going to touch on very briefly decentralized applications or DAPs and that's because

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,070
it's an important topic as you will hear about it especially in the time to come.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,100
There will be more DAPs and they will be more becoming more widespread.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,390
It's not something called more complex than a smart country but less I think it's worth mentioning.

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,950
So let's have a look there there's where we left off previously we've got our smart contracts that go

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,820
to a network like this.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,590
The complexity of this system is growing very fast.

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,730
I know let's just make some space here at the bottom.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,840
What is a dad.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,840
Well a dad is this it is an interface for people to connect with as well.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,340
It's not just an interface.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,540
It contains an interface for people to interact with something on the block chain.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,940
So ADAP consists of a front end and a back end which is the smart concept.

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,960
So in a way your or think of the smart contract as the API or the application programming interface

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,330
for applications to interact with the block chain.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,940
So basically if you like let's say if you wanted if you wanted to if you wanted to create an application

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,760
for that would like to if an app on the phone or a or some other app that's like on an iPad or on the

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,850
computer that would interact to a server you would need to use API you would need to somehow get into

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,440
that server and use the right connectors and things like that to get to that server and get information

21
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,340
that's right.

22
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,650
Good information there.

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,080
So you got a smart contract has a way for an application.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,940
So this is an application to interact with the block change put things on the blush and take things

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,570
from.

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,770
And then there's a front end for people to track.

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,120
So that's what decentralized applications are.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,970
They use smart contracts to track with the block chain and they allow users to interact with the application

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,610
itself.

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:18,030
And let's have a look an example one of the most famous examples is DMARDs and this space is evolving

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,250
so quickly so when you're watching this video stream it might not exist or he or it might be super huge.

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,700
But surely there are other examples of decentralized applications which you can find.

33
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,690
But it is kind of like Twitter.

34
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:39,690
But on block change so you can just like go in here and you will actually see that like this is information

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,620
being loaded onto your screen onto all in this case my screen and it's quite slow but I don't think

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,030
that's the block chain problem.

37
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,920
It's mostly could be Australian internet problem.

38
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,260
It's not the best here but like this information has just been loaded not from a server but from a block

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,750
chain.

40
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,800
So it's kind of like Twitter in a way but it's it's totally decentralized.

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,920
It's like all of this all of these all of this data is stored on the block chain.

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,660
People are interacting or blocking and this is an application.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,060
This web site then application which allows users to like drag which other butts in the back and all

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,030
this is going through a block.

45
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,210
So there we go that steam and check it out.

46
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:34,710
If you would like to learn more it's a it's a new way of life which disrupts Twitter with blocking.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,840
And on that note Popinjay's Tauriel we could see him better next time.

48
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,470
And so then bludgeons.
