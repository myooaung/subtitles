1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,020
A little collective of course on block chain.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,190
And today we're talking about soft forks and hard for us.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,630
So we already mentioned folks a couple of times the most recent time was when we spoke about the Dow

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,360
attack and how they solved the problem by creating a hard for.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,310
So let's have a look at what that means what is hard for it was for.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,350
And what are some examples.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:35,050
So this is what happened back then you 3M in July 2016.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,440
BLOCK number 1 9 1 9 9 9 9.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,650
So one hundred nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:53,940
What they did is they introduced new rules that would allow to reverse the logic in the contract that

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,230
allows the attacker to steal either from the doll.

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:07,550
And what that meant is after that that turned into a hard fork and basically we'll talk about exactly

13
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,510
what hard for kids.

14
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:16,310
But after that the theorem chain continued and they reversed the funds and returned them back to other

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,820
people that contributed them and close down the dollar.

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,290
At the same time there were people as we discussed that were unhappy with this decision because they

17
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,420
said that look it's very sad that the money was stolen.

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,330
But at the same time rules are rules.

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,100
If we said that contracts are binding on the blog chain then they have to be such.

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:43,610
And it's your fault that you made a mistake in the code and we will not agree to changing it so some

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:54,050
minors decided not to go ahead with that not to change their software to the new hard fought so hard

22
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:01,220
for Wisky mean there's a new software than you and you upgrade to the Bauchi software which allows for

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,760
certain things that previously were not allowed that were not possible.

24
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,230
And so what happens then is what happened then is the chain.

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,190
Those miners continued mining the old way that didn't upgrade.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,700
They split off so they split off into their own version and that version is now called ethereal classic.

27
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,860
So right now there's two you can look at them on the exchange you'll see that there's a theorem and

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,370
is at the classic And that's the reason why it happened because there was the doll attack and some people

29
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:39,620
didn't agree to bending the rules to returning money back into back from such an attack.

30
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,710
And so yeah majority went with this but some still went with this.

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:52,140
And so you can see that theme classic is traded is actually quite a big cryptocurrency.

32
00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:03,030
Another example of a hard Forgue is Bitcoin bitcoin in July 2017 in July 2013 on 20th July 2017.

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,050
Bitcoin accepted segregated witness but that happened as a sophomore and that happened on block number

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,400
four hundred and seventy six thousand seven hundred sixty eight.

35
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:21,490
That's where Bitcoin except the or more C-grade witness we've already touched on segregate this before.

36
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
And the interesting thing it was the software.

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,260
So there's no reason for this to happen this doesn't happen.

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,480
And so folks that really will understand exactly why it is second in the next couple of slides of this

39
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,710
and why we saw that doesn't happen.

40
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,650
As you can see everything went smoothly.

41
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:45,440
However there were still people who are unhappy with this decision to desegregate witness because they

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:54,530
thought that doing segregated witness is a way like favors people who want to treat bitcoin as a digital

43
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,230
investment rather than actual actual currency because this doesn't increase the books.

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,030
So there were people who before so agreed with this were arguing that we shouldn't have Remember cigarette

45
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,910
witness or die.

46
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,830
What it did is it stripped out the signature from the block and put it into its own messaging system

47
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,860
meaning that now effectively you can put two megabytes or two between two and four megabytes of transactions

48
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,880
or two or four minutes which was actually the blog.

49
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,110
You get all the blocks has to worry about it because out-of-home for the signatures will be stripped

50
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,790
and the transaction the core transactions themselves are only going to take up less than 1 megabyte.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,490
But they were people before security.

52
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,360
Witness like before here who are saying they were opposing C-grade with and they were saying that look

53
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:46,130
C-grade witness is like a patch solution is a temporary solution to the problem we have let's increase

54
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:52,070
the block size to 8 megabytes and let's have it that way we just can put in more transactions into a

55
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,670
book anyway.

56
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,770
Let's do that and increase the block size.

57
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:02,050
And so the majority of you know the bitcoin network and community said no we want to keep.

58
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,210
We want to go has agreed with this official they did this of course here.

59
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,060
And everything went nice well but people who were posing with this there were still unhappy and they

60
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,650
decided to just buy themselves to do that upgrade to 8 megabytes to increase the block size.

61
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,070
And so what happened this happened on the first of August so that it was this was 20th of July this

62
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,950
was first of all was not that far away like 10 days.

63
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,570
What happened.

64
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,330
So that was good for so forth.

65
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,100
They don't block 4 7 8 5 5 8.

66
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,620
What happened is Bitcoin continued.

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
But there were some miners who switched to Bitcoin cash.

68
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,050
This uses the most called that cash and why.

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,600
Why was it Bitcoin cash.

70
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,830
Well because that's just the name they chose.

71
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,510
Well the difference here is that on this version the block size has increased it's eight megabytes Whereas

72
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,310
on this version it's still 1 megabytes.

73
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,180
And that's that's the difference why they changed I started doing this and that inevitably the chain

74
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:12,840
split into two that happened in August 2017 and then interestingly enough if we move this here.

75
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,160
So interesting enough the ethereal energy was just continued.

76
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,030
And but this was in 2006.

77
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,430
So this is how this one group that was that way.

78
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,500
But in the Bitcoin world it continued but actually in on 24th of October 2017.

79
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,500
So not that many months afterwards.

80
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,340
Blog number 4 9 1 4 0 7.

81
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,420
Another hard for Copland's So another hard for.

82
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,130
What happened was people were unhappy with this whole situation.

83
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,980
Remember we're talking about a sick mining and that they completely made DGP use redundant.

84
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,690
Some people are unhappy with that and they decided we want to go back to GP you mining.

85
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:07,020
And so at that blog they changed their software to make it a sick resistant so that miners miners could

86
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,580
no longer mine it and therefore they went to Bitcoin gold.

87
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,310
And that happened in October.

88
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,730
So this is actually for the Southfork 20th of July this happened first of August the hard for to Bitcoin

89
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:26,310
cash and 24th of October happened hard for Bitcoin gold so there's always reason so there's a reason

90
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,090
for the dollar tax.

91
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,590
They had to change the software to raise the money here.

92
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,640
Bitcoin cash was on happy the Segway so they changed their software to increase book size to 4 megabytes

93
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,050
and because these are not compatible they're inevitably a chain split.

94
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,920
And here the reason was that these miners were not happy with aligning with asix because A-6 are very

95
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,460
expensive devices they want just continue mining with GP use like back in the old days.

96
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,750
And so they just pull it off and they change their software to become a sick resistant like they get

97
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,910
3M hashing is a separate system.

98
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,960
And so they split off into Bitcoin gold as you can see this can happen very freely because it is a distributed

99
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,370
system.

100
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,130
So the participants decide its future for themselves and if somebody is unhappy or something and there's

101
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,840
enough there's enough support for that cause they can just split off into their own network and start

102
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,370
you know they're all watching.

103
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,200
No there is no central authority to say no we're not doing this or this is not allowed.

104
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,670
No they can do whatever they want.

105
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,980
And that's the beauty of the system and so maybe maybe after some time some of these boards might be

106
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,330
like turn out to be and like people stop liking them people don't want to mind them and then they'll

107
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,830
just die off or maybe they'll continue growing or maybe they'll grow something big that concussions

108
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,340
is pretty big right now.

109
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,440
Yeah.

110
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,410
So that's how this thing works.

111
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,630
Couple of things to mention here.

112
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,350
So first of all we'll talk about some folks just now and we'll talk about hardcore acts as well.

113
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:04,290
The thing I wanted to mention here is that if you are on funds before a hard for is first of all.

114
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,540
First of all this sort of this part fork's don't have to result in a split.

115
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,090
So the owners are split if there's people who are unhappy with certain things.

116
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,430
So it's as if we couldn't catch the people who wanted to go to a big buy so the hole between that were

117
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,790
just 28 megabytes.

118
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,050
Everybody would go down this route and it would be just called Bitcoin but would go like that way with

119
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,130
eight megabytes.

120
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:32,430
And so that for a hard for it's a term that's is like reference's software.

121
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,470
So they're forking the software and they're forking the change.

122
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,550
Is a soft form of the software.

123
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,160
There's a hard fork of the software here but as you can see it results in a physical form of the chain

124
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,500
simply because there are people who are unhappy with the way the hard work work.

125
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,220
So in reality this is the hard for the software is the hard fork.

126
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,200
But what we do see is we actually see a physical fault because people decide.

127
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,290
Some people choose to chose to serve the old version.

128
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,740
So that's important to understand that forking refer is a good hub a common term that is there for to

129
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,670
take making a copy of the software.

130
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,530
And if it's a software we'll discuss It's one thing hard for Wasil discusses different thing but it

131
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,840
just happens that if there are people who are unhappy with the heart for it then we'll see the split

132
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
the physical split in the chain.

133
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,870
So the term originates from what we do with the software and we do the change.

134
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,640
The other thing is that if there is a physical split in the chain like we see here if you own fonds

135
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,450
at the start.

136
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,100
Like here for instance of a theory if the theory is you don't either.

137
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
And there's a hard fork like that which actually results in the chain then you will keep on.

138
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,560
So let's say you own 100 E-3 here you will own 100 either here but you will also get 100 E-3 classic.

139
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,060
Why is that.

140
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,560
Well because the 3M chain is this one.

141
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,980
But the classic chain is not just this little bit.

142
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,720
It's this whole bit all the way up to here.

143
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,440
So classic actually has the exact same history up until this blog as a theory.

144
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:08,440
So any transactions any any mind goy mind currency that happened before the split will be present in

145
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,190
both chains and that explains how the hacker could steal you know some money here they stole from the

146
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,070
dollar they stole 50 million worth of either.

147
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,330
And then that a mob got reverted back to the people of the Dow.

148
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,170
The the investors of the Dow they got the money back.

149
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,990
But then the hacker also walked away with 50 million worth of either classic in the end.

150
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,190
How did that happen.

151
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,190
Well because of this for obviously when the hag happened like it was 150 million dollars the hack happened.

152
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,770
It was all in the ether.

153
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,690
And I think that it was all either so soon as it had happened the price were either dropped because

154
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,630
you know there was uncertainty and so then it also splits.

155
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,930
The prices change or so maybe at the time of the.

156
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,470
It wasn't as much as he actually walked away with 67 billion dollars.

157
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,340
It wasn't as much as that.

158
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,740
That's according to the Bloomberg article that we mentioned previously the Brister.

159
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:09,090
So at some point the Bloomberg article mentioned measured it to be 67 million dollars.

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,880
Doesn't that doesn't mean it was right there was out of money.

161
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,330
But the point is in term in terms of gold in terms of either.

162
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,090
Yes.

163
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,400
All of that gets duplicated so all there was a hacker duplicated here and got reverted back to the owners.

164
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,810
And here it stayed with that Tiger because the new rules were not adopted by the classic in terms of

165
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,300
Bitcoin.

166
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,380
Same thing if you own Bitcoin here if you own if you own one bitcoin before 20 of July just before June

167
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,750
and July before first of all it was thousands of because 20th July was over here.

168
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,710
This label should be over here.

169
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,690
This is first of August 2013.

170
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,880
If you own one bitcoin before.

171
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:53,080
First of all we sell 17th 17 stores here then right now you will have one bitcoin cash you'll have one

172
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,690
bitcoin gold and you'll have one bitcoin.

173
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:02,310
That's how these things work because again the whole history is surance if you owned that say one bitcoin

174
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,330
if you purchase the Bitcoin between the first of August and 24th of October somewhere in here right

175
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,830
now you'll have zero bid on cash and they should purchase it separately but you also have one Bitcoin

176
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,880
and one bitcoin gold.
