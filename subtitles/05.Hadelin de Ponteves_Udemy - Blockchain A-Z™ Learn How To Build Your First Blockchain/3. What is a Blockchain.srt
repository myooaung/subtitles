00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,680
Hello and welcome back to the course of blogging today we'll find out what a blog is at a high level.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,160
So bludgeons Where did they come from.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,860
Well the concept initially came from these two people.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,440
They didn't necessarily coined or introduced the term block change that came much later after the original

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,450
paper by Cistercian or Comodo but these two gentlemen over here stood a habor and called Stern Netzer

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,020
in 1991 published a paper called How to time stamp a digital document.

7
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,790
And if you look through the paper you read through it you'll find that the concepts of what now we call

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:55,650
it a block chain and all or most of the features and ideas behind the notion actually are present in

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,340
that paper.

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:04,260
And the way we keep pedia identifies a block chain is a book that is continuously growing list of records

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,390
called blocks which are linked and secured using crypto cryptography.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,310
So this is a very general definition.

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,280
There's much more to abortion as we'll see.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,470
But this is already some place for us to start.

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,600
So let's have a look at one of these records are so-called blocks what constitutes a block Well a block

16
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,620
because it's a record.

17
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,970
We'll obviously have a data inside it.

18
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,920
For instance it might have just a string of words hello world.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,060
Then it will have a value which is called a previous hash and we'll get to this in a second and then

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,570
we'll have a value which is its own hash.

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,390
And what the hash is is it's like a fingerprint of this block.

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:57,870
It's like taking the first two elements the data and the previous hash and finding the like a number

23
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,520
which represents that data.

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,110
So a shortened version of that data specifically 64 characters long.

25
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,110
I will talk about hash more in the future.

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,640
But basically right now the best way to think about it is a hash a digital hash is like a fingerprint

27
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,630
of some amount of data.

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,740
And that makes its much clearer or makes it clearer now what's going on.

29
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,520
So the block here has its own hash and then the previous hash which is contained within the block as

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,910
a reference is actually the hash of the block that came before it.

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,250
So let's have a look at that in action.

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,830
So here we've got block number one.

33
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,290
It's also called the Genesis block in a box in the first block and it's called jazzes block because

34
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,870
after the block chain is initialized that block will always stay blocking them on forever and ever and

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,740
ever for eternity it will never change.

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,830
That's no other block will become the once.

37
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,610
This block is always going to be the first one.

38
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,440
That's where it all originate.

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,970
You might have some data in it.

40
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,250
We're not going to go into detail what kind of data is in there but assuming there's some data it doesn't

41
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,070
have a previous hash inside this block because this is the jettisons block is the only block that will

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,640
have a previous hash.

43
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,450
So we're just going to present them all zeros and then it will have its own hash again.

44
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,820
For now let's think of hash as a fingerprint.

45
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,940
We'll find out more about how these hashes are derived in coming to Torro And then there is block number

46
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,150
two and a book on Mattoo also has some data.

47
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,150
This time it does have a previous hash and it has its own hash again.

48
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,770
And as you can see the block is the previous hash of block number two is exactly identical or is exactly

49
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,060
block number ones hash and that is where the link comes.

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,870
That is why abortion is called a chain or a block chain because the blocks are cryptographically linked

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,780
with each other through these hashes.

52
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,650
And again more of that not to come.

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,250
But this is conceptually hard works every brought block has its own fingerprint and it also references

54
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,450
the fingerprints of the previous block.

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,650
So if anything were to change and block number one it's fingerprint would change.

56
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,150
So if anything were to change here

57
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,920
anything would that change in the data.

58
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,210
So somebody were to tamper with the data.

59
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,490
This fingerprint would change and it would no longer match this fingerprint.

60
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,990
So this block would know or we would know by looking at this block that somebody tampered with this

61
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,650
block.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,010
And then again looking at the three data it's got the previous hash it's got its own hash and it's linked

63
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,140
to the so on and so on.

64
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,540
So again Conceptually we can see that if anybody were to tamper with any block this one and this one

65
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:52,420
then the fingerprints would no longer match up and the chain would be invalid the chain would show that

66
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,100
there's something wrong.

67
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,680
And that's why Bloch's That's why we say that blocks are cryptographically linked together.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,120
All right so that is a blockade at a very very high level to get us started.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,830
There are many more concepts to blockades and things like mining distributed peer to peer network consensus

70
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,340
protocol immutable ledger and hash cryptography.

71
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,770
So right now many of these bytes are very alien or very confusing at the moment.

72
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,300
And that's totally fine because we're going to go through them one by one in the coming tutorials and

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,630
debunk all miffs and understand exactly how everything works and we're going to start in the next tutorial

74
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,440
with hash cryptography.

75
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:40,420
But for now if you'd like to learn a little bit more about boxes from the original source where the

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,840
idea first came up I highly recommend checking out the paper called How to time stamp a digital document

77
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,880
by habor and stern as the links here and also the link is going to be in the course notes and you'll

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,770
be able to just click it there and go head to the paper if you like to check it out.

79
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,420
And on that note I look forward to the next tutorial.

80
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,220
And until then in your actions.
