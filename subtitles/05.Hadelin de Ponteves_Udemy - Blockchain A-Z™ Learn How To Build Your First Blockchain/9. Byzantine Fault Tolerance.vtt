00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.840
Hello and welcome back to the course on block chain.

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.500
We're talking about a very interesting concept called the Byzantine fault tolerance.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.320
It's a very important characteristic not only for block chains but also for any type of decentralized

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.280
system.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.890
So let's have a look.

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.370
The story goes that a long long time ago there was a castle which the Byzantine Empire wanted to attack

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.970
and take over.

8
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.620
It's a made up story actually looked into it and I think they just used the name Byzantine Generals

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.360
rather than I don't think is leading to any specific story if you know a story would be know.

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.020
But nevertheless one way or another there's these four generals surrounding a castle and they want to

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.420
attack it can be more than four it can be any number of generals.

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.490
We're going to look at an example of for they want to attack it.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.640
But the thing is they can only win if the majority of them come to a consensus of what to do in fact

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.550
whether they attack or retreat.

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.530
They the majority of these generals have to come to a agreement a consensus on what they're doing is

16
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.310
if they say if in this case three out of four say we're attacking and they're attacked they'll win three

17
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.810
of our four say we're retreating and they retreat fails they'll be all safe and fine.

18
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.820
However if they have chaos and they don't come to consensus they will be destroyed by the enemy.

19
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.360
And that's that's that's how the problem is stance.

20
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.240
And so among his generals there is one who is the main general commander of this army.

21
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.690
And at the same time there's also a trader.

22
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.720
So they don't know who are these generals is.

23
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.630
They could be a traitor.

24
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.450
They might not be a traitor but they could be.

25
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.370
Usually there is.

26
00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.290
And so they don't know who the traitor is and he's there to put some you know like roadblocks in their

27
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.980
way so that they actually don't come to a consensus.

28
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.590
So the question is how do they come up with an algorithm.

29
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.290
How do they come up with a protocol a consensus protocol like that running a bit ahead of ourselves

30
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.690
into the next tutorial here but how do they come up with an algorithm that will help them come to a

31
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.950
decision despite there being a traitor.

32
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.100
So let's have a look.

33
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.340
They can communicate with each other but they can only deliver oral messages so they can write a paper

34
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.030
and pass it around them.

35
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.670
And so basically that's how they can communicate.

36
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.670
And then let's say for example in this case let's say that this general here is the traitor.

37
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.680
There he is.

38
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.160
So what happens is the commander issues the order.

39
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.330
By the way the commander himself could be a traitor.

40
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.940
That's also something they have to keep in mind because if the commander was not the traitor for sure

41
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.700
they would just follow their commanders orders and that's it.

42
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.590
But the commander could be a traitor or so from the perspective of any one of the generals and say look

43
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.210
if you're like this general over here you don't know who out of the three is a traitor and you don't

44
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.060
know who to trust so you have to follow a and an algorithm that everybody agreed to in advance in order

45
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.980
for this to work.

46
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.170
And that's that's a question.

47
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.260
So what is the algorithm and what the algorithm is the one that's proposed in the research paper that

48
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.130
solve this problem by the way.

49
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.840
It sounds very trivial but it's actually a very complex problem.

50
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.870
Well it is a very very complex problem.

51
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.330
It's a complex problem and there's a quite a in-depth mathematical proof to it which includes you know

52
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.500
one of the prior one of the you know specific cases is when there's four generals but they proved for

53
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.320
any number of generals and then we'll see what the answer is just at the end.

54
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.460
But for now the algorithm that they're going to be using is they're going to just look at the majority

55
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.630
of the messages that they get and they're going to base their decision on that.

56
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.290
So let's have a look.

57
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.600
So the main general issue is or let's say his order is attack.

58
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.770
It could be either it doesn't really matter attack or retreat.

59
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.890
Let's remember that as long as they like the majority of them agree on what to do rather than attack

60
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.470
or they don't have to attack they can all agree on retreating slowly fine as well.

61
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.890
But in this case he issues an order to attack.

62
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.720
We can get rid of these other arrows that are pointing back to the manger because they don't don't matter.

63
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.300
He he issues an order and in this case he's not the traitor.

64
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.620
We'll have a look at when he's a traitor just now.

65
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.930
But he's made up his mind.

66
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.520
He doesn't really need to know what they're saying now is between them to decide.

67
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.720
What are they going to do with this order.

68
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.600
You know like they don't know is he the traitor is not the traitor.

69
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.570
So what they've agreed is we're going to relay what the general said to everybody else and they will

70
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.400
take the majority of the vote.

71
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.600
So the trader being the traitor of course what he says is the general told me to attack to retreat.

72
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.870
You know the three green arrows mean attack red arrows of energy.

73
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.580
The general told me to retreat.

74
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.160
So he says this goes to these two general told me to retreat.

75
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.010
Then next one this guy this general says to everybody the general told me to attack because he is just

76
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.120
saying what the generals.

77
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.130
And then this one says the General told me to attack too.

78
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.150
And so now can they come to a consensus.

79
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.110
The question is can we agree on something.

80
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.010
Well if you look at the majority of decisions the journal is already made up his mind the commander

81
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.360
so he's attacking because he's issued that order.

82
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.980
But let's look at these ones.

83
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:41.450
This general got one red arrow and two green arrows is going to say I'm attacking you.

84
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.620
And then this one got one Green Arrow two Green Arrow one red arrow is attacking.

85
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.450
And we don't care what the trader decides because he's a traitor and because we already have the majority

86
00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.270
and says so by based on that algorithm they came up with the they came to consensus.

87
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.960
They more than half of them have or are going to attack and so they will take this castle they will

88
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.440
win.

89
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.160
So I think if they had the general said we're all retreating same thing would have happened.

90
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.640
They would all just retreat.

91
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.260
So they would come to consensus.

92
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.260
So that's the case when one of the lieutenants or one of the non commanding generals is a traitor.

93
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.550
Let's have a look at the case when this is quite fun.

94
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.300
Let's have a look at the case when the main generals the traitor.

95
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.210
So will this algorithm work.

96
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.900
That's the question.

97
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.480
So the commander is a traitor What can he do.

98
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.920
He can tell everybody to you know do the same thing right if he tells everybody to attack.

99
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.540
Well that would be quite silly of him because then they would just tell each other to attack and they

100
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.250
would attack and they would take the castle right.

101
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.400
There would be consensus.

102
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.090
Same thing retreats you tell em which retreat they just retreat.

103
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.660
And again they went so they solve the problem.

104
00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:01.760
So what's the only way you can mess things up is he can actually tell two of them to attack like these

105
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.940
two.

106
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.450
And one of them to retreat and then see if that messes things up for the army.

107
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.390
So what they do again is they just relay what you heard from the general.

108
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.410
This one says General told me to attack this one says General told me to treat this on says General

109
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.610
told me to attack.

110
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.040
And now let's see if they got the consensus.

111
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:27.020
So here they've got one to two or three so he's he's attacking He's attacking the two arrows and one

112
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.580
red one this was also a two green arrows one red.

113
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:36.110
So in this case as well they are going to attack or it could have been retreat of general issued to

114
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.690
read orders one grain order.

115
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.320
Then there were the three of them would retreat and the army would be safe.

116
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:49.260
So as you can see what this is showing is that there's this Byzantine Generals problem and then there's

117
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.670
this algorithm of taking the majority of the conveyed information or relayed information and acting

118
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.670
upon that basing your decision on that.

119
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.300
And that algorithm is Byzantine fault tolerant.

120
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:11.170
The question is how what to what level is it tolerant of to what level is that tolerance.

121
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:17.030
So the question is what if we had two traders in this army and then in the case of two traitors You

122
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.350
can try it for yourself.

123
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.560
There's no way that they would succeed.

124
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.550
There's no there's no solution to this problem.

125
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:33.950
If there's two traitors say and basically And then what they did in the paper they proved that they

126
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:41.090
methodically prove that for for instance for this algorithm to work you have to have no more than 30

127
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.460
percent no more than 33 percent trade.

128
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.850
So one third of the army cannot or the generals cannot be more than one third cannot be traitor.

129
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:56.060
So if you have you know a hundred generals and they're all deciding orlicí you have 10 generals and

130
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.580
they're all deciding if four of them are traitors then that's it you're not going to win if three of

131
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.820
them are traitors then this algorithm works.

132
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:10.430
And so that is the level of tolerance of this system in the sense of traitors.

133
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:17.930
Now how does this go back to you know block chain or or other like other systems that are decentralized

134
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.240
more technological system.

135
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:27.080
The thing there is that for instance in the block chain what happens we might have somebody trying to

136
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:34.160
attack the system and we need to come up with a consensus protocol like an algorithm like that these

137
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.090
generals came up with we need to come up with a consensus Fergal which we're talking about in the next

138
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:46.580
tutorial which will allow us to protect the system from traders or from people trying to attack it and

139
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.760
so on and we want to make it as tolerant as possible so we want to make sure that you know it's stolen

140
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.560
not only just to one attack or two or three or five.

141
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.980
So as tolerant as possible that's what.

142
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.110
That's the whole concept of why it time for tolerance.

143
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.050
And this notion is actually used not just Fluxion as we mentioned at the start of a tutorial it's actually

144
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:10.920
used in many different places for examples used in airplanes because you might you have all these systems

145
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:18.770
talking to each other all these old measurements coming through from different gauges and so on.

146
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:26.400
And what if one or two of them fail you can just have the whole airplane crash just because one engine

147
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.280
heat monitor failed and is telling us the wrong thing.

148
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.290
So that in that case you know you have the airplane flying it's and the generals actually were present

149
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.900
different components of the circuits of the airplane everything's working fine and then all of a sudden

150
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.890
one of them fails.

151
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:48.060
Part of the main computer phase or the heat sensor on the engine or the windspeed meet or something

152
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.430
something fails the whole airplane is still has to keep going.

153
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:57.290
And so that's called Byzantine fault tolerance it has to be it has to have that characteristic of Byzantine

154
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.950
fault tolerance is also used in nuclear power plugs used in rockets.

155
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.680
You know the highest space station has specific requirements for rockets that want to dock with it.

156
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.800
To which extent are they Byzantine fault tolerant.

157
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:19.530
Because there's so many factors that could jam the computers of the docking the shuttle or whatever

158
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.180
it is and then will just destroy the whole station for instance like there's already radiation which

159
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:32.670
could destroy the memory or the jam the circuits of the docking rocket and or just smash the whole ISIS

160
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.630
station and you know people could die and that's billions of dollars.

161
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.760
You know you even if there's no people involved.

162
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.680
And so yeah so that's where buys and time fault always comes in.

163
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:50.130
So it's a huge concept even though it looks very simple and very kind of like airy fairy about some

164
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.990
generals in the Byzantine Empire.

165
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:58.650
It's actually a huge huge thing in terms of decentralized systems with space and systems with lots and

166
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.380
lots of components and blockin is just one of them and we'll talk more about this allocation in box

167
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.300
in next tutorial.

168
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.860
But for now if you'd like to learn more there's the original paper the Byzantine Generals problem from

169
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.090
1982 by Lamport Szostak and pee's.

170
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.560
Interesting paper.

171
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:21.630
Not very technical but there is some like a logical mathematical proofs if you'd like to go through

172
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.820
it.

173
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:29.000
And then there is a blog if you don't want to go through all the mathematics and this paper.

174
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.170
Again it's more logic rather than mathematics.

175
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:37.830
It's actually quite fun if you don't want to go through all the mathematics then you can just check

176
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.390
out the blog.

177
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.740
It's called Understanding block chain fundamentals.

178
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:47.950
Part one buys Einstein for tolerance by George's constant topless and it's an medium links.

179
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:53.140
Here is also in the notes for this course.

180
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.520
All right.

181
00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.050
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and picked up some new information on bye's and Tydfil torrents.

182
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.300
And yeah I'll see you in the next tutorial.

183
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.940
Until then enjoy.
