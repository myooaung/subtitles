1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:14,250
Now let's talk about the second issue what happens when we add a liquid to miners mine a block almost

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,110
at the center of all this say at the same time.

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,370
Right.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,190
Like that.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,620
So now all of a sudden we've got we've got a conflict in the chain.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,900
How is this conflict going to resolve.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,770
So let's have a look.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,830
This is this is really where the consensus protocol is like is it at its best.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,650
This is very similar to the buys in time for Tolan's and we talked about before.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,130
So by Byzantine Generals problem this is the bicentennial it's.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,040
But this is very similar to the general's problem.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,390
OK.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,930
So what happens.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,820
Well this this Noad this block is since it's correct we're going to assume that it's correct there's

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,060
no malicious intent or anything it's going to be propagated through a network.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,930
So they're propagated or relayed through the network.

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,760
So there we go.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,510
It got relayed to these nodes.

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,860
They checked the checks and they accepted this one could relate there.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,920
And like when you got to come up with like our own example scenarios in our example scenario maybe the

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,300
connectivity here is faster.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,230
So these got propagated first and then this one is maybe this like longer connection or something.

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,190
So by the time this one got there it is there is some stuff happening here and then this one got here.

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:35,380
So basically the connection was here was faster here and like the information spread here faster than

25
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,590
on this site so that just for the purposes for argument's sake of course in real locations this is much

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:48,780
much bigger it is like you know dozens like tens and hundreds of thousands of nodes and then you know

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,170
like when they far away by the time they like the conflict happens it's not like two versus four it's

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,980
it's a much bigger number.

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,210
But this still conveys the point will help us understand better.

30
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,360
So now what happens is this node and these nodes are trying to like tell the snow that they had this

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,930
orange walk.

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,580
But this note is saying to these guys no you add the purple Block.

33
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,270
And now here is the orange block at the orange block and he's saying no add the purple find it the connections

34
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,230
are gone through it so you can see we've got an issue and this is here you should.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,520
You can probably tell that it's very similar to that Byzantine Generals problem where you got conflicting

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,070
messages going across the network.

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,770
So that's why we need bicentennial tolerance.

38
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,630
OK.

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,340
And so what happens what's the consensus protocol in blushes.

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,510
We remember with the generals their consensus protocol was to look at the average of what you were getting

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,500
the average of the messages that you're getting and then do that.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,740
Right.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,430
So you know like somebody saying attack somebody saying retreat and then and then decide from there

44
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,550
you know take not the average take like take the majority.

45
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,980
And look there is a majority.

46
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,430
Look at the majority of the messages that you're getting and then do the will change the concerns protocol

47
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:14,860
is different and brought in block chain what the nodes do is they're like OK that's fine.

48
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,460
So you've got a purple walk.

49
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,800
I've got an orange walk.

50
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,920
You know like OK we've got two versions of the chain right now so we've got competing chains.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,370
What are we going to do is we're going to wait and we're going to wait until another block is added.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,020
And once that block is added then we'll see which of the two chains is longer.

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:43,190
And so which change basically as a block for you guys or us and then whoever has a block first That's

54
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,940
chain wins.

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:52,670
So looks Shane's the term they're saying is the longest chain is king whichever chain has the most blocks

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,280
will eventually win and replace the chain.

57
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:07,000
And the key here is that the key here is that's the part of the network that has the highest hashing

58
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,370
power will eventually generate the longest chain and it's very easy to see in this example we can see

59
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,850
that here we've got four computers and you really have to.

60
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,460
And assuming they have the same hash and power for each computer.

61
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,430
So how has your power is basically how many hash it hashes can you check per second.

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,530
You know how many hashes can he check and how can they how many hashes can it check and check them you

63
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,260
know together they have a hash in power.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,230
And how many hashes can each one of these check that hash are assuming they have the same hash power.

65
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,000
These guys have double the hash and power than these guys.

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:48,170
So the orange chain is double the hash and power that then the purple chain which means that statistically

67
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:55,430
speaking these guys have a twice as high chance of finding the next to of solving the cryptographic

68
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,850
puzzle first.

69
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,010
So solve solving their cryptographic puzzle because all her graphic puzzles are equal.

70
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,870
You just need to find the hash for block.

71
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,590
So these ones have a.

72
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,290
So each one is working on their own.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,360
But if you add up the probabilities all together over all that even if they're you know trying to add

74
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,900
different blocks and so on.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,880
You know like this one might have central actions or the search was actually that doesn't matter.

76
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:30,110
Overall statistically speaking this group of nodes has a high much higher or double chance of finding

77
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,860
a next block or finding the next block in their chain.

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,050
Whatever it is what is it like coming up with a block to add to their chain.

79
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,570
Because there's more hand-car.

80
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,600
These guys have a lesser chance.

81
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:48,950
And so what will happen statistically probabilistically is one of the computers in the the computers

82
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,270
in the orange chain.

83
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,770
Maybe just click here.

84
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,290
There we go.

85
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,070
One of the computers in the orange chain will come up with a block and then this block will be spread

86
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,570
across the network so bam bam bam.

87
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,920
I guess they're part of the network.

88
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:10,010
And then now is when this conflict will get resolved is now we can see that this these nodes Center

89
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,530
has a longer chain it's got two extra nodes this one only has one Laux this only has one extra block.

90
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:23,160
And so what will happen is these blocks will go to the side and the purple network will now adopt the

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,090
Orange network.

92
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,370
So the longest network is key.

93
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,210
And so right away the most important conclusion here is that in a block chain the consensus protocol

94
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:42,540
means that 50 of those who have 51 percent of the power or we just more than 50 percent of the power

95
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,150
that watch that chain will win.

96
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:52,020
So in watching I like the Byzantine Generals problem where Remember we talked about like you they cannot

97
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:59,490
come to a consensus even if this 30 percent malicious or like traitors here they will.

98
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,880
So in that case in that case they cannot come to a consensus.

99
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:11,730
They have to have like 70 plus on on the right on 70 plus non traders or 70 plus agreeing generals to

100
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,740
come to consensus you know block chain.

101
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,520
Its its better in a block chain.

102
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,000
You only need 51 percent and thats from what we just discussed that it basically goes down to probabilities

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,840
and hash and power.

104
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,470
So as long as you have more than 50 percent of the hashing power on one side agreeing more and more

105
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,620
than 50 percent of the power coming to a consensus the block chain will come to a consensus.

106
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,530
So as you can see the consensus protocol in a block chain is more powerful than the consensus per call

107
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,160
in the Byzantine Generals problem thats important to note that there you need 70 percent in blotching

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,620
you need 50 just over 50 percent in order to come to a consensus.

109
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,800
That's very that's a very important feature very important powerful thing of watches.

110
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,820
So where would we stop.

111
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,310
So yeah so this conflict gets resolved.

112
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:07,350
These blokes go to the side and these blocks you know are actually now called orphan blocks orphaned

113
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,930
blocks.

114
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,820
So to that there we go.

115
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,170
These are often orphan blocks.

116
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,870
And so unfortunately the the miner that mind this block in the first place there what happens is their

117
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,030
transaction Their them their reward is actually contained in that block it's in there it's not like

118
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,690
they got they got paid in cash all the transactions.

119
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,830
And we'll talk about this more in module two.

120
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,690
They're actually in the blotching So basically the reward won't be valid anymore.

121
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,320
Only this reward will be valid.

122
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,590
That and mine are gone.

123
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,020
And also the transactions that were in this block there are no longer valid.

124
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,090
So that's why it's important to block change to actually wait until a couple of blocks are added to

125
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,960
make sure that your transactions are have been accepted and then you know they're not going to be they're

126
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,050
not going to be they're not part of a competing chain that's going to lose.

127
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,520
So again we'll talk more about those things in module 2 of course.

128
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:04,350
But for now this is what happens this is how the consensus protocol works and that's it.

129
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,880
So of course after that the book chain goes to normal.

130
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,920
It is already a normal and you know new blocks are going to be mined.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
It's going to continue growing.

132
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,480
So we've come to a consensus based.

133
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,740
And so there we go.

134
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,970
That sums it up.

135
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,700
Our saga across the different realms of block chain and we've discussed immutable Ledger distributed

136
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,290
P2P networks hash group chugger free mining and finally consensus protocol.

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,580
I really hope that now you have a good foundation you can see you can feel that you have a good foundation

138
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:43,650
of blog chains and you feel confident in going into don't know and debated a heated debate with where

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,720
people are talking about actions and you can maybe bring in the clarity and explain how things actually

140
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,600
work and also that you're confident in about going into the practical tutorials that are coming up very

141
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,490
very soon.

142
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,460
And to finish off today's tutorial additional reading this is really fun.

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,730
You can actually read Satoshi Okamoto as emails to people like how Phinny Charles Jackson read Dillinger

144
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,830
and James Donald and a couple of others so if you go to this website again this will be in the link

145
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,710
will be in the notes for the course.

146
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,700
If you go there you'll you'll be able to just go to the e-mails and click through and see what they

147
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,610
said and then the specific e-mail.

148
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,390
Which.

149
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,780
