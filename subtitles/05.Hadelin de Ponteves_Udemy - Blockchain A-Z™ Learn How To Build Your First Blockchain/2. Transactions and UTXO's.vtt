00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.140
Hello and welcome back to the Course on.

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.330
And today we're going to look at the world of transactions and UTX souls in blotching.

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.460
So it's a very interesting field a very interesting concept and I never thought it was this different

4
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.120
to normal transactions but it actually is a whole new world and today we're going to uncover everything.

5
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.810
All right so let's get started.

6
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.010
Transactions and UTX souls.

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.930
So we'll find out what you take so stance for a second.

8
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.390
Cornell let's imagine that we start off with some transaction.

9
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.030
So although after I started using bitcoin the fall I received the following transaction.

10
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.790
So Mark sent me zero point one bitcoin at LUNs and me 0.3 Bitcoin.

11
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.940
Ellen sent me is 3.6 Bitcoin and Susan's and we 0.7 Bitcoin.

12
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.000
So all of those are different transactions that happened in the bitcoin block chain and they all are

13
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.150
all related to me.

14
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.340
I receive bitcoins and all of the transactions.

15
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.770
So what those would be called in the Bitcoin world are you.

16
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:26.310
Ex-POWs which stands for unspent transaction outputs and this is where things start to get very different

17
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.150
to the world of banking that we're so used.

18
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.530
So in banking once you set a transaction that's it there's that's the transaction is done.

19
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.800
And you know it's recorded somewhere in song.

20
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:47.540
But in Bitcoin and transaction lives on after it's been executed until another transaction builds.

21
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.510
All of the UTX So from that transaction I know it's a it's a it's a lot to take in at the start.

22
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.080
But let's go step by step.

23
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.060
So let's say I've received all this money and now I want to buy a bicycle I want to buy a bicycle for

24
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.240
0.5 BTC.

25
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.970
So this is how we're going to now set up the transaction.

26
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.060
We need to set up a transaction for that to happen.

27
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.090
This is what it will look like.

28
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.980
So I'm going to take not just my money and use it I need to choose the transactions.

29
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.070
Remember we said that they live on until these be each XOs have been used up.

30
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.360
So I need to choose the transactions that I'm going to link into the input.

31
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.790
So there are inputs where I'm going to get the money I can just go into my wallet and we'll see why

32
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.540
in the world it's total that there is no such a thing.

33
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.130
This is what's important to understand that in Bitcoin there is no such a thing or in any cryptocurrency

34
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.250
there is no such thing as an amount lying in your account there is no account.

35
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.970
All of that everything we have all we have is a block chain and all the transactions all over any move

36
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.380
money any movement of money is a transaction on the block chain.

37
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.980
So we need to go back to transactions and pick the ones we want so we're going to pick this 06 BTC from

38
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.890
Alan that we received I received so I need to come up with 0.5 BTC.

39
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.080
These are everything I have available.

40
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.520
So I'm going to take this one because it's the closest to 0.5.

41
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.280
I'm going to take the 0.6 beauty series from hell and then I'm going to send it send 0.5 BTC to the

42
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.170
bike shop and the rule is that there cannot be any on the used outputs.

43
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.280
So anything that goes into the in or they going to can use the input so anything that goes into it put

44
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.400
the full amount has to go out but basically there can be no change you cannot just go in and say all

45
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.290
right I have 0.6 BTC I'm sending the report back because you know you have to send all of the 0.6.

46
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.910
But you can send it to different participants so what you do is you send zero 1.1 BTC back to myself.

47
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.490
I know it sounds very confusing but once we get to a couple of examples you will see the logic behind

48
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.890
it and you'll see why it works.

49
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.060
So there we go.

50
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.330
So I I have to choose one or several of the transactions that I have here to put in my inputs I have

51
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:19.290
to build my inputs to get to this amount or higher then I need to send the required amount for the merchandise

52
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.250
for the bike that I'm buying to the bike shop.

53
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.930
And then any change that I want to that I have left I cannot just leave it there.

54
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.810
I have to send it to myself again.

55
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.420
I have to send back one or I can buy something else from another shop and we'll see an example like

56
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.900
that later on.

57
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.160
But for now this is I was so surprised to see this transaction I'm taking putting in here.

58
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.870
So this will actually happen and then it's this transaction this new transaction is piggybacking on

59
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.450
this transaction so the transaction kind of like continues on and on and on and on like.

60
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.570
So this is action now feeds into this transaction and then and now.

61
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.250
Now after that happens now it's it's gone it's finished it's completed it's probably right where it's

62
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.640
no longer a UTF.

63
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.690
So it's not an unspent transaction either because it's done this transaction fed this transaction this

64
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.420
transaction and we're building here and now we have two new utech.

65
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.660
This is a huge Ekso for the bike shop.

66
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.500
So and that's a huge XO for me.

67
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.150
So that amount is going to go into the future.

68
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.300
So as for the bike shop and this is going to go into here and there we go.

69
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.550
And also I'm going to get a bike that's what I was buying.

70
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.240
Once everything is settled.

71
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.940
And so what we'll see here now if we create a list of UTX shows we'll see that Ellen is transactional

72
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.820
with Ellen's gone.

73
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.250
But now I have another you take so from me to me a transaction on 0.1 BTC that is unspent it has an

74
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.070
unspent transactional transaction up.

75
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.530
All right so that was our example with the bicycle Let's have a look another example to kind of like

76
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.500
concrete these things and let's say that now I want to buy a second bicycle.

77
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.950
Let's say that one first one was for me and I want to buy a bicycle from my dad.

78
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.040
And what is this transaction going to look like.

79
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.360
How are we going to create section.

80
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.800
The bicycle is more expensive.

81
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.340
1.1 BTC.

82
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.400
So if you want you can pause the video now and try this for yourself.

83
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.560
Try to practice it and see how to create it.

84
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.970
It's if you don't worry about the overall meaning of all of it is very easy to construct.

85
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.330
You just put that inputs calculate the outputs and send the change to yourself if there's any change

86
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.960
and it's very simple.

87
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.440
And then once you've done that and once we do it a couple times it will make it will become very clear

88
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.540
after a while.

89
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.680
How how why it's working that way.

90
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.190
So feel free to post a video but otherwise I'm going to continue.

91
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.130
So here's our transaction how we're going to construct.

92
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.040
We need an input we need inputs right.

93
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.140
Again we cannot just go to our account and say I'm taking this much money out of my account.

94
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.350
It doesn't work that way.

95
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.420
We have to finish off.

96
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.550
We have to.

97
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.440
What's a good analogy.

98
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.000
Like we have to kill off I guess we have to kill off these UTX so that we have left.

99
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.190
So there's just sitting there and these transactions the only way they will come to an end is when they

100
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.720
feed new transactions.

101
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.050
So this is election and we're going to be building.

102
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.930
Who's going to feed it.

103
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.280
Well we need to build quite a large amount so we're going to take this transaction or here we'll take

104
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.080
the UTX out from this transaction.

105
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.900
So the 0.3 Beatty's here goes from Atlanta will also it'll feed.

106
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.340
So this will I hope will feed into the one rebuilding the 0.7 BTC from Susan will be feed into this

107
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:48.090
was actually rebuilding and the 0.1 BTC that I said to myself will also feed into this transaction.

108
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:55.650
So we got three inputs and now the output is as you can see the total is exactly what we need.

109
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.880
Output is going to all go to the bike shop.

110
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.530
There's nothing left so we don't need to add any additional outputs there's no change to center ourselves

111
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.430
and that's it.

112
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.750
That's that's how we're going to search engines.

113
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.420
And once this transaction goes in the bloodshed this will be removed.

114
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.150
This will be it will be removed.

115
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.520
It will just be no longer be considered a Yuichi so because it will be obvious that this transaction

116
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.820
they later fed into this transaction.

117
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.930
This was actually later fed into this and this was action fit into that one so there no longer is anything

118
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.830
left.

119
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:33.670
And on the other hand the bike shop will have a UTX so the bike shop will have received this money and

120
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.340
now they have it as a result of this transaction.

121
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.800
The bike shop has its own that will go into there.

122
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.490
Ill to be a blotching but whenever they calculate the UTX so they'll see this as you take.

123
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:54.940
So until it feeds into something else I will get a bike and so now if we recalculate excels you will

124
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.150
see that I only have one you take so left.

125
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.800
So all of those things will go into the books.

126
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.400
But once you go to the bloodshed you'll see that they've all canceled each other out and they're all

127
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.760
fed into each other in a way and the result for me is that I only have one UTX all with 0 1 1 2 1 1

128
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.990
B C and that he's considered my balance kind of like there is no balance but you can think of it as

129
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.620
a balance but it's actually takes on.

130
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.100
So there we go that's how it is executed and you take those work.

131
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.940
I know this might still be vague might not be like it might it might take some time to get your head

132
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.650
around this.

133
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.280
So maybe like with different talk about this in the next tutorial and the one after that so there's

134
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.590
too much tutorials of practice don't worry coming up everything will be clear for sure but in the meantime

135
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.400
if you want to practice yourself then just make something up like I did here.

136
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.200
As if somebody sent you money.

137
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.720
Look at the sales.

138
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.650
Think of something you want to buy and see how you build that transaction.

139
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.450
Do it a couple of times it will really help to get head around it.

140
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.690
And but otherwise I'll see you in the next tutorial and we'll continue with Journey on that note I look

141
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.860
forward to see you next time.

142
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.240
Until then enjoy bludgeons.
