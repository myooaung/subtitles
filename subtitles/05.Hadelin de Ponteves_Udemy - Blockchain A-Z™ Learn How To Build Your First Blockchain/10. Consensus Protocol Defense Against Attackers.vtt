00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.830
You are welcome back to the course on block chain.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.380
And today we've got a tutorial on consensus protocols.

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.760
All right.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.640
So here's our map we just ticked of mining.

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.890
And finally we are at consensus protocols the last step in our saga.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.600
All right.

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.870
So let's have a look at what we're talking about.

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.450
We're going to discuss in terms of casettes protocols that we're going to look at first the challenges

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.290
that they're designed.

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.560
So because we've already gotten familiar with the concept of consensus Pericles when we're talking about

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:47.650
the Byzantine fold tolerance and we understand what's what the whole notion is is how the distributed

12
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.160
network agrees on things and in our case it's how does it agree on how to keep growing.

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.100
How do you keep adding blocks in which direction.

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.670
How do how to know when to add a block and we walked across the whole network.

15
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.090
And so the challenge is that a consensus protocol is as you recall in the bicentennial tolerance example

16
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.220
the challenge for the generals was to understand which command to listen to like whether to attack or

17
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.700
retreat.

18
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.840
So they had to come up with concessions Perkel to solve that challenge.

19
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.810
In our case the consensus protocol for a blockade has to solve two main challenges.

20
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.050
Number one is protect the network from attackers.

21
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.780
And we already talked about the situation where a attacker tries to attack somewhere in the middle of

22
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.400
the chain.

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.950
So if attacker and if an attacker tries to like change this block then that's going to be almost impossible

24
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.600
for them because they would have to change all these blogs and then all these blogs on all every single

25
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.030
load.

26
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.840
So that's not the problem we're talking about here.

27
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.750
The problem we talk about here is what happens if an attacker tries to put a block at the end of the

28
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.590
chain tries to add a new blog that is malicious.

29
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.260
And the second challenge that it says is Pericles should solve in a block chain is the challenge of

30
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.650
competing chains.

31
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.480
So in a large block chain because it is distributed across the world.

32
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.730
They can be a lag between nodes especially those that are far away from each other and it couldn't so

33
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.600
happen that two nodes that are far away from each other could find two could successfully mine a block

34
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.490
at the same time like that.

35
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.550
And there's nothing malicious about this there's no attackers.

36
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.480
It's just just so happens because once let's say this one minds the block before the information about

37
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.060
that gets to this one maybe takes like two seconds to get here.

38
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.070
But during the first second this this node already also might a block and from the perspective of each

39
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.360
one of these nodes they have done nothing wrong.

40
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.580
They are in total agreement with how mining works.

41
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.930
But nevertheless for the block chain this is a problem because it needs to be in consensus on how to

42
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.110
keep growing it needs to know how do we keep growing with the orange block or where do we keep growing

43
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.470
if the purple block because as we will discuss further down the course these blocks could actually have

44
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.430
different transaction transactions and Siteman cannot just like access both blogs and split the fee

45
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.020
between the two.

46
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.840
No it has to pick one of the two blocks.

47
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.750
And so that's the challenge how does the network come to a consensus on how to keep growing because

48
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.230
if it doesn't come to a consensus like if the consensus protocol is not in place what'll happen is you'll

49
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.490
have this change you'll have this change will be conflicting and then they'll split up into two and

50
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.870
then later on the block will split up into four and eight and so on and then eventually you just have

51
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.400
a ton of options which are completely separate.

52
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.650
So we don't want that we want an integral block.

53
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.620
So that's the second chance.

54
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.500
And in terms of consensus protocols it's important important to note at this point that they are multiple

55
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.170
different types of consensus protocols and at the end of this tutorial I'll recommend an article which

56
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.340
highlights a couple of them which can be useful.

57
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.400
But the two most famous ones are proof of work O.W. or pro-state us.

58
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.620
And what we're going to be talking about is proof of work because that's the one that's the original

59
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.890
one describe the situation Okamoto in his paper and also it's the one that Bitcoin currently uses and

60
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:34.460
is also the one that if still uses even though they're planning on moving to proof of state.

61
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.830
So that's the one we're going to be talking about.

62
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.540
So where does this term proof of work come from.

63
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.680
Well the great news is that by talking about the information or the things that we talked about in the

64
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.810
previous tutorials such as mining such as hash hashing and P2P networks and the mutilator we've already

65
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.100
laid a very good foundation for seeing how everything comes together to create this consensus of proof

66
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.770
work.

67
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.530
And so we're going to start with mining.

68
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.650
So here you can see that's where we finished off with the whole mining situation.

69
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.770
That's the main takeaway from here is that miners need to come up with this non-SS with his gold and

70
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.090
loans which will create a hash which is under the target and then they will be allowed to create a block.

71
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.490
So that's the cryptographic challenge that they're solving.

72
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.520
And they have to go through lots and lots of iterations to get to that non-SS.

73
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.290
Hundreds of thousands millions billions of iterations.

74
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.400
They need to go through until they find that not.

75
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.400
And so what does that mean.

76
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.130
That means a lot of time.

77
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:48.760
That means a lot of hardware investments like into their into their mining rigs or mining computers

78
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.260
and also a lot of electricity they have to pay huge electricity bills.

79
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.180
Some whiners you know like 8 8 2 plus like one I one I heard was.

80
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.900
Eight thousand dollars per day per day just in electricity just my stuff.

81
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.400
And yeah so as we can conclude that's a lot of work on the side of the mine.

82
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.690
And this hash that they have in the end the solution to the cryptographic puzzle is the proof of work

83
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.730
is the proof that they've put in all this work in order to solve the cryptographic challenge.

84
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.840
So that's where the term comes from.

85
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.870
That's number one and number two is that we can see it's important to see that we do have to put in

86
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.560
a lot of work because this will still be important in the next slide.

87
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:44.370
So now going back to our distributor network what happens when a miner adds and your book comes there's

88
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:52.410
that you block the network or the lauching will reward the miner for mining that blog.

89
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.750
So in Bitcoin it's 12 in a heartbeat Quine's.

90
00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.250
In theory it's a certain amount of ether for adding a block.

91
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:09.100
And also the miner will get the fees associated with the transactions that are included in that block.

92
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.830
So there is monetary incentive this financial incentive for miners to mine.

93
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.420
And also there is financial incentive for miners to play fair.

94
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.670
Why is that's because they've put in a lot of work.

95
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:32.210
So if they put in a lot of work and then they add a block that is rejected or like they add a block

96
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.090
that is you know they found that cryptograms sold in photographic puzzle and they found the correct

97
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.080
hash and they add that block but they've included malicious transactions or they've done.

98
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.090
You know I've done something.

99
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.830
Miss polishers they just won't get that reward and they won't get the fees and therefore they're you

100
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.530
know they're not going to be able to pay for their electricity bill.

101
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:59.420
So basically they'll get penalized and they don't want to risk that so they have to play fair.

102
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.880
And how will the network know if they're adding a malicious block.

103
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:11.670
Well it's actually very simple every single note before that block gets added like that before that

104
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.970
block is propagated to the network every single node will conduct a series of checks.

105
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.660
And this series of checks is very rigorous.

106
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.090
So this is just a screenshot of some of the checks the list just keeps going I think is a couple of

107
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.120
pages long.

108
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:35.140
And they they check they check the miracle hash they check the proof that the previous block matches

109
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.640
the previous the previous hash field in the mail log.

110
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.670
They check the time stamps they check transaction.

111
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.500
This must not be empty.

112
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.560
They check lots and lots of things so as you can see here it's very very detailed.

113
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.860
And if some of the check doesn't go through then they reject the block.

114
00:08:54.010 --> 00:09:03.370
And so basically at the end of the day the network will not allow the box will not allow malicious blocks

115
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.610
to be added to the chain.

116
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:11.910
And that's why there is financial incentive to play according to the rules.

117
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.370
So that's how we solve.

118
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.540
Challenge number one so that's that part of the consensus Perkel that blog.

119
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.100
So once once you see it once the blow comes to you you need to check do all the checks and then you

120
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.750
can only accept or reject it.

121
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.030
And so if the network starts rejecting the block like you've all these notes start rejecting the blog

122
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.480
then that's just the watching will reject it and that minor that block will be valid.

123
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.940
That minor will be penalized.

124
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.320
So that's for the first part.

125
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.050
Now let's talk about the second part of this one.

126
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.360
This one's going to be more interesting.

127
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.790
Oh before we move on.

128
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:52.900
One thing I always thought about why is thinking like this something I wanted to say this cryptographic

129
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.240
puzzles hard to solve.

130
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.350
Easy to verify.

131
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:01.990
So it's important to understand that there's a difference between mining and then verifying things because

132
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.930
in mining you have to do a lot of iterations.

133
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.900
You have to solve this cryptographic puzzle you have to go through all these different variations of

134
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:16.090
the lawns and check the hash and you know like just it's about brute forcing your way through the knots

135
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.190
to get the right hash.

136
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.770
Whereas we've solved it we're checking to verifying.

137
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.890
You just need to check that it matches up so is to go back to you for a second.

138
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:32.380
So here you'll see that you get to this and also you just have to go through all of these you know iterations

139
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.080
iterations iteration billions of durations but to check to verify is it's extremely trivial you just

140
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.090
take all this out all this information you put it into the hashing algorithm and you get the hash and

141
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.410
you just check that indeed it's under the target.

142
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.680
That's it or is indeed it.

143
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.750
It is what the miner is saying it is.

144
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:56.230
So that's the that's the kind of like paradox or irony and say in the cryptographic puzzle that you're

145
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.360
putting in all this work to find this this long.

146
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.790
And then for somebody to verify they don't have to do any of that work at all they just like take this

147
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.410
and then bam they put it into the hash algorithm and then a second later they've got the hash which

148
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.420
you were looking for.

149
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:16.420
You know minutes for a long time you know for billions of iterations and they just take one iteration

150
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.340
to verify.

151
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:23.050
And so all these verifications even though there is a huge list of them it takes a couple of seconds

152
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.030
maximum to conduct these verifications for each node.

153
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.690
So that's it's not a computation only heavy exercise for them they don't spend a lot of pictures or

154
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.090
anything like that in just a routine process that they do.

155
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:35.940
OK.

156
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.640
So we're clear of that.

157
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.790
That was us talking about prevention of attacks.
