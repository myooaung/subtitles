00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
In this lecture, we will update the pom.xml

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.549
the mayon configuration file to

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.980
use the right version of the Java

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.070
compiler and also the dependencies that

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.120
we need as a part of this project by

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.340
default if you see here the JRE system

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.359
library it selects j2se 1.5 that is how

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.910
the Eclipse m2e plugin has generated

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.269
this project it is using 1.5 to switch

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.010
this to whatever version you are using

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.579
i'm using 1.8 if you have 1 7 or 1 6 you

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.899
can switch it by going to the pom.xml

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.079
open the Pom.xml file you can

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.739
download mypom.xml the version I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.809
have from the contents of this lecture

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.220
from udemy and once you unzip that file its

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.930
a zip file when you download it this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.640
is how it will look when you unzip it

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.730
spring j unit files so here is the pom.xml

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
right click on it open it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.160
with a notepad or whatever your text

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.369
favorite text editor is text edit for me

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.220
here is the maven file what I have in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.770
addition is this build section and then

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.200
I have a lot of dependencies so starting

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
from the build section copy everything

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.820
till the end of dependencies.
