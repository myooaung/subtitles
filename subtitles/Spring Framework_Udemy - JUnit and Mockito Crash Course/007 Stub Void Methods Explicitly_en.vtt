00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
In the previous lecture, we have seen

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.130
that simply stubbing out the class will stubout all the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.080
void methods and there is nothing we

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.929
need to do specially bu in this 1 i'll

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.480
show you how to explicitly stub the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.120
void methods if you have to use it in

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000
some cases as you will use later on to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.880
explicitly walkout you will use the do-nothing

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.789
method available in the mockito API do

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.730
nothing.when it's slightly different

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.070
syntax, will not start with when but

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
instead we will say do nothing when

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.540
B.void method is called thats it for

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.600
our test again they will still pass.
