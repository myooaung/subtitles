In this lecture I will show you how to run the J-Unit five test that we have created to do that.

1
00:06.060 --> 00:12.480
Right click on the test go to run as and if you find an option run as Junit test here.

2
00:12.480 --> 00:13.740
Go ahead and run it.

3
00:13.740 --> 00:21.240
Your job has become a lot easier because not all the platforms and Eclipse versions Support JUnit 5 running

4
00:21.330 --> 00:23.300
yet the option will not appear.

5
00:23.520 --> 00:25.810
But if you have it go ahead and use it.

6
00:25.860 --> 00:28.440
If not there are multiple ways to resolve it.

7
00:28.440 --> 00:37.070
Right click on the project do a run as configurations and when you go to junit here by default

8
00:37.070 --> 00:38.180
it will go there.

9
00:38.450 --> 00:43.380
under the test runners try to select J-Unit 5 if you see the option.

10
00:43.460 --> 00:50.760
If you don't have that either just like me open up the pom dot xml double click to maximize it.

11
00:50.840 --> 00:58.130
And we need to add a couple of Jars here that J-Unit platform runner and the J-Unit Jupiter hyphen

12
00:58.250 --> 00:59.470
API.

13
01:00.110 --> 01:11.310
Go ahead and search for J-Unit platform runner maven J-Unit platform maven.

14
01:11.320 --> 01:18.050
Click on the very first link to grab the latest version of that 1.2.0 seems to be the stable

15
01:18.050 --> 01:19.830
version.

16
01:19.950 --> 01:21.160
Grab that.

17
01:21.450 --> 01:28.170
Go back to your Eclipse and paste it right under the J-Unit dependency.

18
01:28.170 --> 01:29.600
Explain why we need this.

19
01:29.660 --> 01:39.360
Once we have them delete the comment format the code the next one is the J-Unit Jupiter API.

20
01:39.590 --> 01:41.880
The platform runner is in place the Jupiter API.

21
01:41.890 --> 01:48.410
You can grab this dependency the first dependency paste it change this to junit  Jupiter API.

22
01:48.410 --> 01:52.270
The version will remain the same five point two point zero.

23
01:52.370 --> 01:56.630
But the version of junit platform runner  is one point 2.0.

24
01:56.810 --> 02:04.190
The Junitplatform Runner has the support to run unit tests and the junit jupiter API provides a platform

25
02:04.190 --> 02:07.320
class that we want to use on our test.

26
02:07.350 --> 02:15.090
So right here Mark this with at run with annotation  within bracket's use a

27
02:15.090 --> 02:19.640
J-Unit platform dot

28
02:19.730 --> 02:27.980
Plus once we do that right click do a run as you'll find the J-Unit test option.

29
02:28.190 --> 02:35.160
Go ahead Run your test and everything is green and you can see everything works like before.

30
02:35.160 --> 02:38.260
Just like how it used to work when you used junit 4 of 

31
02:38.280 --> 02:41.220
But now we now we have used J-Unit 5.

32
02:41.520 --> 02:44.470
All the imports here are from J-Unit 5.

33
02:44.910 --> 02:49.980
We have learned how to use at before each test annotation is also from a different package and from

34
02:49.980 --> 02:51.900
Jupiter.

35
02:52.150 --> 02:59.950
After each and to assert for exceptions you use assertions Dot assert throws instead of using a attribute

36
03:00.010 --> 03:01.170
on this annotation.
