00:00.150 --> 00:05.670
In this lecture, we will run and test the coupon service before we go ahead and do that, go to the

1
00:05.670 --> 00:08.670
coupon rest controller, DoubleClick to maximize it.

2
00:09.510 --> 00:12.120
The create method takes a coupon.

3
00:12.120 --> 00:18.600
as the input here, we need to mark this with request body only

4
00:18.600 --> 00:21.720
then the incoming Json will be de serialized into this coupon.

5
00:21.720 --> 00:28.860
And here this code should also be marked with at path variable and we need to tell which variable in

6
00:28.860 --> 00:30.570
the path  should be used.

7
00:30.570 --> 00:32.400
So Code will go in there.

8
00:32.880 --> 00:34.770
So here we are using code as a placeholder.

9
00:34.770 --> 00:39.140
Whatever value comes in that will go into the code, that value is being injected into this code.

10
00:39.150 --> 00:42.660
So make sure you have those two request body and path variable.


11
00:42.840 --> 00:51.150
Once you have those right click on the app run as
Spring Boot app that will launch our application

12
00:51.150 --> 00:52.440
on Embedded Tomcat server.

13
00:52.440 --> 00:56.790
While that happens, launch Postman, which is our rest client tool.

14
00:57.120 --> 00:58.280
Server is up and running.

15
00:58.590 --> 00:59.730
Click on the plus button.

16
01:00.240 --> 01:02.730
The first step is to create a coupon.

17
01:02.740 --> 01:08.730
We have to hit this restful end point here, passing the coupon data, go back, change this request

18
01:08.730 --> 01:13.680
to post the url http://

19
01:14.130 --> 01:21.090
localhost : 8080 slash coupon API slash coupons.

20
01:22.060 --> 01:24.810
So we are adding a new coupon to the coupon collection.

21
01:24.810 --> 01:30.120
So Coupon API is what is mapped right here to the controller and the controller level.

22
01:30.390 --> 01:33.180
Then coupons is what we call map to the create method.

23
01:34.500 --> 01:38.880
Click on Body select raw change it from text to application.

24
01:38.880 --> 01:40.980
Json open up a flower bracket.

25
01:41.700 --> 01:50.100
The first field here if you remember from the coupon is the code  discount and a expiry date

26
01:50.940 --> 02:01.350
code within the double quotes colon within the double quotes super sale all capital super sale is the code name

27
02:01.350 --> 02:02.970
you can use any code name comma.

28
02:03.360 --> 02:08.250
The next gui is the discount itself discount.

29
02:08.760 --> 02:11.850
We have to use the exact same names as we have on the model object.

30
02:12.720 --> 02:17.910
And the discount is a numeric value, a ten percent discount for this code.

31
02:18.210 --> 02:22.970
And the last guy is exp date for expiry date within the double quotes.

32
02:23.340 --> 02:26.100
twelve twelve twenty twenty.

33
02:27.270 --> 02:29.370
So we got code discount on expiry date.

34
02:29.370 --> 02:33.720
Id is auto increment field that will be generated in the database hit.

35
02:33.840 --> 02:36.420
Send and you see a two hundred.

36
02:36.420 --> 02:37.500
OK, which is good.

37
02:37.500 --> 02:40.020
And in response you see the id as well.

38
02:40.620 --> 02:46.170
So at this point if you go to the database and execute a select query on the coupon table, that guy

39
02:46.170 --> 02:49.560
right there execute you see the coupon record.

40
02:49.560 --> 02:53.730
One is id code super sale discount and expiry date.

41
02:54.390 --> 02:56.340
So that restful end point is working.

42
02:56.340 --> 03:01.080
The next and the last end point here is that get coupon.

43
03:01.380 --> 03:07.380
So slash coupons slash code if you pass in the code not the id return a coupon back.

44
03:07.590 --> 03:08.760
And it is a get method.

45
03:08.760 --> 03:12.120
So go back to Postman, open a new tab.

46
03:12.760 --> 03:13.590
That is the method.

47
03:13.590 --> 03:16.200
Grab the url from the previous tab.

48
03:16.950 --> 03:18.210
Copy, come back.

49
03:18.720 --> 03:27.140
paste it coupons slash code which is super sale type it in super sale is the code hit send.

50
03:27.840 --> 03:28.680
There we go.

51
03:28.710 --> 03:30.840
We get the coupon data back.

52
03:30.840 --> 03:34.860
So both our end points in the coupon service are working as expected.
