00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
So the spring test annotations and the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.290
spring testing framework itself can be

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.359
used both for integration tests as well

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.510
as unit test. There is very subtle

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.210
difference here so if you want to do

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.639
unit test you will mock so if you are

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.440
mocking that means we are still using

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.570
spring injection through the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.949
configuration that way we are making

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.689
sure that we have wired the beans and

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.150
everything properly at the same time we

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.619
are not going to call into the real

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.529
DAO's the real next layer we are still

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.619
mocking it so it is still a unit test we

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.660
could have got away without doing all

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.730
this spring stuff but here we are verifying

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.469
that everything we are

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.090
configuring or all the dependency

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.829
injection we are doing with spring is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.110
still intact it's a great way of testing

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.079
the dependency injection as well but if

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.270
you don't mock here if you don't use

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.309
mockito and if you call into the real

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.980
services they will become integration

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.270
tests so if you want to write

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.739
integration tests and if you are using

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.600
spring in your application go ahead and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.359
don't mock then it will start calling

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.430
into the next layer you have to make

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.739
sure all the dependencies are correct

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.570
and you are injecting everything

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.340
properly this is a great way to test

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.000
that as well. Summarize spring test

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.280
framework can be used along with j unit

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
and mockito to do unit testing or just

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.310
spring test framework can be used with j

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.950
unit just to do integration testing as

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310
well.
