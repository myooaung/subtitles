00:00.210 --> 00:07.950
The next step is to create the product rest controller, right click on one of the packages new class call it

1
00:08.910 --> 00:17.370
product rest controller that will  go in to spring cloud dot controllers finish.

2
00:18.710 --> 00:29.100
Mark it with @ rest controller annotation mark it with @ request mapping annotation within double quotes

3
00:29.100 --> 00:38.420
forward slash product API and within the rest controller, we need a method that returns the product

4
00:38.420 --> 00:39.640
back once it creates it.

5
00:39.890 --> 00:47.920
So product create a product and this guy needs the product model, product product.

6
00:48.890 --> 00:53.420
Mark this with @ request body annotation.

7
00:53.420 --> 01:00.050
Don't forget, if we forget this, it won't serialize or de serialize the request that comes in.

8
01:00.230 --> 01:05.900
hit control one import product from the model of the body of the method.

9
01:07.430 --> 01:13.520
hit control one add a written statement, so this guy needs to save a product to the database and return

10
01:13.520 --> 01:13.620
it.

11
01:13.640 --> 01:24.860
We need the product repository here, product repo, call it repo mark it with it @ auto wired annotation.

12
01:26.150 --> 01:28.650
Can make this private as well.

13
01:30.000 --> 01:38.520
And within the create method, we return Repo Dot Save product for now, the save method is super

14
01:38.520 --> 01:43.980
simple, but it will get a little more complicated later on as we work on Spring cloud in sections later

15
01:43.980 --> 01:46.900
on because there is no discount being applied here.

16
01:47.250 --> 01:53.450
This guy is not using the coupon service yet, but later on it will become a client to the coupon service.

17
01:53.460 --> 01:58.350
It will make a call to the coupon service from within this create method, apply the discount by fetching

18
01:58.350 --> 02:02.890
the discount and then it will save the product to the database.

19
02:02.910 --> 02:05.050
All that will come in later on.

20
02:05.940 --> 02:14.430
So for now, save the product return it mark it with the appropriate annotations @ request mapping.

21
02:16.280 --> 02:22.070
Within bracket value is equal to within double quotes slash product, we are adding a product to the

22
02:22.400 --> 02:24.120
existing collection of products.

23
02:24.150 --> 02:29.030
Slash products method is equal to request method

24
02:29.030 --> 02:32.030
dot post is the method for creation.

25
02:32.030 --> 02:33.420
Always save it.

26
02:33.620 --> 02:36.020
So that is our product rest controller.
