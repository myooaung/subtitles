In this lecture, we will set up what is required to test a coupon rest controller.

1
00:05.010 --> 00:10.170
We have two public methods within the coupon rest Controller create and get coupon.

2
00:10.290 --> 00:15.440
And these two methods use the coupon repo to unit test these two public methods.

3
00:15.570 --> 00:18.270
We need to mock out this coupon repo.

4
00:18.520 --> 00:24.330
The very first dependancy, the only dependency we need is the mockito dependency open the pom dot

5
00:24.330 --> 00:24.810
xml

6
00:26.450 --> 00:33.000
Go to the dependency section and we will see springboot starter test dependency, which has a scope

7
00:33.000 --> 00:33.600
of test.

8
00:33.930 --> 00:39.060
This is the test dependency to test Springboot applications and it brings in.

9
00:40.730 --> 00:48.080
The JUnit dependancy trans duly, if you go to maven dependency, expand it, type in Junit , with the

10
00:48.080 --> 00:52.310
latest version of Spring boot will bring in latest version of the Junit for you.

11
00:52.310 --> 01:01.830
Now launch your Web browser to add the mockito dependancy search for Mockito maven dependancy,

12
01:02.450 --> 01:03.780
Mockito maven dependecy.

13
01:03.800 --> 01:12.470
Click on the very first link takes you to mockito all grab the non beta version 2.0 as of the recording

14
01:12.470 --> 01:13.940
is beta.

15
01:13.940 --> 01:18.020
So one point one zero dot one nine is what I'm going to grab.

16
01:19.270 --> 01:27.440
Scroll down, click on the text area to copy those contents, come back to spring tool suit and paste it

17
01:27.440 --> 01:32.770
control shift f to format and we have Mockito all which is scope test.

18
01:33.980 --> 01:40.400
So it will be used only during the tests when the tests are compiled and when the tests are run by Maven.

19
01:42.250 --> 01:47.920
So we have the mockito dependency go open the test class that got generated under source test java

20
01:47.950 --> 01:52.270
and we created the project, spring has generated the spring tool suit

21
01:52.270 --> 01:54.220
has generated the test as well.

22
01:54.220 --> 01:58.870
For us, this test is Marked with @ spring boot test annotation.

23
01:58.870 --> 02:04.450
This annotation knows how to initialize everything for a springboot application and how to run this

24
02:04.450 --> 02:04.870
test.

25
02:05.200 --> 02:09.130
And every method in a test is marked with a test annotation.

26
02:09.370 --> 02:12.080
This test annotation is from Junit

27
02:12.100 --> 02:15.610
starting the next lecture will write our test.
