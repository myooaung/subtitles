In the previous lecture, we have created the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.089
the order processing service eclipse java project in

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.189
this one we will add the mockito

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.349
dependencies to this java project by

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.210
downloading them from the internet so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.190
that we can start our unit testing in

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.710
the next few lectures. So launch your

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.029
webbrowser and search for mockito

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.519

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.900
mockito all 1.9.5 which will have all

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.970
the classes we need to test our java

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.939
code and it also has the java.doc which

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.280
i'll come back in later on lectures for

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.119
ctrl-C go back to your eclipse

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.070
right click on the project say new folder

give it a name lib for libraries hit finish

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.040
say ctrl-v so paste that  jar into this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.590
lib folder then we'll add this jar to our

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.290
eclipse projects class path by

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.869
right-clicking on the project go to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.050
mackito all 1.9.5 jar click ok and then

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.080
ok again so now we have the mockito

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.780
dependencies on our project we can use

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.790
mockito to write our junits.
