00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
In the last lecture, you have seen that

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
our order processing services BO layer

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.589
which we are testing has seventy one

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.870
percent of coverage which is good but we

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.780
have to improve it at least eighty to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.580
ninety percent is a good test coverage is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.770
not hundred percent let's improve the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.020
test coverage by writing a test for this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.050
delete order method we have left this on

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.630
purpose so that we can see how

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.330
test coverage works so go back to our order

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.060
BOimpl test and start writing a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
test for our delete order method

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.530
in here will start with a junit test

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540
annotation public void delete order

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:52.020
deletes the underscore order the first

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.500
step will be doing here is when

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.539
DAO.delete123.then written one we

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.070
are testing the positive scenario to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
start with this delete throws a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.799
sequel exception so add a throws

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.280
declaration by hitting control one

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
the next step is to call the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.470
BO.deleteorder and pass it 123

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.630
we have been using this 123 in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.450
quite a few places so lets refactor it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
select that 123  right click go

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.299
to refactor extract constant and give it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.750
a name let's call it order underscore

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.439
ID hit finish it doesn't replace it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.470
everywhere so copy that order id paste it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.460
everywhere we have 123, we shouldn't have

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:59.759
any magic numbers delete order throws a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.979
BOexception so hit control one on

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.070
the delete order surround it with or ad

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.450
the throws declaration we are done

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.760
stubbing and calling the method  let's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.900
assign this to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.819
local variable call it a result and then

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:37.200
assert true result and also verify DAO.delete

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:47.609
is called with order ID thats it run it goto the play

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.569
button run as a junit test so all our

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.370
tests are green now let's rerun the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.099
coverage one more time by right-clicking

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.000
on the test folder go to coverage as

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.220
junit test

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.150
let's see if our coverage has gone up to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.569
see the BOfolder in here you see

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.879
that the coverage has gone up from 71%

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.720
to 84.1% as an assignment

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.859
please go ahead and bring the coverage to

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.349
100% by writing a test for the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.269
negative scenario as well as the  exception scenario.
