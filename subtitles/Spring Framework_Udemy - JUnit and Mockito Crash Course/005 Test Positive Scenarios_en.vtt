In this lecture will test a positive  scenario, this test here, which invokes greeting, dot greet passes

1
00:06.660 --> 00:09.660
in J unit, and it expects hello J unit to come back.

2
00:10.080 --> 00:13.730
But now we have a services layer that is being used.

3
00:13.830 --> 00:16.560
We have already mocked out this class in the test.

4
00:16.770 --> 00:20.370
We need to stub  out this method when service dot greet  is invoked.

5
00:20.530 --> 00:26.280
We need to return a response that this class under test should return back.

6
00:26.280 --> 00:30.090
Whatever response the service gives it, it should return back to do  that.

7
00:30.100 --> 00:38.670
It is very simple going to this test and use when  from Mockito so the  when is a static import see this

8
00:38.670 --> 00:42.900
Uptop here from Mockito when the method  call should go here.

9
00:43.410 --> 00:51.090
Service dot greet method is invoked with what input, whatever input you are passing here to the actual

10
00:51.090 --> 00:53.980
test that will be passed to the service method .

11
00:54.000 --> 01:00.990
So when this comes as an input to the service dot  grade, then return the response that we are expecting,

12
01:00.990 --> 01:02.760
which is Hello J unit.

13
01:03.280 --> 01:11.190
So we are Stubing out the service layer method call then this guy is invoked  with the Junit, the mocked 

14
01:11.190 --> 01:12.720
version of this service.

15
01:12.870 --> 01:17.190
It will return hello J unit and the class under test are the object here.

16
01:17.310 --> 01:19.620
The method under test greet  should return.

17
01:19.620 --> 01:28.290
Whatever response comes back from that stubed, call that's  it just one line you can right click do a run as 

18
01:28.290 --> 01:32.970
if you don't see the Junit option here go to run configurations under Junit.

19
01:33.330 --> 01:38.760
Run your greeting  implementation test from next time we can just hit the play button run it 

20
01:39.930 --> 01:43.350
There will be one test that will be passing and there will be two tests that are failing.

21
01:43.620 --> 01:47.010
So this is the test that has passed.

22
01:47.010 --> 01:48.360
As you can see, it is green.

23
01:49.200 --> 01:51.110
The tests that have failed are these two.

24
01:51.110 --> 01:52.350
We don't have to worry about it.

25
01:52.350 --> 01:58.770
But this test, as you can see, no failure test it is green will fix the other wto test the exception,

26
01:58.770 --> 02:01.470
test both have  to do with exceptions.

27
02:01.620 --> 02:07.530
You will learn how to handle or assert for assertions in Junit   five while mocking you already know

28
02:07.530 --> 02:11.040
how to assert will simply add another mock here.
