In the next lecture, we will be using the Lombok annotations on your entity classes, once we have that

1
00:06.900 --> 00:12.480
will be able to use getters, setters and constructors which are generated by Lombok on the fly.

2
00:12.930 --> 00:15.990
For that, we need to have Lombok support for our project.

3
00:15.990 --> 00:19.350
We have already added the Lombok support and it will work great.

4
00:20.380 --> 00:26.870
When we run the application, but for the ide spring tool suite doesn't know about these Lombok 
generated

5
00:26.870 --> 00:31.240
getters, setters etc, that is where we need to install the Lombok plugin.

6
00:31.660 --> 00:34.870
So the Lombok plugin is different for different IDEs.

7
00:35.080 --> 00:42.190
The easiest way to install it for spring tool suite is to go to help click on, install new software

8
00:43.240 --> 00:49.240
and launch your web browser, do a search for Lombok spring tool suite.

9
00:49.600 --> 00:54.810
So depending on the IDE you are using, just use Lombok Spring Tool suite or Lombok Eclipse.

10
00:54.820 --> 00:59.230
You will end up going to this website, which is Project Lombok dot org.

11
00:59.410 --> 01:00.550
Set up eclipse.

12
01:00.550 --> 01:06.010
That's the page it will take you to click on that, and they have very simple documentation to follow.

13
01:06.020 --> 01:07.030
There are two ways to do it.

14
01:07.240 --> 01:15.550
One is to download the Lombok Jar file and run Java Hyphen Jar that jar file or even easier.

15
01:15.640 --> 01:21.430
The second way what you see right here via Eclipse Plugin Installer Copy this link.

16
01:21.610 --> 01:23.770
This is the link to the Lombok plugin.

17
01:24.370 --> 01:27.760
Once copied, go back to the spring tool suite on this here.

18
01:28.060 --> 01:31.750
Paste the website and click on Add.

19
01:34.130 --> 01:39.220
Paste the website in this location here and then say, Lombok, that's the name I'm giving to it.

20
01:39.230 --> 01:41.870
So I have copied and paste it the url right here in the location.

21
01:42.380 --> 01:45.510
Then I have clicked on name or I have given it a name called Lombok.

22
01:45.530 --> 01:49.130
Add as soon as you do that, it will fetch this Lombok.

23
01:50.110 --> 01:54.670
Plug in for you have been doing it for quite some time thats the reason it's already loaded for you,

24
01:54.670 --> 01:58.270
it will take a few seconds to load this guy select it

25
01:59.260 --> 02:00.160
Click on Next.

26
02:00.490 --> 02:03.940
That will pull all the dependencies and requirements to install Lombok.

27
02:04.420 --> 02:10.920
Click on Finish that will do the installation for you will have to accept the license agreement.

28
02:10.930 --> 02:12.640
As i said,i have already installed it.

29
02:12.670 --> 02:15.700
That's the reason it didn't ask me for a license agreement.

30
02:15.700 --> 02:17.890
In your case, it will ask you for a license agreement.

31
02:18.340 --> 02:19.420
Click the radio button.

32
02:19.630 --> 02:24.800
Once you do that, it will install the software, as you can see bottom right here at the bottom.

33
02:25.180 --> 02:28.840
It is doing the installation in my case once the installation finishes.

34
02:29.200 --> 02:32.370
If it asks you to restart the IDE, go ahead and restart it it.

35
02:32.380 --> 02:39.880
I suggest you restart your IDE and then you will be able to use Lombok in your application or IDE

36
02:39.880 --> 02:42.730
when you use the Get Etc. in other classes.

37
02:43.570 --> 02:46.150
They will work without any compilation issues.

38
02:46.150 --> 02:52.410
Just the Lombok annotations will be used by your IDE and you'll be able to use the getter setter constructors,

39
02:52.420 --> 02:53.830
etc. for these classes.
