00:00.210 --> 00:07.260
The reason the negative scenario tests failed is because we are expecting a illegal argument exception

1
00:07.260 --> 00:09.570
to be thrown, but nothing was thrown.

2
00:09.570 --> 00:10.620
The reason behind it?

3
00:11.010 --> 00:18.330
We go back to the test implementation go  the first negative scenario test where we are passing null

4
00:18.330 --> 00:19.650
value to the greet  method.

5
00:19.980 --> 00:25.170
But we are not getting any illegal argument exception because we have stubbed out the greeting service

6
00:25.170 --> 00:32.130
implementation and we need to stub out or mark out this particular scenario as well.

7
00:32.130 --> 00:34.140
In the test, which is very simple.

8
00:34.680 --> 00:39.710
We use to throw do throw from Mockito 

9
00:39.990 --> 00:46.680
This guy needs the exception that should be thrown  illegal argument exception dot class when dot when

10
00:47.130 --> 00:58.230
the call service outside the bracket dot greet when greet method is invoked with a null argument through

11
00:58.230 --> 01:00.480
the illegal argument exception.

12
01:00.480 --> 01:02.370
And then we test the implementation.

13
01:02.370 --> 01:03.690
We invoke the greet  method.

14
01:03.870 --> 01:09.060
The great method internally will use the mocked object service object.

15
01:09.330 --> 01:15.720
It when the mocked  service objects greet method is invoked with null, it will throw a illegal argument

16
01:15.720 --> 01:16.260
exception.

17
01:16.260 --> 01:19.650
Now if you run the test, go here run the test again.

18
01:20.970 --> 01:26.910
Two tests should pass, go back to the Junit on the left, see, two or  green, only one has failed.

19
01:27.180 --> 01:35.310
You can simply copy this do throw  and paste it in the next test where we are passing a blank value instead

20
01:35.310 --> 01:35.840
of null.

21
01:36.180 --> 01:38.090
The greet method receives a blank value.

22
01:38.520 --> 01:43.920
And here when we are Stubing, we need to pass this blank value.

23
01:43.920 --> 01:49.830
So we are saying telling Mockito throw  a illegal argument exception when the service greet method is

24
01:49.830 --> 01:52.830
invoked with blank and in the service implementation.

25
01:53.790 --> 02:00.210
If you see this, if name is equal to null or name dot length is equal to zero through illegal argument

26
02:00.210 --> 02:00.630
exception.

27
02:00.630 --> 02:07.980
That is the scenario we are mocking  right now so that our object or class under test can be tested,

28
02:08.460 --> 02:09.740
run again.

29
02:09.750 --> 02:11.220
Everything should be green this time.

30
02:12.740 --> 02:15.000
There we go, all green, all happy.

31
02:15.800 --> 02:23.510
So you have  successfully used J Unit five and Mockito together to test positive and negative scenarios with

32
02:23.510 --> 02:25.430
three simple steps or  four simple steps.

33
02:25.440 --> 02:28.940
First, this extends  with then mock annotation.

34
02:29.120 --> 02:33.140
Inject mocks  and then do appropriate method  level Stubing.
