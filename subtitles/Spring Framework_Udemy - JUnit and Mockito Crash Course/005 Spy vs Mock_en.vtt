00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
So by now you have understood that spy is

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.030
going to use the real object you unless

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.309
stubout something all the methods on

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.780
the real object will be called by

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.130
mockito when we use a spy whereas if we

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.859
mock then it's mockitoes own version of

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.070
object and nothing happens unless we

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.660
stubout a particular call,so a better way of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.810
handling spice or doing partial mocking

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
in mockito is not to use by simply use

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
mockito mock annotations ctrl 1

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
to import it control shift O to remove

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.190
the spy and unused imports and in our

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.920
code we can now use this when syntax

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.559
without any problem so this is stubbed out

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.629
earlier when we used spy

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.030
it threw a index out of bound

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.370
exception because it called the actual

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
method but now it's mocked out and we no

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.229
longer need is do return syntax and also

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.040
we can call the real methods if you want

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.610
to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:25.979
by simply using mockito dot when my list

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.119
dot size is called then call real method

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.090
so this is a better way of handling it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.750
instead of using spy and then stubbing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.590
out some methods and calling the real

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.990
methods for a lot of them we can simply

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.229
use mark and only in cases where we want

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.030
to use the real method you can simply

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.030
say when the object and then call the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.729
real method is a better syntax so in you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.189
application if you ever need RCL

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.850
mocking then use @mock

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.180
annotation and then call real method

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.550
this way we need not learn another

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.709
syntax of doreturn we can simply use

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.450
the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.500
when syntax.
