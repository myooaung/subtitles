00:00.060 --> 00:07.140
Next step is to add the dependencies to POM. XML to work with J Unit 5 and Maven, all we need

1
00:07.140 --> 00:08.780
is these two dependencies.

2
00:09.240 --> 00:13.900
You can grab these from the completed project that you have now downloaded from the previous lecture

3
00:13.900 --> 00:15.510
or the first lecture of this section.

4
00:15.660 --> 00:25.350
Or you can Google for the Junit Jupiter to grab the latest version, launch your Web browser J unit Jupiter

5
00:26.130 --> 00:26.940
Maven.

6
00:28.450 --> 00:35.620
Click on the very first link, we don't want the API, so if you go to org Junit  Jupiter level, scroll down.

7
00:35.620 --> 00:39.550
There is a Jupiter unit, Jupiter dependancy see this  aggregator.

8
00:39.550 --> 00:44.200
It brings in everything that is required for us to click on this Junit hyphen  Jupiter.

9
00:45.340 --> 00:47.230
Grab the latest version.

10
00:48.340 --> 00:49.180
Copy that.

11
00:51.500 --> 00:58.040
Go back to Eclipse, open the POM.XML  you can take out all these dependencies in the dependancy

12
00:58.040 --> 01:03.770
section, get rid of everything just paste  that first format it 

13
01:05.450 --> 01:08.090
So that's the first dependency Junit Jupiter.

14
01:08.100 --> 01:11.720
The second one is J unit or Mockito J unit.

15
01:11.720 --> 01:14.660
Jupiter, the Mockito support for Junit Jupiter.

16
01:15.170 --> 01:17.780
Go back, Google for it again, maven.

17
01:20.310 --> 01:25.980
So this is Mockito  JUnit, Jupiter, Maven dependancy, click on the very first link, grab the latest

18
01:25.980 --> 01:26.490
version.

19
01:27.830 --> 01:35.180
Click come back paste it in dependencies, format it  and now we're good to go.

20
01:35.210 --> 01:38.750
There are a few changes which we need to make to our test here.

21
01:38.760 --> 01:40.670
As you can see, it is not compiling.

22
01:40.910 --> 01:43.490
We'll start doing that in the next lectures 

23
01:43.490 --> 01:48.020
Two dependencies J unit  Jupiter and Mockito J Unit Jupiter.
