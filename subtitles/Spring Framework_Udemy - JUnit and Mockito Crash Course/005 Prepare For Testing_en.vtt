00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
In this lecture, will start writing a J unit

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.190
test case for our userDAO class and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.250
we will prepare it to mock the static

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.130
method in the ID generator so to do that

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.460
right click on the user DAO class say

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.140
new junit test case leave the options

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.359
as is except for the source folder from

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.609
SRC change it to test hit finish even before

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.980
we start implementing our test method we

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.750
need to do some preparation while using

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.480
power mocks the first thing is to use

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.969
the run with annotation which I have

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.660
explained in the junit lectures the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.629
run with annotation tells the j unit

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.390
that at runtime we want to use a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.190
different runner instead of the default

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.399
j unit runner while using power mock we

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.039
should use the power mock runner from

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.870
power mock  powermock dot class this power mock runner

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.780
is from the powermock modules

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.750
for j unit the second important

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.840
annotation is the prepare for tests

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.330
prepare for tests and we pass the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.400
classes that we want to mock at runtime

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
we tell this to the power mock API using

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.590
the prepare for tests ID generator dot

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.920
class and import the ID generator this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.270
tells powermock that we are doing

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.070
something special or we need something

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.049
special at runtime and we are asking

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.610
power mock to prepare it using the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.799
custom class loader or using the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.200
bytecode manipulation or whatever magic

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600
it does behind the scenes we want powermock

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.460
to do all that for this particular class

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.619
so that we can mock out the static

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.630
methods inside this class and this test

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
is run one final piece is to import just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.440
static methods inside that power mockito

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.649
since we are using the mockito

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.920
flavor of power mach there is a power

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.520
mockito class and we want to import all

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.129
the static methods that are available on

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.069
this class so that we can use

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.230
them in the next lecture when we start

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.909
testing our user DAO.
