We need to have a couple of micro services in place so that we can take the spring components and plug

1
00:06.120 --> 00:08.480
them in wherever and however required.

2
00:08.760 --> 00:13.590
So you're going to create a product micro service and a coupon micro service.

3
00:14.010 --> 00:21.210
These two services will expose out the restful API, which will allow a end user to create a product.

4
00:21.390 --> 00:28.110
And in the process, the product service will use the coupon service to apply a coupon code that the

5
00:28.110 --> 00:31.580
client passes in and gets the discount.

6
00:32.310 --> 00:36.900
So all the coupon information is maintained by the coupon service.

7
00:37.380 --> 00:42.720
The product service is only responsible for creating the product in the database, along with its price

8
00:42.720 --> 00:44.980
and description details which the client passes.

9
00:45.600 --> 00:48.840
So the process here is take the client's request.

10
00:49.080 --> 00:53.700
The product service will call the coupon service, get the discount for the coupon code, which the

11
00:53.700 --> 00:59.550
client would have passed, apply that discount on the price which the client passes and then save that

12
00:59.550 --> 01:01.010
product to the database.

13
01:01.020 --> 01:04.740
All the coupon details will be saved in the coupon service database.

14
01:05.500 --> 01:08.790
The coupon service will expose out a couple of restful apis.

15
01:08.790 --> 01:16.260
One is to create the coupons and the second one is to get the coupon details through the coupon code.
