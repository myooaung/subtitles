Now you know how to create and run tests using both J-Unit four as well as JUNIT five the rest of the

1
00:07.890 --> 00:12.890
scores will use the Junit 4 way of doing things because there are a lot of projects out there which

2
00:12.890 --> 00:14.310
are still on Junit 4.

3
00:14.340 --> 00:18.090
And when I first recorded this course it was Junit 4.

4
00:18.470 --> 00:24.350
But if you want to use junit 5 As you progress through the course instead of creating standalone projects

5
00:24.350 --> 00:31.300
like this, create a maven project when I create a project you create maven project include the dependencies

6
00:31.310 --> 00:38.270
like how you have done it in this section and in your tests you will use the J Unit 5 annotations instead of

7
00:38.330 --> 00:44.300
junit 4 annotations and include the junit platform dot class to run your test.

8
00:44.300 --> 00:49.760
So key steps are to create a maven project if you want to use junit 5 create a maven Project add

9
00:49.850 --> 00:55.100
the appropriate dependencies which you have learnt in this section and use the right annotations on

10
00:55.100 --> 00:56.500
your tests.

11
00:56.540 --> 01:02.050
Once you do that everything else even when you work with Mockito will work as expected.
