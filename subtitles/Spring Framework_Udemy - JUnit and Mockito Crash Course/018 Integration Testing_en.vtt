In this lecture, we'll do the integration testing between the product service and the coupon service

1
00:05.520 --> 00:09.270
before you go ahead and do that, just to be consistent, go to the application dot

2
00:09.480 --> 00:18.080
properties will start using ports 9090 and 9091 for the product service we are using 9090.

3
00:18.450 --> 00:23.490
So for the coupon service instead of 8080, let's use 9091.

4
00:24.480 --> 00:31.200
Just to be consistent, Later on, for other micro services, we can use the 8080 port. Go to coupon

5
00:31.200 --> 00:32.450
service, go to the application

6
00:32.510 --> 00:35.090
dot properties add a server.

7
00:35.130 --> 00:45.390
dot port is equal to 9091, so product service uses 9090 and coupon service uses 9091.

8
00:45.390 --> 00:47.490
Stop those two applications.

9
00:48.150 --> 00:49.800
Start the coupon service.

10
00:50.710 --> 00:57.550
Run as a Springboot app, you can also run it from here, the play button, start the product service.

11
00:59.230 --> 01:04.780
While they come up, go to Posman, this time when we create a product along with the price, you need

12
01:04.780 --> 01:12.100
to send one more detail, which is the coupon code colon space.

13
01:12.640 --> 01:14.790
The code itself will go in double quotes.

14
01:14.800 --> 01:18.430
The code we have is all capital super sale.

15
01:18.640 --> 01:21.030
That was the code that we have created earlier.

16
01:21.040 --> 01:25.060
If you remember super sale, this will apply to a ten

17
01:26.890 --> 01:31.840
discount of ten dollars or ten rupees, in our case, it's ten dollars here it's a thousand bucks.

18
01:31.870 --> 01:35.490
Thousand dollars so ten dollars will be deducted from this thousand.

19
01:35.680 --> 01:40.300
Let's change this product from iPhone to a Mac.

20
01:41.230 --> 01:42.820
And it's cool.

21
01:45.180 --> 01:47.730
Prize is 2000 for a good one super sale.

22
01:47.760 --> 01:49.230
So now let's hit send.

23
01:50.620 --> 01:51.350
There we go.

24
01:51.670 --> 01:56.910
So this time it has applied a discount, if you look at the price that comes back, it has deducted

25
01:56.920 --> 02:03.650
ten dollars from the two thousand dollars and it has used that as the price and also the coupon code.

26
02:04.060 --> 02:05.860
You can see it in the response coming back.

27
02:05.860 --> 02:10.110
But this is not saved to the the coupon code itself is not saved to the database.

28
02:10.120 --> 02:16.630
Only this info here, the id name, description and price go into the database because we have marked this coupon

29
02:16.630 --> 02:18.190
code as transient.

30
02:18.850 --> 02:25.540
So it both the micro services are working perfectly end to end the product service is able to talk to

31
02:25.540 --> 02:31.840
the coupon service, get the discount, apply that discount and save that price along with all the other

32
02:31.840 --> 02:34.360
product information into the database.
