Next method under test is the delete interests that takes a interest ID and deletes it from the

1
00:05.730 --> 00:09.540
database using interest repo dot dlete by the ID method.

2
00:09.840 --> 00:14.820
So we need to mock this interest repo dot delete by the ID method, which is the void method, and

3
00:14.820 --> 00:17.250
our method is also void it doesn't return anything.

4
00:17.550 --> 00:19.590
Go to the test at the end of it.

5
00:19.990 --> 00:23.040
Lets's add a new test method right there.

6
00:23.860 --> 00:35.010
Void test delete interest is the method mark it with @ test annotation invoke controller dot delete

7
00:35.010 --> 00:36.630
interest pass in 1-2-3.

8
00:36.630 --> 00:44.430
For this to work, we need to mock use when when interest repository  dot delete by id

9
00:44.640 --> 00:45.720
is invoked with id

10
00:45.810 --> 00:46.590
One two three.

11
00:48.080 --> 00:54.830
Then we need to return, but in this case, it is a void method, so we'll be using get rid of that

12
00:54.830 --> 00:57.020
line, do nothing.

13
00:57.410 --> 00:58.820
We don't want to do anything.

14
00:59.810 --> 01:00.860
dot when.

15
01:02.160 --> 01:12.300
Interest repository Dot Delete by id is invoked this is one easy way to mock void methods semicolon at the

16
01:12.480 --> 01:20.310
end, so do nothing when interest repo within brackets outside the brackets delete by id take out

17
01:20.310 --> 01:21.150
the additional bracket at the end

18
01:21.150 --> 01:23.600
so that syntax again do nothing

19
01:23.610 --> 01:26.940
Invocation dot when interest repo goes in to the brackets.

20
01:27.180 --> 01:28.380
Dot delete.

21
01:28.380 --> 01:32.070
By ID . Pass in the ID one two three, that is the mocked call.

22
01:32.370 --> 01:40.890
And then we can simply verify if the interest repository outside  the brackets dot delete by ID

23
01:41.040 --> 01:46.230
is really getting invoked when we call control dot delete intercept is invoked.

24
01:46.230 --> 01:49.680
That means the functionality whatever we are expecting is done.

25
01:49.680 --> 01:55.920
When we are invoking this delete interest method, it should invoke interest repo dot delete by ID. and

26
01:55.920 --> 01:57.750
our test is good enough.

27
01:58.620 --> 02:01.560
Right click run as Junit test.

28
02:02.780 --> 02:05.060
That will run all the tests real quick.

29
02:06.740 --> 02:07.320
There we go.

30
02:07.340 --> 02:12.020
Everything is green and happy, all the four tests have passed successfully.
