2
00:11.160 --> 00:12.000
menu new.

3
00:13.170 --> 00:14.700
Spring Starter Project.

4
00:16.570 --> 00:24.550
Call the Project Product Service Product Service, com.Bharath.springcloud, that's fine.

Select MySQL Driver uptop here Spring Data JPA as well as Spring WEB.

9
00:35.770 --> 00:39.760
We need the same dependencies as the previous project hit finish.

10
00:40.920 --> 00:48.870
That will create the product service for as expanded go to source main Java, right click new class

11
00:49.440 --> 00:51.510
call it product is the model.

12
00:51.510 --> 00:52.830

Private string description, private big decimal price.

17
01:21.240 --> 01:25.730
You can also use integer if you want to, but since it's a decimal in the database, let's use a big

Generate getters and setters select all.

21
01:33.630 --> 01:44.760
I want it after price, generate. Control shift f to format it scroll up mark this with @ entity

22
01:44.790 --> 01:45.600
annotation.

23
01:47.510 --> 01:55.710
Run javax dot persistance Mark this with @ Id hit control one import that the last one is @ generated

24
01:55.850 --> 01:56.600
value.

25
02:01.230 --> 02:10.680
That guy right there within brackets, the strategy is equal to generation type dot identity column

26
02:10.680 --> 02:11.750
in the database.

27
02:12.210 --> 02:13.140
So that's the model.

28
02:14.170 --> 02:15.750
Next, create a repository, right

29
02:15.750 --> 02:16.740
Click on the package.

30
02:16.740 --> 02:21.090
New interface product Repo

31
02:21.510 --> 02:23.760
This will go into springcloud

32
02:23.760 --> 02:30.450
DOT repos hit add search for a jpa repository or it'll be readily available for you.

That entity is of type product.

36
02:39.120 --> 02:44.260
Which we have just created that guy right there, and the identity type is long.

37
02:45.150 --> 02:51.150
You go back to the product id type is long, so has successfully created a product service project,

38
02:51.150 --> 02:53.910
the model and also the repository.
