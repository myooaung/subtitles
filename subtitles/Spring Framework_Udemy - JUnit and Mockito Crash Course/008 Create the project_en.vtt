The first step is to create the coupon service Spring boot project to do that, go to spring tool suite

1
00:06.390 --> 00:09.960
go to the file menu, new spring starter project.

2
00:10.900 --> 00:13.520
Give the project a name right here.

3
00:13.540 --> 00:18.160
Call it coupon service is the project name.

4
00:18.520 --> 00:25.330
The group name is com.bharath.Springcloud,  com.bharath.Springcloud

5
00:25.450 --> 00:28.990
The artifact name is Coupon Service that is taken from the name of top here.

6
00:29.230 --> 00:33.280
The description is Coupon Service as well.

7
00:33.490 --> 00:34.240
The package name.

8
00:34.240 --> 00:39.490
You can copy this group name pasted on the package name hit next.

9
00:39.520 --> 00:42.520
This is where we select all the dependencies for our project.

10
00:43.150 --> 00:46.120
The first dependancy we need is the Spring Web.

11
00:46.390 --> 00:49.470
So search for web and select spring web.

12
00:49.720 --> 00:55.030
Right there you see spring web because we need this to develop that restful web services.

13
00:55.900 --> 01:00.100
The second dependency is spring data JPA

14
01:00.130 --> 01:06.370
That guy, we are going to use Spring Data JPA to do all the object relational mapping work against

15
01:06.370 --> 01:07.390
the database.

16
01:07.900 --> 01:13.780
The last of the dependencies for now is the My SQL Driver.

17
01:14.020 --> 01:15.160
So type in My SQL.

18
01:15.160 --> 01:20.020
Select that MySQL driver that will add the MySQL Connector, which is the JDBC driver to connect

19
01:20.020 --> 01:22.450
to the MySQL database finish.

20
01:24.810 --> 01:29.830
That will pull all the dependencies, it will create the coupon service project for us if you open

21
01:29.830 --> 01:31.050
the pom.xml

22
01:32.250 --> 01:37.920
DoubleClick to maximize scroll down, you will see all the dependencies for your project, the Web dependancy

23
01:37.920 --> 01:44.730
For restful Services MySQL connecter to connect to the MySQL database, springboot starter data jpa.

24
01:44.730 --> 01:49.290
to do object relational mapping and using spring data within our project.

25
01:49.560 --> 01:55.710
We're going to add a lot more dependencies here as you mastered spring cloud in the next few sections for

26
01:55.710 --> 01:57.240
now to develop the restful API.

27
01:57.540 --> 01:58.680
