Hi there welcome to the  Junit and Mockito crash course in this video

1
00:06.190 --> 00:10.500
I will brief you about the course so that you can use it effectively

2
00:11.860 --> 00:17.449
This course is organized into sections and each section is made up of one or more lectures

3
00:18.850 --> 00:24.359
Most of the lectures have a quiz at the end for you to do a self-check

4
00:25.180 --> 00:30.119
The questions in these quiz's are what you usually face in job interviews

5
00:32.200 --> 00:39.659
Seventy percent is a good score in this quizs it is a self-paced learning so learn it at your own pace

6
00:41.379 --> 00:48.989
There is a software section setup section right at the beginning of the course I recommend you do that setup before

7
00:49.210 --> 00:51.210
proceeding with the course

8
00:51.760 --> 00:54.870
As you cruise through the course you might face questions

9
00:55.629 --> 01:00.329
You can ask those questions either by sending me a personal message on udemy

10
01:00.879 --> 01:03.779
or by creating a discussion

11
01:04.869 --> 01:06.390
Before you create a discussion

12
01:06.390 --> 01:13.949
I suggest you check the earlier discussions to see if the answers for the issues or the questions you have already been answered

13
01:14.830 --> 01:22.679
They also recommend your answer the questions posted by others as it is a great way to learn and share

14
01:24.729 --> 01:32.219
the course has enough material to enable you write unit tests you have to practice and

15
01:32.500 --> 01:34.500
experiment to be good at them

16
01:35.290 --> 01:39.179

17
01:40.450 --> 01:45.540
