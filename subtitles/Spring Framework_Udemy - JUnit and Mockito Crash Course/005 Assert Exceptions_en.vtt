In this lecture I will show you how to expect for exceptions in your J-Unit test cases the expected

1
00:07.760 --> 00:11.010
attribute on the test annotation is no longer supported.

2
00:11.040 --> 00:14.660
So you can get rid of that delete those brackets as well.

3
00:14.760 --> 00:22.130
Do the same for the second method here which is testing for the exception not to assert for an exception.

4
00:22.150 --> 00:27.500
We will do assertions Dot  assert throws

5
00:27.730 --> 00:30.640
So assert throws

6
00:30.860 --> 00:37.930
takes Tthe expected exception as the first parameter and an executable as a second parameter lets starts with

7
00:37.930 --> 00:43.240
the exception a illegal argument exception dot class.

8
00:43.240 --> 00:45.430
The second parameter is an executable.

9
00:45.430 --> 00:50.460
The easiest way to do that is use a closure or a lambda expression.

10
00:51.160 --> 00:57.270
Open and close bracket arrow symbol open and close a flower bracket that will close the lambda close

11
00:57.280 --> 00:59.800
the bracket for the assert throws.

12
00:59.920 --> 01:06.500
And inside this you can define any code you want to invoke that will throw an exception.

13
01:07.200 --> 01:11.870
So here we can simply throw a illegal argument exception but that is not what we want.

14
01:11.870 --> 01:18.610
invoke this greeting dot great cut  it paste it inside the lambda expression.

15
01:18.610 --> 01:23.700
So when this is invoked with null that will through a illegal argument exception you can copy this

16
01:23.700 --> 01:27.920
line scroll down and paste it here.

17
01:27.930 --> 01:33.880
Replace this line in the method which passes in a blank instead of null.

18
01:36.030 --> 01:39.130
Then double quotes pass a blank value.

19
01:39.460 --> 01:39.920
That's it.

20
01:39.920 --> 01:45.140
So now you have resolved all the errors in your test and we're all set to run.

21
01:45.300 --> 01:47.950
Running a test needs a couple more steps.

22
01:47.950 --> 01:49.720
I'll show you that in the next lecture.
