00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
In this lecture, I will explain the order

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.830
processing use case which will be

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.960
developing and testing in the next few

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.389
lectures the order processor application

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.330
will allow a client to place an order

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.809
to cancel an order and then to delete an

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.060
order will be developing a mini

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.600
ecommerce application with two important

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.390
layers or classes starting with the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.420
OrderBO and OrderDAO.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.359
The OrderDAO Data Access Object

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.759
is responsible for all the database

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.180
access and the DO object provides the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
business logic.The BO has three

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.460
important methods placing an order,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.739
cancelling an order and deleting an order

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.800
and then the DAO does all the crud work

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.590
Creation of data, reading the data

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.840
updating the data and then deleting of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.059
data. Will not be connecting to any

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.219
database that's where mocking will come

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.090
into picture as we'll see we'll start by

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.940
creating the order DAO interface then we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.549
create a OrderDAO impl but will not

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.830
completely implement this class just to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.479
demonstrate the power of mocking and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.820
mockito we will then create a order

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.490
interface which will be implemented by

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.320
order BO impl which is our main

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.150
class important class which we will be

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.570
testing using junit and mockito by

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.850
mocking out the order DAO.
