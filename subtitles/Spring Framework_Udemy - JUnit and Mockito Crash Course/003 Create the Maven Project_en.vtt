00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.259
The maven project for our ticketing

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.440
service to do that launch the Eclipse

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.990
IDE by clicking on the Eclipse icon once

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.059
you select the workspace you are on the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.090
Eclipse workbench go to the file menu

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.869
say new you can say project or go to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.830
other and in here in the wizards type in

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.859
maven select maven project hit next next

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.070
again leave the default options as is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.840
that is you will be selecting the maven

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.079
archetype Quick Start hit next the group

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.530
ID I'm using is com.bharath.Junit.spring

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.320
you can type in whatever you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.969
want for the group ID it is a unique

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.940
space where all your projects will be

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.510
saved under maven artifact ID is the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.570
actual project ID so let's give the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.230
artifact id as spring j-unit although it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.390
is a ticketing service just so that you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.609
can easily find the project later on if

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.219
you want to i'm naming it spring j unit

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.619
you can leave everything else as if you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.829
want you can change the package name so

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.520
it is using the group ID dot the project

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.799
name as the package name we can change

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.689
it to bharathj-unit service for now i

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.340
will choose one package called service

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.659
hit finish so here is our maven project

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.899
it has the package that we gave it and

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.359
it also generates a sample java class

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.729
with the main method in it and the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.229
corresponding j-unit test for it the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.439
skeleton test for it and the important

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.909
maven configuration file form dot XML go

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.859
to the form dot XML tab click on this

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.419
maximize it so everything we gave when

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:00.299
we created the project is being used

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.719
here the group ID the artifact ID these

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.609
are all the maven coordinates the jar

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.200
says that it is a standalone Java

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.019
project for web applications this is war

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
instead this is the name which we give

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.660
then maven some properties for maven and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.940
here is the dependency section which is

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.710
a very important section which will be

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.980
updating in the next few lectures right

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.870
now it only has dependency for j-unit

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.320
that to not j-unit for so we'll be

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.450
updating all that based on some files

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.800
you will be downloading from the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.690
contents of the lectures later on.
