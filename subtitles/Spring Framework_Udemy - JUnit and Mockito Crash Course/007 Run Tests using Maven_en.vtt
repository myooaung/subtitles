In this lecture I will show you how to build a Maven project and in the process you will see that our

1
00:05.700 --> 00:08.670
tests are automatically run for us.

2
00:08.670 --> 00:18.500
So right click on Hello J-Unit five do a run as maven clean expand this console.

3
00:18.510 --> 00:24.780
So maven will delete everything under the target directory right here which it uses to build our project.

4
00:24.780 --> 00:30.820
So everything is copied here and our classes are compiled and the jar is built under the target directory.

5
00:31.230 --> 00:33.170
Right click do a

6
00:33.650 --> 00:35.600
Run as maven.

7
00:35.670 --> 00:43.870
Install is the maven goal or command that's going to compile our classes run our tests and even prepare

8
00:43.870 --> 00:46.280
a jar file so it's compiling the source code.

9
00:46.320 --> 00:49.480
It is running the tests right now as you can see here.

10
00:49.770 --> 00:56.460
All our test passed successfully only the test pass it will automatically build our project and the

11
00:56.460 --> 00:58.760
jar files under the target directory.

12
00:58.980 --> 01:05.470
So we have no issues with our tests all the tests are passing and the build is successful.

13
01:05.470 --> 01:09.630
So you have successfully used J-Unit 5 in your project.

14
01:09.630 --> 01:18.380
If you go to the target directory right click do a refresh you will find all the artifacts are copied 

15
01:18.380 --> 01:18.710
by maven

16
01:18.740 --> 01:25.400
And the final jar file is generated and you can even see the sure fire reports which our unit test case

17
01:25.400 --> 01:25.780
reports.

18
01:25.790 --> 01:26.690
If you open them up.
