00:00.090 --> 00:06.720
In this lecture, we will test the Do post  method to do that, change the method name to do post hit 

1
00:06.720 --> 00:16.740
control D ,  to get rid of the fail line, invoke new coupon servelet dot do  post passing the request response

2
00:16.740 --> 00:24.360
hit control one, handle exceptions that come back to test the this should be do post not do get do

3
00:24.360 --> 00:28.440
post and then the request and response.

4
00:30.760 --> 00:38.540
Save it, go to the coupon Servelet, if you look at the Do post  method, it gets the coupon using request dot 

5
00:38.680 --> 00:39.750
get parameter.

6
00:39.760 --> 00:47.740
So we need to mark this call on the request and then you do this request, don't get request despatcher

7
00:48.040 --> 00:52.540
and we need to mock out  this as well   that as well so that it returns a mocked out dispatcher.

8
00:52.540 --> 00:55.330
And then we can verify if this forward gets call.

9
00:55.480 --> 01:00.460
You can also verify that the set  attribute gets called on the request object.

10
01:00.810 --> 01:03.670
So let's do that mocking go here.

11
01:03.670 --> 01:06.940
Let me scroll this up so that you can see it clearly.

12
01:09.800 --> 01:19.970
Even before the test or Method under  the test is invoked, he will use the when request, dot get parameter

13
01:19.970 --> 01:23.870
is invoked with within the double quotes  coupon.

14
01:25.160 --> 01:26.990
You can extract  this to a constant.

15
01:28.990 --> 01:38.830
Dot then return super sale  is what should be returned all capital super sale , that is the first mock.

16
01:40.710 --> 01:51.870
Then when request of a cap lock caps lock issue here, when request dot  get dispatcher, that request

17
01:51.870 --> 01:56.070
dispatcher is invoked within the double quotes  with response.

18
01:56.730 --> 02:00.970
Dot JSP  this is how the method is invoked in the servelet if you look here  request.

19
02:00.990 --> 02:06.030
Dot get dispatcher And this guys invoked what should be going back.

20
02:06.990 --> 02:10.840
Dot Then return the mock dot  request.

21
02:10.870 --> 02:12.630
Dispatcher Which you have a up top here.

22
02:12.630 --> 02:17.240
Let me change that or  to lower case requests.

23
02:17.250 --> 02:19.410
Dispatcher is what should be returned now.

24
02:19.410 --> 02:21.810
We have complete control on the Code.

25
02:22.260 --> 02:27.900
Do the verification instead of asserting we will verify if the appropriate calls are being made.

26
02:28.410 --> 02:30.570
Verify on the request.

27
02:33.250 --> 02:41.830
Dot set attribute should be invoked with this string called discount, that is what should happen here.

28
02:41.830 --> 02:48.430
See this discount, that is the method that should be  invoked with this key and the value.

29
02:49.120 --> 02:57.700
You can copy the value from here, the whole thing, and entire  string come back paste it  right there.

30
02:58.150 --> 03:04.900
And instead of this coupon, you can change it to super sale , get rid of all that, all capital Super

31
03:04.900 --> 03:08.770
Sale   only one space on the left and one space on the right.

32
03:08.950 --> 03:10.290
That is the first verification.

33
03:10.300 --> 03:18.010
Next will also verify if the response is being sent to the correct page request.

34
03:18.010 --> 03:20.160
Dispatcher dot  forward should be called.

35
03:20.170 --> 03:26.740
That's all are that we are going to verify  forward and it should give it the request and then the response.

36
03:28.120 --> 03:35.010
Save it  we can right click run both  tests, run as the J unit test.

37
03:36.030 --> 03:39.810
And everything is green both the test  has passed without any issues.

38
03:39.990 --> 03:43.460
So in this lecture, you have tested the Do post method in the process.

39
03:43.680 --> 03:49.700
You have mocked out  two things to get parameter on the request and get request despatcher with the following JSB ,

40
03:49.710 --> 03:51.930
we are retaining our own request despatcher.

41
03:52.170 --> 03:57.720
And then we are verifying that when the real method is invoked method and the test is invoked, we are

42
03:57.900 --> 04:03.690
verifying  the set attribute is called on the request and the request dispatchers forward is called

43
04:04.050 --> 04:06.160
with the request and response that go to the.

44
04:06.330 --> 04:07.860
Servelet's do post method.
