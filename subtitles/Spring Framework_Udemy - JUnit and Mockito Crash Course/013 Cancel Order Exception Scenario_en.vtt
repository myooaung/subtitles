00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
In this lecture we will test the cancel

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.200
order method for the exception scenarios

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.740
that it will check if the read method

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.110
on theDAO if it throws an sequel

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.719
exception our cancel order method on the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.759
BO is actually throwing a BO exception

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.470
thats the first check and then secondly

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.119
we'll also check the update method   throws a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.130
sequel exception then our

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.350
cancel order method is again throwing a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.660
BOexception two scenarios copy

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.869
this test method actually our test code

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.519
will be very simple in this case will be

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.710
deleting a lot of lines from this code

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.160
cancel order should throw a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.309
BOexception on read on DAO read actually so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.890
in here will stubout when DAO.read

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
123 instead of then return will say then throw

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.940
a SQLexception.class will removethis

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.240
order at the end we don't need this order

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.340
line in here, we don't need order,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.700
we don't need this update and we don't

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.650
need any of these asserts and verifies

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.900
just a two-line method we don't even

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.640
have to assign this BO.cancelorder

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.110
to a result because we're not

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.840
going to assert for that result all we

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.610
are going to do is use the expected attribute

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.909
on the test annotation and we

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.400
are going to see if aBO ctrlspace

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.470
exception.class is coming

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.630
back all we have done is thrown a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.119
sequel exception and the read method on

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.100
the DAO is called and we're making

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.200
sure that the BO wraps it up inside

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.680
a business exception and it throws it back

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.670
let's run this and everything is green.
