00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
In this lecture, I will introduce you to

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.339
power mock by the end of it you will

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.010
learn what power mock is why we need it

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.690
and how it works. Mockito no doubt is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.940
one of the most used mocking frameworks

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.369
in the java space but it does come with

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.590
certain limitations where it can't mock

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.439
out the edge cases like static methods

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.590
final methods, constructors private

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.980
methods enum etc.. The piece of our

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.929
code which uses these will become

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.320
untestable these are not frequently used

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.690
but once in a while we do how to mock

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.480
these out that is where power mock comes

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.530
into picture and it saves us.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.719
Power mock instead of reinventing the wheel it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.510
reuses what is already there in mocking

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.579
frameworks like Mockito and easy mock

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.309
and extends them so there is a flavor

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.070
of power mock which is for the mockito

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.690
users and there is a flavor of power

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.090
mocks for the easy mock users,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.829
easy mock is another popular mocking

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.379
frameworks you can download either

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.869
version as we will be doing in the next

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.799
few lectures. The reason why mockito and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.710
easy mock cannot do what power mock

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.110
achieves because they use proxy pattern to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.500
mock out classes or objects that is if

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.610
class A uses class B and then we are

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.860
testing Class A we mock out class B

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.369
mockito uses a proxy pattern to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.329
implement or inherit Class B at runtime

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.770
dynamically if you mark Class B as final

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.530
then we cannot mock out Class B or

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.049
mockito cannot mock out Class B once

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.759
the class is marked final it cannot be

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.310
inherited and Class A cannot use the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.770
mocked out object that is where pwermock

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.200
comes in and it uses bytecode

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.570
manipulation and a custom class loader

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.820
to achieve what other mocking frameworks

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.409
cannot do but since power mock reuses

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.689
what is already there the syntax for

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.640
stubbing and setting expectations is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.740
very similar so the learning curve for

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.239
you since you have already mastered

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.780
mockito it is very less as the methods

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.700
to stub out and set expectations are

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.209
same and this changed slightly when you

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.280
are mokking out static methods private

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.370
methods etc even when you are verifying

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.069
the same old verify methods from mockito

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.830
it will be seeing the same syntax in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.870
action you will learn all this and more

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.930
in the next few lectures so to summarize

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.550
power mock is a mocking framework that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.290
allows you to mock out things that you

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.270
cannot mock using mockito to another

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.790
mocking frameworks the power of power mock

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.060
comes from its bytecode manipulation and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.989
custom class loader syntax of power mock

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.820
is very similar to what you have learned

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.680
from mockito and there are a few new

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.180
methods that you will be learning
