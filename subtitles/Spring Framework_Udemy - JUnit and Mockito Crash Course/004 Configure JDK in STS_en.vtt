When you launch the spring tool suit, by default, it picks up a JDK that it will use to compile and

1
00:06.690 --> 00:12.210
run our Java applications, it will look at the environment variables and it will automatically pick

2
00:12.210 --> 00:19.410
up JDK to ensure that it is using the right JDK or Java go to the spring tool suite the very first menu item.

3
00:20.470 --> 00:21.670
Go to preferences.

4
00:22.790 --> 00:25.320
And search for jre.

5
00:26.120 --> 00:31.460
Click on installed jre's that will show you which Jre or Jdk it is using.

6
00:31.730 --> 00:35.750
Make sure that this is pointing to your JDK folder.

7
00:37.100 --> 00:43.250
If you edit it, you can see that it is pointing to my JDK folder sometimes on Windows machines, it

8
00:43.250 --> 00:47.020
will pick up a jre which comes by default with Windows.

9
00:47.030 --> 00:54.830
If that is the case, if it is pointing to a jre instead of a JDK folder, delete that entry and add

10
00:55.040 --> 00:55.700
an entry.

11
00:56.390 --> 01:01.730
Click on Standard VM, say next and point it to your JDK home folder.

12
01:01.730 --> 01:09.500
There should be only one entry which points to your Java installations or Jdk's home folder and not

13
01:09.500 --> 01:11.120
the jre home folder.

14
01:11.720 --> 01:17.660
If you leave it to point to the jre home folder when you use tools like Maven to build your projects, you will

15
01:17.660 --> 01:23.750
have an issue because those tools need JDK to compile your classes, not just the jre

16
01:24.080 --> 01:29.210
So ensure that you have an entry that points to your JDK folder.
