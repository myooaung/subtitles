00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
In this lecture, we will be testing the

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.259
cancel order method on the orderBOimpl

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.440
class a cancel order method takes

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.469
the order ID and then it calls the DAO

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.110
read method to get the order takes the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.849
order updates the status of it to cancelled

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.060
and then it sends that order to the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.910
update method on the DAO so it calls

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.890
two methods on the DAO which we need to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.320
stub and said that expectations for

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
we'll go back to our test class will be

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.789
adding a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.769
new test method here for the cancel

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.960
order so in here lets use the junit test

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.239
annotation publicvoid cancel order

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.120
underscore should underscore

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.059
cancel the order in here the first

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.920
thing will be doing is stubbing it out when

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.789
DAO.read method is called give it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
an order id123. then return new

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.100
order we are stubbing out the read to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.260
return a new order object back

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.479
DAO.read throws a sequel exception hit ctrl one

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.909
on it add throws declaration for the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.180
sequel exception extract this order by

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.860
selecting is hitting control one

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.000
extracted to local variable let's call it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.100
order instead of value

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.350
the second thing we're going to stubout

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.890
is the update method when DAO.update

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.110
is called this order object which we

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.659
have already here dot then return an

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.520
integer value of one so we have the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.000
expectations set here now we can call

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.369
the BO.cancel order pass-it 123

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.790
hit control 1 add a throws class for our

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.219
BOexception assign this to a local

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.979
variable assign statement to a new local

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.929
variable call it a result we can assert

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.440
this result assert true

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.360
result and also we can verify to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.250
see if the DAO.read 123 is

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.880
called and also we can verify

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.450
DAO.update order is called we have

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.910
stubbed out setup the expectations called

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.270
the method under test and then we have

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.630
asserted and verified the results let's run it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.770
and see if we have done a good job right

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.260
click run as junit test

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.170
so everything is green so you have done a great

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.510
job of setting the expectation so the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.600
same order which we are reading

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.130
we have stubbed when reading we are

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.650
using that and we are updating we are

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.710
also making sure that that same object

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.650
is being used and the update is called

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.780
as and also we have asserted that the result

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.570
that comes back from cancel order is

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.080
true.
