00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
In this lecture, we will create the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.250
resources folder and we will copy the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.890
application context dot XML file which

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.880
is the configuration file for spring to

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.799
do that let's first create the source

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.830
folder right click on the project say new

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.960
source folder folder name SRC / main /

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.570
resources this is a maven convention we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.580
put all our resources like XML

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.189
properties under this resources folder

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.420
hit finished now go back to what you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.040
have downloaded in the previous lecture

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.380
the spring j-unit files you can also

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.480
download this zip file from the contents

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.940
of this lecture once you unzip it has

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.160
the form dot XML which you have used in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.719
the previous lecture and it also has a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.899
application hifen context a dot XML

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.199
copy that control C go back to eclipse

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.870
paste it under SRC main resources it has

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.329
the bare bones as the beans element

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.119
beans is the root element of every

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.670
spring configuration file inside it will

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.170
declare all our java objects as beans it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.500
has all the namespaces that we need some

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.380
spring the spring beans namespace spring

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.650
context in space etc we'll use this in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.900
the next lecture when we do dependency

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.420
injection for our services class
