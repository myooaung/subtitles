In this lecture, we'll create the test and the mock objects that are required to do that right, click

1
00:05.490 --> 00:12.330
on the coupon Servelet  say  new, go to other search for Junit and you  will find Junit  test case

2
00:12.330 --> 00:12.870
select it .

3
00:12.870 --> 00:13.800
Click on next.

4
00:15.110 --> 00:20.870
The package is fine, the name is Coupon servelet  Test, it uses the class name, the Servelet  name, and

5
00:20.870 --> 00:23.770
then appends  with it  a test that is also fine, click on next.

6
00:24.680 --> 00:27.470
We want to test the do get and do post optionally.

7
00:27.470 --> 00:32.180
If you want to select them, you can go ahead and select them and it will generate the test methods

8
00:32.180 --> 00:33.440
for those two.

9
00:34.400 --> 00:40.190
We can change the methods later, for now, let's start by mocking  out to test these two methods, we

10
00:40.190 --> 00:42.460
need to mock out three things.

11
00:42.470 --> 00:46.070
If you go to the Servelet, we have this request and response that we need to mock out 

12
00:46.070 --> 00:47.630
These are provided by Tomcat.

13
00:48.620 --> 00:55.520
When we ran the integration tests and also this request,  dispatcher which dispatches it to the request

14
00:55.520 --> 00:58.430
Or  the Jsp page go back to the test.

15
00:58.620 --> 01:04.150
The easiest way to do this mocking is define the fields on this test.

16
01:04.160 --> 01:05.810
Private HTTP 

17
01:06.440 --> 01:08.780
Servlet request is the first one.

18
01:12.090 --> 01:23.070
Call it a request, similarly, private HTTP  servlet response is the next guy, call it response,

19
01:23.640 --> 01:27.270
private request dispatcher.

20
01:28.350 --> 01:31.980
Call it request dispatcher.

21
01:34.100 --> 01:40.610
Mock this out, so just mark this with @ Mark annotations, that is all that is required to mock them

22
01:40.610 --> 01:43.400
from or Dot Mockito.

23
01:43.880 --> 01:44.570
Copy that.

24
01:44.840 --> 01:47.230
Paste it  on the other two as well.

25
01:47.660 --> 01:50.240
So there are different ways for this to be mocked.

26
01:50.240 --> 01:55.760
Once you marked  with these annotations, you  will have to invoke the mockito dot in it mocks method .

27
01:55.940 --> 02:03.230
Or you can use a runner that comes from mockito on this class instead of using the default Junit test runner ,

28
02:03.380 --> 02:10.250
we use @ run with annotation within brackets, Mockito.

29
02:12.300 --> 02:19.920
Junit runner , make sure this is from Org dot  Mockito Dot junit that is the package select it  Dot class.

30
02:20.520 --> 02:24.030
Once we do this we don't have to invoke any methods for this.

31
02:24.030 --> 02:26.940
Mock's to be stubbed  out or for these mocks to be mocked out 

32
02:27.510 --> 02:34.290
This runner automatically will scan through all those fields that are marked with at mock annotation

33
02:34.500 --> 02:37.180
and it will mock those objects out for us.

34
02:37.770 --> 02:42.770
So in this lecture you have  created the test and you have  mocked everything that is required for our application.

35
02:43.050 --> 02:49.200
If you run this test right click   do a run as  junit  test, right now we have two tests and those two

36
02:49.200 --> 02:55.530
tests fail because we are saying fail, not yet implemented, will implement them one at a time in the

37
02:55.530 --> 02:56.210
next lecture.
