00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
In this lecture we will test the cancel

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.950
order method for the negative scenario

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.680
wherein the update method should return

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.320
0 value and then the result that comes

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.420
back from cancel order should be false

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.360
instead of true let's do that in easy

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.420
steps we can copy entire test case

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.760
because we have already stubbed out what

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.580
we need in here just need to change some

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.849
values cancel order should not cancel the order

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.180
so change the method to that and in here when

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.120
we are stubbing out the update method on

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.780
the DAO change the value from 1 to 0 that's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.180
all we need to do and here instead of assert

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.989
true we will do assert false on the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.510
Junit library everything else remains the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.910
same still the read method should be called

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.620
update method should be called we have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.649
to verify for that the right click or

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.109
we can go to the play button run as

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.129
junit test everything is green so we

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.530
have simply tested or cancel order

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.840
method for the negative scenario by

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
changing the return value from 1 to 0 and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.439
 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.439
asserting for falls instead of true.
