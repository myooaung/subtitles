00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
So far we have created the data access

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.010
layer for our ticketing project in this

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.840
lecture we will create the services

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.759
layer or the business logic layer which

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.330
will use the ticketing BAO to do that

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.660
right click on the SRC main java say new

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.039
interface always go to interfaces ticket

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
DAO ticket service not the DAO and the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.019
package will be

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
com.bharath.junit.spring.service instead of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.030
DAO it will be serviced hit finish

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.129
in here will have one method which will

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.920
return an int it is the bite ticket

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.879
method it will take two parameters

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.430
string passenger name comma string phone

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
and that's it that's the only method in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.090
this service to create the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.500
implementation again right click on the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
package say new class ticket service

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.590
impl click on the Add button search

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.750
for the ticket service interface we have

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.400
created select it click ok hit finish will

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
have the overwritten method

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
maximize this point the cursor to this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.740
to do line hit ctrl d to delete it and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.170
the first step here is to add a field

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.729
you can do it in different ways the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.409
simplest is to just directly add it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.759
ticket DAO DAO so we are going to use

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.670
the dao in the service in our business

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.030
logic layer hit control one import the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.570
dao and in the buy ticket method it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.119
very simple dao dot create ticket

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.790
semicolon hit control one on this create

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.250
local variable ticket select that we got

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.540
the ticket is equal to new ticket this is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.390
the dto we have created the ticket

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.090
ticket dot set

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.110
passenger name to this parameter to get

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.060
dot set phone to the phone parameter

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.780
that is passed to this method you can

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.090
simply take this entire line DAO dot

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.000
create ticket control x delete the semicolon

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.430
instead of returning zero we

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.069
can directly return that and we are all

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.670
set so our service simply takes two

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.890
parameters instantiates or it does not

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.569
instantiate the DAO so far we have only

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.819
declared that DAO at the field level

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.700
will be using spring in lectures later

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.480
on to inject this DAO dependency so to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.239
follow encapsulation let's hit control

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.959
one on this dao and generate the Getter

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.280
setters hit ok and also this field is

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.209
private now.
