00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
In this lecture, we will create a simple

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.830
calculator project will create a

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.960
calculator class that does addition of

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.179
two numbers and then we will unittest it

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.030
go to the Eclipse file menu say new go

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.760
to other type in maven and you will see

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.930
the maven results that are available

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.480
select the maven project click on next

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.760
leave the default options as is on the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.699
first screen click on next again it will

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.230
be taken to a screen where you see the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.540
different archetypes that are available

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.989
from maven the m2e plug-in provides all

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.870
of them for us each of these architects

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.390
creates a certain folder structures that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.670
maven requires for a standalone project

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.440
for a standalone java project you should

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.500
select maven archetype pick start if

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.969
it was a web application project you can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.010
scroll down and select this maven

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
archetypes web app select the maven

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.609
archetype quick start click Next here

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.330
we enter our group ID a group ID is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.390
unique for a module in our application

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.689
or a team within which we can put all

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.630
our projects when the projects get saved

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.820
as artifacts to the repository they are

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.250
saved under this unique group IDs like

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.310
package in case of Java classes let's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.450
give it com.bharath.maven.calculator

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.970
the artifact ID is the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.610
project name so let's call it calculator

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.509
you can leave the version as is or you can

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.729
enter whatever version you want the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.259
package name as you can see it has

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.799
already taken the group ID dot the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.820
project name or the artifacts ID as the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.829
package name for our projects you can

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.899
change it if you want to but I am going

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.740
to leave it as is click finish and the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.170
eclipse m2e plugin has generated the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.509
entire project structure which we need

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.799
for maven to work src main java where

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.259
our source code will go and SRC test

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.720
java where are our test classes the unit

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.500
test class

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.350
go and it also has a target directory

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.390
where it compiles deploys and does all

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.360
that under the target directory compiles

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.550
creates java files war files test

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.710
reports and all that under the target

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.220
directory and also the pom dot XML

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.500
which is the heart of maven this is the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.320
configuration file all that information

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.630
which we have entered on the wizard has

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.030
gone into this file as project

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.850
coordinates it also has certain

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.520
properties for encoding and by default

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.330
it adds a junit dependency unfortunately

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.220
it still adds the old version of j unit

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.010
if you are lucky and if you see 4.4 here

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.530
leave it as is if not if you go to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.360
google search for j unit maven

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.450
dependency click on the first link this

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.830
is the open-source maven repository

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.350
where all the open-source jars are

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.989
located just call it down a little on

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.620
the first tab under the maven tab you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.989
can grab this entire dependency select a

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.170
control C go back to eclipse replace

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.480
this entire dependency here inside the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.370
dependency section with what you have

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.840
copied so 4.4 is the current version we

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.299
have the latest j unit by default if you

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.150
see it also generates a class called ab

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.480
dot java and also a test for it under

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.730
the test folder i am going to delete

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.980
these two in the next lecture will be

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.660
creating a calculator from scratch and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.970
we will be testing it from scratch so in

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.590
this lecture we have created a simple

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.380
eclipse maven project with all the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.269
project structure we need and there is a

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.670
pom dot XML we have updated this form

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.310
dot XML with the current version of in

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.970
junit.
