00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
In the previous lecture we have created

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.009
the DAO layer for our order processing

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.109
service in this one will create the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.980
business logic layer to do that right

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.299
click on the SRC folder say new interface

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.710
give it a name OrderBO and change the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.439
package name from DAO to BO

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.550
business object hit finish in here we'll be

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.529
adding three simple matters

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.900
starting with place order method which

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.040
returns a boolean place order takes

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.360
the order object the order DTO to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.190
import it  hit control 1 point the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.000
cursor on the order hit control 1 set

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
the first option to import the order the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.610
second method is the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.680
cancel order method again boolean

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.559
cancel order it takes the order ID int

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.320
ID and finally a boolean delete order

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.630
method which takes int ide as well.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.360
All these methods through a business

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.090
extraction back instead off throwing a sequel

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.680
exception of some other exceptions they

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.509
will wrap up those exceptions in a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.939
exception which is our own custom

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.740
exception so hit control 1 right now

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.270
this BO exception doesn't even exist

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.750
select the first option which says create

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.110
class BO exception and change the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.299
package name from BO to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.340
BO.exception

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.820
It implements or it inherits from the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.280
superclass java.LAN.exception so our

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.340
exception is a checked exception do the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790
same thing will change this exception

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.770
BOexception as required later on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.290
leave it as it is for now go back to the orderBO

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.229
take this throws BO exception

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.380
copy it and paste it for the other two

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.770
methods as well. Save your file

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.040
we have the interface ready now right  click on

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.580
the BO to implement it say new class

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.580
order BOimpl and interfaces

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.570
section click on add search for orderBO

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.310
select it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.270
interface click on OK hit finish we

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.340
have all the three methods and the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.980
skeletons ready with the override annotation

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.210
read the to do comment appointing the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.360
mouse curser on it hit ctrl D do the same thing

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.190
for the other two methods as well as we will

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.910
be implementing these methods will

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.030
declare the DAO as a global objects so

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.330
the orderDAO the interface

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.320
our BOimpl let's rename this to impl

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.860
imple hit control 1 rename

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.040
compilation unit to orderBOimpl and this

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.590
guy the orderBOimpl depends on the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.370
order DAO hit control 1 create getters

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.190
and setters so that we can inject this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.459
DAO from our test and also we can

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.800
inject this DAO from any other layer

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.810
BO layer typically we use

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.360
frameworks like spring to do this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.040
injection now to place an order in here

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.840
we will say DAO.createorder and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.570
pass the order to it.This method

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.330
through a sequel exception we have to hit

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
control 1 surround with tricache block

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.760
delete this to do clock again by

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.980
hitting ctrl D instead of doing a

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.600
e.printStacktrace will say throw new

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.120
BO exception and we'll wrap this sequel

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.920
exception inside this new exception save

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.910
right now

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.050
our BO exception doesn't have a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.630
constructor which accepts this e so

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.630
hit control 1 and select the second

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.280
option which says create a constructor

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.570
double click now we have a constructor in  here

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.180
inside these constructor let's call

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.820
super and passing the E  that will call the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.710
exception classes constructor here to get

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.270
it out this warning is complaining about

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.490
the serialization version ID hit control 1

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.200
for the quick fix

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.690
add default serialization version id

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.290
remove these useless comments go back to

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.280
orderBOimpl assigned this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.230
DAO.create to a local variable by

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.210
hitting control 1 assigned statement

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.030
new local variable lets call it result if

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.200
result is equal to 0 we are going to

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.910
return false otherwise at the end of it

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.920
we're going to return a true a very

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.250
simpleplaceorder method similarly let

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.820
implemented cancel order method for cancel

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.100
order we have two calls that we need to make

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.730
the DAO.leadfirst by passing in the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.870
order ID once we read it let's assign

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.880
this to a local variable assign statement to

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.710
a local variable by hitting control 1

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.600
will get the order back again we need to

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.400
handle the sequel exception by

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.980
surrounding it with tricache take this

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.070
line from the placeorder method which

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.740
throws a new BOexception paste it in

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.400
here by replacing those two lines now

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.400
will call the DAO.update and will

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.460
pass the order object to it but in between

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.720
those two lines we will say order.set

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.480
status to cancel very crude way of

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.520
handling a cancellation but and again to

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.810
keep things simple

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.510
we are using status as cancel and then

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.300
we call the DAO.update

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.350
Assign this to a local variable again and call

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:33.790
it result gift result is equal to 0 we

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.790
return a

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.220
false else we return true at the end

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.000
again this is not a great realtime

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.610
logic in here but to demonstrate the use

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.920
of morking and everything which makes it

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.520
a lot more easier.Finally the delete

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.140
method will call DAO.delete by

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.810
passing the ID same logic again assign

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.530
it to a new local variable call it result

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:16.190
handle the exception surround with  tricache

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.770
take this throw new BOexception replace these two

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:26.090
lines here if result ok, we are at a

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.280
point where we can extract out result

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.360
is block is if block return false.There is no big

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.100
course

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.350
so lets leave it as is instead of refactoring it

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.620
that's it we are all set we have

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.530
implemented the three different methods the

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.560
Place order, Tocancel order and Delete

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.290
order matters will start unit testing this

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.050
by starting this place order

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.010
in the next lecture.
