ignore CG lib and objeneses if

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.400
required we will add them later on to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.159

right click on the project say new

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.159
folder Lib folder create a lib folder

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.220
that is where we copy our libraries paste

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.560
the three jobs you have copied that is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.530

mock 4 mockito it's important that you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.619
include the mockito all that you have

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.020
downloaded from power mock because the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.970
version which you would have downloaded

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.470
directly from the mockitos website

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.960
could be different and power mock might

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.590
need this version to work the current

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.600
that we need to add these jars to the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.100
classpath so right click on the project

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.149
