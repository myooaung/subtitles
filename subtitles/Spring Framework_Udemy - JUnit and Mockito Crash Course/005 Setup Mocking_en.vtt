In this lecture, we'll set up the mock environment that is required to write unit tests for our user

1
00:06.280 --> 00:12.850
account controller, the user account controller uses user account repository and interest repository.

2
00:13.030 --> 00:16.000
We need to mock those two to do that.

3
00:16.000 --> 00:18.190
Go to source test Java.

4
00:18.490 --> 00:23.380
Open up the class that is in there, the test class that is marked with spring boot test annotation.

5
00:24.560 --> 00:33.020
And inject the user account repository or Mock the user account repository, define it first user account

6
00:33.200 --> 00:42.650
repository mark it with @ mock annotation from org mockito that will create a mock object of this type.

7
00:42.920 --> 00:53.930
Next interest repository is the second guy call it interest repository mark it with @ mock annotation

8
00:53.930 --> 00:54.710
as well.

9
00:55.520 --> 01:02.390
Then we want to inject these mocks into the user account controller object, which we can then use for

10
01:02.390 --> 01:03.200
our testing.

11
01:04.100 --> 01:11.690
So define a user controller user account controller instance.

12
01:11.990 --> 01:16.160
That Guy right there, call it controller, because that's the only controller we'll be testing and we

13
01:16.160 --> 01:17.500
mark this with @

14
01:17.510 --> 01:23.060
Inject mocks annotation from Mockito, so Mockito will do all the magic for us.

15
01:23.270 --> 01:29.570
It will create the mock objects for these two and it will inject those mocks into this user account controller

16
01:29.750 --> 01:33.890
instead of the actual objects getting created and injected.

17
01:34.100 --> 01:39.740
We can then use the mockito when verify, etc. on this mocks starting the next lecture.
