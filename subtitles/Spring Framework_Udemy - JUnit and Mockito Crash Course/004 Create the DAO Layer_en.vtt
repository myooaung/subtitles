00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
In this lecture data access object layer  for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.230
our ticketing service project to do that

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.059
let's refer to the usecase that we have

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.269
will be creating a ticketing dao

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.360
interface and it will be implemented by

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.400
the ticketing dao impl which will

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.130
have the create method that it overrides

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.710
from the interface it will take a ticket

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.949
beam as its parameter so let's do that

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.920
right click on the SRC main Java let's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.460
create a new package name it com dot

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.320
bharath dot J unit dot spring dot dao finish

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.070
now right click on this package say new

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.230
interface always go to interfaces let's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.480
call it ticketing or ticket dao the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.399
package is the spring DAO package hit

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.860
finish will add one simple method here called

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.100
create ticket and this should take a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.549
type of ticket this ticket doesn't even

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.060
exist yet so we will create one will act

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.670
as if it exists and let eclipse do some

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.090
work hit ctrl one here and choose create

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.329
class let's change the package from

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.810
spring DAO to spring beam spring dao

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.079
dot DPO or you can take the dao portion

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.180
out you can say spring DTO that's even

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
better hit finish so we have the ticket

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.439
let's add two properties here string

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.909
passenger name string is phone number

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.930
phone add getters and setters by hitting

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.310
control 1 create getter setter hit ok in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.979
control one on the phone create getter

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.080
setters hit ok

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.600
control shift F to format it back to the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.120
ticketing dao you save it error should

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.510
go away let's created the ticket Impl

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.340
now ticket dao impl right click on the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.490
dao package a new class ticket DAO

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.490
impl and go to the interfaces

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.640
click on add search for ticket dao

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.480
select that interface okay click finish

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.900
we have the default method generated

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.560
here hit ctrl d on this to do line so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.250
that it's delete so we are returning

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.070
zero let's return one we are going to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.290
keep this implementation very simple

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.090
because we are going to mock this out it

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.680
doesn't matter we could have just tested

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.870
with the ticket dao as well without even

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.350
implementing the ticket do impl but we

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.390
have the minimum implementation here and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.630
we are all set to implement the service

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.400
layer in the next lecture.
