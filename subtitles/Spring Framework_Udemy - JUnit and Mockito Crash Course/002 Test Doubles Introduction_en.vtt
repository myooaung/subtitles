00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
In this lecture, I will introduce you to test doubles

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.720
you have been using test doubles  throughout the mockito sections unknownly

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.520
Test doubles are common patterns that are used across the unit testing frameworks

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
Gerard Meszaros was working on a book

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.560
to comeup with these common patterns

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.080
and he named these patterns test doubles

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.960
The  best way to understand test doubles is by looking at stunt doubles

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.320
from which they derive their name.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.200
The stunt double is a guy or a lady who acts as the main actor or the actoress

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.840
and they help comeup with great stunts and make a great movie.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.600
SImilarly test doubles allow us to mockout the actual objects, they act as a stunt double

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.120
and they allow us to write great unit test

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:10.520
So the five famous test double patterns are Dummy, stubs,mocks, fake and spies

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.440
We have been using the Dummy, stubs, mocks already

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.280
I will explain in detail what they are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.400
and also about fake and you will also implement a small test case that uses mockito spice later on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400
To summarize,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.080
test doubles are nothing but design patterns that have to do with unit testing frameworks

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.920
they derive their name from stunt doubles they act as if they are real objects but they do

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.440
only do what we ask them to do allowing us to write great unit test

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.000
and there are five test doubles will explore these in a little more in the next  few lecturers.
