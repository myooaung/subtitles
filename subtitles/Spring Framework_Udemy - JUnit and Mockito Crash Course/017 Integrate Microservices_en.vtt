This lecture will integrate the product service with the coupon service to do that, go into the product rest

1
00:06.470 --> 00:15.170
controller and within the create method, we will invoke the rest API exposed out by the coupon service.

2
00:15.530 --> 00:21.860
To do that, we need the coupon code in the request the user should send the coupon code to on the product

3
00:21.860 --> 00:23.530
and the product information comes in.

4
00:23.810 --> 00:30.310
He should also send a private string coupon code.

5
00:30.560 --> 00:34.440
We will use this coupon code to fetch the coupon details from the coupon service.

6
00:34.730 --> 00:39.410
Mark this with @ Transient from the javax dot

7
00:39.410 --> 00:46.070
Persistence because we don't want this to be saved to the database hit control one create getterrs and setters.

8
00:46.790 --> 00:49.520
This is only to handle the incoming request.

9
00:49.760 --> 00:55.640
Data in the incoming request will get the coupon code, will then use the coupon code inside the create

10
00:55.640 --> 01:02.330
method through rest template so spring offers rest template to make restful calls.

11
01:02.340 --> 01:17.060
its our restful client rest template call it rest template Mark this with @ auto wired annotation use

12
01:17.060 --> 01:26.720
that rest template inside the create method dot get for object is the method we can use and the

13
01:26.720 --> 01:27.650
u r l. we will

14
01:29.140 --> 01:33.100
Copy the u r l in a second, the response type is coupon.

15
01:35.370 --> 01:41.700
dot class, this class doesn't exist in this project, we can easily create it, hit control one

16
01:42.030 --> 01:48.560
create class coupon, put it in a package called dto  it's just a simple data transfer object.

17
01:48.570 --> 01:51.180
It's not an entity in this project or a model object.

18
01:51.990 --> 01:59.730
hit finish. Double-Click to minimize go to the coupon service go to the models, open up the coupon dot Java 

19
02:00.330 --> 02:01.980
copy all the way from the id.

20
02:01.980 --> 02:09.960
We don't need any of that JPA annotations all the way from id to the last method come back paste it

21
02:10.110 --> 02:11.490
inside this class.

22
02:11.880 --> 02:19.350
So when we get a response from the coupon service, we are de serializing that into the coupon class.

23
02:19.350 --> 02:20.880
That is what is happening here.

24
02:21.390 --> 02:26.040
hit control one assigned statement to a new local variable call it coupon.

25
02:26.850 --> 02:32.550
And we get the coupon back, as I said, will fill in the u r l in a second before the repository sale

26
02:32.550 --> 02:33.060
happens.

27
02:33.060 --> 02:39.120
We want to deduct the products price from whatever discount this coupon has to offer.

28
02:39.420 --> 02:44.940
So product dot set the price of the product to product.

29
02:46.140 --> 02:49.260
dot get price dot difference.

30
02:49.260 --> 02:53.610
There is a difference method on the big decimal.

31
02:54.210 --> 02:56.250
Let's get that dot.

32
02:58.210 --> 03:08.770
Subtract, subtract, pass in that coupon dot, get discount, a simple discount logic, we are fetching

33
03:08.770 --> 03:15.280
the coupon information, deducting that coupon discount, whatever it offers from the actual price up

34
03:15.280 --> 03:19.000
the product and setting it on the product before it is save to the database.

35
03:19.660 --> 03:21.040
Now to the u r l portion.

36
03:21.460 --> 03:23.620
Grab the u r l from Posman.

37
03:25.730 --> 03:32.330
To get the coupon details come back, we can paste it here and then we will extract it into configuration.

38
03:33.140 --> 03:40.870
So coupons forward slash plus whatever coupon id  comes  in the incoming request.

39
03:40.880 --> 03:41.900
So product dot

40
03:44.230 --> 03:46.090
Get coupon code.

41
03:47.680 --> 03:52.780
So that completes it you can grab this entire u r l  copy it.

42
03:54.280 --> 03:58.360
Go to the application DOT properties, file on your product service.

43
03:59.510 --> 04:05.930
We are moving it to a property file instead of hard coding it here right after this property, introduce

44
04:05.930 --> 04:11.770
a new property called Coupon dot or Coupon Service dot

45
04:11.860 --> 04:13.430
u r l  you can name it.

46
04:13.430 --> 04:16.400
Whatever you want is equal to paste the u r l no need 

47
04:16.400 --> 04:17.440
of double quotes

48
04:17.450 --> 04:18.080
Take that out.

49
04:21.120 --> 04:27.210
Now, copy this property, name coupon service dot u r l go back to the product rest controller and we will

50
04:27.210 --> 04:27.930
inject it.

51
04:29.250 --> 04:31.560
Private string.

52
04:32.860 --> 04:36.760
You can call it coupon service, u r l.

53
04:39.280 --> 04:43.780
Mark this with @ value annotation within brackets.

54
04:45.440 --> 04:52.520
Dollar symbol Angler Brackett's paste the property name, so that is how we inject values from a property

55
04:52.560 --> 04:55.370
file, use this coupon u r l  here

56
04:56.790 --> 05:05.340
Instead of hard coding it save it, one last thing, go to the application class of product service,

57
05:05.340 --> 05:10.370
the product service application, we need to create a bean of type rest template.

58
05:10.830 --> 05:19.530
So here you'll simply create a method that will return the rest template bean call it rest template.

59
05:22.420 --> 05:27.620
And return new rest template.

60
05:27.940 --> 05:34.280
Mark this with @ bean annotations so that at run time will have the rest template bean so in this lecture,

61
05:34.330 --> 05:40.390
have done a lot of work to integrate the product service with the coupon service.

62
05:40.690 --> 05:43.930
You have started it by using the rest template.

63
05:43.930 --> 05:49.450
You have invoked the get for object method and then you are using the u r l to the coupon service.

64
05:49.450 --> 05:52.660
You are appending the coupon code that comes in the incoming request.

65
05:52.670 --> 05:58.600
We have added the coupon code to the product entity and then we are retrieving it, getting the coupon,

66
05:58.600 --> 06:00.550
applying the discount.
