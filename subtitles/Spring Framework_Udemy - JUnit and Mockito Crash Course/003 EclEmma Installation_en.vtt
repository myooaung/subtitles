we have a eclipse back up once we choose

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.720
the workspace we should have the plug-in

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.659
installed and we should be good to go

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.880
we'll check that in a second if you go

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.689
