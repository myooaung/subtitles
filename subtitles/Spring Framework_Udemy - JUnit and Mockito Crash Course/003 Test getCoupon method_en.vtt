The next method under test is the get coupon method, this guy takes a coupon code and returns a coupon

1
00:06.960 --> 00:08.420
back by invoking repo dot

2
00:08.430 --> 00:14.430
find by code we need to mock this find by code, call on the repo, go back to the test class,

3
00:15.900 --> 00:17.310
create a new test method.

4
00:17.340 --> 00:20.760
Let me add some lines and push it up so that you can see it clearly.

5
00:22.250 --> 00:30.200
The new test method is public void test get coupon.

6
00:34.910 --> 00:43.280
Mark it with @ test annotation controller dot get coupon is the method, and this guy takes a coupon

7
00:43.280 --> 00:43.680
code.

8
00:43.700 --> 00:46.340
We have a code already as a constant supersale

9
00:46.340 --> 00:53.930
is the code name hit control one assign statement to a new local variable call it Coupon Response.

10
00:55.280 --> 01:04.550
One, at the end of it, a response that comes back to mock the call when repo dot

11
01:05.760 --> 01:11.370
Find by code is invoked passing in the supersale

12
01:12.880 --> 01:22.600
dot then return a new coupon back, we are going to extract this to a variable and we will set some fields

13
01:23.050 --> 01:29.320
on it, hit control one on the new coupon extract to a local variable call this coupon.

14
01:30.550 --> 01:37.780
Coupon dot set id one, two, three, you can set anything one, two, three, long L coupon

15
01:37.780 --> 01:41.170
dot set code is super sale.

16
01:43.530 --> 01:49.580
It can also said the discount, if you want to, so that you can assert on that later, coupon

17
01:49.600 --> 01:53.740
dot set, expiry date if you want, you can do that.

18
01:53.760 --> 02:03.720
And finally, that discount is new big decimal, say, 10 percent discount or ten dollar discount.

19
02:05.370 --> 02:13.460
So once this is invoked, we get a coupon response back, we need to first verify if the repo dot find

20
02:13.470 --> 02:15.020
by code method is being invoked.

21
02:15.030 --> 02:16.830
So use the static, verify.

22
02:17.800 --> 02:27.040
Repo outside the brackets, dot find by code with Supersale is being invoked or not.

23
02:28.180 --> 02:35.290
Next, you can do the assertions assert not null the coupon response that is coming back and you can

24
02:35.290 --> 02:39.160
add as many number of assertions you want as assert equals.

25
02:39.520 --> 02:42.810
The expected is, say the discount.

26
02:42.820 --> 02:44.080
Let's assert on the discount.

27
02:44.740 --> 02:47.080
New big decimal.

28
02:49.610 --> 02:58.430
Ten is what is being expected and the actual comes back on the coupon response dot get discount.

29
03:00.950 --> 03:06.410
So we have stubbed out or we have mocked the call, then you have invoked the method under test, we

30
03:06.410 --> 03:11.540
are verifying that the mocked objects find by code is being invoked.

31
03:11.550 --> 03:16.780
And also we are doing the assertions on the response that comes back right

32
03:16.780 --> 03:23.750
click run as if you don't see those configurations go to run configurations and just run by default,

33
03:24.380 --> 03:25.750
your test will be selected.

34
03:25.760 --> 03:29.690
So simply hit run and that will run all the tests for you.

35
03:29.690 --> 03:32.870
Both the test create and test get coupon.

36
03:35.470 --> 03:40.720
And let's see if we have any issues, everything is green, so both the tests have successfully passed,

37
03:40.720 --> 03:43.960
meaning the code is working as expected.
