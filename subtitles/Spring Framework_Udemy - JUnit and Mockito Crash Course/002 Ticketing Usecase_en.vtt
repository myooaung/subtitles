00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
In this lecture , I will introduce you to the very simple usecase

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.520
that we will be using to demostrate the power of powermock

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.000
will be developing a useradmin service that allows us to create end users

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.840
so will have a userDAO class

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880
which will use a IDGenerator class.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.000
This IDGenerator class is a final class we don't want anybody else to inherit from this class we want to use what is there in that class.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.840
The userDAO will have a create method

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.080
that takes a userDTO as the input parameter

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.480
and it uses the generateid method that is inside the id generator

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.400
class and this method is a static method

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.080
it gets the user id everytime we are trying to create the user

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.040
we generate a new userid, then take the values inside the user object along

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.040
with the id we are going to persist everything to the database,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.000
but for the sakes of this demo and usecase we are not going to do all the database

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.640
saving and all that we are going to create a simple userobject

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.420
and will use the generateid method and will be mocking that later on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.660
to test our userDAO in isolation.
