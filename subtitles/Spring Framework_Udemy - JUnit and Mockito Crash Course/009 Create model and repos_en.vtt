00:00.150 --> 00:07.170
The next step is to create the model and the repository classes to do that go to sts  go to the

1
00:07.170 --> 00:07.890
package, right

2
00:07.890 --> 00:14.580
Click on it, new class, call it Coupon, and that will go into the package called springcloud.

3
00:14.580 --> 00:17.310
model,finish.

4
00:18.030 --> 00:20.700
This model class represents the database table for us.

5
00:21.180 --> 00:26.930
The coupon table has id code discount and a expiry date.

6
00:27.600 --> 00:31.860
So go back to the sts and type in those fields.

7
00:31.860 --> 00:39.120
Private long id private string the coupon code private.

8
00:39.870 --> 00:42.990
We can use a decimal a int a big decimal.

9
00:43.170 --> 00:48.300
So big decimal is preferred because in the database the discount is of type decimal.

10
00:48.600 --> 00:56.130
So we will use big decimal discount it control one import decimal from Java dot math package.

11
00:56.880 --> 01:01.530
Private string exp date is the last field.

12
01:03.690 --> 01:11.790
Select all those fields go to source generate getters and setters to select all after expiry date is where I want

13
01:11.790 --> 01:13.890
those formatted.

14
01:14.820 --> 01:15.540
Scroll up.

15
01:17.710 --> 01:20.500
The ID field should be ID, not I.

16
01:20.830 --> 01:26.110
So let me take out that getter setters, save it,hit control one, generate the getters and setters

17
01:26.110 --> 01:30.220
one more time just for that field. Now i have all the fields correct.

18
01:30.700 --> 01:32.350
Now, this is just a Java bin.

19
01:33.400 --> 01:37.480
To make it a JPA entity, you need to mark this gui with.

20
01:37.480 --> 01:40.990
@entity annotation from javax.Persistence next mark the id with

21
01:40.990 --> 01:46.780
@ ID annotation from Javax.persistence and let's make this generation type

22
01:47.080 --> 01:53.510
identity so that it will be automatically incremented generation value within brackets.

23
01:53.530 --> 02:00.540
The strategy is equal to generation type.identity.

24
02:02.440 --> 02:06.740
So that tells that this is identity field in the database and it should be incremented.

25
02:07.360 --> 02:08.440
So we have the model class.

26
02:08.500 --> 02:13.600
The next step is to create spring data, data repository, which is super simple, right

27
02:13.600 --> 02:19.210
Click on the package, say new interface, call it coupon.

28
02:21.840 --> 02:29.760
Coupon repo, and this will go in to spring cloud.repos package. Hit add this interface should

29
02:29.760 --> 02:37.020
extend the JPA repository interface select that hit OK, finish.

30
02:38.960 --> 02:42.720
Here, we need to specify the generic types, this repository is for the model class.

31
02:42.790 --> 02:49.580
called coupon, that gui and the identity type is long

32
02:50.180 --> 02:55.500
Thats it, that is all that is required to perform current operations against the model coupon.

33
02:56.330 --> 03:01.430
So in this lecture, you have successfully created a coupon model with four fields on it, annotated

34
03:01.430 --> 03:03.470
with it, with @ enitity jpa annotations.

35
03:03.470 --> 03:08.840
And then you have also created a spring data repository which can be used to perform operations against

36
03:08.840 --> 03:11.090
the database table coupon.
