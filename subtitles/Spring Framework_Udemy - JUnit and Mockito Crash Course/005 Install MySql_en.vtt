00:00.450 --> 00:06.330
In this lecture, I will show you how to download and install the MySQL community server on your Windows

1
00:06.330 --> 00:13.040
box to do that, launch your Web browser, first download visual C++ on your machine.

2
00:13.470 --> 00:17.880
You need to install visual C++ for the MySQL to be installed.

3
00:17.910 --> 00:22.680
This is a prerequisite your most of the Windows machines will not have this installed.

4
00:23.070 --> 00:25.310
So go ahead and install this.

5
00:25.740 --> 00:27.750
So if it's a 64 bit machine, download this exe.

6
00:28.200 --> 00:32.270
If it is a 32 bit machine, you can download that. Once you download it.

7
00:32.280 --> 00:34.410
It's a super easy installation.

8
00:34.410 --> 00:36.540
Double click, it will open up, runit.

9
00:36.690 --> 00:38.070
It's a two step process.

10
00:38.070 --> 00:41.580
Finish that installation and then go back to Google again.

11
00:41.940 --> 00:50.130
Search for My SQL community server download, My SQL community server, download, click on the

12
00:50.130 --> 00:50.850
first link.

13
00:52.680 --> 00:56.470
Here you can install or download the MySQL installer for Windows.

14
00:56.490 --> 00:59.010
This is the community version, which is the open source version.

15
00:59.250 --> 01:03.240
You can download the Zip Archive or installer is the way to go.

16
01:03.450 --> 01:04.640
Go to the download page.

17
01:05.070 --> 01:06.320
You have two options here.

18
01:06.690 --> 01:11.310
The first option will download the minimum installer, which will later on pull the packages.

19
01:11.460 --> 01:16.440
Or you can download this 420 MB file, which will have all the packages that are required.

20
01:16.650 --> 01:21.630
When you run the first installer, once you download it, it will pull all the packages on the fly.

21
01:21.690 --> 01:22.860
You can choose either of them.

22
01:23.040 --> 01:25.730
I have the first version downloaded.

23
01:26.160 --> 01:33.090
I go here, launch the installer, click on Run that will launch the installation for us.

24
01:36.140 --> 01:41.990
So here you have a choice to pick what you want to install, if you want to just install the MySQL server

25
01:41.990 --> 01:44.330
and nothing else, then you can choose this.

26
01:44.540 --> 01:47.630
Or if you want all the developer tools, then you can choose this.

27
01:47.660 --> 01:51.680
There are several unnecessary things in this developer that will get installed.

28
01:51.680 --> 01:55.750
Some of them might even fail during the installation phase.

29
01:56.150 --> 01:58.760
So I'm going to choose the server only.

30
01:58.760 --> 02:05.480
That's good enough for us because we are going to use the MySQL client, the MySQL workbench, to connect

31
02:05.480 --> 02:06.770
to this MySQL server.

32
02:07.160 --> 02:08.000
Click on next.

33
02:09.430 --> 02:14.710
Leave the default, as it is, the location where it's going to be installed click on next again.

34
02:16.560 --> 02:21.840
So it says there are some warnings thats ok I have that location from earlier installation in your case, you

35
02:21.840 --> 02:24.050
might not see this say yes.

36
02:24.390 --> 02:27.640
So My SQL server is ready to be installed, execute.

37
02:28.320 --> 02:32.580
Now, it's going to pull that particular package from over the Internet.

38
02:33.630 --> 02:36.490
And it will do the installation for us.

39
02:36.510 --> 02:37.140
There we go.

40
02:37.210 --> 02:39.540
It's finished. Click on next.

41
02:39.690 --> 02:43.510
Next again, choose the defaults here for high availability.

42
02:43.530 --> 02:46.650
It has replication managers clustering and all that.

43
02:46.650 --> 02:47.580
That's not required.

44
02:47.590 --> 02:48.680
Say next again.

45
02:49.110 --> 02:52.740
So the port by default is three three O six as it is.

46
02:53.920 --> 02:54.820
Record next.

47
02:56.170 --> 03:02.740
Here it says, use strong password encryption, this is recommended, so all the latest versions of

48
03:02.740 --> 03:07.380
MySQL starting from My SQL eight use password encryption.

49
03:07.630 --> 03:14.830
So if you are using My SQL five in your client, for example, if you are working on a Java application

50
03:14.830 --> 03:20.560
and if your driver, the jdbc driver you use is five dot x, you will have to upgrade the driver

51
03:20.560 --> 03:22.060
to My SQL eight.

52
03:22.060 --> 03:28.210
Otherwise, your application will stop communicating with the database server because now the passwords

53
03:28.210 --> 03:29.100
are encrypted.

54
03:29.110 --> 03:29.980
That is what it is saying.

55
03:29.980 --> 03:34.840
If you want to work with legacy applications, you will have to choose the second option or else just

56
03:34.840 --> 03:37.870
upgrade the JDBC driver in your projects.

57
03:38.870 --> 03:42.660
Click next, so here you can give your root password.

58
03:43.040 --> 03:49.040
For me, it's simple test one, two, three, four, because I'm going to use this later on in my applications.

59
03:49.040 --> 03:54.170
You can choose whatever password you want as the root password, but make sure you use the same password

60
03:54.170 --> 03:55.920
in other applications as well.

61
03:56.690 --> 04:00.560
Click on next and it will launch. This is the Windows service name.

62
04:00.560 --> 04:02.220
If you want to change that, you can change it.

63
04:02.240 --> 04:05.470
I'm going to leave it as it is standard system account.

64
04:05.520 --> 04:07.610
That's fine not for a custom user.

65
04:07.610 --> 04:09.380
If it is for the entire system.

66
04:09.500 --> 04:10.370
Click on next.

67
04:11.380 --> 04:12.470
And execute.

68
04:13.300 --> 04:15.820
So it's going to do its installation and set up.

69
04:16.880 --> 04:22.070
We'll finish in a few seconds, it's installing the database now, so I'm going to pass it unless it

70
04:22.070 --> 04:24.050
finishes, I'm going to pass the regarding.

71
04:25.270 --> 04:31.130
I took a few seconds and now it's complete hit finish, it will ask a few more questions it says will

72
04:31.130 --> 04:34.620
now walk you through the configuration, but there is not much configuration.

73
04:34.620 --> 04:36.960
Say, next, and we are done hit finish.

74
04:37.800 --> 04:44.730
And now the MySQL server should be up and running on your machine in the next lecture will install MySQL

75
04:44.730 --> 04:48.750
workbench and validate this MySQL server installation.
