In this lecture, I will create the product and coupon tables that are required to work on the product

1
00:05.610 --> 00:08.320
and coupon micro services to do that.

2
00:08.340 --> 00:13.160
You can download this SQL by going to the resources section of this lecture once downloaded.

3
00:13.200 --> 00:18.930
You can open it in your MySQL workbench once the connection is opened up, or you can copy the contents,

4
00:18.930 --> 00:21.300
paste it into your MySQL workbench tab.

5
00:21.960 --> 00:26.270
My database is my DB, so use the database.

6
00:26.280 --> 00:30.140
That's the first step excute that,that will connect to my database.

7
00:30.360 --> 00:35.190
Then you execute the first command, which is to create the product table. Go ahead click on this.

8
00:35.190 --> 00:37.050
That will create the product table for you.

9
00:37.320 --> 00:40.470
The product table has id, which is the primary key.

10
00:41.050 --> 00:42.310
It is auto increment.

11
00:42.330 --> 00:47.550
So every time a product record is created in the database, automatically this value will be incremented

12
00:47.550 --> 00:48.580
and saved.

13
00:48.630 --> 00:55.600
We don't need not worry about it in our code the product table has name, description and a price.

14
00:56.340 --> 01:00.510
Similarly, we have a coupon table, so go ahead, Select that. Click on that.

15
01:00.510 --> 01:01.940
That will create a coupon table.

16
01:02.250 --> 01:07.200
Id is the primary key coupon code, a unique code for each coupon.

17
01:07.200 --> 01:13.380
That discount that should be applied, which is a decimal number then the expiry date as well, which

18
01:13.380 --> 01:14.130
is a varchar.

19
01:14.130 --> 01:17.130
You can make this a date field or a time stamp field if you want.

20
01:17.140 --> 01:19.800
I'm keeping it simple it is a varchar field.

21
01:20.220 --> 01:24.240
So this coupon code will be used later on by the product micro service.

22
01:24.240 --> 01:29.820
It will be passed from the product micro service and the coupon micro service should return the details

23
01:29.820 --> 01:33.060
of the coupon based off the code that is passed in.

24
01:33.450 --> 01:36.120
So go ahead, create these two tables.
