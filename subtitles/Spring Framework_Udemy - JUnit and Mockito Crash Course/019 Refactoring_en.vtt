In this lecture, we'll refactor our controller a little bit instead of using this request mapping annotation,

1
00:06.930 --> 00:11.610
we have more specific annotations for every http method in the recent versions of spring.

2
00:11.850 --> 00:17.400
So I'm going to take out this request, mapping at the method level, use @ post mapping.

3
00:19.470 --> 00:25.890
And we no longer need this method in there because it is obvious that it is a post method.

4
00:25.890 --> 00:30.810
When you use a post mapping automatically, that is for the post http method and the value is

5
00:30.810 --> 00:31.570
also gone.

6
00:31.590 --> 00:33.700
It is much more readable and simpler.

7
00:33.960 --> 00:34.740
Same here.

8
00:35.190 --> 00:42.270
Instead of this whole thing, you can take out the whole thing, use @ get mapping annotation, open

9
00:42.270 --> 00:48.300
the bracket right there, get rid of the method on the right side  control shift f  have to format,

10
00:48.630 --> 00:50.820
get rid of the request, method, import.

11
00:51.180 --> 00:54.840
We need the request mapping because we are using it at the class level.

12
00:55.170 --> 00:56.730
Otherwise we could have got rid of that as well

13
00:56.730 --> 00:58.410
stop the application.

14
00:58.410 --> 01:05.460
If it is running started, make sure it comes up without any issues and once it is up you can go ahead

15
01:05.460 --> 01:07.020
and run a quick test.
