00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
In this lecture, we will add the mockito

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.770
dependency to a new mockito scrapbook

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.680
project and also will create the test

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.530
class for class A will implement the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.570
actual test methods and mocking in the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.440
next lecture.To do that right click on

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
the mockito project and say new folder will be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.350
will be creating a lib folder to which will copy the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
mockitojar hit finish go to the order processing service under

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.800
the lib folder copy the mockito jar from here paste it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.390
under the new lib folder under our new

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
project we have the job here now so

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.820
added to the classpath right click on

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.180
the project go to properties go to the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.090
library staff add Jars

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
browse to the lib folder select the jar

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.770
click OK it ok again we have mockito

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.739
now on the classpath to create a new

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.809
test case junit test case right click on class A

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.199
say new junit test case the only thing we need

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.600
to change here as you know by now is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.670
change the folder source folder from SRC

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
to test click finish and we have our

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.650
default test case here we implement our

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.110
tests in the next lecture by mocking out

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.009
class B
