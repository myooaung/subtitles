00:00.240 --> 00:06.270
In this lecture, we will install MySQL Workbench, which is a GUI based tool, graphical UI tool

1
00:06.270 --> 00:08.440
to access My SQL server.

2
00:08.460 --> 00:09.150
It is a client.

3
00:09.150 --> 00:14.790
So search launch your browser and search for My SQL work bench.

4
00:16.000 --> 00:21.400
Click on the downloads page, this guide here download My SQL Workbench again, it's the same process

5
00:21.400 --> 00:28.510
you download a installer click on this here and you will get a installer once you have the installer.

6
00:28.540 --> 00:30.430
It's a straightforward installation.

7
00:30.430 --> 00:32.680
Double click on the installer run.

8
00:34.190 --> 00:35.090
Click on next.

9
00:36.080 --> 00:42.980
Choose the defaults, say, default here again, the complete version of it, say next install.

10
00:43.930 --> 00:47.920
That will install it at the end of it, it will prompt you if you want to launch it.

11
00:52.100 --> 00:54.420
While it finishes, there we go.

12
00:54.500 --> 00:59.270
That was quick, so hit finish and you see here, launch My SQL workbench now.

13
01:00.680 --> 01:02.330
Keep it selected finish.

14
01:06.700 --> 01:07.370
There we go.

15
01:07.390 --> 01:12.310
So there is our My SQL workbench, which makes it super easy to connect and work with MySQL server, and

16
01:12.310 --> 01:16.690
you see here it gives as a default connection for the local machine.

17
01:16.870 --> 01:17.770
So you can click on this.

18
01:17.770 --> 01:19.660
You can add more connections by going here.

19
01:19.660 --> 01:25.330
If we hit this plus button, you can even connect to the remote MySQL servers by simply providing a name

20
01:25.330 --> 01:26.290
whatever name you want.

21
01:26.590 --> 01:30.560
And then the IP address or the host machine and the port number

22
01:30.810 --> 01:33.370
these machines can even be on the cloud.

23
01:34.820 --> 01:39.380
Click on this, that will open up, it asks for the password, which you would have set earlier from

24
01:39.380 --> 01:41.450
the MySQL installation test.

25
01:42.110 --> 01:44.270
One, two, three, four is my password.

26
01:44.700 --> 01:46.670
Hit ok, there we go.

27
01:46.910 --> 01:48.400
So I have been playing around with that.

28
01:48.410 --> 01:49.310
Let me clean that up.

29
01:49.340 --> 01:53.090
It will open a Query window for you here.

30
01:53.090 --> 01:58.090
You can create your databases and do whatever you want with the MySQL server.

31
01:58.310 --> 02:04.940
So if you type in show data bases, show databases execute.

32
02:05.900 --> 02:09.220
It will show you all the databases, these are the default databases.

33
02:09.270 --> 02:17.480
Now you can create your own database using create database, give it a name My DB, for example.

34
02:18.530 --> 02:23.840
Execute that they have new database before you go ahead and create the tables, we have to use that

35
02:23.850 --> 02:26.900
database so use is the command use mydb.

36
02:28.080 --> 02:29.130
Execute that.

37
02:30.520 --> 02:32.540
And now we are inside that database.

38
02:32.560 --> 02:34.330
You can see the output below here.

39
02:35.840 --> 02:39.980
Next, the last one show tables.

40
02:41.370 --> 02:46.850
Execute that right now, there are no tables, we will be creating the tables later on.

41
02:46.860 --> 02:51.930
So in this lecture, we have successfully installed My SQL Workbench, which is a client tool to

42
02:51.930 --> 02:53.630
connect to MySQL database.

43
02:53.640 --> 02:57.840
You have opened up a query window and you have created your own database.
