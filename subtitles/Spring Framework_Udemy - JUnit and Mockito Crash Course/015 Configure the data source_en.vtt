00:00.210 --> 00:06.000
The last step is to configure the datasource to do that, go to the application dot properties

1
00:06.000 --> 00:07.560
under source main resources.

2
00:09.500 --> 00:19.490
Spring dot data source dot u r l is equal to this where we pass in the JDBC u r l JDBC Colen MYSQL

3
00:19.700 --> 00:25.070
Colon to forward Slashes localhost colon three three zero six.

4
00:25.070 --> 00:32.210
The default port number of MYSQL slash mydb so that u r l again JDBC Colon MYSQL Colon two forward

5
00:32.210 --> 00:45.080
Slashes localhost colon three three zero six slash my db then spring dot data source Dot user

6
00:45.080 --> 00:52.480
name is the next guy is equal to Root is the user name spring dot data source dot password is the last

7
00:52.700 --> 00:55.610
field password is equal to test.

8
00:55.610 --> 00:57.560
One, two three four is my password.

9
00:57.740 --> 01:01.010
Whatever your MYSQL root password is, go ahead and enter this year.

10
01:01.010 --> 01:07.910
So these are the three properties that are required to connect to the database and how a data source ready

11
01:07.910 --> 01:09.410
to execute the sequel queries.
