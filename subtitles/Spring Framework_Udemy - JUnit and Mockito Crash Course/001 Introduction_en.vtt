This is a new bonus section, I am adding to the course where you will be unit testing a e-Dating, restful

1
00:06.180 --> 00:08.730
API developed using spring boot.

2
00:09.420 --> 00:13.980
This e-Dating restful API will allow the restful clients to do four important things.

3
00:14.430 --> 00:22.290
Register users add interests to those users, likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc. It will allow users

4
00:22.290 --> 00:29.460
to see all the other users in the application and also find matches based on age and location.

5
00:30.330 --> 00:36.000
So the four requirements are allow users to register by passing in the following details like username,

6
00:36.000 --> 00:39.060
password, age, email, phone number, city country.

7
00:39.600 --> 00:45.360
Secondly, add interests to that user account like likes, dislikes, hobbies, profile url and

8
00:45.360 --> 00:49.710
about and then see all the other users or find all the other users.

9
00:50.430 --> 00:55.200
And finally, find matches based on age, city and country.

10
00:55.230 --> 00:58.190
you will not be developing this application from scratch.

11
00:58.200 --> 01:05.190
I'll be giving you the complete working application will be only writing unit tests using Junit and mockito.

12
01:05.190 --> 01:10.200
I'll walk you through the code in the next lecture, and then you will start writing unit tests using

13
01:10.410 --> 01:11.790
the Junit and Mockito.

14
01:11.790 --> 01:16.980
If you want to work on the complete project from scratch, you can take up my end to end Java project

15
01:16.980 --> 01:18.590
using spring boot.

16
01:18.630 --> 01:24.600
There are several projects like this in that course, but here we are going to focus on unit testing.
