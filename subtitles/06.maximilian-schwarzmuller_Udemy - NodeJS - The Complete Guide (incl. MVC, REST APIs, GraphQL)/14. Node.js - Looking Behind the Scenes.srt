00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,370
Over the last lectures, I extensively mentioned how node works with asynchronous code

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,610
and i mentioned this event loop which is important.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,070
Let me dive deeper into that and deeper into how

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:24,380
nodejs exactly executes your code to stay performant and still be able to handle long taking tasks

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,360
like working with files or things like that because there is an important concept which you have to

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,100
understand to understand, well what is happening behind the scenes.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,250
So in our node application we have our code

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,420
and one important thing to understand and to really keep in mind is that nodejs uses only one single

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,100
javascript thread,

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,710
a thread is basically like a process in your operating system you could say.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,380
So it's only using that one thread and the obvious question is how is it then able to handle multiple

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:05,390
requests because if we're not able to assign a new thread for each request, they ultimately end up all

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,390
running in one on the same thread

14
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,310
and this of course poses a security question,

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,990
can you then access data from request A, from request B and most importantly here at this point when

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,930
we talk about performance, there of course also is the question of does this not mean that if the

17
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:30,480
request A is still doing work, request B can't be handled? Well both is taken care of

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,840
nodejs

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,470
.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,340
and at this point of time here, I want to focus on the performance question though I'll also briefly

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,150
touch on the security question.

22
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,510
Now let's start with the performance.

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:49,100
Let's say we have some code which accesses the file system as we already did in this course too. Now working

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,670
with files often is a task that takes longer because files can be very big and it doesn't necessarily

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,380
complete instantly,

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,950
therefore if we're doing this upon an incoming request, a second request might have to wait because we're

27
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,070
not able to handle it yet or it even gets declined,

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,270
so basically our webpage is down for that user.

29
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:17,780
Now one important construct I already mentioned is that event loop, the event loop is automatically started

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,580
by nodejs when your program starts,

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,830
you don't have to do that explicitly,

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,810
nodejs does that when well

33
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,380
it basically starts running code.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,970
This is responsible for handling event callbacks though,

35
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:39,260
so all these nice functions we basically added thus far in create server for example, the event loop

36
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,830
is responsible for basically running that code when a certain event occurs you could say, it's aware

37
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,520
of all these callbacks and basically well, execute said code. That doesn't help us with our long taking

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,330
file operation though and it's important to understand that this operation is not handled by the event

39
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,890
loop, just the callback that we might have defined on write file

40
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:11,150
once it's done, that code will be handled in event loop but that code will finish fast,

41
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,950
so basically the event loop will only handle callbacks that contain fast finishing code.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:25,370
Instead our file system operation and a couple of other long taking operations are sent to a worker

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,810
pool which is also spun up and managed by nodejs automatically.

44
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,450
This worker pool is responsible for all the heavy lifting,

45
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,450
this worker pool is kind of totally detached of your javascript code you could say and it runs on different

46
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,990
threads, it can spin up multiple threads, it's closely intervened with your operating system you're

47
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,200
running the app on,

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,560
so this is really detached from your code and this worker pool is therefore doing all the heavy lifting.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,710
If you're doing something with a file, well a worker from that pool will take care and will do its job

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,000
totally detached from your code and from the request and from the event loop. The one connection to the event loop

51
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,360
we will have though is that

52
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:19,550
once the worker is done, so for example once we read a file, it will trigger the callback for that read

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:25,460
file operation and since the event loop is responsible for the events and the callbacks, this will in

54
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,100
the end end up in the event loop,

55
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,560
so there nodejs will then basically execute the appropriate callback.

56
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,050
Now this is a lot of behind the scenes stuff which is nice to know, you don't have to write any code

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,360
to make this work,

58
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,620
this is all built into nodejs

59
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,810
and if you write code as you learn it in this course, you automatically take advantage of this.

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,210
I still of course want you to understand how that works behind the scenes because I believe that helps

61
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,100
you understand

62
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,060
nodejs better.

63
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,610
Now let's look into that event loop

64
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,710
then. That event loop is in the end

65
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:07,570
a loop which is run or started by nodejs that keeps the nodejs process running

66
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,060
and as I just mentioned, that handles all the callbacks and it has a certain order in which it goes through

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,300
the callbacks.

68
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,250
So basically it's a loop that just well keeps on looping

69
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,650
unsurprisingly, at the beginning of each new iteration it checks if there are any timer callbacks it

70
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,410
should execute. We haven't set up any timers yet

71
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,840
but basically there is set timeout and set interval,

72
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,760
you might know this from frontend javascript too, there these methods also exist. Now in nodejs you can

73
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,040
also set a timer and basically you set a timer and always pass a method, a function that should be executed

74
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,840
once that timer completes and nodejs is aware of this and at the beginning of each new loop iteration,

75
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,020
it executes any due timer callbacks,

76
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,740
so any callbacks that have to be executed because a timer completes. Then as a next step, it checks other

77
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,520
callbacks,

78
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,240
for example if we had write or read file, we might have a callback because that operation finished and

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
it will then also execute these callbacks.

80
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:21,340
Now be aware that with IO here, I mean generally any input output operations that typically is file

81
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,370
operations but can also be network operations and in general, I'm talking about blocking long taking

82
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,730
operations.

83
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,540
Now it's important to understand that nodejs will leave that phase at a certain point of time and that

84
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,900
can also mean that if there are too many outstanding callbacks, it will continue its loop iteration and

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,910
postpone these callbacks to the next iteration to execute them. After working on these open callbacks

86
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,930
and hopefully finishing them all,

87
00:06:50,980 --> 00:07:00,310
it will enter a pull phase. The pull phase is basically a phase where nodejs will look for new IO events

88
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,000
and basically do its best to execute their callbacks immediately if possible.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Now if that's not possible, it will defer the execution and basically register this as a pending callback,

90
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,160
so this is how that works.

91
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,970
Important, it also will check if there are any timer callbacks due to be executed

92
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,010
and if that is the case, it will jump to that timer phase and execute them right away,

93
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,510
so it can actually jump back there and not finish the iteration

94
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,150
otherwise it will continue

95
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:42,030
and next set immediate callbacks will be executed in a so-called check phase. Set immediate is a bit like

96
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:50,000
set timeout or set interval, just that it will execute immediately but always after any open callbacks

97
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,750
have been executed,

98
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,140
so typically faster than set timeout with one millisecond of open duration, let's say

99
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,450
but after the current cycle

100
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,750
well finished or at least finished open callbacks that were due to be handled in that current iteration.

101
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,770
And now we're entering a highly theoretical terrain

102
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,780
and I don't want to dive too deep into that, though you will find a couple of resources that do dive

103
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,600
deeper at the end of this module in case you want to join the nodejs team and really dive super

104
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,270
hardcore into this.

105
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:30,510
Now we're nearing the end of each iteration cycle and now nodejs will execute all close event callbacks,

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,860
so if you registered any close events and in our code, we haven't

107
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,890
but if you had any close events, this would be the point of time where nodejs executes their appropriate

108
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,940
callbacks.

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:49,290
So roughly spoken, we have timer callbacks, we then have any IO related callbacks and other event callbacks

110
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,470
and set immediate followed by close event callbacks,

111
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,830
so close events are basically handled separately or their callbacks are handled separately we should

112
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:09,750
say. Well and then we might exit the whole nodejs program but only if there are no remaining event

113
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:17,150
handlers which are registered and that is what I mean with this refs equal null thing here. Internally

114
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:25,050
nodejs keeps track of its open event listeners and it basically has a counter, references or refs

115
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,000
which it increments by 1 for every new callback that is registered,

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,760
every new event listener that is registered

117
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,630
so every new future work that it has to do

118
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,460
you could say and it reduces that counter by 1 for every event listener that it doesn't need anymore,

119
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,280
every callback it finished and since in a server environment

120
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,370
we create a server with create server and then listen to incoming requests with listen,

121
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,820
this is an event which never is finished by default and therefore, we always have at least one reference

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,630
and therefore we don't exit in a normal node web server program. We can call the exit function as you

123
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,720
already saw

124
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,070
and if we do anything else like at the beginning of the course when we just used node to execute a file

125
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:21,270
that did not listen to a web server or on a web server, then it also finishes eventually once its done

126
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,150
with its work.

127
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,340
So this is how the event loop works

128
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:34,110
and this can be very theoretical, all these different phases typically don't matter to you, certainly

129
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,650
not when getting started with nodejs.

130
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,930
Now consult these advanced resources if you want to learn more,

131
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:48,660
for now just be aware of that first picture I showed you, of how nodejs handles complex work, that

132
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,270
there is this worker pool that takes care that your things are not getting blocked and that it therefore

133
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,280
stays performant.

134
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:02,110
Now I also touched on that security thing with that one javascript thread

135
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,340
and regarding that, we also got no problems by default,

136
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,920
though I will come back later to how we can manage global data and how we should manage it to ensure

137
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,050
that we do not spoil data from request A to request B. By default

138
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:25,350
we have some separation because remember that callback method in create server gets executed for every

139
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:31,080
new incoming request and therefore this function only runs for that incoming request and anything we do

140
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,900
to the request or response object there will not be exposed to our request or response objects because

141
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,100
each function is only scoped to itself and not accessible by the other functions,

142
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,760
so by default we have that separation due to how javascript works.

143
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,130
Now that was a big chunk of theory,

144
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,200
again not something you have to learn by heart but something where you should at least keep that big

145
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,910
picture in mind of how nodejs manages its work.
