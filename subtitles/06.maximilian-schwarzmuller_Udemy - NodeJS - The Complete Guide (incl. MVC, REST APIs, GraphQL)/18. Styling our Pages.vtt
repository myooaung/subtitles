00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.330
Our html pages look pretty boring and obviously this is no css course,

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
I got one if you want to learn more about css though but that's just a little side note

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.450
but this is no css course but still, it's important to understand how you can serve css in your

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.500
node apps too

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.510
because typically, you have css and also javascript code in your apps.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.580
Now let's start simple,

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.080
I'm on the slash page here, so on shop.html and let's add some styling here with good old style tags

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.740
in the head section and this is not the way we'll keep it,

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.290
this is just so that we can work on it and auto-update this because importing an external style file

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.390
wouldn't work at the moment to spoil the fun already.

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.320
Now as before, you can skip this lecture

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.070
if you don't want to write the style together with me and you'll find it attached to the next lecture,

13
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.620
otherwise let's do this together.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.230
So let's start styling this and let's start with the header.

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.070
Now I won't target the element directly instead

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.010
this will be my main navigation or my main header,

17
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.260
let's give it a class, main header

18
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.010
header,

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.180
this will be the main header nav and if you're wondering about the strange css class name, I'm using

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.450
a styling system named bem,

21
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.760
more on that can be learned in that css course I mentioned or of course you can google css bem,

22
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.520
it's a certain way of naming your classes to avoid double class names

23
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:42.100
basically, here I'll have my main header, whoops, header item list and here I'll have my main header

24
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.620
items like this and you can of course name this however you want.

25
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.110
So these are a bunch of css classes that should help us with styling,

26
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.030
now let's start with the header.

27
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.880
The header should have a width of 100% to take the full width of the page and let's say it should

28
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.680
have a height of 56 pixels

29
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.310
or if you want to work in rem which has certain advantages, we could also go with 3.5rem.

30
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.200
Now let's also give it a nice background color and here you're really free, I'll not stick to red but now

31
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.980
I can hover over this and use this nice color picker and pick any color you want,

32
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.530
now I'll try to pick a nice yellow golden-ish orange color, something like this

33
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.210
maybe, if you click on rgb it will also convert this to a hex code

34
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.880
so let's use that and of course the class is not header but main header. And now if I save this and go

35
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.500
back and reload,

36
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.800
we got that, looks better. Now

37
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.980
there is some padding in the body so

38
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.210
let's actually define that we want to have no padding and no margin,

39
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.230
I think it's a margin, that we don't want to have that, let's add this, looks almost better.

40
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.180
We still got some margin here at the top,

41
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.220
this is coming from our list in here though, that some margin call isn't doing its job here,

42
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.870
now let's also get rid of that. By now

43
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.590
also styling our main header

44
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.320
item list.

45
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.770
So let's copy that,

46
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.230
add a class here,

47
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.690
set the list style to none and remove any margin and padding

48
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.990
we might have here, that looks better. Now

49
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.000
obviously the items are not looking nice,

50
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.150
for this I will actually change the display here to flex to use flexbox for the list and then style

51
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.580
our items here a bit, on these items

52
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.780
for now I'll remove all margin and padding they might have, reload.

53
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.960
Now thanks to flexbox they're sitting next to each other,

54
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.640
now let's also style our links in there.

55
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.420
So main header item,

56
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:06.190
any nested anchor tag should have no text decoration and a color of white maybe, looks a bit better.

57
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.700
Now 

58
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.020
vertical centering would also be nice

59
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.600
and for that I'll go back to the main header, excuse me, back to the main header nav here, let's add a class

60
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.720
for that too.

61
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.290
And here I'll first of all use a height of 100% because this is a child element of the main

62
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.840
header and therefore it should take all its height and this will also be display

63
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.020
flex now and we can center items vertically with align items centered now.

64
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.950
With this if I save that and reload this page,

65
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.250
now this is centered,

66
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.180
now let's add some padding to our main header.

67
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.560
For this let's go here, add a padding, top and bottom

68
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.910
I don't need padding but left and right maybe 1.5rem, something like this,

69
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.440
on mobile phone also still ok I'd say.

70
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.110
Let's also change the global font by the way

71
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.100
so in the body

72
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.200
I'll set the

73
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.430
font family to sans-serif for now,

74
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.560
looks a bit nicer than the serif font I think

75
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.050
and now I want to have some space in-between my navigation items there so

76
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:24.790
let's actually go to the main header item and let's add a margin to the left and right of 1rem, like

77
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.400
that

78
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.430
and for now, this will do.

79
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.560
Now little hovering effect for the links maybe,

80
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:39.870
so let's also go here, main header item hover and main header item active and let's also define a

81
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.610
rule which would apply if the anchor has an active class attached to it

82
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.890
and there I want to set the color

83
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:59.070
to well we have this nice little yellow touch here, so we could go into the blue-ish direction here,

84
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.700
maybe like this purple-ish color,

85
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.110
let's let's see how that looks like.

86
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.100
Not too shabby,

87
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.430
so let's go with that

88
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.580
and now since we have that active class rule here on shop.html where this link is active, we can actually

89
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.650
add the active class here and you will learn how to set that dynamically later in the course too of

90
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.580
course.

91
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.490
So now this is active, now for the main section

92
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.410
let's also style this.

93
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:34.620
Here I will define a general rule for main that I want to have a padding of let's say 1rem in all directions

94
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.180
and now this is the style I want to go with.

95
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:47.820
Now let's also of course work on the admin add product styling here and we can simply copy the entire

96
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.670
style object from the shop.html

97
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.790
file in the add-product.html file and this will already get us pretty far.

98
00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.030
Now one thing we should change in add product, we should of course add all these classes, so we can basically

99
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.430
copy that header

100
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.650
and later we will also learn how to reuse it across files

101
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.370
by the way. So let's copy that header,

102
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.280
by the way that auto-formatting I'm doing occasionally can be set up in the preferences by going to

103
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.280
the keyboard shortcuts and searching for format document, this is the shortcut I am using here but that's

104
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.750
just a side note.

105
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.780
So here we now also have to change the active class,

106
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:35.020
it's not on the shop link here but of course it should go onto the add product link and with that if

107
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.840
I now reload this page, looks way better.

108
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.820
Now let's work on the form here too

109
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:50.500
and for this, I want to go to my form, give it a class of product form maybe, the name is up to you,

110
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:57.500
add a little div with which I give a class of form control and in that div,

111
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:07.270
I'll insert this input here and I'll also add a label for the title, put title as a label on it, give that

112
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:14.950
input the ID title so that it matches the label for accessibility reasons simply

113
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.130
and now let's style this too. For this

114
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.120
I'll use my form control,

115
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:31.820
so this class I added to this rounding div and here, I want to make sure that a label as well as an input

116
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:38.270
which is nested in a form control uses a display of type block so that it takes the full available

117
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.350
width

118
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.720
and I also want to style the input then,

119
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.510
so the input here should have a border of one pixel solid

120
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:54.720
and then I will reuse that yellow color we used for the header. The font should be inherited so that

121
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.350
it uses the default font family and so on

122
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.920
and I'll give it a little border radius of like two pixels maybe, let's see how that looks like or the

123
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.570
radius. If I now reload this, doesn't look too bad,

124
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.350
let's now also work on the button. For this

125
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.140
I will set up a generic button style here for now, 

126
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.970
inherit the default font,

127
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.600
give it a border of one pixel solid and this light gray

128
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.710
a background of white maybe,

129
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:41.390
let's maybe give it a black border here simply and a border radius of three pixels.

130
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.120
Now let's see how that looks like,

131
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.600
it's ok but let's reuse the yellow color here actually

132
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.090
and let's also give the text that yellow color.

133
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:59.120
Additionally I want to make sure that we assign the pointer cursor to get this hand cursor when hovering

134
00:09:59.180 --> 00:09:59.890
over it

135
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:08.040
and last but not least, I want to have some spacing but with my form control div and the button.

136
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:15.970
So on the form control itself, I'll add some margin to top and bottom of

137
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.650
let's say 1rem and 0 left and right

138
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.810
so that this looks like that

139
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.370
and I think for the button, maybe you want to go with the purple color since that

140
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.690
should be easier to read

141
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.810
and let's also assign a hover and an active state for that button

142
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:43.240
and when it is active, I just want to set the background color to purple and the text color to white

143
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:43.620
then.

144
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.300
So now it looks like this

145
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.810
and this doesn't look too shabby,

146
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.160
we can go with that I guess, we can always work on this and we will continue to work on this throughout the

147
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.000
course

148
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.530
but for now this is good.

149
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.010
Let's now center the entire form

150
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:04.190
and for that I assigned the product form class to the form.

151
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:15.400
So here I want to give this a width of let's say 30rem, a max width of 100% or of 90%

152
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.630
in case we're on a mobile

153
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.510
view, give it a margin of auto, this will automatically center it horizontally

154
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.470
and now just make sure that the input and so on take the available space so

155
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.520
let's reduce this 20 actually, I think 30 is a bit too much

156
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.700
and on the form control for laying an input

157
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.950
I'll give it a width of 100%.

158
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.690
and now this looks much better.

159
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.970
Now I'm not happy with the white text here now that I think about it

160
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:50.580
so let's actually go to the header and change the white link text to black, let's see how that looks like,

161
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.050
yeah I think I prefer that

162
00:11:54.050 --> 00:12:02.520
so let's actually take that and also add it to shop.html so that we have the black color there too

163
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.960
and I think the purple could be a little bit darker.

164
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.440
So let's now also go to the hovering and active style here

165
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:20.530
and make this a darker purple and replace the purple in all occurrences with that color style.

166
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.090
I'm using a multi-select feature of

167
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.010
the IDE here to do that quickly,

168
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.990
I can of course also search and replace to do that, reload,

169
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.960
yeah I think that is a bit better.

170
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.490
Now you can always tweak this to your needs,

171
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.070
it's not a css course here.

172
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.870
I just want to have some basic styling that we can use.

173
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.280
So this is the style with which we'll go from now on and which we'll of course continue to tweak.

174
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:51.790
Now one thing we should also do now, let's copy that style from the shop.html file and put it into

175
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.120
the 404.html file here

176
00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:01.580
because there, I also want to take the header and copy that into there because I don't just want to have

177
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.800
the page not found thing,

178
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:11.210
I also want to show the header. So that now if I do enter some route which does not exist, like this, we

179
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.340
also got the header there

180
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.230
and we can at least leave that route, though we can't because I obviously got an error

181
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:17.910
in the url,

182
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:23.320
that should be admin flash add product.

183
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:28.030
Now let's fix that everywhere here including our form of course,

184
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.580
like that

185
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:43.900
and now if I reload, we can navigate around just fine here and try adding a book, that seems to work.

186
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.110
And with that, we get the styling in there, we get the basic html markup

187
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.750
but of course regarding the styling, the issue is that it's all in our html files. It would be nice to have

188
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.820
some external files for that, wouldn't it?
