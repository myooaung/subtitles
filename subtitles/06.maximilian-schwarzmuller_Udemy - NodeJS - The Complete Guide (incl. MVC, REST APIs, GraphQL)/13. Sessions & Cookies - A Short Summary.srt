1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,910
So now we had a look at how we can use sessions and what the advantage of a session is

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,110
and we also of course learned about cookies, what a cookie can be used for and how it plays together

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:19,670
nicely with a session to identify a user, a client and then store the sensitive data on the server,

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:26,810
so in the session and that difference between the sessions server side and cookies, client side is really important

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,730
to understand and

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,280
you also learned how to set a cookie and how to use a session.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:38,150
Now by the way if you're wondering how that session cookie, this cookie here, how this is set, well this is done

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,100
automatically by express session

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,040
so by that middleware we're configuring and

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:49,010
that's also why you can add cookie related configurations here because this middleware automatically

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,440
sets a cookie for you and it automatically reads the cookie value for you too,

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,580
so it does all the cookie parsing and setting for you. Now with that, you actually rarely need to manage

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,910
cookies on your own

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,250
because that session cookie

15
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,860
and with that I don't mean a cookie which gets lost after you close the browser but that cookie that

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,150
identifies a server side session, that is the most prominent, the most common use case for cookies besides

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,180
advertisement, tracking which you typically don't implement on your own but you use third party tools

18
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,550
like Google for that.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,080
But that session cookie, so that session identifying cookie is an important thing

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,710
and sessions on the server are often used for authentication

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,580
but as I mentioned, you could use them for any kind of data you want to store.

22
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,640
We happen to store the information whether the user is logged in

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,020
but you could be storing the carts, the shopping cart of the user here or anything which belongs to a user

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,140
which should be shared across requests as I highlighted.
