00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,780
In this module we had a look at some advanced authentication related topics, namely we had a look at

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:15,140
password resetting and there it was important to understand that you of course have to implement password

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,170
resetting in a way that prevents users from resetting random user accounts.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,780
Therefore we implemented such a short lived password token so that it's not valid forever

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,880
to reduce the chance of it being generated by some brute force attack and therefore, our reset token

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
is a great mechanism to identify the user for whom we want to reset the password. The token has to be

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,110
generated in a way that is random,

8
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,050
unguessable, at least in a reasonable amount of time

9
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,680
hence the expiration date and unique

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,390
and in this module, we implemented a token in exactly that way.

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,110
We also had a look at authorization and authorization is all about locking down access for authenticated

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,020
users because just because you're authenticated, you're not allowed to do everything. You might be logged

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,910
in in your udemy account but you can't edit my course because you are not the creator of the

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:20,240
course and that's the idea of authorization and that is also what we did in this module when we ensured

15
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,550
that only users who created a product can actually view, edit and delete it.

16
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,380
So authorization is a crucial part of most applications

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,950
and together with authentication which is the surrounding topic of having users in general, you can really

18
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,560
control which visitor can do what in your web app in your website.
