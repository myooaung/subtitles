00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.940
So we want to use nodejs

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.180
and the first important step is that we install it and for that you have to visit

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.260
nodejs.org.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.820
There you'll find an installer,

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.180
in my case here it picked the right one for my operating system, MacOS but you will also find a version for

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.740
Windows

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.260
if you're visiting this page on Windows or you manually choose a different version and you can of course

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.520
follow along no matter which operating system you're using,

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.710
the code you write and the steps you need to take to install nodejs are exactly the same.

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.850
You simply download the latest version here, 10.9 in my case and you then simply save it anywhere and run the installer

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.310
this gives you. Now simply follow through all the steps which are mentioned in the installer, accept the

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.900
license agreement and so on

13
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.850
so simply click through that,

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.760
install it on your machine

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.870
and once it is completed, you already got everything you will need to write

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.290
nodejs

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.010
code.

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.340
So this is super fast, it's done here,

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.730
you can close this now

20
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.400
and now, how do we use nodejs?

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.390
Well the easiest way of using it is to open up your local terminal or on windows, powershell or the

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.680
command prompt. In that terminal, as a first step simply run node -v, like this,

23
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.390
this should show you the version of nodejs you installed.

24
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.600
Now with that being executed, you can now use node just like that to enter a special input mode,

25
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.710
the so-called repl I'll come back to that where you can execute code and have it parsed by node on the

26
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.330
fly.

27
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.400
You can use this as a calculator, simply type two plus two to see the result

28
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.510
or you can write whole javascript programs there.

29
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.790
Now I won't do that

30
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.710
so you can quit it with control c

31
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
and instead let's write a real script which we can execute with nodejs so that we can also see what

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.060
we can do with it. For that, create a new folder anywhere on your computer and open that folder in your

33
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.730
favorite IDE or code editor.

34
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.480
Now here I am using Visual Studio code,

35
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.660
you can find that on code.visualstudio.com,

36
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.630
this is a great IDE which I strongly recommend using,

37
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.640
it's free,

38
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.670
it is really built for you such with javascript code

39
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.590
it will work great and you can simply download it from this page,

40
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.840
as I said for free, simply walk through the installer,

41
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.410
it's also available for Windows and so on.

42
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480
Walk through the installer it gives you

43
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.060
and then once it's installed,

44
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.110
simply start it and open that new folder you created somewhere on your computer.

45
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.970
This will be your project folder for this very first quick app or script

46
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.720
we're going to write. Now your Visual Studio code might look a bit different,

47
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.950
I'm in fullscreen mode which is why you don't see any menu items here at the top

48
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.860
and I also got two important things installed here.

49
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.660
The first one is the theme and you can hit command shift P or control shift P on Windows to go to that

50
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.520
quick command interface here and there if you type theme, then you can go to the preferences color theme and

51
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.240
choose which theme you want to use and I'm using the dark plus theme here,

52
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.470
so if you want to get the exact same coloring, you can choose that.

53
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.950
And I also installed an extension,

54
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.550
you can view the extension menu by going to view extensions or if you have on the left a menu, you can

55
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.240
also click on the extensions tab there but view extensions will do or the shortcut you see there

56
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.850
and there I installed the material icon theme, this theme here. I already got that installed

57
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400
and this gives me some special file icons and so on.

58
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.180
You don't need that,

59
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.030
you just can use it if you want to, you have the exact same layout and thereafter you can go back to the view

60
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.250
explorer here.

61
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.330
Now this is then my setup, I get a gitignore file here since I'll use git for version management,

62
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.290
you don't need that

63
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.660
and with that let's simply create a new file here with control n, command n or by clicking that icon

64
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.010
here and then simply give it any name you want, like

65
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.790
first-app.js, .js is of course important because we're creating a javascript app here. Now in

66
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.060
there,

67
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.450
we can run any code

68
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.320
nodejs is capable of executing

69
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.700
and for this, I will write a simple script.

70
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.850
I will simply write console log

71
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.770
hello from nodejs.

72
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.690
Now you could write this in the browser too, the browser would be capable of running this and it would

73
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.640
log thiss in the javascript console in your browser dev tools.

74
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.840
Now you can also execute this with nodejs though. For this,

75
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.550
go back to your terminal or command prompt and make sure you navigate into that new folder you created

76
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.770
with the help of CD and so on,

77
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.190
you can alternatively also go back to visual studio code and there under view,

78
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.800
you can open that terminal and that will give you your default system terminal already navigated into

79
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.540
that folder,

80
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.400
so that's a bit more convenient.

81
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.700
And then here you can run

82
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.320
node

83
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.650
and now

84
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.340
first-app.js,

85
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.670
so that filename. If you now hit enter,

86
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.200
you should see hello from nodejs here because this executes your code and this already shows you

87
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.310
that node is javascript on your computer.

88
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.820
This is not using a browser, it's just using the internal engine,

89
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.050
the extended internal javascript engine used by the browser to execute your code locally, totally outside

90
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.280
of a browser.

91
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.230
and of course we can also do more than just logging something.

92
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.080
Let's for example write this text to a file.

93
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.830
For this, we can import something from the nodejs environment,

94
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.000
I mentioned that it would add new features to javascript, right.

95
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.300
You have to import them and I'll come back to the detailed import syntax and which features exist a

96
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.490
little bit later,

97
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.350
for now just follow along to have this first quick demo and create a new constant, I'll

98
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.860
also give you a brief refresher about constants in Javascript in this course and then type require

99
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:25.800
fs. Fs stands for file system and this syntax simply imports some file system functionalities into this

100
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:34.490
javascript file so that we can use these functionalities there. We can now use fs write file sync here

101
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.420
to create a new file and this takes a couple of arguments and the first argument is the path where you

102
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.990
want to store that file and that also includes the file name.

103
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.080
Now I want to create it in that same folder so I will simply name it

104
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.410
hello.text for example

105
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.540
and the second argument is the data we want to put in there and there I'll just put hello from nodejs.

106
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:05.780
With this if we now save this and we re-execute this with node first-app.js,

107
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.670
you should have a hello.txt file here and this gives you the text written in there

108
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.900
and this is something you couldn't do in the browser because there

109
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.630
you can't access your local file system and obviously it's features like this which you need to then

110
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.540
also create a server which we don't have at this point

111
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.940
by the way, this is not a website obviously, it's just some utility script and this is something we can

112
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.510
do with nodejs.

113
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.520
Well this was a first quick demo, we'll learn all the cool features and how this works and what exactly this

114
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.680
syntax is throughout the course of course.
