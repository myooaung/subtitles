1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,760
Now we worked with the debugger a bit and after this lecture,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,270
you'll also find a lecture with a link to a more detailed explanation of the debugging capabilities

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,000
Visual Studio Code gives you. Don't learn them by heart but feel free to explore them to get the most

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,390
out of the debugger for you.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,440
Now there are two things I want to show you or I want to draw your attention to,

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,440
one is something you already saw.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,340
Let's add a breakpoint again and again submit this,

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,260
I already showed you that you can execute code here in that debug console at the bottom,

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,070
so you don't see the console logs here, you can also execute code here.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,070
For example you can type variable name here,

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,340
so something which is available in your code at this point of time, in general something which you

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,940
can find in local or in block here or in global,

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,690
so the things you find here like message, you can also type that down there and hit enter to print its

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,500
value.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,440
And this is of course not really useful for printing because you can see the value on the left too

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,890
but as I showed you for parsed body, you cannot just print the value,

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,790
you can also run operations on it that will not affect your code as it's running but that will allow

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,040
you to look into it or try out some transformation before you add it to your real code.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,990
So whatever you run down there does not affect the code you run up here but it is nice for you to understand

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,760
your code.

21
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,570
The other thing I want to show you is that for now at the moment, if we change something in our code

22
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:46,400
here, let's say we add a blank line, our debugger doesn't restart but with nodemon we actually have

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,370
a package that does allow us to restart.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,700
So it would be nice if the debugger would also restart if we change our code

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,720
otherwise it just behaves differently than the rest of our app and we have to restart it manually. Now to

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,570
restart it,

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,340
let's go back to the explorer view for a second,

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,190
we have to go to debug and then add a configuration for nodejs.

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,300
This adds the .vs code folder with the launch json file

30
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,020
and this allows you to configure debugging for this project and how it behaves. You can click on add configuration

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,880
to see some demo settings you can add but you can also just type in there and one setting you can add

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,750
is restart and you can set it to true,

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,940
you just have to make sure that you also add some other fields.

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,500
For example you have to make sure that nodemon is used and for that, you set the runtime executable not to

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,560
node which would be the default but to nodemon

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,730
here. So now it'll use nodemon

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,640
and it will restart the debugger when a change is detected,

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,930
so that not just the server is restarted but also the debugging process. Here by the way in this configuration,

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,540
you can also define that it should always start with the app.js file

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,740
so that you can even have the routes.js file selected while starting debugging and it will still

41
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,560
go for the app.js file which is more convenient than always selecting the file you want to debug

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,740
first before starting the debugger and you always have to pick the app.js file because that starts your server.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,890
So you can't say I'm going to look into the routes.js file so I'll start with that,

44
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,320
it always has to be the app.js file because you always have to start the entire server,

45
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,790
so here you can define that it will always pick that no matter which file you have currently open.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,630
You can also change the console where things are logged to to the integrated terminal which is the normal

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,340
terminal.

48
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,000
With this if you save all of that and you now start debugging, it fails though

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,160
and the reason for this is that it will not use the local nodemon

50
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,080
but it looks for it globally.

51
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,360
Now to add it globally, you have to run an install nodemon -g

52
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,370
and now important, on Mac and Linux you might need to add sudo in front of this,

53
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,210
on Windows you don't, to get the right permissions to install this. With that you might be prompted for your password

54
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,650
and now it will install nodemon globally which makes sure that if you ever run nodemon in the terminal

55
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,450
now, it will not fail with a not found error but instead it will find it

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,550
and therefore now you can also run this debugger here which will use the global version and you'll

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:32,170
see it now opens terminal, starts nodemon and if you now add a breakpoint somewhere and submit this

58
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,930
again it still works

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,610
as before, just important,

60
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,420
you now see the terminal here

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,410
logs all the things. You can still use the debug console to output messages though, so you can still work

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,640
with this

63
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,810
as I showed it to you, so this is not stopped from working, this still is something you can use but

64
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,330
in the terminal, you get the normal output and you have to use the terminal because if you now change something,

65
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,570
it restarts the debugger and node and these are two separate processes

66
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,170
and if you stop the debugger, nodemon has to quit separately or has to exit separately and you do

67
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,200
this by hitting control

68
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,410
c here and this couldn't be done in the debug console which is why you have to funnel this to the

69
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,290
terminal.

70
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,120
So that's just something to keep in mind,

71
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,810
you have to stop that process separately which you can do from the terminal which is why if you are

72
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:33,320
using that nodemon process, you should use the integrated terminal and you can read more about that in

73
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,470
that detailed visual studio code debugging article

74
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,750
but now you have a setup where you have a debugger attached to your program that will restart if you

75
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,150
edit something, where the server will restart

76
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,050
if you edit something and where you have now all the tools you should need to debug your node app and

77
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,750
hopefully solve any errors you get.

78
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,320
Now one important note, for the rest of the course I'll mostly use npm start and not have the debugger

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,770
attached all the time,

80
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,880
I will only use that if there is some error I want to particularly debug with the debugger and want to find

81
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,100
with the debugger. So you can use it as a default, always on option,

82
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,900
I prefer to not to use it to not have that extra panel and so on

83
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,460
but to really just use the server and work on that.
