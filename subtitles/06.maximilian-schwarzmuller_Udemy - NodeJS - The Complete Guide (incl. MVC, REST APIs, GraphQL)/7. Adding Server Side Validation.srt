1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:08,440
So validation in the database is missing. Now I'll start by adding validation here and for that,

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,070
I'll quit my server side npm start process because I need to install a new package and I'll use the same

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,890
package which I used in the validation module of this course. Therefore

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,250
you should definitely watch that module to learn how validation works because I'll not repeat everything

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,690
here,

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,250
we already learned it after all.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,350
So here I'll just install that package which was express validator,

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:38,340
that is a package that helps us with implementing validation into our node express applications.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,550
After that is installed, you can restart npm start and now do you remember how you add it?

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,740
Have a look at this module I just mentioned

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:54,850
if you don't. You go to your routes and there, you add some middleware which does that validation. For

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,130
that, you

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:04,800
first of all need to import something from the express validator package and there from the

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,550
/check sub-package and that something is either the check method or the body method to check the request

15
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,670
body or with the check method

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,620
also the headers, the query parameters and so on,

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,460
I want to check the request body here. Now for a get route, validation makes no sense because no data is

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,130
submitted

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,080
but for the post route it makes sense and there I'll add an array of middleware that will be applied

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,200
which will be related to validation. There

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:40,180
for example I will use body to check the title field.

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,070
Now the title field can be validated in any way you want,

23
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:52,990
I can tell you that on the frontend however, I am validating that title field and you can see that in the

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:01,750
components, feed feed edit component, that I am validating this to have a minimum length of five characters

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,250
and to be non-empty which is of course the case if it is at least five characters long,

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,060
the content also has to be five characters long.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,450
So that's just a little side note on what I'm doing on the frontend and the backend should of course

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,450
meet that same pattern.

29
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:24,190
So my body title will first of all be trimmed to not have any whitespace in there and then I'll use

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,980
the isLength validator with an object to set a minimum length of five.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,380
Now this is the title, now after a comma, I'll add my next middleware where I will validate the content,

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,030
we can also trim that and basically set the same validator,

33
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,060
obviously you can be more creative than that but I just want to re-iterate how validation works and

34
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,950
really show you that it works in exactly the same way in rest APIs because you build a normal

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,170
node in express application in the end,

36
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,690
that does not change here.

37
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:07,600
So with that, we added these two validation steps for our incoming data, for title and the content and now

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,740
we can implement some logic to send an error if our server side validation logic is not met. For this

39
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:21,160
we go to our controller, to the feed.js file in our controllers folder and there we also need to import

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,940
something from that express validator package,

41
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,050
so here I also require express validator/check

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:36,120
and that something which I am importing here is the validation result function. With that imported

43
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,560
in create post,

44
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:45,130
we can simply create a new errors constant and use that validation result function on the request, it

45
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,190
will then automatically extract any errors that validation package

46
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,190
gathered and we can check if not errors is empty which means we have errors.

47
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:02,050
If that is not empty, we have errors and then I will return a response with a status code of 422 which

48
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,330
is of course our validation failed status code where I send some json data

49
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,040
and there you can have a message of validation failed,

50
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:22,650
validation failed, entered data is incorrect or whatever you want, it will be on your frontend to

51
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,060
do something with that message or not and you could add the errors here by using that errors constant

52
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,980
and then using the array method to extract an array of errors and also add this to the json object.

53
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,640
So with that, we're returning this response if validation fails.

54
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,440
Now thanks to our client side validation, with the correct rules we could not reproduce that because

55
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm already checking for a minimum length of 5 on the frontend

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,410
but if we increase the title minimum length to 7 for now on the server,

57
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,760
now if I go back to the frontend and I enter a title which is only 5 characters long and therefore

58
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,980
long enough for the client side validation but too short for the server side validation which is of

59
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,880
course a mismatch

60
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,770
you don't want to have in a real app but it's great for testing,

61
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,060
if I do that and I

62
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,050
accept here, I actually get an error, creating or editing a post failed,

63
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,880
that is an error message I'm just showing on the frontend.

64
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:28,920
But if you have a look at our console log in the dev tools, we see a 422 error here and if we click

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,030
on that we're taken to the network tab, we see that read request and if we inspect that, we see our response

66
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,550
here and that indeed has that message we sent on the server side, validation failed and so on and it

67
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,870
has this errors array where we see that the title failed.

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,400
So you see that the server side validation is working and that is all I wanted to show you here,

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,190
of course I revert back to 5 characters minimum length on the server now too so that the client side

70
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,150
validation logic and the server side logic are in line

71
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,730
otherwise we would have very bad user experiences because users get the feedback that their input is

72
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,420
correct and then the server would throw an error.

73
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:17,280
So with that, we added validation for this post route and now we can move on to adding a database.
