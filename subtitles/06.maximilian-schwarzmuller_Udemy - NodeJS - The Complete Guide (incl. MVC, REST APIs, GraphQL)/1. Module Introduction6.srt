00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:09,070
Enough about databases for now but let's stick to storing data and let me dive into some mechanisms

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,270
of storing data in memory or even on the client side,

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,730
so in the browser. And for that in this module, we'll have a look at the sessions and cookies,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,820
two important constructs or technologies in web development in general which you can of course also

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,140
use in nodejs. Now in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly cookies are

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,400
and of course what exactly sessions are and then how you can use both and how you typically use them

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,360
together.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,430
So let's dive in and let's understand what these things are and how we can add them to our project and

9
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,690
why we would add them.
