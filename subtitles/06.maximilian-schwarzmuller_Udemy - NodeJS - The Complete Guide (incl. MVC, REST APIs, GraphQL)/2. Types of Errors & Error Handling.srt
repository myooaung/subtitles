1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,550
So how bad are errors?

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,820
Now errors are not necessarily the end of your app,

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,210
you can recover from the errors,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,940
you can inform the user that something went wrong and that he should try again

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,420
for example, you just need to handle errors correctly

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,070
that is the key takeaway and there are different types of errors.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,460
We can have technical or network related errors where you have very little influence on at least if

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,560
you're not the system administrator,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,890
we have so-called expected errors and this is not an official term,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,680
that is something I came up with and I'll explain what this is in a second

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,700
and we also have bugs or logical errors in your code.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,320
Now for technical errors, our mongodb server might be down and therefore any interaction

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,580
with the database will fail. In such a case,

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,420
there's not that much we can do,

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,700
the best thing might be to show some error page to the user to let the user know that something is wrong

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,510
on our end, that we are sorry and that we're working on fixing the issue.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,820
We also might want to behind the scenes send an e-mail to the administrator or anything like that.

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,940
We also have these expected errors as I like to call them.

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,250
There are certain operations,

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,630
let's say we are interacting with a file or with a database that can fail,

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,100
not very often

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,750
and of course it's not really expected for this to fail but that can happen.

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,620
Maybe because there are too many simultaneous requests to a certain file, anything like that. Here informing

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,830
the user and giving the user the ability to retry

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,080
might be a good solution.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,300
For example the validation errors which we also implement in earlier module, these would also be expected

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,670
errors, users will input valid and invalid data and for invalid data, we want to inform the user and give the

28
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,520
user the chance of retrying

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,870
and of course we also have errors in our code where we interact with a user object in a place where

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,480
it just can't exist or at least not in all circumstances.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,890
We should fix such errors during development,

32
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,610
we should test our code and we should fix such issues of course,

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,830
these are not errors

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,450
we should handle at runtime,

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,310
we should not show a message to the user because these errors are not the users or the network's fault,

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,750
they are our fault.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,810
So how can we work with the different types of errors then? We have to differentiate.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:35,080
There are errors where an error is thrown, an error is a technical object in a node application.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,530
So there is a built in error object which we can throw

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,780
that's also a javascript language features,

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,070
basically all programming languages have such a feature.

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,340
We also can have scenarios where we can't continue with our code but there is no technical error.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,640
An example would be that we try to log a user in but the email address does not exist,

44
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,920
this is not really a technical error,

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,900
there is no error being thrown but we know we can't continue

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,670
and so we want to check for this scenario as well and handle it appropriately.

47
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,250
Now for the errors thrown part, we have certain tools we can use to test code and catch potential errors

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,570
so that we can handle them gracefully

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,900
and for synchronous code, that would be try catch blocks. For asynchronous code with promises, we have

50
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,840
then and catch which you already saw quite a lot throughout this course.

51
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,920
In the end in both scenarios, we then have the choice if we want to directly handle the error or if we

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,040
use a mechanism built into express, a special error handling middleware which we haven't used thus far

53
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,900
which you can use to catch errors and then return a response to the user and I'll show how this works

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,940
in this module of course. For this scenario that no error is thrown,

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,440
well we just have to check values with if checks for example and then we can decide whether we want to

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,650
throw an error, to kind of enter the left world here and then kick off that error handling process

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,250
or if we want to directly handle the error which is not a technical error but where we simply add some

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,610
code that can continue with the missing input data

59
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,170
for example. In all cases, we've got different ways of communicating with our users.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,490
We can return an error page,

61
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,050
so a dedicated page that informs the user hey we have a problem and that of course should be kind of

62
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,220
the last resort because there the user loses all his input, can't continue.

63
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:44,610
We also can return the page which user was on and just give some error information,

64
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,850
that is what we did for validating for example, there we returned the page the user was on, kept the input

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,440
values and just added an error message.

66
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,860
Or we could redirect,

67
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,060
for example if we try to access a page which we are not authenticated to visit, then we can redirect the user.

68
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,970
So these are the different tools

69
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,810
we have, the different ways of working with errors we have

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,910
and now let's dive into our code and see what we're already using and what we can use.
