00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.160
Were you successful? Let's add it together. I'll add a new html file in views and I'll name it

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.730
404.html

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.180
but the name is totally up to you,

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.190
well it has to be a html file of course. I'll then create a new html5 skeleton with the help of visual

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.210
studio code here and then here I'll name this

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.330
Page Not Found,

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.090
that sounds like a fitting title

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.080
and now you can get of course really creative here,

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.480
I will in the end just add an h1 tag where I say Page Not Found,

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.450
obviously you can add more content here if you want.

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.040
Now I want to return this html file

12
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.560
whenever we make it into this middleware and therefore again, I should send a file here

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.560
but obviously I want to construct the path with the help of the path module to make it work on all operating

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.400
systems,

15
00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:04.300
so require the path here and then go down there, send and don't send but send a file and that file will

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.450
use a path which we construct here with their name

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.060
and now here's a gotcha,

18
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.760
we already are in the project folder here because we're in app.js,

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.570
so we don't need to go up a level here because we already are in the root folder.

20
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.470
Instead here we can go right away into the views folder and then serve the 404.html file, like this,

21
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.680
we also still want to set this status code because we still have a 404 error.

22
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.530
If you now save this and you enter any random route that doesn't exist, you should see that page not

23
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.850
found being served

24
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.230
and you see that 404 error being sent back too.

25
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.580
So this is now working too and

26
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.450
and this is now a way better, well way of serving this all but styling would also be nice, wouldn't

27
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.850
it?

28
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.330
So let's work on this over the next lectures.
