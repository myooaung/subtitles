00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.160
Now that we learned what the core idea is and how we transfer data and that data is king in a rest API,

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.050
let's have a look at the routing,

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.510
so how do we communicate between client and server?

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.020
So we get client and server and on the server, we got our server side logic, we reach out to databases and so

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.660
on.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.440
Now we send a request from the client to the server and how do we do that?

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.350
Well in a traditional web app as we built it thus far

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.310
in the course, we did it of course by simply adding a link on our html page for example or we had

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.240
a form with a button and we defined the form action and the method.

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.210
Well it's not that far off for rest

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.620
APIs. We still send the request

12
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.170
to a combination of http method, also called http verb and a path on the server.

13
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.540
So what we defined thus far still will be used kind of, we still define such paths, on the server, on the

14
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.930
server side routing where we wait for incoming requests and we also define certain http methods we want

15
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.930
to handle for these paths so that not all requests can reach all paths.

16
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.080
These requests would be sent from the client through, when working in the browser, through asynchronous

17
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.930
javascript,

18
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.840
so with the fetch API for example or with Ajax and on mobile apps and so on, we also get special clients.

19
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.890
The core thing here is we in the end still send normal requests,

20
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.980
these are totally normal requests that just don't expect any html response and we send a combination

21
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.080
of http method and path and this is how we communicate with our server.

22
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.670
Now in the rest world or in the API world, we like to call these things here API andpoints,

23
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.780
so when you hear me talk about an API endpoint, I'm talking about the combination of a http method like

24
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:06.800
post and get and the respective path. These are the endpoints we defined on our rest API

25
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.370
and we defined a logic that should execute on the server when a request reaches such an endpoint.

26
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.500
Now talking about http methods, there are more methods than just get and post. I did mention this before

27
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.700
in the course but when working with the browser only and not with javascript in the browser but just

28
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.240
with forms and links, then we only have get and post available.

29
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.950
These are the two methods the browser natively knows or the browser html elements know

30
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.800
so to say. When using asynchronous requests through javascript or when building mobile apps and so on and

31
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.260
using their respective http clients, you have access to more http methods

32
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.190
and we actually already saw that in the asynchronous requests module of this course. Besides get which is

33
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.010
responsible for getting a resource from the server and post which is responsible for posting a resource

34
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.870
to the server which means create it on the server or append it to an existing let's say array of resources,

35
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.540
besides these two methods which we re-used a lot throughout the course, we have access to put which we would

36
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.750
use if we want to put a resource onto the server, which means we want to create it or overwrite an existing

37
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.380
resource,

38
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.140
posts will never overwrite or should never overwrite.

39
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.980
We also have access to patch which is used for updating parts of an existing resource, so not overwrite

40
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.080
it entirely necessarily but update parts of it.

41
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.610
We have access to delete which allows us to delete a resource on the server and also there is a special

42
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.440
options http method which we will use too in this module

43
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.830
indirectly though, it is sent automatically by the browser and I will come back to it.

44
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.620
This basically is a request which the browser will send automatically to find out if the next request

45
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.450
it tries to do,

46
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.930
for example delete something, if that is actually allowed and I will come back to that.

47
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.990
So these are the http methods

48
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.600
we will work with and the methods we typically work with when building a rest API

49
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.170
especially the first five ones, the orange ones are important.

50
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.760
Now let me also highlight that in theory, you can do whatever you want when a request with a certain

51
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.530
method reaches a certain path.

52
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.900
So for the rest world, we should use a post request to create or append a resource.

53
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.430
No one is stopping you from deleting something on a server because ultimately, you only define a method

54
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.040
path pair on your server side and then you run any code you want

55
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.070
and what happens in that code is not restricted by the method that was used to execute that code.

56
00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.220
You can restrict it yourself and you want to implement the rest API that follows these ideas here but

57
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.260
you don't have to

58
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.330
and that's just important to highlight.

59
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.180
It's common and it's a good practice, it's a best practice to use these methods in this way because then

60
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.770
anyone who's using your API clearly knows what to expect to happen on the server for a given method

61
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.760
but in theory no one is stopping you from doing something else.

62
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.470
So these are the http methods.
