Deleting works but when I try to add product and I'll just enter some dummy data here, that fails and

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:20.000
it seems to fail because I would imagine that in save here, we somehow make it into this if block. So

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.430
that _id is the problem and that makes sense because I actually do initialize

4
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.510
_id here at the beginning by creating a new mongodb object id.

5
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.480
So even if we pass no ID and this therefore is undefined, this will create an object and store it in

6
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.460
_id,

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.870
so _id down there will always be defined

8
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.990
and if it's just such an empty or automatically generated object id object, this should be the issue here.

9
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.710
So how can I overcome this?

10
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.660
Well for example with a ternary expression, we can check if ID exists basically,

11
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.110
so if this returns true in an if statement and if it's the case, then I want to create my object id object

12
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.060
otherwise I'll store null and null will be treated as false down there.

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.520
So with this tiny change in place, with this ternary expression added in the product model, we should be

14
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.660
able to add a product real quick with some dummy values

15
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.560
and now it's created.

16
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.820
So now this is working

17
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.310
and it was just the fact that we were always creating such an objectid object which we shouldn't.
