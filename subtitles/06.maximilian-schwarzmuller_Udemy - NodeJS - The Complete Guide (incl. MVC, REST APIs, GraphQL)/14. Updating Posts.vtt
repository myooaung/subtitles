00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.630
We're making very good progress, we're able to create posts, view posts, view a single post, upload files,

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.080
validate content,

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.450
all great.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.910
Now what is missing?

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.030
We want to be able to edit posts,

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.690
we want to be able to delete posts and authentication and users and connecting posts to users,

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.840
this is all missing, now

8
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.890
let's continue with editing and deleting posts before we dive into the authentication and user related things.

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.640
So for that, let's go to our feed routes in our node rest API project and there, I'll add a new route,

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.750
I want to be able to edit posts now and for that

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.170
I will use a new http method which we haven't used before.

12
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.020
Editing a post essentially is like replacing it, replacing the old post with a new one, we'll keep the

13
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.130
old ID but that is it. Since we'll replace a resource, I'll use the put method here and the put method is

14
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.470
one you learned about in the last module but which we haven't used before because with normal browser

15
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.020
forms,

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.070
you're not able to send it, through asynchronous requests triggered by javascript

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.320
you are however. Now we need a url here and the url will be /post and then also the ID of

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.870
the post encoded in the url,

19
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.920
so colon post ID.

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.900
Now we also need a controller action to handle that,

21
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.510
the important thing about put requests and the same is true for patch requests

22
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.940
by the way is that they also have a request body, just like post requests

23
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.710
but you can also have parameters in the

24
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.470
url,

25
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.670
well that would have been the case for post requests too by the way

26
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.050
but the important thing is we have a body for these request, we can add a request body and that will hold

27
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.010
the actual post data that I want to well use and that I want to use to replace my existing post,

28
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.890
so let's work on the controller now. In the feed controller at the bottom, I'll add a new action and I'll

29
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.470
name it update host,

30
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.580
the name is up to you but this is what we'll do,

31
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.670
we'll update the post in there,

32
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.360
this is the function and in here, in this function,

33
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.910
I can

34
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.510
first of all retrieve my post ID from my request params because we just added it there, right. In my

35
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.180
route,

36
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.730
host ID is a parameter which of course I can extract.

37
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.810
Now when updating a post I also will extract my title, so request body title, I will extract my content,

38
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.750
request body content and I want to extract my file, my image

39
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.420
url, however for that url

40
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.510
we have two options when updating. The first option is and that will be my default,

41
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.680
that image url is part of the incoming request and it's just some text in the request body.

42
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.250
That would be the case if no new file was added,

43
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.770
if no new file was picked, then my frontend code has all the logic to take the existing url and

44
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.100
keep that but we might have picked a file

45
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.660
and in this case request file will be set and I can now set image url equal to request file path,

46
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.820
this is the alternative. After all of this, at least one of the two should be set,

47
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.980
so if image url is not set at this point because we were not able to extract it from there and we

48
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.260
did not make it into this if statement, then we should throw an error

49
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:51.910
so here I will prepare a new error, no file picked, I'll set my status code to 422 and I will throw

50
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.870
that error here.

51
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.010
So that's my first little piece of validation,

52
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.350
we'll add more validation of course,

53
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.260
normally we should have an image url however. Now I have one little mistake here by the way,

54
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.570
this should be image here, what I retrieve from the frontend

55
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.790
and we need to tweak our frontend a little bit too.

56
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.440
There in feed.js,

57
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.770
in source pages feed, feed.js,

58
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:26.830
when we load all posts, so in load posts, that is when we basically load to post data from the server including

59
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.220
our image url.

60
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.390
Now we then store the post here in the frontend so that the rest of the react application,

61
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.330
the rest of the code I prepared can handle that, we need to tweak this line a little bit.

62
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.220
There you should access res data posts but we have to map this, which is a default javascript method into

63
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.720
a different kind of array or every element has to be changed a little bit.

64
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.300
Map takes a function that executes on every element in the array and it gets the element which in our

65
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.920
case is a post as an argument and then we return, 

66
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.190
well the updated version of that object, so I return a new object here where I will use the spread operator

67
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:17.650
to get all the properties of my post object and then I'll add an image path key here which is

68
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.490
post.imageurl

69
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.320
.

70
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.260
Now image url

71
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.280
here is referring to the property I am storing on my server side,

72
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.480
there we are restoring a path to an image in the image url key,

73
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.440
you could have name this differently, if you named it differently here,

74
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.000
you would have to name it differently here.

75
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.660
Now I'm storing the original path here because when I'm viewing a single post for example, I do extract

76
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.500
that image url and I append my url to the domain.

77
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.110
Now the path should be well just a path without a domain

78
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.460
because I'm keeping that here and this will get reused later when we edit

79
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.240
this through this edit modal,

80
00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.570
behind the scenes this path will be stored and if I don't choose a new file here, this path will be submitted

81
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:09.640
with my edited post and there, the path will be stored in a property named image,

82
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.040
you can see that in the components, the feed edit component under feed, feed edit,

83
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.150
there you could see all the internals, if you know a little bit of react

84
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.660
you can see the internals and see that I'm extracting my image path and I'm storing it in an image key

85
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.510
ultimately.

86
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.420
I don't want to dive too deep into react but this is what I'm doing on the frontend and this was one

87
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.600
adjustment that was required and on the server side, we can now extract our image here from the body and

88
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:46.040
either this is set or we selected a new file in which case a file will be found.

89
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.960
So now we can continue working on update post and we can continue working by

90
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.180
first of all adding more validation which we do in our routes of course.

91
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.540
Well there I will copy that array from my post route and I will add it here,

92
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.460
so for my put route I also want to validate the title, by the way we should switch that back to 5 characters

93
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.560
of length for both posting and putting.

94
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.700
So I will validate these two things,

95
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.400
I'll not validate my image because that is done directly in the controller action and I don't need to do

96
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.450
any other validations for now.

97
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.230
So with that added, let's go back to the controller and let's copy the validation logic from the post

98
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.180
route where I gather all my errors and then I check for errors not being empty

99
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.400
and then I would throw an error.

100
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:43.110
So before I extract anything else, I'll check these things in update post, whether I have any errors and

101
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.400
if I have, I'll throw an error.

102
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.010
If I don't have errors, I continue, check the file and if we make it down here,

103
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.720
so after all these if statements, then I know I have valid data

104
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.290
and now we can update it in the database. To update it in the database,

105
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:09.580
I will find my post by ID for the post ID which I extracted from the url, then I can do something or

106
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:16.270
we might have an error, if we have an error, I'll reuse that error handling logic you find in other places,

107
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.590
in other actions,

108
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.170
so I'll add my status code in the next, the error. If I am successful,

109
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.030
I know we have no database error,

110
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.640
I still need to check if post is undefined

111
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:34.810
which means we didn't find a post, in which case I will also throw an error just as we did it for getting

112
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.920
a single post,

113
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.900
I can copy that logic and again if you are copying a lot of code,

114
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.070
you might of course also refactor that,

115
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.000
I like the more verbose approach

116
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.550
to make sure we all understand each step we take in each action creator

117
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.390
and if we make it past this if check inside of the then block, then we found a post and then I want to

118
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.670
update the post of course.

119
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:04.690
So here I'll set my post title equal to the title I extracted, I'll set my post image url

120
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:10.810
equal to the image url I extracted and I'll set my post content equal to the content

121
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.760
I extracted

122
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:20.550
and then I can return post save here to save that updated post back to the database,

123
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.500
overriding the old post but keeping the old ID

124
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.890
and then here we get the result of that save operation

125
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.480
and here I want to return a response with a status code of 200.

126
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:40.510
We didn't create a new resource so it's not 201, with some json code or some json data where I say

127
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:49.830
post updated maybe and where I return that updated post which is stored in the result in the end.

128
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.840
So this is now the updating logic here,

129
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.010
there is one more thing we can add and that is some logic to delete the image.

130
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.690
For that I'll add a little helper function down there,

131
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:09.140
clear image which is a function that accepts a file path as an argument and then I will use the file

132
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.240
system package nodejs offers,

133
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.480
so I'll import it at the top by requiring fs

134
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.000
and with that imported in that clear image function here, I'll

135
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.430
first of all construct my file path for which I'll also import the path package by the way so

136
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:38.760
let's import that at the top too and now the file path can be constructed by joining dir name, then going

137
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.860
up one folder because we're running this inside of the controllers folder which is not where we will find

138
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.310
images,

139
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:51.030
so we should go up one folder to be in the root folder and then we look for whatever file path we got

140
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.500
here.

141
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.020
So images and then the image name would be the case in our application

142
00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:05.140
and I can then use the unlink function to delete that file by passing the file path to it and we can

143
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.140
also log any error message

144
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.660
and I want to trigger that clear image function when ever I uploaded a new image.

145
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:25.660
So inside of my update post action creator, right before I save my updated post maybe, I'll check if my

146
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.210
image url which is the path to the image,

147
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.310
if that is not equal to post image url.

148
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.170
So to the image url I stored in my post before,

149
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.790
if they're not equal it obviously changed, so I uploaded a new file and that is where I will execute

150
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.860
clear image and pass the old image

151
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.930
url, so the old path as an argument.

152
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.180
Now with that, we got all in place here in the controller,

153
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.690
now we can go to the route and there we still need to register that controller action on the put route,

154
00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.120
so on the feed controller I access update post here, that's one important step

155
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:08.960
and on the frontend so in the react code, we also need to do something. There in source feed, feed.js

156
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.390
in the

157
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.030
finish edit handler function there, we need to adjust our code now.

158
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:24.510
There we set up our form data which is correct for updating as well

159
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.800
but if we are in edit mode which will be the case if we make it inside this if statement due to the

160
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:36.720
logic I configured on the frontend, we want to send a request to localhost 8080

161
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.440
/feed/post/ and

162
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:48.770
now we need the post ID which we get from this state edit post._id,

163
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.390
that is where it will be stored in my react app and I'll set the method to put because we created a

164
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.580
put route.

165
00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:01.350
Now with that, we can save all that and try that out and hopefully not get an error.

166
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.670
Let's edit the second doc here and add a couple of exclamation marks in both title and content.

167
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.770
Let's not choose a new file,

168
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.300
it's looking good, I see my exclamation marks there,

169
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.840
I see them in the content as well.

170
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:20.870
Here I get a confirmation message that should looks good and on the backend, I still only have one image,

171
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.950
well that makes sense because I didn't replace it anyways.

172
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.520
Let's now replace it by editing that same doc again,

173
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.350
let's not change title and content but choose a different file,

174
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.610
maybe that coffee mug, click accept, post updated is looking good,

175
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.420
it's not a doc any more so the title is not correct but on the backend, we only have the coffee mug now,

176
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.150
so updating seems to work

177
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.370
and of course we can confirm this by viewing that image as well,

178
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.190
there we also see all the updated data.

179
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.320
So that is working

180
00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.600
and with that, only deleting is missing before we can finally start working on authentication.
