1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,800
In the last module, you learned how to use SQL in a nodejs application

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,620
and we did this at the example of a MySQL database which we want to use to store data.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:21,050
Now we didn't complete the project with that SQL approach simply because in this module, we'll now implement

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,220
other features like for example working with the shopping cart with the help of sequelize.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,650
This will still use a SQL database, still use the same

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,240
MySQL database actually behind the scenes or in the background as a database but the code we write

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,200
will be different.

8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,760
Instead of SQL statements as we have them here and as we wrote them in the last module, we'll use

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:54,410
a third party package that allows us to work with javascript objects and convenient methods to create

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,720
new elements in the database, to edit them, to delete them or to find them and also to connect them

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,570
because you remember, a SQL database typically also works with relations

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,040
and we got lot of these in our current project.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,410
So this is what we'll dive into in this module, 

14
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,820
you'll learn what exactly sequelize,

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:21,170
this third party package is and how you can use it and we'll then implement our products and our cart

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,530
and so on in this module with sequelize.
