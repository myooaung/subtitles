00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.440
Editing fails here

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.520
and do you have an idea why it fails?

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.930
It fails because of my check here,

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.160
I compare the product user ID to the request user ID.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.390
Now we have a type problem again, I should convert both to a string because I'm also checking for type

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.250
equality.

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.770
So with this change, both converted to a string and not this strange object id thing, with this in place,

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.440
now if I login or if I'm logged in with the right account,

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.660
now I can update this and I can also delete this.

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.330
So this now all works with the right account,

11
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.370
so with the account who created it

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.210
but it will not work if I login with the wrong account because if I login there,

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.990
so this is now the account which did not create it,

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060
I can view it on the normal pages,

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.980
I can add it to my cart if I want to but under admin products, I do not see it

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.120
and even if I would see it, I could not interact with it.
