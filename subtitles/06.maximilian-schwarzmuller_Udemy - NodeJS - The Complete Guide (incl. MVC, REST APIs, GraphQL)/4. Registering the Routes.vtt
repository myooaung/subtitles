00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.340
So let's start with registering the routes then

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.790
and for this I will go into the routes folder. There we have admin and shop and this still sounds like

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.700
a decent differentiation

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.400
and let's start with the shop related routes.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.600
Right now we got the starting page,

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.930
now we will also need a get route for /products because if we have a look into our navigation.ejs

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.040
file, this is this new link which we added, so /products. We'll also need /cart because that's

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.870
another new link we have and

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.450
this will also be a get route and I will of course also add controller functions

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.730
but I'll first define all the routes. So I'll also need /cart and later, I'll also need a route for

11
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.990
the checkout process,

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.290
so /checkout is already something we can also add and obviously you are free to edit any of these

13
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.880
paths to your liking,

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.790
just make sure to then adjust the links you might have in your application. Now

15
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.220
besides visiting /products, we will also need a single product and that will then actually contain

16
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.530
some new logic to which I will come back

17
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.980
so let's stick to these general routes for now.

18
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.980
Of course we also need more than just the shop routes,

19
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.580
we also got some admin routes, in a navigation for example,

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.210
we got the new admin products here and then we'll also need a route for editing,

21
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.540
we'll add this later and for deleting, also something I'll add later.

22
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.290
So for now let's simply go to admin.js and there I will add

23
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.710
a new get route because I want to load a new page and that will just be /products. Now

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.730
never forget this is just as the other routes also already in a path that starts with /admin

25
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.410
because this is what we filter for in app.js and of course we'll also need a controller function for that.

26
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.000
Ok

27
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.190
so this is looking good,

28
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.600
now how about the controllers?

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.460
Now we can follow different approaches there,

30
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.800
obviously most of the things we have are still related to products but we also got some new routes like

31
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.420
cart or checkout

32
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.710
and later we'll also add orders for example.

33
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.270
So we got that,

34
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.740
now these are implicitly of course related to products right,

35
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.630
we do buy products in the end

36
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.100
but we could also argue that semantically or from a logic perspective, they rather belong to the general

37
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.980
shop idea.

38
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.450
So now we might be back to actually using a shop controller and a new admin controller so that we can

39
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.330
split our logic by these two sections,

40
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.820
alternatively you could of course also think about using a products controller and a shop controller and

41
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.160
have everything related to products only in the products controller and things like cart and checkout

42
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.690
in the shop controller

43
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.440
but I will go for this setup.

44
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.020
Now that of course means that my two admin related routes, get add product and post add product should

45
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.470
be removed from the shop.js

46
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.850
file and go into the admin.js file,

47
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.440
this makes more sense.

48
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.690
I will also need my model here though,

49
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.950
so let's take that import and also add it here in the admin.js file.

50
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.380
This has implications for my routes because in the admin routes,

51
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.620
I'm still importing the shop controller,

52
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.740
well this should now become the admin controller and therefore I should also rename it to admin controller

53
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.610
up here and then replace it down there and a similar thing needs to be done in the shop.js file in

54
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.830
the routes folder.

55
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:48.120
There we import the shop controller which is good but I should also name it shop controller then and then of course

56
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.350
also replace that.

57
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.260
So this looks a bit cleaner to me

58
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.630
and with that, we can now also hook up our other routes. For this of course we first of all need to add them though,

59
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:08.390
so let's start with shop.js and there I will export a new page and that should be my get index function

60
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.000
here, there

61
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:19.040
I want to render the index page so I will get my middleware function here and in there of course I also

62
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.010
want to fetch some products and render a view.

63
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.110
For now I will therefore simply copy the logic from get products,

64
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.870
so for now the two pages are the same but I will render shop index here,

65
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.890
so using that index page view here

66
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.590
and even if we have the same products on there, we can of course work on the view and show a different

67
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.540
starting text there for the starting page,

68
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.020
anything like that.

69
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.510
OK now we got get index and get products and if we go to the routes file,

70
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.580
this means that for slash anything, I actually want to load the get index function

71
00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.580
here in my controller because that is the starting page and it's for /products that I want to load

72
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.640
get products instead.

73
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.010
We also need to load the cart and checkout pages and therefore let's go back to the shop controller

74
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.480
and there, we got get index and get products,

75
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.440
I will export something new and that will be get cart and there again, request, response, next is what

76
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.450
I have here

77
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:35.460
and I will render a new view here and that view will be shop/cart, pointing at the cart.ejs

78
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.390
file in the shop folder and I will pass some data to it,

79
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.800
for example I need to set the path to /cart. By the way for product list here,

80
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.940
I also need to set it to /products because that is the path we're checking for in the navigation,

81
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.480
we can also change the title here maybe to all products and on the starting page,

82
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.510
I leave it at shop.

83
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.920
I pass the products to both views,

84
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.520
I don't really need that code anymore,

85
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.000
that is a relict we have from the handlebars times,

86
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.690
we don't need that so we can remove that.

87
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.330
Now for the cart view,

88
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:21.250
I will therefore also add a page title and there, I will simply say your cart and that is it for now,

89
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.760
later we'll also add or load the cart items

90
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.940
but let's not focus on that for the moment.

91
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.240
Last but not least, let's load the checkout page with get checkout

92
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.840
and there we have a request, the response and next and here I then also render a view,

93
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.110
the view here is shop checkout

94
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.270
and then we need to pass some data where I set the path to /checkout and where I also set the page

95
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.430
title to checkout, so that all our views get the data they should need.

96
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.930
Now that's looking good,

97
00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.860
let's go back to the shop.js file in the routes folder then and there we can use these new routes. For

98
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.930
the cart route,

99
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:10.970
we can use shop controller get cart and for checkout, we can use shop controller get checkout, the two

100
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.810
new controller functions we created.

101
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.470
Now we're almost done with the controllers and the routes, at least the basic setup,

102
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.890
let's now go to admin.js and there we also have one route, products,

103
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.540
so let's go to the admin.js in the controllers folder and there I will add a new route,

104
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:40.380
exports get products is my normal middleware function and here I basically want to do the same as I

105
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.260
do in get products in the shop. Here

106
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.740
I simply want to fetch all products and then render my view, so I will copy that code, go to admin.js

107
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.730
and put that into this route,

108
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.770
fetch all products but of course then render a different view,

109
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.650
I want to render admin/products,

110
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.110
so this view here should be rendered.

111
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.230
I will also name it admin products

112
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:13.160
and the path will be /admin/products to mark that correctly in the navigation. With all

113
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.730
that setup,

114
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:19.240
if we go back and reload, we see a white page which is a good sign because it's not an error

115
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:26.300
and we do see a white page because actually for slash nothing which is the route I'm on here, we load

116
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.170
or we execute get index in the shop controller

117
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:36.020
and this actually yields us shop index which happens to be an empty ejs view,

118
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.860
so therefore we see an empty page,

119
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.150
makes sense.

120
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.150
Let's take the code from product list.ejs and copy it into index.ejs

121
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:51.770
and if we leave it as it is and we reload, we now see shop and we see the products, the same is the case

122
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.430
for the products page because they share the same code for now,

123
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.220
cart is empty again

124
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.840
and therefore we should add some content there too, at least we should include the head and the navigation

125
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.570
so that we see something,

126
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.710
so let's go to cart.ejs and add that include of the head,

127
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.430
we don't need product.css here for now,

128
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:20.010
we got the body start and then we get the navigation and then let's simply also add end.ejs so that

129
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.030
we have a valid html document.

130
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:30.470
With that added, if I reload this route here, we also see cart with nothing on, add product should still work

131
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.930
and admin products won't work, let's copy the code from cart.ejs

132
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:41.120
and let's head over to products in the admin folder, in the views folder, paste it in there so that we at

133
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.140
least see that and therefore if I now click on admin products,

134
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.990
it looks like it tries to render the 404 page but has an error there.

135
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.540
Now that means two things,

136
00:09:52.580 --> 00:10:00.150
for one our route seems to be wrong, in admin.js in the routes folder, /products should be right,

137
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.150
yeah but

138
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.640
I didn't hook up my admin controller there, so we should add admin controller get products here in admin.js

139
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:13.430
in the routes folder and on the other hand, also our 404 page had an issue because there

140
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.340
we see that the path is not defined,

141
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.610
so what I'm missing here is that for my 404 controller, the error controller to be precise,

142
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:31.070
I also need to add a path here because I try to extract that path in my navigation and therefore I

143
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.330
also should set the path here and I can set it to /404,

144
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.490
doesn't really matter,

145
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.890
it just needs to be there.

146
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.700
So now reloading works because that's admin products

147
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.600
but now even an unknown route will work again.

148
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.890
So this is looking good,

149
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:51.800
also note that the active item is displayed correctly in the navigation and therefore we made a huge

150
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.750
step forward,

151
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.620
we added a bunch of views, the fitting routes and controller actions even though they don't do that much yet.

152
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.900
Now it's time to work a bit on the views and add a bit of logic already.
