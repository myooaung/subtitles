00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,610
In the last module, we continued working on our application

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,960
but now we need the ability to pass some dynamic data through our routes.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,870
We want to be able to encode some information in our url so that we can for example pass a product

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:25,980
ID as part of the url. In this module, you will learn how you can do that, how you can actually submit

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,110
or send data

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,980
through the url and when you would not do that and put it into the request body instead and we'll also

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,670
continue working on our models, to be precise you will learn about how to pass route params, route parameters

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,050
and how to use query parameters,

9
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,380
both important things that the express router supports.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:53,060
But besides that we'll not just pass that information, in this module we'll also use it to enhance our

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,760
models

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,030
and with that I mean will add more functionalities, we'll even add a new model.

13
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,670
So with that, let's start and let's learn how we can pass data and how we can use that data then.
