00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,500
We worked a bit on the cart model, some things are still missing

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,670
for example we never display our cart and we also never really, we're not able to delete an item from

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,510
the cart but let's ignore that for the moment,

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,240
let's instead focus on editing a product.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,790
We've got the edit product ejs file and in the end what I want to do in there is I want to render

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,050
the same form I have for add product,

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,840
the difference will be that I want to pre-populate that form with the values of the product I want

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,390
to edit.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,070
Now if I'm using the same html code in the end, it would make sense to reuse the same template. If you

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,750
ever plan on using a different one, it doesn't but here it makes sense.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,910
So what I will do is I'll take my add product.ejs code and move it into edit product because I find

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,580
this to be the more generic name and I'll delete the add product.ejs file,

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,940
so now we just have edit producte.ejs with all the html code in there that we need.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,450
Now first of all, that means that I have to load that file in admin.js

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:20,950
when we load get add product, I no longer need the add product path here, I need edit product here only, 

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,130
the part down there can stay add product because that is what we use for highlighting a certain navigation

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,160
item. By the way we can get rid of these additional information pieces.

18
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,300
So now this should still work, if I click on add product

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,260
I still see that form,

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,590
so that's looking good.

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,980
However for editing a product, I now also want to have a route and I want to use that same view, so

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,140
I'll copy that route

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,390
here and add it maybe below post add product to keep these two together

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:04,780
and here I will have get edit product as an action name and I also want to render edit product here.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,570
The difference is that here I plan on passing in my product information

26
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,850
but the problem is of course how should I reach this controller action

27
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,240
and my idea is that since I already have my edit button here,

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,050
if I click that I don't want to call edit product like this,

29
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,920
I also want to add the ID of the product I want to edit.

30
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,330
So if I grab a real ID from my products.json file like this one,

31
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,460
then I would have that in the url

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,340
and if I load this, now I want to have the form pre-populated with the data for this product and if I

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,370
hit the save button, I of course don't want to create this product but simply edit the existing one. Now

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,820
this means that I need two things,

35
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:58,250
the ID I need to pass that and the information that I want to edit a product instead of create it.

36
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,830
Well if we go to our admin routes, we can add a new route

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,510
first of all, this edit product route here with the ID and you learned how that works actually, you

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,830
can add a new route here, get route

39
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:19,110
will be at slash and then here, the /admin is available for all routes in the admin.js file

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,650
anyways as you know, so it's just edit product

41
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,900
and then the ID and again this is a variable,

42
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,710
a dynamic path segment indicated with a colon. And then we can load the admin controller and there the get

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,710
edit product

44
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,260
action we just added.

45
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,320
So this is step number one

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,300
and actually, we now already can go to our admin.js controller

47
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,210
and here we obviously know that we want to edit a product.

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:57,530
So what we can do is we can pass an additional information field to our view editing and set this to true

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,040
maybe so that we can check this with an if condition to find out

50
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:07,070
for example if upon clicking that save button, we should try to add the product and send a request to

51
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,020
that route or try to edit it and send it to a different route.

52
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:19,670
But let's say we want to get an additional confirmation by ensuring that people have to pass us a so-called

53
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:26,360
query parameter in the url. A query parameter can be added to any url by adding a question mark and

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,890
then a key value pair separated by an equal sign, like edit equals true

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,400
and you can have multiple query parameters by separating and them with and percents,

56
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:45,050
so we could also have title equals new for example.

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,460
So this is possible

58
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,250
and this is so-called optional data,

59
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,930
the path here, the route which gets reached is determined by the part up to the question mark.

60
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,640
So you don't need to add any information about query parameters

61
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,960
you might get to your routes file, these paths are not affected but you can
