1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,500
That's it for the SQL part of this course. You learned about SQL, that it's a database philosophy or

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:19,350
schema engine type that uses strict data schemas and relations in the databases that use SQL and

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,840
that you can easily connect to such databases with nodejs, with packages like MySQL too. There we

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
had to write all the SQL queries manually though

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
and you also have to configure the database manually, add tables manually, set up relations and that is

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,880
a lot of work and definitely something you need to learn

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,230
in addition to nodejs, it's its own language essentially

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,100
or you use packages like sequelize. Sequelize allows you to not write SQL queries but instead interact

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,020
with your database through models you define and not just models but also relations, so-called associations

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,670
in the sequelize world.

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,850
That gives you a lot of magic methods that allow you to easily connect data, add data, delete data,

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,320
basically what you saw in this module.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
Now you could easily create an entire course just about SQL and sequelize

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,500
and that is not what this course is, it's the complete node course, not the complete sequelize

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,780
course. I strongly encourage you to dive into the sequelize docs if you plan on continuing with that to

16
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:31,650
learn all the ins and outs of this package and simply play around with it, build your own demo applications

17
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,760
and try out the different features, different types of relations and so on.

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,310
We'll move on here and we'll learn about a different way of storing data with a NoSQL approach in mongodb.

19
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,250
This is what we'll dive into in the next modules.
