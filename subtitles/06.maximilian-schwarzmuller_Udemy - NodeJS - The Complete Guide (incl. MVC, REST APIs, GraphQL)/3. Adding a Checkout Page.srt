1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,400
To add payment to our application, let's work on that

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,940
checkout.ejs file with which we never work thus far.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,510
I want to go there before I actually place an order when I click on order now in my cart, so I'll go

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,140
to this page first.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,800
For that, I'll copy the content of cart.ejs

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,520
add it in checkout.ejs to make sure that I have my default head.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,930
I'll get rid of that stylesheet though, I don't need it here,

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,840
I want to include the navigation, 

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,490
the main content will be totally different though,

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,750
I will keep my body however, so or my end here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,540
So with that, I have everything set up to have a basic checkout page,

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,410
now let's first of all make sure we reach that before we start adding stripe.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,740
For that we need a new route of course in a shop.js file,

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:04,130
here we have our create order route and in the end what I need is a new route, a get route which we

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,600
can name checkout and there,

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,800
I want to be authenticated because we can only buy something if we are logged in let's say and

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,140
then I'll use my shop controller and there, get checkout which is an action I still have to create. And in

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:26,070
that get checkout page then, we'll have the possibility to create an order and so on.

19
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,730
So for now, let's just add this and let's work on our controller then, on our shop controller and there

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,940
I need a get checkout method.

21
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:44,320
So maybe here before post order because logically, it comes prior to that, I'll have get checkout with request

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:53,880
response and next and in there, I want to render my checkout page. So we can of course grab one of our

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,420
other render functions here,

24
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,090
render that, here I will render shop/checkout,

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,720
the path can be checkout, it doesn't really matter, we don't have a naviagtion

26
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,000
item we want to highlight, here we can checkout as a text

27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,290
and of course we need some data for the checkout.

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,110
Now what do I want to return here?

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,140
Well in the end,

30
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:23,050
I will need the same data as I have in my cart, so I need my products here which I do have in the cart,

31
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,810
so I can actually copy that entire code from get cart

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,640
I guess and add this here and now just make sure we use shop

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
checkout, path checkout and here,

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,020
checkout but besides that I also need to calculate the total let's say. So total sum or whatever you

35
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,780
want to name it and that total sum of course can be retrieved from our product data

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,210
because in the cart or in the products here we have in the cart,

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,410
you have to keep in mind that products is in an array of products where we have the quantity and

38
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:09,550
then a product ID field with detail data about the products because we populate this product ID field

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:20,030
with the detailed product data. So therefore, the total sum can be generated by looping through all products,

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,480
so here I can do products forEach

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,620
and create a new variable, total which is zero initially

42
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:38,490
and then there, total is equal plus equal this shortcut to add something to the existing total, so total

43
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:47,170
plus the product and then there is a quantity field times the product product ID price and then it's

44
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,270
this total which I pass to my view.

45
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,780
So that's all the data I should need in checkout view.

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,010
So now back in my checkout.ejs file,

47
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,330
now I can indeed grab that unordered list for rendering a list of items

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,800
like this, I'll go through all my products.

49
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,900
I'll remove the delete button though, it's too late at this point let's say, we can of course always cancel

50
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,350
the checkout process if we want to though,

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,810
actually I'll delete this entire form therefore, this is my unordered list and below that, we can add

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,530
a div with a h2 tag of total

53
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,690
and then here I output total sum.

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,310
Now let's have a look at that and to have a look,

55
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,050
I need to make sure that on cart.ejs when you click order now, I don't submit this form here,

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
so I will actually comment this out,

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,950
we don't need that anymore

58
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:49,700
but instead I want to have a normal anchor tag here where I say order now where I simply point at

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,310
/checkout,

60
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,850
so this new route we added and I'll just give this a class of button to look a bit like a button. With

61
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,670
all that added,

62
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,830
let's go back to our page,

63
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:09,740
let's go to products here maybe, add this to the cart and click order now and this is now my,

64
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,420
well a page here.

65
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,250
Now it's not looking super beautiful I'd say,

66
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,520
I need to include that cart.css file again because since I'm reusing the rest of the code here and we could

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,130
create our own stylesheet but I want to keep this relatively short, since I'm using all that,

68
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,720
I of course also want to use the same styles.

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,860
So now if I reload this checkout page here, it's looking ok,

70
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:40,080
the total could be placed in the middle maybe, we can do that by giving this div a class of centered

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,630
which is a utility class I added earlier in the course and now we have this checkout page.

72
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,100
Again we can always work on the visuals but it's not so much about the visuals here.

73
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,020
So now we have this total and now I want to add stripe and for that, let's first of all set up an account

74
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,350
with them.
