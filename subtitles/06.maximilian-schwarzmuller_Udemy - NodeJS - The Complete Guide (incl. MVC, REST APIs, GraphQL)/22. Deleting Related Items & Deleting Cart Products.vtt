00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.070
Our program is taking shape, we can't delete products from the cart yet though so we should definitely

2
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.310
also do that. To do that,

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.160
we still need the product ID

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.540
we want to delete

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:24.460
but now again, I will first of all get my cart for the user by accessing request user get cart and then

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.370
adding then and catch calls as we did it multiple times already

7
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.940
and in the then block here,

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:41.510
I know that I've got access to my cart and in that cart, I now want to find the products for this user

9
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.030
and to be precise, the products,

10
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.230
not all products but the product with that product ID.

11
00:00:47.480 --> 00:01:01.990
So here I will return cart get products and then simply here where ID is equal to prod ID. In the next

12
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:11.250
then block we add, I therefore have my products and I have to extract that exact product I'm looking for as

13
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.650
the first element in the products array

14
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.270
and now I want to destroy that product but not in the products table of course but only in that in-between

15
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.330
cart item table that connects my cart with that product. To do that,

16
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.450
I can simply call product cart item using that magic field sequelize gives me to access the element in

17
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.940
the in-between table and then destroy

18
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.650
and that will remove it from that in-between table.

19
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.690
Now I will return this so that I can add another then block here with the result of this operation

20
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.840
if I would care

21
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.260
and then there I'll simply redirect back to the cart, where I should then not see that product anymore.

22
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.190
Let's give it a try.

23
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.670
If we reload the cart and I delete that one with quantity three, it's gone.

24
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.950
Got no errors here

25
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.240
and if we reload the cart items, we only have one element in there with quantity two and the other one

26
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.210
is gone indeed.

27
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.160
So this is how simple we can delete connected items in this in-between table.

28
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.140
Here are the example of the cart.
