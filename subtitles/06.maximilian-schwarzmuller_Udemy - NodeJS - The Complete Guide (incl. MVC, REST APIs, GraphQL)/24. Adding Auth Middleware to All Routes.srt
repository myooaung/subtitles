00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,000
We added this isAuth middleware on the server,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,770
let's now protect all feed routes with it. Now this is super simple, we just copy that middleware and we add

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:19,040
it to every route we have there. As the first middleware before we do anything else because if no token

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,470
is there,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,810
we don't even need to continue with anything else.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,970
Every route should be protected here,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,010
so we simply add this to every single route.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,110
Now once you did add it to every route, you have to make sure that you pass the token on the front

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,540
end.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,040
So this header set up where you add this authorization header,

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,340
this is something you now need to add in a couple of places in the frontend,

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:55,890
for example our edit handlers there. There on the fetch request, we now should also add some headers and

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,100
the headers should contain our authorization token.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,770
If we scroll down further, we also got delete post handler,

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,680
well there obviously we also want to add some headers and that one header we want to add is our

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,420
authorization token. Of course we can also fetch single posts,

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,030
so in this single post.js file in the frontend code where we fetch a single post, we also want to pass

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,330
that second argument to fetch, add our headers and there, add the authorization header.

19
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,210
Now we should be able to navigate around as long as we are authenticated

20
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,190
but I also want to lock down access to ensure that I can only edit and delete posts which I actually

21
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,090
created.

22
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,430
Now in the last lecture, I deleted all posts,

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,890
so let's make sure that we first of all connect posts and users when we create new posts.
