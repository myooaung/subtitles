00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.050
Now that we are able to sign up, let's also add some functionality to ensure that we can sign in

2
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.630
and for that, we obviously have our login page and when we enter something here, we reach our post login

3
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.620
route here.

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.350
Now in there we still have the old dummy code where we just find our default user which by the way won't

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.380
exist anymore because we deleted it

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.360
and then we would create a session.

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.030
This is obviously not the approach I want to use anymore,

8
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.040
instead what I want to do is I want to find a user in here but I want to find the user by the email

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.170
the user entered,

10
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.740
so let's first of all extract that. Let's extract the email from the request body and let's extract

11
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.130
the password from the request body,

12
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.760
these are two pieces of information I need for signing a user in.

13
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.500
And then here I'll not use find by ID but find one to find one user with a specific e-mail

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.330
and there should be only one user with an email in the database and I'll find the user by looking for

15
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.850
the email field in the documents and comparing it to the e-mail value we are extracting here.

16
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.420
Now if I find a user here

17
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.900
so if I make it into here and I then have a user, then I know that we can check the password next.

18
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.900
If I don't have a user here, so if user is undefined,

19
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.080
I didn't find a user in the database and then I can simply return here,

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.980
not execute the other code and simply redirect back to login for now because the login failed because

21
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:45.170
we tried to use an e-mail which does not exist in the database as we didn't find a user for it. If we

22
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.140
make it past

23
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.080
this if check, we know that the e-mail exists but now we need to validate the password of course. We'll do this

24
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.650
with the bcrypt package again because the password is of course stored in a hashed form

25
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.090
and I mentioned that we can't reverse this,

26
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.250
so how can we now compare the password?

27
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:14.630
Well remember that bcrypt was responsible for creating the hash, bcrypt uses a certain algorithm

28
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.410
for that

29
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.040
and we can essentially pass the password the user entered into bcrypt and let bcrypt compare

30
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.840
it to the hashed value and bcrypt can then find out if the hashed value does make sense, taking into

31
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.820
account the algorithm that is used for creating that for the password you entered as plain text.

32
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.120
So if that plaintext password, if you would hash it could result in the hash password and if the answer

33
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.450
is true, then you know the user entered a valid password. And for this, brypt has the compare function

34
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.440
and there we enter the password

35
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.100
we want to check,

36
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.290
so the password we extract from the incoming request and then the hashed value against we want to compare

37
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.580
it

38
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.960
and that is found in our user document which we get from the database and there of course in the

39
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.890
password field.

40
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.970
Now this also returns a promise,

41
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.250
so here we can add then and a catch block.

42
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.620
Now if we have an error here,

43
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:24.280
so if we fail to compare this, then I also want to redirect back to the login page but if we make it

44
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.730
into the then block, then I want to check whether we were successful.

45
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.300
Now important, with compare we'll only face an error

46
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.720
if something goes wrong, not if the passwords do not match. In both a matching and a non-matching case,

47
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.540
we make it into the then block and result will be a boolean that is true if the passwords are equal,

48
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.500
so we could also name this do match to make this clearer and it will be false

49
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.330
if they are not equal.

50
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.050
So here we can check if do match is true,

51
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.750
that means the passwords are equal, the user entered a valid password and then we could return to not

52
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.280
execute any other code,

53
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.660
we could return a redirect to the starting page.

54
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.030
If we don't make it into there, then we want to redirect back to the login page because then the user

55
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.190
entered an invalid password.

56
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.650
Now we also want to set a session as we did it before

57
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.980
and that session code should only be set if we have a matching password,

58
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.950
so if the user did authenticate. Then we can still set is logged in,

59
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.790
we can still store the user in the session because we still need the user object and the user here keep

60
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.690
in mind is the user we retrieved from the database and we want to save that session and only redirect

61
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.200
in that session after we saved it successfully.

62
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.520
Therefore we should also return this to avoid code execution of this line because the callback here

63
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.070
will execute asynchronously,

64
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.580
so this needs to be returned to not execute this line here, in here

65
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.510
we don't need to return then because after this line, this line can't be reached because this line is in

66
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.570
a callback in a different function.

67
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.780
So with all that in place, we should be able to sign in if we do enter a valid password,

68
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.490
let's give this a try.

69
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.450
So keep in mind my email is test2 and I used tester as a password and first of all I will try a wrong

70
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.250
email, I'm redirected back to login

71
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.930
so this didn't seem to succeed.

72
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.680
We can also quickly go to the sessions and clear all sessions here so that we can really prove that

73
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.110
no session was created.

74
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:50.340
So now let me enter a valid email but an incorrect password and I'm again redirected back and no session

75
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.960
was created here

76
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.760
but now let me enter the valid email and the valid password

77
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.340
and now I'm on the starting page.

78
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.840
I see all options which is looking good,

79
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.630
we get no error here

80
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.240
and if I have a look at my sessions collection, we've got a session here because now I am logged in,

81
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.470
this is the user object with which I'm logged in,

82
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.770
so this is correct

83
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.660
and now we got a working login flow, taking into account our email and so on.
