00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.820
To check whether a user tries to edit or delete a post which does not belong to him, we should go to

2
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.590
on the node, rest

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.850
API project, we should go to our feed controller and there, find our update and delete methods of

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.480
course.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080
Let's start with updating a post. In there,

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.700
we find a post by ID which is all right of course and we should keep in mind that for a post, the creator

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.420
will be the ID of the user who created that.

8
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.690
So even if we do have a post here, we want to check whether that creator ID is equal to the ID of the currently

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.100
logged in user so of the ID that belongs to the token we received.

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.550
So here I'll check if post creator is equal to, excuse me, creator toString to convert this to a string, is

11
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.020
equal to request

12
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.510
user ID, so to the user ID I got from my token. If that is equal, I'm allowed to continue, if it is not equal

13
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.950
hence we need a exclamation mark here,

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.040
I'll throw an error. So here I'll create a new error,

15
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.170
not authorized,

16
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.340
set the status code to 403 which is a good status code for authorization issues

17
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.400
and I'll throw that error.

18
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.230
Now if I save that, let's check that,

19
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.700
first of all let's delete a post which we are allowed to delete,

20
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.620
like that duck.

21
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.170
If I delete that, now deleting obviously works because we never added any logic to prevent this.

22
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.780
Now let me logout and create a new user,

23
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.620
we need a different email address,

24
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.510
well let's first of all try the same one,

25
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.720
it should fail so here I'll just use Max and it fails.

26
00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.160
Now let's use an unused e-mail address and it succeeds,

27
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.660
let's now login with that newly created user,

28
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.340
now let's try editing because that is where we did add protection, the cup which was not created by that

29
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.100
user. This failed with a 403 error,

30
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.970
let's now login with the user who did create it and let's now try editing with this user and this now

31
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.990
succeeds.

32
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.980
So now we have this first check in place.

33
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.760
Let's now also add it to our delete post logic there. There

34
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.560
I find my post at the beginning and before we continue, here I basically want to implement that same

35
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.510
check.

36
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.160
I'll check the creator which is the ID of the user and compare it to the user ID extracted from the

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.530
token and if they're not equal, I will throw an error,

38
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.090
so now only authorized users should be able to delete the post of course.

39
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.640
Make sure to do that before you clear the image.

40
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.600
Now after saving this, let's go back and delete this and it succeeds because this was the right user.

41
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.680
Let's logout, let's login with this user let's say

42
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.560
and create a new post, a duck

43
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.810
with the image and some content and let's logout and login with the other user, the user who did

44
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.750
not create it and let's delete that there and you see that fails.

45
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.690
Now I didn't implement an error message there

46
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.230
and of course you could also tweak the frontend to not even show these buttons if you're not allowed

47
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.070
to edit

48
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.260
but my idea here is to show you how you can protect this on the backend

49
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.320
since of course this is a node course.

50
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.390
Therefore I deliberately let you do that so that you can see that we can prevent this on the backend

51
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.330
and indeed we can't delete this now

52
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.400
with the wrong user.
