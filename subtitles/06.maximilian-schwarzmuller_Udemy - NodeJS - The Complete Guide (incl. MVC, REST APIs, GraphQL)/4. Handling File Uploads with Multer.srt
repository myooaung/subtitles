1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,180
So let's use multer now on our backend. We can restart the server already because we installed that

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,290
package

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,100
and now let's go to our admin controller and let's work on post add product here,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,720
we want to use multer to extract incoming files. Now multer is actually not a package which we will

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,410
use in here, instead just like the body parser we use here,

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,600
multer is some middleware which we execute on every incoming request and it then simply has a look at that

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,500
request,

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,210
sees if it's multipart form data and tries to extract files if that is the case.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,970
So it is some extra middleware we add

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,230
and therefore we can import it here in our app.js file.

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,620
We can import multer by requiring it from the package like this,

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,530
multer and thereafter we can use it,

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,650
so maybe after the body parser, we can use multer.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,260
Multer has to be executed as a function and then we have to call another method on that

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,980
and that simply defines if you expect to get multiple files or only one file and we will only expect

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,880
one file,

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,460
so we use the single method

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,990
and then we define the input name which will hold the file and in our case, that is image

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,770
and this is not a random value,

20
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:32,940
I'm using image here because in my view, this input which holds the file, so this file picker here is

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,310
named image as well.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,460
So with that, we initialize multer

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,490
and let's now see if that works.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:49,830
Now to see that, we need to know how multer will actually store the incoming file and for that, let me go

25
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:59,120
back to post add product and instead of extracting request body image, let me access request file here and

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,220
let's see what this gives us,

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:08,590
I will also console log image url now.

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,420
Now let's save all that and see what that gives us.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,620
If I now try to add a product again, I'll choose that same file from before, enter any values up here,

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,220
click add product

31
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,440
and I still get an error.

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,130
Now if we go back, we see something interesting though, indeed here

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
this part is what I log here.

34
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,750
So here what we see is that multer seems to have done something,

35
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,670
it seems to have stored something in that file property on our request object

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,370
and that is what we print here essentially and it stored the name of the field where it extracted

37
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,360
that, it detected the file name, it detected the mime type

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,890
so which type of file that is

39
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,310
and that buffer here is essentially how node handles the binary data.

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,310
You'll learn about streams and buffers earlier, in the end

41
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,290
this is the result of the streamed data, the file basically was sent to our server as a stream or was

42
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,560
handled as a stream to handle it efficiently if it was bigger and then this is the collected data in a

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,330
buffer which as we learned is like a bus stop,

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,200
it gives you a way of working with the stream data, here in this case it's the combined stream and data

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,770
and we could indeed work with that buffer to turn it into a file.

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,100
Now you can actually configure multer a bit differently if

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,880
we go back to app.js, when we set up multer, we can pass an object to the multer function and there

48
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,420
we can set some options

49
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,130
and one option is the dest option.

50
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,100
Now here we could specify /images or just images, like this.

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,290
What this will do is that when I again add a product here and don't worry that it still fails because

52
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,180
we're trying to store the file in the database right now and we'll do all kinds of stuff with it for which

53
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,050
our code is not prepared but the upload works

54
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,800
but with this option set, you also see that the output down there changed a little bit.

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,900
We don't have the buffer because now multer is able to do something with the buffer, instead of just

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,620
buffering it all in memory,

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,710
it can then turn that buffer back into binary data you could say and it stores it in this path here.

58
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:27,140
So indeed if you have a look at your folder, you should not have an images folder with some file in there.

59
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,000
Now that file has some random hash name, does not have a file extension and is not recognized as an image

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,580
but indeed if I change that and I add .png at the end, this is the image I uploaded.

61
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,560
So this does work.

62
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,200
All we now need to do is we need to tweak the way this file is named and that is something we'll do

63
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,320
in the next lecture.
