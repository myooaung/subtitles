00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.770
Let's first of all start with the payment process, how does this work?

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.020
Well it's a pretty long process,

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.050
we start by collecting the payment method,

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.170
so the credit card data typically. We then have to verify that, is the credit card data

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.780
correct,

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.920
is it expired,

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.590
is the number correct?

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.250
We then have to charge it and after we charge it, we have to manage payments,

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.730
so that includes things like fraud protection,

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.850
also managing disputes and so on.

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.440
And last but not least, we of course have to process the order in our app, so in our server side code,

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.880
for example that we store it in the database there.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.870
Now all the payment related things here are pretty complex tasks, both from a legal and a technical

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.490
side and therefore typically you outsource them

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.370
and by the way, even very big companies outsource this. Stripe is a very popular company offering payment

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.090
services,

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.180
it offers a great integration and it's super easy to add to any application as you will see in this module.

18
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.240
How does it work?

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.180
Well we have our client and our server,

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.380
so that is all the code we own and we wrote and in the client, we'll collect credit card data.

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.170
We'll do that with the help of stripe and we'll send it to the stripe servers which are not owned by

22
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.040
us but by that company to validate that input. Once it is valid, stripe will return a token to us which

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.120
basically encodes or which includes that credit card data and the confirmation that it is correct.

24
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.380
We send that token to our server,

25
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.810
so to our code and in our code, we create a charge or we charge this payment method then with the help

26
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.950
of stripe again.

27
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.880
So we create a payment, an object, a charge object, we send that to stripe with that token and with our price

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.620
included and stripe will then do the actual charging, do the actual managing

29
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.830
and we will get a response once this is done and then we can also continue with our code and edit this

30
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.320
or store this in the database and so on.

31
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.270
So this is generally how that will work,

32
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300
now let me walk you through that step by step.
