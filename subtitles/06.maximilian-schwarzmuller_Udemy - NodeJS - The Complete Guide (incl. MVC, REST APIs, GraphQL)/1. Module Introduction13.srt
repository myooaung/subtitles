00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:08,890
Now that we know how to work with errors and now that we learned a lot about node express in general,

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,940
let me dive into a little more advanced or specialized topic, file uploads and downloads.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,360
Now it's actually not something that rare, you'll often have a feature like this on your web page and

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,660
therefore it is important to understand how you can allow your users to upload files and how you can

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:36,040
handle that on your server side and which different possibilities you have for returning files to your

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,820
users.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,880
So this is essentially what we'll dive into in this module. We'll have a look at how to upload files and

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,010
most importantly how to handle them on the server

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,930
and of course we'll then have a look at the different options you have for returning files.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,060
So let's dive in.
