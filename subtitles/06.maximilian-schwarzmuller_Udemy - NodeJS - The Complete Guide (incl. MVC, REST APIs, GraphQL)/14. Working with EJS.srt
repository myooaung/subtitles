1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,660
So now we had a look at pug and at handlebars, two possible templating engines you can use and if you

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,840
plan on using them, definitely dive deeper into their docs. Now I want to show you my favorite and the templating

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,090
engine we'll use for the rest of this course and that is ejs.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,210
Now ejs is a templating engine which is just like pug, supported out of the box so we don't need

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,240
to register the engine as we did it with handlebars,

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,360
we can remove that,

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,820
we can therefore also get rid of that handlebars import

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,660
and here we just set the view engine to ejs now.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,870
Now ejs has a very nice syntax in my opinion and has a nice mixture of the extended functionalities

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,660
of pug, so not regarding the html

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,380
but regarding the javascript code you can use in your templates, that you can do things like that

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:01,280
simple comparison here in shop.pug file, this comparison here with the if statement which we couldn't

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
do in handlebars,

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,630
that is again possible with ejs and this is the nice thing I like about it and still, it uses normal

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,410
html

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,700
just like handlebars which I personally also like

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,490
but of course you can follow along in this course with any solution,

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,510
I will stick to ejs though and all source code will therefore be provided with that templating engine.

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,840
So let's use it then

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,360
and let's start with the good old 404 page again.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,540
I'll add my 404.ejs file and now in there,

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,190
let's start with the html code again and let's copy that into that file here,

23
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,920
so all the 404 html code,

24
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,610
let's move it in there,

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,260
get rid of that active class which still incorrectly is there

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,880
and now we got this set up. Now

27
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,640
ejs does not support layouts but we will find a solution to at least have some kind of reusability

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,260
of certain building blocks

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,150
but for now let's just create the whole document in that file.

30
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,680
So this is now our page and let's start with the title again and let's output that dynamically. Now

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:14,660
in handlebars, we used double curly braces, in pug we used hashtag and then single curly braces, in ejs

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,160
we use a smaller than sign and then a percentage sign

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,670
and then if we just want to output a value in the place we're placing this placeholder, we add an equal

34
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,940
sign right after the percentage sign and then we close this with just a percentage sign and a greater

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,780
than sign.

36
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,040
So this is the syntax

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:41,390
and now here we can output the data which our template receives and just as before, the method of how

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,060
we receive

39
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,570
that hasn't changed,

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,430
so we can still output page title here, just as before.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,170
So just to bring this back in memory, in app.js we're passing in that page title here and therefore

42
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,420
we can reference page title in our template.

43
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,990
So this will still work

44
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,230
and with that we can already test this.

45
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,280
If I now save this and I reload here, I get an error for add product because we've got no ejs template

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,340
for that yet

47
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,940
but if I enter anything else which is not found,

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,100
we do indeed see our not found page rendered through

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,390
ejs.

50
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,780
So this is now working

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,340
and with that let's move on to add product,

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,240
let's add the add-product.ejs

53
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,190
file here and in this file,

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,570
again I'll just copy in my add product html code, here

55
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,380
I also want to output the title dynamically though,

56
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,740
so again our syntax here which we used just a second ago,

57
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,820
let's output the page title here and then the rest can stay as it is for now.

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,400
Now the more interesting part is the shop file because there, we also need an if statement and a loop.

59
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,960
So let's add our shop.ejs file and in that shop.ejs file here,

60
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:06,700
let's copy in the html code we got here for the shop and let's make sure we also take that new image here, so

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,320
let's copy that from one of the other files then move over to shop.ejs and replace that here.

62
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,600
And with that, now let's remove these comments again so that this is part of our page, let's remove that

63
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,970
part up there

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:31,810
and now in this file, we can of course again simply output our title equals page title as we did it before

65
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,250
but the more interesting part are obviously the if statement and our loop,

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,920
so we want to output this grid here only if we do have some products. Now an if statement is placed

67
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:51,140
a bit differently than with handlebars, we still use our smaller than percentage sign syntax but not

68
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,900
an equal sign because we don't directly output a value here in this place,

69
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,540
instead we want to enclose,

70
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:07,400
we want to wrap a certain block of code and we do this by adding our opening and closing ejs tags

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,390
you could say like this

72
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,210
and now in there and that's the cool thing, you can write vanilla Javascript code.

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,010
Now we know that we will get in our shop route here,

74
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:25,700
we will get our prods key which holds our products array and this will be an array and therefore here

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,920
what we can do is we can write a normal javascript if statement, so normal javascript code and that is

76
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,840
really important

77
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,670
and simply say prods.length greater 0

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,880
and if that is the case, I want to render this, so thereafter after this grid, I also close this and now here important,

79
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,720
you simply close the curly brace which you also have to open here at the beginning.

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,380
So in the end what you do is you write a normal if statement as you would write it in a javascript file, just

81
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:04,310
that the part inside of that statement is not javascript code but this html code and I find this to be

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,300
very straightforward and easy to understand.

83
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:13,720
So this is our if statement here with the opening curly brace and once we're done, we close that curly brace.

84
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,520
Now we can of course then also combine this and add an else block here just as we would do it in normal

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,860
javascript again and eventually once we're done,

86
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,680
also close that

87
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,560
and now here we can output our h1 tag where we say no products found.

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,690
Now that is nice,

89
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:40,080
let's see that in action by saving and by now going to the shop page and indeed, we get no products found.

90
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:49,040
If I now do add a product on add-product here, first book, we do see it here so the if statement is working.

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,110
Now again of course we want to loop through all the products and output our data and for that again,

92
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,360
we use the same logic as with the if statement. We create simply the normal javascript code we would

93
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,210
use for looping and there are multiple ways of doing that,

94
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,370
we could use prods forEach to use this forEach function

95
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,780
vanilla javascript supports or we use a normal for loop,

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:20,970
we could say for let product of prods and then we simply open a curly brace, wrap all the content that

97
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,480
should be repeated and once we're done, we add another ejs tag where we close that curly brace, again

98
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,660
using normal javascript and then we have our product in there and now we can again output it as before

99
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:42,000
with this ejs equal syntax as I like to call it here, basically this inline output syntax.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,150
And now with that if I reload this page here, we see object object, that is my mistake,

101
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,800
obviously we want to access product title because product indeed is an object,

102
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,350
so now we see the title. This is ejs

103
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,620
and I prefer this syntax because I like having that flexibility of being able to write some javascript

104
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,500
code in the template whilst having a clean syntax that nicely mixes with html

105
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,380
because I personally like using html instead of the minimal version pug offers us.

106
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,840
But as I mentioned, you can go with any approach you like.
