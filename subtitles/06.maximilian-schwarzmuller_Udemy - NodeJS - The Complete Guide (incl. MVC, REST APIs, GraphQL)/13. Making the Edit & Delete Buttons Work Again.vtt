00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.470
Let's complete the crud operations by ensuring that we cannot just find all products and add them and find

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.400
a single one but that we can also edit and delete our products

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.370
and that is of course something which would happen in the admin area and therefore, we need to work on

4
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.590
the admin side again. For that

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.800
first of all make sure that our admin page here where we list all products works again, feel free to

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.770
pause the video here to try this on your own before we will implement it together. Were you successful?

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.480
Well let's do it together.

8
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.630
First of all in the admin routes, I want to comment in my get route here again so that we are again able

9
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.390
to get all products onto our admin overview page.

10
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.110
Now here we use admin control in get products to fetch and render all products,

11
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.540
so if we go to the admin controller here, I of course need to re-add that get products function by simply

12
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.930
commenting it in again. In there I use request user get products and this will not work anymore,

13
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.720
so instead let me here simply use my product model and then use fetch all and this also returns a

14
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.430
promise so we can still use then on it

15
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.270
and we should still get all products but now through our own modified model.

16
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.970
So if I now reload this admin products page here,

17
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.690
I see all the products and now we can try editing and deleting them.

18
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.870
Now for that, first of all we need to go back to our views and adjust them to take account of the new

19
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.290
ID format,

20
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.400
so here in products.ejs in the admin folder in the views folder, in there

21
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.720
whenever we reference the product ID like we do here, it's products._id, the same here, product.

22
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.190
_id, that is really important.

23
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.910
Now with that in place, if we reload that page, our edit and our delete button should work again and should

24
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.660
make sure that we edit or delete the right product.

25
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.210
So let's work on editing the product in the next lecture.
