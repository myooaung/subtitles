00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,200
So I added a message box in the last lecture, you can download the finished version of the entire project

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,010
attached,

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,070
I simply added css classes to my div which surrounds the message

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,200
and then I worked on these classes in the main css file,

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:25,510
I added user message and user message error and also added some user message entry to my desktop sys

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,770
classes. So you can add this manually from the attached code,

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,790
now one thing you'll notice is that even if you load the login page regularly, you'll see an empty box

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,540
here.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,980
So even if no message is flashed, it looks like error message is not set to undefined and therefore let's

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:52,780
quickly go to auth and let's simply console log request flash error to see what's in there that's

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,040
causing this to not be undefined

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,690
basically. So if I reload this page, I see it's an empty array

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,520
and if I do enter something here, you see

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,490
it's an array of messages.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:17,690
So in the end what do we want to do is we want to extract our message here is equal to request flash

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:28,530
error. Now if message length is now greater than zero, then I know I have a message in there,

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,310
so now I'll actually turn this into a variable by using let here and then I can set message equal to message the

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:43,150
first element because I want to retrieve that otherwise I'll set message equal to null and now down there,

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:53,600
we can use the message and pass that as an error message. If we now save that, don't have the box here, if I

20
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,120
do enter something invalid,

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
we do see the error message though

22
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,400
but if I go to the login page regularly without an error, I don't see it.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,070
So this is now how we can use these flash messages and output them in a nice error box.

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,110
Now here's also a challenge for you,

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,700
find some other places in the login and sign up screen

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,870
where it would make sense to flash other messages onto the screen.

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,980
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
