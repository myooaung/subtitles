1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,210
So what is a cookie?

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:11,200
Well here's our setup, we got a user using browser and we got our server where our node application runs

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,880
on.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:18,310
Now the user interacts with the frontend with the views we render with the ejs templating engine

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,410
in this course but of course I'm talking about any views you might be rendering in your project with

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,910
which ever templating engine you are using and from inside that view,

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,280
let's say we have a form there to add a new product,

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,930
we submit a request to our node server.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:43,260
Now let's say that request requires us to store some kind of data in the browser,

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,720
let's say we're not working with the add product page but let's say we have a login page and when the

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,750
user logs in, we want to store the information that the user is logged in somewhere so that when the

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,300
user reloads the page and therefore technically a new request is sent, we still have that information

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,670
around that the user is logged in

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,140
and for that, we can send back a cookie with the response we send back upon the request.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,000
So the user submits the login data and we return a response which can be a new view to which we redirect

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,550
to user

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,320
but we also include our cookie and that cookie simply is important to well telling the user or to storing

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,350
that information that the user is authenticated. We can store that information in the browser,

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,990
so in the frontend so to say, in the environment the user interacts with and we can send this

20
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,410
with subsequent requests to include the cookie there to send the data we stored in the cookie, like for

21
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,350
example that information that we are logged in to the server,

22
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,310
so cookies are stored on the client side.

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,270
Now this is really abstract,

24
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,430
let's simply try it out

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,390
in our application.
