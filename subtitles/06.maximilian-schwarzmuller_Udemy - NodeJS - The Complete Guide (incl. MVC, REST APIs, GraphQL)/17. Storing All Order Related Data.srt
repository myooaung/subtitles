00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,340
Now let's see what was causing that issue

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,070
and for that let's console log user cart

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,000
items to see what's in there

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:21,230
when we place an order. So if I click order now now and I increase the console, we see product ID indeed does hold a full

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,440
object and not just the ID which is what gets stored though,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,330
if I refresh my orders, now I got two but both orders actually just have the product ID in there, not

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,500
the full product,

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:40,810
I want to have the full product data though. Now one thing we can do is here when I store the product

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:48,040
ID, I can wrap that in curly braces to create a new javascript object, use the spread operator and use that

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,210
not directly on the product ID but on a special field

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,550
mongoose gives me, _doc. I can access this here because product ID actually will be an object

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,560
with a lot of metadata attached to it even though we can't directly see that when console logging

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,040
it

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,720
but with .doc we get really access to just the data that's in there

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,270
and then with the spread operator inside of a new object,

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,800
we pull out all the data in that document we retrieved and store it in a new object which we save here as a

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,910
product.

18
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,290
And with that if we save that and we go back to the cart and I click order

19
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,320
now, I get no error

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:35,020
and if I go back to my compass interface and I have a look at this new order, there I see indeed I got

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,490
all the product detail data in there too.

22
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,220
So this is now working

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,130
and this now allows me to store all the data I want to store with every order.

24
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,300
Now with that being stored, of course the missing part is that we also clear the cart.
