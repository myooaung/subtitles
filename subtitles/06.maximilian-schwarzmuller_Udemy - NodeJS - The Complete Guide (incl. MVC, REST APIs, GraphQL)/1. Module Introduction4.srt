00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:09,080
We had a very detailed look at how you can use SQL based databases like MySQL to store your application

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,730
data and most importantly for us as node developers, how you can interact with your MySQL database from

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,400
inside

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,730
nodejs.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:26,240
Now SQL based databases are popular, are great and are used a lot but there is another very popular

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,580
alternative which is used heavily and that is NoSQL or NoSQL based databases especially mongodb

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,300
.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,490
And in this module we'll have a look at

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,110
mongodb, what it is and how you can start up a mongodb database

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,010
and most importantly of course, how you can use it from inside your node code.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,980
So specifically I'll give you a short introduction to what mongodb is and why we would use it,

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,340
what the difference to SQL is,

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,560
I also had a brief discussion about this earlier in the SQL module.

14
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,440
And then most importantly, we'll see how we used the so-called mongodb driver,

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:09,500
basically a package we install to interact with mongodb from inside our nodejs applications.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,620
So let's dive into mongodb and see why it's awesome and why we could use it and how we use it.
