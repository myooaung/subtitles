1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,330
Let's make sure we can also delete items in the cart and for this in cart.ejs,

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,020
I will change my list item a bit, in there

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,040
I'll add a div first of all

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:22,370
or maybe let's add a paragraph to be semantically more correct which will output the text for this cart

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,290
items, so things like the name and the quantity

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,190
and then I will also add a little button there,

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,060
wrapped in a form. The form should go to cart

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:43,740
delete item maybe, the method will be a post method and in the form I will of course have my button with

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:53,120
a class of button with a type of submit which says delete. If we now reload the cart here,

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,660
we see delete this is the button, we can certainly work on the styling but for now I just want to make sure

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,820
that it works.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,310
Now this is the delete button

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,740
and if I click that, it well should delete this item of course.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,460
So cart delete item is a route

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,920
we now need to add and therefore let's go to routes here in shop.js

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,500
because of course this is a customer action,

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,450
our customers will manage their cart and there below the cart

18
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,800
I'll add a router post method, cart

19
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,420
delete item.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,810
Now we need a fitting action in the controller,

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,420
so in a shop controller here and there I got get cart and post cart,

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:41,720
now I will also have exports post cart delete product maybe, you can of course use any name you want

23
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,350
and in here we'll have to remove that product from the carts but only from the cart, not the product

24
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,360
itself.

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:57,230
Well to do that, let's first of all extract the product ID from the request body product ID and therefore

26
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,650
we need to make sure that we pass it there too,

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:13,760
so in our form let's again add this hidden input with a value of our p product data.ID and then

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,210
a name of product ID so that we can extract it by that name on our backend.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,630
And with that added, with this hidden input added here, let's now go back into the controller and with

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:35,430
that ID let's access the cart and then there, we can delete a product right. Now that delete product function

31
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,330
takes the ID of the product and we do have that

32
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,540
but it also takes the price and therefore, we should get that product information first.

33
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:52,080
So let's also call product find by ID here and get that product for this ID and add a callback with the retrieved

34
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,550
product, simply so that we can get the price before we well issue the delete request.

35
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,630
So in there, in this callback I will call delete product and now I can pass in product price too

36
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,830
and of course we could have also used a hidden input to pass the price to the backend

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,770
but I think this is the cleaner approach,

38
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,610
if we only pass the ID through the request and then we do all the data retrieval on the backend in our node

39
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,920
express code.

40
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,650
So now we get delete product

41
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:31,220
and with that we can also send a redirect request back to cart and in theory, this should be all we need.

42
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,280
Now of course the missing thing is that we connect our cart delete

43
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,450
item route to the newly created shop controller action, the post cart delete product action. And with that

44
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:50,070
added in the shop.js file in the routes folder, we can reload our cart page here,

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,850
click delete and we see our products and

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,640
by the way you can ignore these errors on the right,

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,350
these are related to my local network here.

48
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,670
So now I got no products in the carts

49
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,240
and if we have a look at our cart.json it's indeed empty, product.json still has the products though.

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,500
And if I quickly add another product with no real image, like this

51
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,650
so that I have more than one and I add both to my cart

52
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,310
and I delete just a book here, only that is removed, also in carts.json.

53
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,930
So this seems to work just fine,

54
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,520
let's also delete this one now,

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,160
seems to work good and with that, we improved our app a lot and you hopefully get a bit of a feeling

56
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,880
for how you can pass data around and how you can work with your models. Now correctly you would say that

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,240
of course

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,100
our current approach here in the modules is a bit suboptimal because working with the file and so on,

59
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,320
it's not that great,

60
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,070
we can also improve some things in the controllers because for example as I said, we should redirect if

61
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,360
we know that the deletion succeeded and not right after this line 

62
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,040
because since we access a file in there, theoretically we should use a callback here too.

63
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,270
But these are all things I will do once we finally also added the database, something we will do in the

64
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,880
next module now.

65
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,770
So time to move on to this exciting big block of the course.
