00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,530
So now that the csrf protection was added,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:11,770
let me quickly fix that error where I was not able to order an item and there, the path username is required

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,500
is the issue which is thrown,

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:20,220
let's quickly check the shop controller and there, the post order and in there, I indeed store the username

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,080
and I'm not storing the username anymore here.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
When signing up, users only have the email,

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,150
so here we could store the e-mail for our user with request user e-mail on the order, like this.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,600
So instead of the name, I now store the e-mail of the user in here or you also omit this and just store the user

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,420
id, whatever you want.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,960
Now in our order model, this means that here I also don't expect the name but the email which still is

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,820
a string and still is required,

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,500
So this is a tiny change that needs to be done to fix that issue

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,320
and if I now go back to products and I add this to my cart and I add it to my cart

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,720
again let's say therefore I have to order this,

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,000
now this works

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,390
and the cart is empty.

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,920
So this was just a little node something that was required,

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,770
let's logout,

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,610
this all works.

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,080
This is this bug fixed.
