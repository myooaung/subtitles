00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.560
Now in the last lecture, we did insert a product into our mongodb database which is awesome.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.690
Now I also want to see it and before we actually fetch it in our node application, let me show you

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.060
another tool called compass.

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.990
If you click on get mongodb on mongodb.com,

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.320
you can choose that and you can download and install it for free as well.

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.470
It's available for Windows, MacOS and Linux

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.800
and once you get that installed, you can start your compass application on your machine

8
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.260
and this essentially is a tool that gives you a graphical user interface to connect to your database

9
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.060
and to interact with it.

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.780
So let's wait for it starting up here and once it did start up, you can connect to it. Now to connect

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.090
to it,

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.630
let's go back to our mongodb cluster and click connect here and then click connect with mongodb

13
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.230
Atlas, choose your operating system and then copy that url down there.

14
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:08.200
Now one cool thing is if you now quickly close compass again and you restart it after you copied that

15
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.280
url,

16
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.400
it should tell you that it detected a connection string

17
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.100
and if you click yes, it will insert the most important pieces here for you.

18
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.530
Now you still need to choose how you want to connect, so make sure your username is correct and also

19
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.210
enter the password for this user,

20
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.210
you need to do this manually. All the defaults can be left as they are and you should be able to now

21
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.840
connect to your database

22
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.310
and here it is and interesting enough, you are to be precise, you are now connected to the database server

23
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.010
and here you see a couple of databases, two default ones which you don't need to touch and which you

24
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.700
shouldn't touch

25
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.240
but then also your own one, shop. And the shop database here actually has a products collection as you

26
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.050
can see and if we look into that products collection, in there

27
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.480
we can see the documents that are stored in there

28
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.930
and here is that one document we inserted,

29
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.920
so it is one product we added in the last lecture.

30
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.900
Now you can also insert documents and edit them inside of compass and check out the official compass docs

31
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.850
to learn all about the features you can use here.

32
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.490
I just want to use this as a nice visual support so that we can see our data before we fetch it in our

33
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.380
node app.

34
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.600
That being said obviously the data is not that useful to us here,

35
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.270
so let's go back to nodejs and write some code so that we can use the product data on our shop pages

36
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.800
again which we commented out at the moment.
