00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,210
So let's clear the cart after storing an order

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,250
and for that, here once I'm done with saving the order, I want to clear the cart

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,310
and one way to do that would be to go to the user model and add a new method there.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,450
We can go to the user schema, to the methods key and then add a clear cart method,

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,770
so simply a function we can call to clear the entire cart

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,340
and how would we do that?

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,020
Well we would simply set this cart equal to an object where we have an empty array of items and then

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:45,390
we just return this, whoops, return this save and that should be it. That updates the carts to have no

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,000
items in it anymore and we then save this and therefore we update this. With this, let's go back to the

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,160
shop controller

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,930
and here once we know that the order was placed, let's simply call request user clear cart,

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:08,400
this method we just added and then I will return that and move my redirection into a new then block

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,400
after the previous one which will only execute once the cart was cleared.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:22,300
So now with that, let's save that, let's now also go to products and maybe add another product to our cart.

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,750
Let's order that cart

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,400
now, let's click on cart again, no products in cart, this is looking great.

17
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:34,670
Let's quickly check our orders in compass and this new order should now have two products, that is looking

18
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,160
good,

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,050
one with quantity two, that was our nice book and one with quantity one, that was the second product

20
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,240
and in the users, the cart is empty.

21
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,960
So now we got an elegant way of managing orders and the cart through mongoose.

22
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,030
However let's of course also add the functionality to get the cart in the next lecture.
