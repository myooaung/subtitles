00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.400
To conclude this module, I will now simply add one additional view here in the shop and that is the orders.ejs

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.250
route which is responsible for displaying orders.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.230
We don't have any yet

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.110
so I will just take my cart.ejs content and put that in there so that we at least have the navigation

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.700
and obviously we could then display something in-between, have some main element and say h1, nothing

6
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.860
there but we'll work on that obviously

7
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.640
and I want to add this in my navigation too. There I already have the cart,

8
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.810
now next to the cart I will add one additional navigation item where I say orders and I go to

9
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.680
/orders

10
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.310
and the path here which I check for the active css class is /orders

11
00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.930
and now therefore in my routes here in shop.js, I want to add a new route which allows me to go to

12
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.510
/orders and this means I need a new action in my shop.js controller, there

13
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.490
I also want to be able to load that orders page,

14
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.720
so I will just duplicate the get cart action your name does get orders like this and then simply return

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.350
shop orders,

16
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.180
this new view I added and then path orders and then here also your orders, like this

17
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.040
and now we can go back to shop.js in the routes file and have get orders here. With that,

18
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.560
this is looking good.

19
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.010
If I save everything and I reload,

20
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.010
I have this new menu item with nothing there yet

21
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.870
but now we're well prepared,

22
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.970
I will make some styling changes and provide the finished code at the beginning of next module and then

23
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.890
we will learn how we can actually use the express router to work with dynamic data or in general, data

24
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.390
in the url and how we can use that to retrieve specific items or interact with specific items.

25
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.520
So for now, let's finish this module and let's move on.
