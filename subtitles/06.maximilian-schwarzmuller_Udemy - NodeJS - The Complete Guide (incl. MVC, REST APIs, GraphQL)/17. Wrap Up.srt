00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:09,160
That's it for this module. We added a bunch of validation logic for signing up, logging in and creating

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,790
products and you learned that this is a two step process of adding validators to your routes with that

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,120
third party package we're using, express validator so that it's a two step process with adding these validators

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,950
to the routes as middleware

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,790
and then for this package we collect errors in our controllers and then we do something if we do find errors.

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,850
Most commonly you would re-render that form page, so that page which wanted the user to input something and

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,620
to provide a good user experience.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,090
You want to make sure that you keep the original input the user entered and that you show at least some

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,390
error message that gives the user an idea that nothing was wrong on your server but that something was

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,580
wrong with the user input instead.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,530
These are the core takeaways and other than that, I can only encourage you to play around with the

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,730
different built-in validators, build your own ones

13
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:10,260
and of course there are other solutions, other express or node packages for validation out there as well.

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,260
This is a pretty popular package, pretty easy to use and I can only recommend using it

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,680
but as always it's most important that you play around with these things and that you practice using

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,110
it.
