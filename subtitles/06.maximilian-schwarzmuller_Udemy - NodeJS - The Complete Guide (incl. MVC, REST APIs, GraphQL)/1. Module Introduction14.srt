I'm really happy with the shape our course application is taking and we're diving into many exciting

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,230
features

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:14,740
we can build with node and express as you see. Now that we're able to work with files and even generate

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,130
them on the fly on the server,

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:24,830
let's dive back into some work with our database or interactions with our database. There right now

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:31,900
we always fetch all products when we display the product page. In this module, we'll dive into a technique

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,590
called pagination which allows us to split our data across multiple pages, something you typically want

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,370
to do when you work with a lot of data.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,530
So let me show you how this can be implemented with our application in this module.
