00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,110
Now that we learned some new tricks regarding how we can send mails,

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,550
let's use that new knowledge to improve our authentication features and in general, let's improve our

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:21,710
security or the authentication related things in our app. For example let's also work on ensuring that

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,770
only users who created a post can edit it

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,180
but let's start with resetting passwords. To be precise

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,210
in this module, we'll start with resetting passwords but then we'll have a look at

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,240
authorization

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,620
which is that part I just talked about with ensuring that you can only edit and delete what you created.
