1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,670
So to pre-populate this form with the product data, we need to fetch the product first,

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:16,190
so for in added mode here after not being redirected, then I want to get my product information. For this

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,250
I need the product model which I already have and I need the product ID, prod ID can be retrieved from

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,940
the incoming request because if you check the routes real quick, we have that dynamic segment here, 

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,640
so by this name we can extract the Product ID.

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,740
So in admin.js, here I can set or I can access request params product ID and get that ID from the URL.

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:47,840
Therefore I can then use my product model and find this product by id and then here, I have my callback

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,940
where I receive the product that was retrieved and by the way of course, you should also try to add

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,640
a check to see if you have a product and redirect the user in case you don't but let's do it like this for

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
now.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:07,100
So here I will now get my product and I will then render this page assuming that I always get a product and

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,050
pass my product on a product key and you can name this key whatever you want of course.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,000
And we can for example add a check if we don't have a product, so if this is invalid, if it's undefined

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,210
then we could return a redirect for now which is not the best user experience,

15
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,840
most of the time you would want to show an error instead

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,180
but let's now, for now do it like this.

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,360
So we assume we always make it here and we get the product in the view now,

18
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,680
so let's move over to the edit product view. And here first of all let's work on that button.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,170
Right now it's add product

20
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,320
but I want to change that button caption if we're in edit mode.

21
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:54,140
Now remember we're setting this editing property here so this is a variable available in the template.

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:03,230
So here I simply want to check if editing and then add a curly brace,

23
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,560
if this is true then I actually want to display the edit or maybe update product text here on the button

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,080
otherwise and for that, I'll close the first if block here and add an else block still in my ejs tags

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,900
of course.

26
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,040
So otherwise here if we're in this else block here, I want to show add product and thereafter I also have

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,700
to close my curly brace of that if statement. If I now reload this page, we see update product correctly

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,810
and by the way if I go to add product, I'll now get an error because editing is not defined.

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,440
So to fix this, I also have to make sure that in my controller, for showing the add product page, I set

30
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,510
editing to false of course. And now here reloading this page will work,

31
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,120
going back to the editing page will show us the update button.

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,910
Now that is one step, back to the template

33
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,640
I don't just want to show the caption here,

34
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,360
I also want to change the action. So here on the form, the route we're sending the request to should also

35
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,530
change of course.

36
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,470
Right now it's always add product but it should only be add product if we are not in editing mode.

37
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,400
So here indeed

38
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,490
I will also output something dynamic,

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
I will check if we're editing,

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,450
so I'll have the same logic as for the button

41
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:44,700
and if this is the case, I went to load /edit product let's say, otherwise I'll close that and have

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:54,010
my else block open up, so otherwise this is my ejs else block, I'll add add product into my url here

43
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,010
and I can inject these segments into the url

44
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,280
because this will just be converted to normal text in the end.

45
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,030
This is what ejs does or or what all templating engines do.

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,750
So also close that curly brace of the else block here and with that if I save this, we should make

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,350
sure that if we click that update button, we go to edit product.

48
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,010
Well let's go back and let's see if we can pre-populate this with product information.

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,760
Now keep in mind that in admin.js, I am retrieving the product, whoops not here but here in get edit

50
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,390
product and I pass the product information into my view.

51
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,450
So therefore in the view, we can of course use that

52
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,810
and we can set it on all our inputs, here on value,

53
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,410
I also want to check if I'm in editing mode and if I am, I want to display my product information, if

54
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,790
I'm not I don't want to do that.

55
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,640
So same logic as before,

56
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,750
I'll check if I'm editing, if I am then I will display product title here because this is the title input

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,370
otherwise I will not do anything and therefore I don't even need an else block,

58
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,880
I just do this if I am in editing mode

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,530
otherwise nothing will happen.

60
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:19,780
So if I now reload this, we indeed see product title and the issue here is that of course this is simply

61
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,130
output as text, to output the real value behind it,

62
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:31,930
we need that equals ejs tag here nested into our other ejs tags like this,

63
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,620
so this was now added, equals unclosing with a dollar sign greater than sign.

64
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,820
And this can be hard to read,

65
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,530
you simply have to divide it up in blocks, you've got if, then you've got the output and then you've got

66
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,120
the closing curly brace for and with that saved if you now reload, you'll see the real title behind

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,920
that. Now let's do the same for all the other values,

68
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,580
so I'll just copy that value here real quick, for the image url.

69
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,240
I obviously want to output image

70
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,070
url, for the price.

71
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,210
I want to output product price. For the description we get a text area,

72
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,890
so here I will not have value equals, I'll just output the value between the opening and closing text

73
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,180
area tags

74
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,430
and here I'll output the description. And with that all saved

75
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,050
if we reload, this is looking good

76
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,070
and now we can start editing our products.

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,550
Now I want to hook up that edit button so that we can really load the product and this newly added view.

78
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,700
So let's do that

79
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,080
and then also work on the functionality to store the updated information over the next lectures.
