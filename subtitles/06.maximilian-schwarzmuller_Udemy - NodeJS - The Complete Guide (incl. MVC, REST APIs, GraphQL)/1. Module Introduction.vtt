00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.740
It's now finally time that we start storing our data in a more correct or realistic way because thus

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:16.000
far, we either used the memory when we just stored the data in a variable in our node program and it

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.140
was then even shared across requests or we stored it in a file and that's also not optimal because accessing

4
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.950
files is pretty slow, especially as we start storing more and more data in them and it's therefore not really something

5
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.650
we would do in a real application.

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.200
Instead there, you typically would use a database which is a specific program that allows you or that is

7
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.600
built for storing data and for efficiently retrieving data too. Therefore in this module, we'll have a look

8
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.620
at the different kinds of databases or two important different kinds of databases, SQL and NoSQL

9
00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.180
databases and I will compare them, highlight the differences and we will actually see examples for both

10
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.510
in the course and we'll start with SQL also in this module,

11
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.050
so NoSQL will also follow in a separate module but let me first of all show you how you would use

12
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.630
a SQL based database together with your nodejs application.

13
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.200
This is what we'll cover and that will actually be a lot,

14
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.110
so let's dive right into it and let's learn what the different kinds of databases are and whether a

15
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.260
SQL or NoSQL could be the right choice for your application.
