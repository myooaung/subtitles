00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,230
Welcome to this optional, that's important, optional module where I want to introduce you to the javascript

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,430
basics and this module is really just a quick refresher.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:19,060
I do expect you to have some basic knowledge about how javascript works, what you use it for and it's

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,390
base syntax.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,000
This module does not replace that,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,600
you can't really use that module with zero

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,940
javascript knowledge or at least it will be very very challenging.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,290
But if you only get some very basic knowledge or it's been quite some time since you worked with javascript,

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,250
then this module will be a great refresher.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,300
Please skip this module if you already know javascript though because then this module is not for you,

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,940
so you don't have to be an expert to skip this, if you know javascript and you also know some of its

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,450
next-gen features like the rest and spread operator or object destructuring,

13
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,510
so a bunch of nice things that we can do in javascript, definitely skip this module and maybe come back

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,050
later if there is some feature you don't recognize or you're not sure what it's all about.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,300
If you don't have that knowledge though, this module is for you and also have a look at the next lecture

16
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,840
where I provide links to helpful resources in case you're brand new to javascript because there are

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,040
some free resources that allow you to get started with javascript after which you can come back to this

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,190
module and the rest of the course where you will need that basic knowledge.
