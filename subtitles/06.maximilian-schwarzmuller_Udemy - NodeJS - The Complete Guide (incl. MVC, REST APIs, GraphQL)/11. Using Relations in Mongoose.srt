1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,050
With the user model set up, let's make sure we can use it together with the product model.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,000
Now obviously every product should be assigned to a user,

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,890
so first of all we need to change our product schema a little bit.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,850
A product should also have a user ID field let's say, just as we had it before in the last module.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,630
Now a user ID field is of type and now which type is this?

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:34,860
Well it will be a reference to a user, so this will actually be of type schema types objectID

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,880
and now we can set something special here, we can add a special ref configuration and ref takes a string

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:49,010
where we tell mongoose hey which other mongoose model is actually related to the data in that field.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,380
We know that we will store a user ID here but just because the type is objectid, this is not obvious,

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,010
this could be any object ID of any object.

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,580
So I will add user here and you use the name of your model to which you want to relate this,

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,080
so since our model here is named user, I will name it user here,

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,190
so I refer to my user model here

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,720
and with that I got a relation set up. This also means that in my user model where I do store

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,640
the product ID, I can also add a reference here and refer to product because I know that for every user

16
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:37,830
in the cart items, I will store products where I refer to some ID and that ID happens to refer to a product

17
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,540
stored or defined through the product model.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,510
So now we got relation set up with ref,

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,390
of course you only need this when using references, when using embedded documents as we do with the cart,

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,490
you don't need to do anything because well you use an embedded document, this already has kind of an

21
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,280
implicit relation that is managed inside of one document.

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,640
So now with the references set up,

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,990
let me also add a required to true here and now I adjusted my schemas. Now with the schemas adjusted,

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,140
we of course need to adjust our code like in the admin controller when we create a new product. When

25
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,560
creating a new product, we also want to make sure we store the user id and that is super simple.

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,770
We just add user ID here to the fields we pass in the object to the product constructor and now remember

27
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:39,640
that we did save the user in our request, so I can just do request user_id like this and

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,490
this should give me access to the user id and assign it here. Now conveniently in mongoose,

29
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,280
you can even just store the entire user object,

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,350
so this is really the entire user object not just the ID and mongoose will just pick the ID from that

31
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,080
object,

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,440
so that's another convenience you got there.

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,820
Let me save my code,

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,160
let's go back and let's add a new product, a nice book.

35
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,370
Let's use that image url we used before,

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
let's give it some price,

37
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,820
you should not miss that and click add product. Now you see

38
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,330
that looks good, it was added

39
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,880
and now let's have a look at compass and see if the user ID was added too.

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,360
So if I refresh there, indeed we see the user id here and just the ID, not the entire user, just the

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,740
ID as we want it.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,220
So this is pretty awesome,

43
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,450
this is how we can manage relations through mongoose.

44
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,650
Now let me show you something cool

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,660
when it comes to fetching these relations.
