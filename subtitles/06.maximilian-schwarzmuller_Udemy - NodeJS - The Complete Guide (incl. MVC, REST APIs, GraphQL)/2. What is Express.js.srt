1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,820
So what is express and why do we use it?

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,680
Well I briefly mentioned it,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,480
writing all that server side logic is pretty complex,

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:17,450
just remember what we had to do to parse an incoming request. For extracting the body, we manually had

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,970
to listen to the data event, to the end event and then create a buffer which we in the end converted to a string

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:30,710
and this was just one type of data we could get. If we get other kinds of data, like for example we get

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,940
a file or differently structured data, then we would have to write new logic. Now expressjs

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,190
helps us with that,

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,420
it actually doesn't have a built-in way of handling or parsing that data but it makes it easy to

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:51,170
install another package that can easily be hooked into our project that will then do the parsing for

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,820
us and you will see what I mean in a second.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,890
We in general don't want to care about all these nitty gritty details,

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,390
we want to focus on our code that defines our application,

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,570
so the thing that really sets our application apart from other applications, our unique selling point

15
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,200
you could say and we do use a framework for this, for all the heavy lifting. A framework is basically

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,780
a set of helper functions but also a suite of tools and rules with which we work,

17
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:29,720
so basically we have a clearly defined way or at least some outline on how we should structure our application,

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,580
our code and how we should work with that framework to write clean code

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,590
and of course, I will teach you all of that for expressjs in this module.

20
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,540
So expressjs helps us with that

21
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,980
and this is why we will dive into it here.

22
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:52,400
Now of course expressjs is not the only package or framework you can use for nodejs that will help

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,660
you write better nodejs code and focus on your business logic.

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,040
Now from one you could of course stick to vanilla nodejs,

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,950
we only use that thus far and of course that works and depending on the complexity of your application

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,550
or the level of challenges you are seeking, you can absolutely stick to vanilla

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,710
nodejs, you can theoretically write everything on your own just with that.

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,450
There also are other frameworks you could use,

29
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,830
for example there is adonis.js.

30
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,190
Now if you ever used laravel for php,

31
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,920
this is basically a laravel inspired framework for nodejs

32
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:38,890
but not from the same creators. There also is koa or a sailsjs and there are many more,

33
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,350
you can basically Google for expressjs alternatives and you will find plenty of blogposts diving

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,420
into the different alternatives and what their strengths and weaknesses are.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,830
But expressjs is by far the most popular and most often used one

36
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,120
which is why I will also teach it here.

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:04,490
The great thing about express is that it's highly flexible and actually doesn't add too much functionalities

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,900
out of the box but it gives you a certain way of building your application or of working with the

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,920
incoming requests that make it highly extensible and therefore, there are dozens or hundreds and thousands

40
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,540
of third party packages built for express specifically that you can then easily add to your node express

41
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,310
application without having to configure a lot and this is

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,670
probably the real strength of express and of course it also does add some nice features out of the box.

43
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,630
So why don't we just install it and take a closer look ourselves.
