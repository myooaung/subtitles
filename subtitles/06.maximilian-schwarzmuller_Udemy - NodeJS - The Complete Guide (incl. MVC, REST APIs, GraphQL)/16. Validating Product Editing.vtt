00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.910
So let's now make sure that when we edit a product, we don't break our app as we're currently doing

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.210
it

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.040
if we enter something wrong but that we instead simply validate the input.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.190
Well we are validating it already because I do have all my validators added on the edit product route

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.430
in the routes folder but in the controller action that belongs to that, we should also repeat the code

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.910
from adding a product,

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.630
so all that code where I fetch the errors and then check for the existence of errors, we should grab

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.560
that and add it to post edit product as well

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.110
and there before we start doing anything,

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:47.110
so before we find a product, before we do that, I will actually use my validation errors if we got any

11
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.020
and then re-render the page with the title of edit product, editing set to true because we are still

12
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.030
in editing mode

13
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.810
but has error also set to true and the product data populated like this, with the values the user entered.

14
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.960
And with that if we save that, that's all we have to do because we're reusing the same view we use before,

15
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.260
so we already got everything we need for outputting the errors

16
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.780
and now if I do leave out that price field, I get title is not defined.

17
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.400
Yeah

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.900
here when I try to set the data which I return, here in this post edit product actions, it's all named

19
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.520
updated title, updated price,

20
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.730
so we should be using that.

21
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.010
So let's use updated title here, updated price, updated image url and down there, it's updated desc,

22
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.730
so this was a little mistake on my side,

23
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.170
these values which I extracted were named differently.

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.300
Now after renaming that if I try to submit this again, now I simply get invalid value, again

25
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.460
you could override that default message in the way I showed it earlier in this module.

26
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.830
We also see that our image url was lost,

27
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.290
yeah but simply because I assign this incorrectly, I assign the price to the image url and the

28
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.250
other way around.

29
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.320
We should of course do it this way

30
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.130
and now if I update this, now all the data is kept and I still get this error.

31
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.650
So now we get this validation in place too,

32
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.110
now one thing we can do of course we can again set that red border by repeating that same way we did

33
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.640
in the login or in the sign up pages. We get our class here, we conditionally add a css class and

34
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.580
we do the same in edit product,

35
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.420
so there for this input

36
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.340
I do add my class when there is an error for the title input, the same of course for the image url

37
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.320
and all the other inputs, so that does not change. Here for the image url,

38
00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.090
I do get this css class here if we do have an error on the image url.

39
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.030
Let's do the same for the price of course

40
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.840
real quick,

41
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.190
split up what we get thus far

42
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.840
and then let's here check the price to see whether we add this invalid css class. And for the text area, it's

43
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.140
exactly the same,

44
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.490
we just need to do one little change to our css code because here I'm checking for description and

45
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:31.110
so the invalid class might be added to that text area. Thus far in my css code, in the forms css

46
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.750
file,

47
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.800
I only add or change the text color if invalid was added to the input,

48
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.800
now we should simply group another selector or add another selector to that group here

49
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.480
and simply check whether invalid is added either to an input or to a text area

50
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.880
and in both cases give it a red colored border. And with that in place, we now just have to make sure

51
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.910
that we pass these validation errors which we are checking in edit product now, that we passed that

52
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.430
with our responses.

53
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.660
So in the admin controller starting with get add product, there validation errors should be an empty

54
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.860
array because we got no validation errors in this place, for post add product however, here we should have

55
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.530
validation errors which is equal to errors array,

56
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.450
so these errors which we did fetch. For get edit product,

57
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.650
there again I will pass validation errors as an empty array because we have no errors here when we just

58
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.350
get the page

59
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.230
but for post edit product when we do return our error page basically, then I want to set validation

60
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.650
errors back to errors array like this.

61
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.510
And now we do pass that data

62
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:57.510
so if I now hit update here, you see this is red, only interesting pieces, the title is red as well.

63
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.920
Well that makes sense because here I still have something in my validation set up in the routes folder,

64
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.060
here alphanumeric,

65
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.930
we did remove that if you remember because it should be isString otherwise the whitespace, the blank is

66
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.190
not allowed.

67
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.530
So if I change that and I hit update now, I actually fail and I do fail

68
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.350
because the cast to object id failed for that value.

69
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.520
Now what's wrong here?

70
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:36.510
Well keep in mind for editing, we need that hidden input where I do have my product ID right

71
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.050
and I do load that product ID when I first render this page

72
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:50.280
but if I re-rendered it due to a validation error, so due to this render function in my if check here,

73
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.020
well then I only set title, image url, price and description.

74
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.010
I also need to set _id though, otherwise it will render the page

75
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.320
but if I try to submit it that ID will be missing and I need that ID because I extract it here.

76
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.100
So what I should do is I should simply pass _id here and set this equal to prod ID which

77
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.420
I am extracting when this is submitted the first time.

78
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.440
So now I'm passing _id

79
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:32.470
and this means that if I now go to admin products, edit this and let's say I change the price,

80
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.280
this works

81
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.450
but now let's also do something that breaks validation,

82
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.800
so now this was reloaded due to our failing validation.

83
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:49.540
And now if I edit this, it will still work because now we also did store and re-render that product ID

84
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.260
and that is how we can add validation and provide a relatively good user experience.
