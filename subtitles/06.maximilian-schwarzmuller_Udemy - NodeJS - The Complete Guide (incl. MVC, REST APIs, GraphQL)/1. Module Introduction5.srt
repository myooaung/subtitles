00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:09,200
In the last module, we had a closer look at NoSQL or especially mongodb and how you can use

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:16,360
such a NoSQL database in our course mongodb, the most popular NoSQL database in a nodejs

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,630
application.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,350
Hopefully you saw that it wasn't too difficult and still just as with SQL,

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,890
we can abstract some complexity away from us and focus more on our data than the queries we write and

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,090
here just as we had sequelize for SQL, we got mongoose for mongodb and mongoose is indeed pretty

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,250
similar to sequelize in terms of what it tries to do,

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,470
it tries to enable you to work with the data instead of with the queries.

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,250
So what's in this module? We'll have a look at what mongoose is in detail and how we can add it to our

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,760
project and how we can start using it and then we'll,

11
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,900
well we will use it,

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,520
we will use it in our nodejs application,

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,390
I will give you a thorough introduction to mongoose, also show you where you can learn more about that

14
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,040
if you want to dive deeper

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,630
and we will transform our project once again to move from a

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,440
we write all queries on our own approach to we just define how our data should look like and then

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,080
work with it approach.

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,530
So with that, let's dive in.
