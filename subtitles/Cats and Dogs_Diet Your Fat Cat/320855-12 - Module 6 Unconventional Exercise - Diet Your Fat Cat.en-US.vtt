00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
all right,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.650
while you guys,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.560
we've made it to module six.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.350
This is great.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.280
This is the unconventional exercise module.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.030
So in the last model,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.920
we went over in depth how to exercise your cap.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.260
And in this one,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.600
we're gonna go over a couple ways that are maybe considered unconventional.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.920
A little overview for you will be going over walking your cat,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.680
leading your cat through an obstacle course and clicker training for your cat.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.740
Keep in mind that there are actually a bunch of other ways you could exercise your cat.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.350
If you can dream it,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.210
you can do it.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.340
So if you have a cat that is interesting about doors,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.470
maybe they Trent or dash on you.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.250
This activity is definitely for you.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.820
Um,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.780
you will need a harness and a leash for this activity,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.610
and you may initially need to reward the cat for being near the harness.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.290
It depends what type of cat you have.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.140
Uh,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.750
if they don't mind you putting it on,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.640
then great.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.600
But if they're kind of cat that really hate harnesses,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.780
you'll find out pretty easily If you try,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.930
um,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.460
you might need to just reward them for being near the harness at first and then,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.250
um,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.070
making sure that you're giving them attention.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.880
Pets,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.410
maybe.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.720
Maybe some snacks,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.480
but only if it's part of the diet.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.050
Right?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.460
Um,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.610
also,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.250
if there's any possibility of the cat running away and hiding while outside,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460
make sure that I You have an i d.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.030
Tag and collar on the cat.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.590
Um,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.060
also,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.410
please make sure that the collar is a breakaway collar.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.150
Uh,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.210
this means it'll break off if the collar gets caught on something outdoors.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.030
Some considerations for you when you walk your cat,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.540
this is going to not be like walking a dog.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.400
Let the cat explore safely.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.050
You have the harness for a reason.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.620
If they end up going somewhere that they shouldn't or starting to go in a direction that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.750
they shouldn't just redirect them and then also set a time limit for this activity,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.880
as it can be a little a little less than exciting for the owner.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.500
Just take the cat back when you're done after the timer goes off,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.130
try and make the experiences positive.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.450
It's possible for the cat,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.310
uh,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.150
pick times that you know they'll be fewer people or dogs out.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.160
Uh,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.960
you can also reward your cat treats outside.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.180
Just remember,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.760
Teoh,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.810
keep it part of the diet.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.420
The next topic is an obstacle course for your cap that I know what you're thinking.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.060
You're thinking Oh,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.280
like I could barely get my cat waddle around for this.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.040
Want toy?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.190
What makes you think I can take him on an obstacle?

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.370
Course G's hear me out.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.900
Uh,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020
you might really like this one.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:00.410
It's one of my favorites as it combines exercise and food with an obstacle course.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.100
Uh,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.980
the game goes like this.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.880
You would have cats,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.600
food bowl,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.290
and at the time that you would normally just put the food down for them to eat,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.760
you would pick it up and you would walk somewhere.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.150
Um,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.830
if this is drag cable,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.570
you can put this on the ground somewhere.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.410
If it's what me do you have it on the spoon and you're taking it around the house.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.920
Uh,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.090
leading your cat,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.190
um,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.650
on this obstacle course,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.710
hopefully your cat is already already following you.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.330
But if not,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.680
perhaps when you put the food down somewhere,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.150
he'll get interested and come check it out.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.930
If things were going well,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.990
you would then pick up the feud bowler.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.150
I just moved to new location and put down some more kibbles for your cap and then repeat,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.080
and that is how an obstacle course works.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.590
Eventually you will be out of food,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.050
and your cat will have gotten some exercise walking around the house to get his meal.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.560
You can try leading your cat around first on the ground level on.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.150
Then if they are spry enough to jump up on things eventually lead up to that.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.900
That would get more energy expended.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.510
If they're jumping on something last,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.350
we're gonna go over clicker training.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.400
You might be thinking Onley dogs,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.200
do you tricks,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.670
right?

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.180
You are wrong.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.360
You can actually train cats to do a fair number of things.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.620
There's a really great book on this topic.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.610
It's called,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.050
uh,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.050
click Your Training for Cats by Karen Prior.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.410
You will need a clicker and your cat's favorite treats to do this.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.720
The general concept is a soon as your cat is doing something that you want him to dio,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.170
you would click and then treat your cat.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:04.260
He will eventually figure out what you want him to dio so that he can get truths.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.340
You can train your cat to do you any number of things.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.240
With this method,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.900
I won't go to into detail this one as you can find some good books out there on the topic,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.560
just keep in mind that there's any number of ways even exercise your cat,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.150
and this is just one of them.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.870
Last thing.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.040
I want to go over one bonus on conventional exercise,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.150
and that's teaching your cat to swim.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.390
Uh,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.130
believe it or not,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.050
there are actually some cats out there that do enjoy swimming.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.800
There aren't that many,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.900
so don't just plop your cat in the pool and see what happens.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.640
I would not suggest that.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.500
But if your cat is so large that he can barely move,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.450
I would definitely look into something called hydrotherapy for your cat.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.750
That's where they can do some swimming in a controlled environment,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.870
and it's less strain on their joints while still getting them some good exercise.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.370
All right,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.750
let's get into some homework here.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.240
Just kidding.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.210
You don't need to actually do any other work here,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.240
but for sure one of the used technique strikes your fancy for sure.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.950
Try it out.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.420
We do highly recommend trying out the obstacle course method of feeding your cat,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.160
though you may be surprised at how engaged your cat will be and how much fun you can have

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.680
two.
