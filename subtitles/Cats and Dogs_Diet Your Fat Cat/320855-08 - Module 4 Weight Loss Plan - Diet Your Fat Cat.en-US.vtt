00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
All right,

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:00.950
guys.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.890
Welcome to Module four.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.450
This is exciting.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.130
Um,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.010
thing this is the weight loss plan.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.360
The fun part in this model will be going over how to start the weight loss program for your

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.700
cat.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.950
The general outline is learning about the calories making a weight loss plan for your cat

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.440
making sure you are feeding your cat.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.710
Correct him out of food in what to do when your cat actually starts going down and wait,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.050
and then incorporating details to make the plan work.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.640
So,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.680
first question,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.790
how many calories should you feed your cat?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.940
This,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.520
I found,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.490
is not an easy question to answer.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.350
There are so many options and various formula out there on their net,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.350
you confined.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.580
Um,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.620
it's kind of the definition of not easy,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.230
right.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.550
So how do we tackle this question?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.770
I'm gonna throw up a slight here to show you how best do this.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.250
So the first method of how many calories to start being your cab is based on observation.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
So if you doing the homework for module to which if you haven't done it,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.370
go back and do it now.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.900
You now have a baseline.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.160
For how many calories your cat eats daily.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.810
You can use this table under tap.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.370
Four in cell download initial calorie calculation example shown to the right here so you

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.300
would input the calories under the calories column.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.440
Using the calorie values determined from their observation phase,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.040
download.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.720
This spreadsheet will determine the average calories your cat eat for that week and the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990
calorie value to start out feeding your cat.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.350
The second method is just based on a rule of thumb,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.720
which is that your average indoor cat needs about 20 calories per pound to maintain his

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.080
weight.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.770
This is going to depend,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.290
of course,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.140
on how active your cat is and their metabolism so you would subtract a pound from that

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.690
number or 20 calories to get the amount of calories to start out.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.880
Feeding your cat Help you?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.990
Oh,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.810
this calculation.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.930
You can also use tab,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.200
for example,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.480
you'll seen you'll see is shown below.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.360
If your cat weighs Â£15 start out by feeding him 280 calories a day,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.830
so if you wanted the map there,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.850
it's 15 times 20 minus 20 would equal to 80.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.970
In this merchant,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.320
you can simply enter your cats.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.120
Wait you can see how well your cat and module to and tap four will do the math for you.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.390
A couple notes for you.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.750
Obviously,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.040
the best method here is Method one,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.750
but only if you're confident about your measurements in the observation days.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.080
So if you're not confident about those measurements,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.670
um,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.760
or you just happen doubts about it.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.760
You should probably go with method to or the initial for figuring out the initial calories

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.550
to feed your cat.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.480
I would recommend determining the values for both methods and then taking value that you

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.910
feel most confident about.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.360
Also,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.390
please note that you can enter in fractions of a pound in the spreadsheet and spreadsheet

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.570
will work the same way to figure out calories.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.290
I also wanted to explain that if you are using Method Teoh,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.750
there's actually a buffer built into it already.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.970
Most in your cats that are over.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.130
We will need less than 20 calories a day to maintain weight.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.440
Primarily,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.130
that's because they are overweight.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.680
They probably don't move around as much as they should.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.150
Extra pounds make it difficult for them to appropriately exercise.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.360
This buffer is put in there to make sure that you're not accidentally under feeding your

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.790
cap and then to help.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.360
You know that if your cat is complaining about something,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.860
it's probably not food related or it's not that they're hungry.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.800
I guess I should say so.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.040
If your cat starts complaining about something,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.300
don't just automatically jump Teoh.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.760
Oh,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.930
they must be hungry.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.140
They're starving.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.930
Um,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.980
your cat is probably fine.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.650
They are just used to getting things done a certain way.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.990
So probably the change in schedule has upset him.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.310
Or maybe he wants Mexico Attention.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.790
Module two,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.250
we filled out Tapped to the food calories in the cat weight loss helpers Fred Cheat.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.890
This type is very useful for the weight loss plan.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.750
So if you have not already go back and fill it out so you will now be determining the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.550
amount of food.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.960
You will start feeding your calf on his diet.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.670
So open up.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.240
Tap three in food and exercise plan in your cat,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.750
we've lost helpers spread cheap.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.940
I'm going to throw up a slide,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.270
show you an example.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.520
So I'm left.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.560
This slide is an example for you.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.580
You can use this to determine which food what amount of food and the frequency of feeding

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.610
on a given day.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.350
Please remember that the calories are calculated on tap to food calories and should be

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.750
copied to the table in tap three.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.430
So take a couple minutes now and fill this out and I will meet you back and part two of

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.200
module for good luck guys.
