00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
he everyone?

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.170
My name is Aurilia.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.590
I am an aerospace engineer,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.320
cat enthusiast,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.650
a lover of food,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.500
nutrition,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.150
organizational systems and a bunch of other things.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.690
So a little bit about me and why I wanted to teach this class.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.110
A few years ago,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.960
I adopted a morbidly obese rescue kitty marshmallow.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.420
If you want to see her,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.960
she's hanging out upon her cat shelf.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.590
Yeah,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.450
so that's marshmallow.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.510
And when I say Toby's I mean obese.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.340
I mean,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.780
check out these photos.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.990
Anyway,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.170
as soon as I got her,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.590
I devoted a bunch of time and energy researching anything that I could find out there on

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.650
cat weight loss.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.500
During the course of this cat weight loss project,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.570
I discovered there wasn't really a great all in one location for Cat.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.650
We lost information.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.100
Also,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.450
the info is typically vague and kalsa be contradictory or sometimes just really confusing.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.480
Taking all this information into consideration,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.700
I embarked on the long and arduous journey of dieting my cat.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.200
Of course,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.560
there were some hiccups along the way,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.990
needing to correct course,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.780
and I discovered some side effects and wasted you know them.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.870
This course will give you everything you need to know on how to diet your cat successfully

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.870
.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.140
If you need help that in your little for monster I hope you'll consider this guy.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.120
Thank you.
