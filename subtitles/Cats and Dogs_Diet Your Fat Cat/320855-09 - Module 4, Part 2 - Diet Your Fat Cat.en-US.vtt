00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
so gay.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.160
Welcome the part two module for you should all have filled out your plan for how much

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.740
you're gonna start out feeding your cat day exciting.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.940
So I would recommend printing out tap three on putting it up on your fridge or something.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.680
Make sure that everyone in the household its on board with the new plan for cat.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.310
Keep in mind that this plan will be modified as your cat starts to lose weight.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.810
To make sure that you're feeding your cat the right amount of food,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.800
you will have to make a schedule for when your cat and do it at the beginning.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.930
You can plan on winning your cat about once a week.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.650
You can wait unless people knee as you get the hang of how the diet is going for your cat.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.570
You can track your cats progress in tap.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.200
One tracking weight in the cat weight loss helpers.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.310
Spreadsheet example is shown to the right here.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:01.400
You'll need to just input the date that you wait your cat and the amount that you got so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.080
you can see here in tap one.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.130
It will also produce a grap of the information that you input into those two columns

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.750
explained on the last slide.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.050
And if you see your cats,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.080
we initially go up or stay the same for two or three wins in a row,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.390
it is time to reduce the calories by 20 again.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.880
So I mentioned earlier that I would show you how to make sure that you are not under

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.000
feeding your cab and we're going to throw up a slot here to show you good.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.730
Then you should be aware of is that the average cat should lose no more than 2% of their

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.220
body weight her week.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.030
You can do the math on your own for fun,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.300
or you may have been wondering.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.340
With the orange cells were representing in previous slides.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.590
Tab one is actually formatted so that the cell will change color to light orange.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.290
If your cat is losing more than 2% body weight per week,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.370
you could then correct the calorie amount.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.350
If you see any orange cells,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.820
do not try to aim for 2% change.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.540
Just aim for your cat to be losing weight Overall,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.320
if your cat loses any way at all,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.650
this should be treated as a huge success.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.330
Keep in mind that each cat is different.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.680
And if your cat is a senior or has any other health concerns,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.900
he may be a bit slower losing weight than the average cat.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.780
So you might be wondering.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.920
Great.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.510
So now I have this plan.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.350
But what happens after he loses just a little bit?

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.450
Um,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.620
don't worry.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.310
Getting there when you start to see your cats weight go down.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.030
Uh,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.650
just keep watch on that until you see it start to plateau.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.820
Um,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.250
would you join me?

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.840
Okay,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.450
um,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.620
you can reduce the calor and take another 20 when you get very similar way in values for

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.140
two or three weeks in a row,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.130
and your cat is still not at the ideal weight,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.870
and you could determine the ideal body shape based on the cat weight chart.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.380
Download from earlier.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.930
Just repeat this process until your cat sweet plateaus,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.040
and it looks like he is at a healthy body shape at this point.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.250
Although the calorie amount that your cat actually needs to maintain a healthy body weight

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.870
and can stop pretty seeing the calories,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.640
you may find it difficult to get an exact value for the calories based on your current food

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.350
options.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.750
Just try to get the calories as close as possible to the to the desired amount.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.920
If you're off by a few calories,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.960
that will be OK.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.040
A note on treat calories Not all treats have marched calories on them.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.810
If you still want to use them,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.950
you'll have to make an educated guess on how many calories might be in them.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.430
I found a good rule of thumb to be about 25 to 30 calories per tablespoon.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.950
Some of you might also have multiple animals in the household.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:24.890
Some of you also might have multiple animals in the household.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.900
Don't worry.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.780
You can still diet.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.030
You're one or two animals that are overweight.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.930
As long as you keep a schedule,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.670
make sure that each animal is getting the food you want them to eat.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.990
Sometimes simply watching them while I eat is all you need to do.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.090
However,

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.590
a safer but is feeding your animals separately to make sure that they get the food that

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.500
they're supposed to.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.570
You can also try feeding them on different levels.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.900
So,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.530
for instance,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.700
if you fed one animal on the top of the cat tree,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.380
another animal on the floor.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.790
You also need to make sure that everyone in the household is on board with this weight loss

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.390
program.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.550
Trust me,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.910
if your chat thinks that he can go around,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.760
each member of the household hit everyone up retreats.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.400
He will talk to everyone in your household and make sure that they understand the health

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.260
implications of this regimen is not followed and how they're contributing to a better life

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.850
for the cat.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.450
You can also make a schedule for feeding the cat and put it up on the fridge.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.050
And then you can check off when you have actually fed the cat.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.700
And that way,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.280
the cat won't accidentally,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.380
uh,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.670
trick you and feeding him twice.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.530
Uh,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.400
it's happened.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.750
You might also have a cat who eats too fast and then throws up as soon as he's done eating

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.750
,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.990
Um,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.320
and then he'll eat it.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.150
If you don't get up fast enough,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.870
I have had this happen.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.040
Um,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.330
so after waiting for your cat's stomach to settle 20 to 30 minutes,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.760
you can try feeding him again.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.290
But the real trick is making sure that your cat doesn't throw up in the first place.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.520
Um,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.530
some tricks for that is puzzle feeders,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.380
I found be really helpful on then.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.690
You can also try if you don't want to invest in that getting like a muffin tin and then

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.840
putting your kibble in there past crippling that grounds that he'll have to,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.030
like,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.960
pop out each one to get at those slowing down for sure.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.160
And then you can also try putting some big,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.940
smooth rocks in his bowl,

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.650
and then he'll have to Paul around those to get food.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.210
You can also try an obstacle course.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.880
Uh,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.300
that's where you have your measured out food and you would walk around the house and put

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.050
down food in strategic locations that your cat can get Teoh,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.180
and then your cat has to follow you around to get them.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.880
It will slow him down because he has to,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.100
like,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:00.570
follow you to get the food some thoughts on measuring.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.380
So if you have not already started measuring the food for your cat,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.640
you need to start now.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.850
A good idea would be buying a set of measuring cups that is specifically designed for the

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.630
cat food.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.550
That way you can leave them in the cat bag even,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.560
and your cat won't associate those measuring cups that you use for baking with the

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.400
measuring cups that you used to feed him.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.390
I made this mistake,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.980
and my cat now comes running whenever I get out.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.050
Tablespoons.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.190
All right,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.960
I'm going to throw up a slight here on the homework or module.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.760
Four.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.230
The homework four.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.290
Model four will be determining how much to start out feeding your cat on his diet using tab

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.290
.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.150
For initial calorie calculation,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.110
determine the calorie count for both methods and pick the one you feel most confident about

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.110
.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:03.650
Share this in your project on skill share to get some feedback to make a schedule of one.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.480
What and how much will be feeding your cat every day using tap three.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.400
Food and exercise plan.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.570
You can also share this in your project on skill share.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.570
To get some feedback,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.940
start weighing and tracking your cats week.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.570
Where regularly once a week to start by using tap.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.090
One.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.140
Tracking Wait.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.750
Also,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.070
be sure to adjust the weight Last time in your cat has got towed and is still overweight
