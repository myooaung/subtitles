00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.170
well.

00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:00.870
Seven.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.630
Wrapping up the last module.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.380
We made it.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.670
All right,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.110
Good job,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.490
guys.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.120
Getting through all the modules and getting started on the weight loss plan to type things

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.390
up.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.390
I just wanted to go over a couple of things to remember and some final thoughts for you

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.080
guys.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.060
First off first things to remember.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.670
Make sure the way your cat as often as once a week.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.570
That way,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.130
you're ensuring that you are not under or over feeding your cat,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.250
and you can keep track of your progress that way.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.750
Secondly,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
on your cats weight loss plan Reduce calories again when one.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.020
Your cats weight has been stable for two or three weeks,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.270
and he is still overweight,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.920
according to the cat wheat chart.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.070
Lastly,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.770
you can stop reducing calories when your cats we have stabilized and he looks like he's

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.920
actually the correct weight.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.690
According to the cat weight chart.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.350
A couple things to know this is going to be a slow process.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.820
Take every ounce that comes off your cat as a huge victory.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.100
Get excited about it,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.490
a zong.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.040
As you stick to your new schedule,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770
everything should work out just great.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.530
Another thing to take note of is depending on how large your cat is at the beginning,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.330
they might have some skin flaps at the end after losing some of that weight.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840
This is totally normal and totally fine.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.700
It's definitely not something that you need to be concerned about and then some final

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.050
thoughts.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.910

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.610
