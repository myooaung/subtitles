00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
the onto module three.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:10.540
The food in this module will be going over some common questions you may have about cat

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.900
food.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.560
They are as follows.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.870
Do you need to change the food you are presently eating your cat?

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.190
What is it?

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.250
Good food for dieting.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.810
Your cat.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.410
Do you need to cut out treats?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.200
Do you need to feed your cat?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.960
Wet food?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.510
Can you feed your cat?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.130
Any people?

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.740
Food?

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.060
Can you still free?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.900
Feed your cap.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.370
How often should you feed your cat?

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.350
And what if your cat get snacks from outside?

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.500
The first question Do you need to change the food?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.730
All right,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.610
so the short answer is No.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.000
You probably do not need to change the food.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.300
Uh,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.350
the only thing that really matters is the calorie count.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.170
If you want a longer answer,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.950
you may want to take a little peek at the current nutritional values in your cat food.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.880
Um,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.550
see what you're actually feeding your cat right now to see if you could possibly improve

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.120
its diet.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.040
So the following information will help you along this journey also.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.230
I can't help myself.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.900
I'm gonna have to show you my cat again.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:29.470
She is really enjoying Kat shelves today.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.250
Some things to consider when selecting food for your cat,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.520
our calories,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.450
the nutrition breakdown,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.560
what food options and kibble considerations and will go into a little bit more detail.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.050
Now,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.460
however,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.270
there are a few other things that we need to keep in mind.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.910
Calories are definitely your number.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.120
One thing to consider when picking out ate cat food because your cat eating too much of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.200
them is why he is overweight now.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170
The nutrition breakdown is important,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.510
too.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.930
Your cat is a condom for,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.930
and this is something to keep in mind because he would normally just be outside all day.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.320
Eating mice and mice are comprised of about 55% protein,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.510
23% fat and 12% carbohydrates.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
So when you put the numbers up here for you guys to see that,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.430
so here you can see the protein,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.240
fat and carbohydrate breakdown for your average mouse.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.440
This is something that you might want to keep in mind when picking out your next cat food

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.030
for your cat.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.470
For what food options.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.160
You might notice that it could be difficult or impossible to find dry food options that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.910
have that nutritional breakdown?

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.370
Uh,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.470
what food typically has a lot better.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.980
A nutritional breakdown in terms of what your house would typically be eating.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.530
You might try some money in your cat's diet with wet flew to try and achieve a closer

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.200
balance to what he would typically be getting in the wild.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.830
Also,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.850
if your cat isn't good at drinking water,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.660
you confined that,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.870
adding what food to his diet will help with this.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.870
And that's because what food has a higher water content,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.550
then dry food does.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.500
Another thing to consider is fiber content in your kibble.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.230
So it's been found that if you feed your cat higher fibre content that will eat in his diet

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.440
if you'd like a recommendation,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.780
one of my favorites is called Natural Balance Fat Cats.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.450
Cat food.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.690
Seriously,

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.590
that's what it's called.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.280
Also,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.980
try finding a dry cat food that has lower calories per cup as this will aid in your cat.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.650
Feeling fuller for longer.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.560
A couple notes on water.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.670
Your cat should be drinking between 5 to 10 fluid ounces of water per day.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.140
This will depend on your cats size,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.420
activity level health and diet.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.050
She cat does not consistently drink enough water.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.540
He may develop some bladder problems,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.690
such as urinary tract infections or kidney disease.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.040
A few things you can do to help get your cat to drink more water.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.890
One is your cat might be picky about location,

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.910
so you might want to spread water bulls throughout the house to see where you might like to

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.980
drink water from,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.420
Uh,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.860
you might try putting ice cubes in the water.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.230
Maybe the temperature isn't what she really likes.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.900
Another thing to consider is water bull material,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.150
so trying out different water for full materials such as ceramic metal.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.570
Typically,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.800
when we use plastic,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.440
that'll leach into the bull,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.050
and it'll start tasting my plastic at some point.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.650
And cats might not like that last thing.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.980
You can try getting a drinking fountain,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.860
which is an awesome idea,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.070
because it's actually something that simulates more closely what he would be drinking from

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.590
and in the wild that would be a stream or river
