00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
I also wanted to take a little bit of time to go over some differences between active

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.040
playtime and inactive playtime there many different ways you can actively play with your

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.450
cap.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.010
A couple examples of active playtime would be using a want away with them or do something

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.890
under a blanket or something else that you don't mind your cat destroying.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.630
If you don't have anyone who is yet,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.080
what are you waiting for?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.770
Go get some or you can also make some.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.660
If you're handy,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.560
Just valued is really a string and a stick.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.060
Some favor.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.000
Want boys of mine?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.550
Are ones that simulate riel.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.100
Pray that you can't would actually eat in the wild,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.450
for instance of mouse toy or something with feathers on it.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.630
You can also try investing in cat toys that will stimulate your cat.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.650
While you weren't around what we would call inactive playtime,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.580
at least for the human right for inactive playtime.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.510
There's a bunch of things you can find out there if you don't always have the time or

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.850
energy to play with your cap.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.720
However,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.120
I wouldn't make this the only type of play time that you do with your cap as,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.650
uh,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.510
we're not.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.950
Your cat actually enjoys hanging out sometimes with you.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.570
Another question that you might have is how much exercise does your cat actually need?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.110
An average healthy cat will need about three minutes of exercise a day.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.220
Uh,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.440
this,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.820
of course,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.510
depends on age mobility.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.250
Um,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830
older your cat gets,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.630
the less he will want to move around.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.290
And if your cat is more with the obese,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.030
just intently watching and toy can be an exercise for him,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.320
your cat will let you know when he has done playing.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.630
A cat will begin to groom himself after a place session.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740
You may be able to start them up again if he has not.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.650
If it hasn't been too long,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.070
try to at least get your cat to move for 5 to 10 minutes at the beginning of the diet or

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.060
morbidly obese cat.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.670
Getting him to move around for even a few seconds can be an accomplishment.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.460
You can work up to 30 minutes eventually.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.480
Next,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.370
I'm gonna show you an example of how to fill out three cat exercising plan from your cat

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.090
weight loss helper spread cheat That's under Tab three.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.400
Food and exercise plan Gonna throw up.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.130
He's slide here for you.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.750
You can see here on the right an example of filling out the cat exercising plan.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.980
Just fill out the time of day which tour you would like to use and the amount of time you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.470
were planning to spend during the place session.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.820
Next,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.400
I'm gonna throw up a couple slides here on do it yourself.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.580
Cat toys will have two options for you to try out if you'd like.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.340
For the first option here,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.880
you will need an empty cereal box,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.240
some scissors tape and a cat toy.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.170
So taken empty cereal box and tape the open and shut cut holes in the cereal box big enough

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.060
for a cat to get their paws through and then put a cat toy or two in there and leave it out

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.730
for your cat to enjoy during the day.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.910
For the second option here,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.780
you will need a toilet paper roll,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.710
some tape and a cat tree.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.520
Just fold over the end of one side of a toilet paper roll and seal with teeth and then

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.690
place the cat's favorite treat inside and leave it out for the cat to play with and about

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.350

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.040
some considerations for playtime.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.950
I don't want you to get daunted by the 30 minute goal.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.050
Most cats will play with themselves if you d about a few cat toys during the day.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.790
Hi,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.530
your cat may also need to lose a pounder T before this happens,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.950
though,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.730
make sure to rotate toys every couple of days is this will keep things interesting for the

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.270
cat?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.620
