00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
So emails be wondering why is my cat fat gets gain weight the same way humans do.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.330
They expend less energy than they consume.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.160
But getting into a few other issues there could be underlying health issues.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.330
There's the move to indoors boredom and positive associations with food,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.010
so let's go into those in a little bit more detail.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.810
First of all,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.400
if there are any medical issues,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.760
that would be a problem.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.650
For instance,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.250
if your cat was pregnant,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310
then your cat would be overweight.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.050
If you find there is a medical cause,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.250
the's do work with your vet to determine the best course of action.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.520
Assuming it is not a medical related issue,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.350
what's move on to the more mundane and more probable causes.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.470
So one of the more mundane causes of your cat being overweight is the move to indoors.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.950
This is actually a fairly recent development.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.250
In fact,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.650
our modern version of Kitty litter wasn't even created until 1947.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.200
Move indoors has also greatly increased the lifespan of the cat.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.430
Your average outdoor cat is only going to live about five years,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.720
whereas indoor cats have been known to live up to 20 years besides the moved indoors

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.490
increasing room,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950
the cat's life span.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.260
There are also a few other substantial changes that have happened as well.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.840
For starters,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050
are captains and hunt for food anymore.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.810
We just put the food down for them men.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.760
They have us trained,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.140
Huh?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
Where Cat would normally need to hunt for food,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.150
they no longer have Teoh.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.610
Another reason.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.670
Maybe border.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.400
Uh,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.300
sometimes as cat parents.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.310
We might find it difficult to understand what is interesting to a cat.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.920
So for a cat,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.510
watching movies or playing video games wouldn't be interesting.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.240
And for humans,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.590
staring out the window after the first hour might get kind of boring.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.270
Often wanted Cat does get bored taken sometimes just find the food bowl and scarf down a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.350
couple cables.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.150
Another reason that your cat may be overweight is a positive association with food,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.970
so your cat may have a positive association with food because we give them attention during

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.950
feeding times.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.490
For instance,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.860
your cat Yeah,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.800
is that you?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.720
Let's say you interpret that is them wanting food.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.320
You go get some treats,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.280
give it to them,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.880
pet them at the same time,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.450
and now they have a positive association with getting food,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.420
getting pet,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.580
getting attention,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.650
and they like that.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.260
We can also sometimes underestimate how much our cat really wants or needs our attention.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.510
To some,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.570
all that up there could be a multitude of reasons why your cat is overweight now.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.050
Your cat may have been overweight for years,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.800
and maybe you just even realized it recently.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.330
There are many issues that comes with Cap being overweight.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.180
There are many common disorders associate with excess weight and cats.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.480
The bottom line,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.690
really is that if you can't remains overweight,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.650
he can expect a shorter life span than a cat with a healthy weight.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.850
The benefits for your cat being at a healthy weight is that your cat will be better eagle

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.620
to around junk.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.910
Run and play with you.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.300
Your cat will live longer,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.050
enjoy more in his environment.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.030
You also get to enjoy all the benefits that come along with your cat being healthier and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.580
happier.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.020
So for the homework,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.560
I'm gonna put up a slide here to show you take some time to look over the chart and

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.440
determine what your cat lies on.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.430
The cat weight chart.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.010
Where to print out the chart and or save it somewhere that you can reference every week or

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.590
two and then armed skill share.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.670
Click the Create Project button below than upload a current picture of your cat.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.600

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.000

According to the cat we chart.
