00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,190
In this video we're going to talk about the profile picture specifically.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,155
This is mine right here.

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:10,275
If I open it in a new tab and have a look at it,

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,345
I can increase it a bit,

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,559
it'll still be pixelated,

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,510
but literally this is the highest resolution that your prospective clients will see it.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,890
You really don't have to have a photo that looks amazing in

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,455
a high resolution or a high screen size because this is basically the highest resolution.

9
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:32,640
I have this as it's super high res photo on my desktop,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,710
but once it goes up to Upwork,

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,860
this is as big as anyone's going to see it.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,550
Any of the small details like you have

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,065
a blemish on your face or anything it doesn't really matter,

14
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:47,790
the important thing is that you get the basics right.

15
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,235
When I say the basics,

16
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:51,220
I mean your attire,

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,220
your look on your face,

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,205
the background, and the composition.

19
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:57,845
First of all my biggest tip,

20
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:00,290
and this is not going to work for everyone.

21
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,730
But as you can see,

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,940
this is a pretty professionally done photo and actually had

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,330
the help of a professional photographer that take this.

24
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,250
There was a special deal going at

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,350
the co-working space I used to work out of back in 2015.

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,390
A really good photographer came in,

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,960
and was just taking headshots all day.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,440
I got this pretty cool headshot,

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,140
which has lasted me up until now.

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,500
It really is a good investment if you want

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,325
to hire somebody or even have somebody who you know,

32
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,510
who's good with cameras,

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,770
who can take a good shot,

34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,650
come and take a photo of you.

35
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,900
It's a great asset to have and it's not just for Upwork.

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,400
You can use it for LinkedIn,

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,265
you can use it for all things.

38
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:46,520
The reason why I mentioned that upfront is because the photographer is going to make

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,840
sure that your photo is not only professional looking,

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,345
but it's going to make sure that you've got

41
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,820
all these points covered in terms of the lighting,

42
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,790
the composition, the attire hopefully,

43
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,010
and your expression on your face.

44
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,380
Let's just go over those right now in case you

45
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,110
don't have a photographer and you're doing it yourself.

46
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,635
The first thing is attire.

47
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:12,260
I'm wearing a dressed up button up shirt,

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,770
but I'm not wearing a tie and I think that's a good balance of

49
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,420
professionalism without looking like you're some corporate dude.

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,620
We are freelancers on the platform,

51
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,465
so we're not expected to be

52
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:27,800
this corporate person unless maybe that's your niche or that's your audience.

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,340
Again, it has to all match with your audience, but for me,

54
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,445
I think having a businessy type shirt,

55
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:39,665
but buttons open, no tie is the good balance.

56
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:43,010
The second thing is I got a smile on my face.

57
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,830
Don't put a photo on there of you being angry or anything like that.

58
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,640
I mean, it should be common sense,

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,415
but you want to look approachable and

60
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:55,730
people have to get the sense that they're going to enjoy working with you.

61
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,344
Don't obviously put on a silly face because you want to be professional,

62
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,619
but you can be professional,

63
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:03,215
and be smiley and happy at the same time,

64
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:06,610
I think I got a pretty good balance in this profile photo.

65
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,705
Next one is no distracting background.

66
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:14,365
As you can see, the background is pretty much plain gray.

67
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:17,460
If you don't have a nice plain background,

68
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,570
it's pretty easy to find.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,160
I think just looking around here I can see some pretty plain walls.

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,595
But if you do have a distracting background that you're shooting on,

71
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,280
maybe blur it out or just in Photoshop,

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,250
try and lower that contrast because you don't

73
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,000
want anything to take away from the photo of you,

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,935
then of course, the lighting.

75
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:42,920
It's all very even in this photo, as you can see,

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,480
I think from memory,

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,435
the photographer who did this had a flash.

78
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,595
It's always going to be even lighting when

79
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,490
the photographer is using professional lighting.

80
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,530
But for yourself, I don't know,

81
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,980
maybe step out into a sunny area,

82
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,160
right here, for example,

83
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,735
I've got the sun on my face because I'm looking out off this patio right here.

84
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,900
Maybe right here would be a good place to do a headshot.

85
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,260
Essentially, you just don't want your face to be dark

86
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,920
or it to be hard for somebody to make out your face.

87
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,790
I mean, again, putting this down to 100 percent,

88
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,150
this is what the size is going to come out to when your client looks at it.

89
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,945
If your face is not easily distinguishable,

90
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,095
they can't figure out what's going on in the image

91
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:30,710
from looking at it for a split second at this image size,

92
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,025
then you've already lost the battle.

93
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,805
That brings me to my last point is the composition.

94
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:41,135
I think I've got the composition pretty bang on here.

95
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,060
I've got my head in the middle.

96
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,390
I'm showing a bit of showed,

97
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,755
it's not to close on the face like I think if you had it about here,

98
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,925
maybe it'd be a bit close up, a bit intimidating.

99
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,490
But I think having it here showing a bit of the

100
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,630
shoulder's it's at a good distance so that you can actually see my face,

101
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,320
but you're not right up in my face.

102
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,480
I think, aim for this composition and you'll be fine if we want to go through

103
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,625
the search results and find a few examples,

104
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,040
let's just do WordPress developer again.

105
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,080
Going through the results here,

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,640
you don't have to have a background that is neutral necessarily.

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,270
You don't have to necessarily be wearing a business type shirts.

108
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,250
The important thing and I think this profile right here is all right one.

109
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,530
The composition is pretty perfect I think.

110
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,765
You've got his face. It's not too close.

111
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:38,285
Maybe he needs to smile a bit more or maybe that is his smile.

112
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:41,300
But, one like this where you're wearing a cap and

113
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,795
a hoodie and it's super close into the face.

114
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:47,860
I wouldn't say that that would be the best look.

115
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,310
Here, you can see it looks like a professional photo shoot.

116
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,980
But what I don't like about this photo is the composition that

117
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,835
doesn't need to be a lot of his body in the shot.

118
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:02,285
I think if we just did a front on shot with his face,

119
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:03,710
that would look a lot better.

120
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,780
Muhammad is looking good here.

121
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,285
For [inaudible] I like his composition,

122
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,010
but the lighting is not perfect.

123
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,900
It's a bit dark on his face.

124
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,450
Pretty easy to fix that up in photoshop if you've got

125
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,580
some photo editing skills, otherwise,

126
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,000
invest in a light or find a light source in your house and put that close

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,445
to your face because you want your face to be bright and clear in the frame.

128
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:30,860
I just thought I'd share some thoughts with that.

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,480
Another resource you can use if you're iffy about whether your photo is

130
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,465
actually really good on that is a website called photo feeler.

131
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,615
I learned this from my friend Lewis.

132
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,090
It's just photofeeler.com.

133
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,805
When the page loads,

134
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,820
I'll be able to show you what it does. Here you go.

135
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,164
What you do is you add in your photos,

136
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,440
you say what it's for.

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,335
In this case it would be business and you get a rating on certain aspects.

138
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:02,450
Essentially, if you have a bunch of photos that you've

139
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,565
taken and you can't tell which one is the best.

140
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:08,235
You can put it into a tool like this called photo feeler.

141
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:11,175
You can let other people decide basically.

142
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,500
You can see here,

143
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,050
if you scroll down more about how it works.

144
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,540
But basically your crowd sourcing and answer to is my profile picture good?

145
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,670
Or which one of these profile pictures is the best?

146
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,705
That's if you want to take it the step further.

147
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:30,900
Honestly, the same principles apply.

148
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,320
If you were going to do a LinkedIn photo,

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,100
you just want to have good composition.

150
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,050
Honestly, I think if you try and follow what I've done in terms of my profile,

151
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,485
I think you'll be pretty sweet.

152
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,650
That covers the profile picture.

153
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,245
In the next video,

154
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:52,650
we're going to go over choosing a title. I'll see you in that one.
