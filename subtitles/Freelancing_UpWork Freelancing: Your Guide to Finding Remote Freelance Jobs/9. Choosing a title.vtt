00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
In this video we're going to talk about choosing your title and the

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.650
two words I want you to keep in mind when you're writing your title is;

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.865
one, relevant and two, specific, okay.

4
00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:16.485
Obviously it goes without saying that if you are a web developer,

5
00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:20.415
you want to say that your web developing your title, if you're a designer,

6
00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.350
you want to say that you're a designer in your title,

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.550
if you're a writer,

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.445
you want to have the words write in your title.

9
00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:30.570
But what you need to do is also be specific.

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.330
If I put out web developer,

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.640
that's simply too broad.

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.680
The reason why that's too broad,

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.720
is because you have to have an understanding of your audience.

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.025
At least in the web development world,

15
00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.695
if somebody is looking for a web developer,

16
00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.750
they could be looking for a number of things.

17
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.610
Maybe they want somebody to build them a simple website built on WordPress.

18
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.295
Maybe they are looking for somebody who has

19
00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:58.745
experience with a certain language or framework like say for instance,

20
00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:00.995
a React. js Developer.

21
00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.300
Calling yourself a web developer is just too broad,

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.450
and even calling yourself just a designer is to broad.

23
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.415
Are you designing UX, UI, web, graphics?

24
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:14.420
Make sure to be specific enough to the point

25
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.560
where you're covering that specific need that the client wants.

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.380
Again, this goes back to understanding your audience and understanding your focus.

27
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.135
This all goes back to your pitch,

28
00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.130
what is it exactly that you're audience?

29
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.125
If you can answer that question,

30
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.970
that answer goes directly into your title.

31
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.675
Looking at my title here,

32
00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.225
I've identified that I like working with

33
00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:41.390
Australian clients and Australian clients like working with me.

34
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.240
That's like my audience right there and that's why I

35
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.695
put Australian at the start of my title.

36
00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:52.550
Then I go into my main title or the core of my title,

37
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.675
which is WordPress developer,

38
00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:57.455
and I could actually put in another word here,

39
00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:02.555
Word press web developer but I think people get the point with WordPress developer.

40
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.805
I'm not saying I'm a web developer,

41
00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:08.270
I'm going one step deeper and I'm being specific to the point

42
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.035
where I'm targeting people who want WordPress websites.

43
00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.165
Which I feel is quite a good balance,

44
00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:16.115
and it's done me well so far.

45
00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:20.550
This extra bit here that I put in keywords that often go along with it.

46
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.325
I've heard of WordPress experts being referred to as theme experts.

47
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.610
The difference between developer and theme expert would be,

48
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.215
a WordPress developer can develop features and customized code,

49
00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:37.040
whereas the theme expert is just somebody who knows how to use

50
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.575
WordPress and maybe can build a whole website and customize one without any use of code.

51
00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:45.950
With this title, I'm telling people that I'm an Australian,

52
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.475
I can build on WordPress and I can

53
00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:54.005
do basic stuff on WordPress as well and update the theme,

54
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.070
build them a website, all that stuff.

55
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.110
That is basically the framework to developing a good title.

56
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.380
You just want to be relevant and specific and talk

57
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.920
directly to what the client might be looking for.

58
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.000
Really guys, that's pretty much it,

59
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.360
keep it simple, be relevant and specific.

60
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.320
If you don't know how specific you want to go,

61
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.150
my guideline would be to choose a category that you're obviously in,

62
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.495
you should know your category by now and go one layer deeper.

63
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.360
We talked about specialization in a previous video,

64
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.535
if you're not sure what to specialize in,

65
00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.450
just put what you did last time in there.

66
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.050
If you're a web developer and you did a WordPress website last,

67
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.450
specialize in WordPress for the time being.

68
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.400
You can always come back and change your title later.

69
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.005
Now before we wrap up this little lesson here,

70
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:47.960
I want to give you one more bit of advice and

71
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.930
it's something that I see some freelance is doing,

72
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.200
which I think is actually detrimental to their success.

73
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.740
What I'm going to do demonstrate this is click over into

74
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.275
the ''search box'' and search for WordPress in freelancer.

75
00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.170
Once I get to the search results,

76
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.860
you can start to see some people doing what I like to call keyword stuffing.

77
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.905
If you look at Arti R here,

78
00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:14.250
she has basically thrown words into a tidal.

79
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.320
It doesn't say I am WordPress developers specializing in,

80
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.730
or I am a WordPress developer with a particular focus on,

81
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.560
what it says instead is just the words WordPress, Joomla , HTML5,

82
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.540
Ccss3, she's even misspelled one of the terms here, CSS.

83
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.385
Probably that's why she's $0 on the platform and Bootstrap.

84
00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:42.740
These are skills that she should definitely include in

85
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.330
her skills section but to keyword stuff these inner profile,

86
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.004
it's actually working in the sense that when I typed him WordPress,

87
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:52.760
she did come up,

88
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.570
she has done that part well in terms of including her keywords.

89
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.880
But as soon as the client sees this,

90
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.770
they need a WordPress website,

91
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.495
maybe they need a Joomla website,

92
00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:05.525
but they probably don't need both at the same time.

93
00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:08.510
I think it would help for her a lot to be a lot

94
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.645
more specific with what she offers clients.

95
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.055
Maybe she wants to say,

96
00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:17.600
I do WordPress websites and Joomla websites but I don't think

97
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.160
you should go into five different things that you can do even if you are multi-skilled.

98
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.615
But I think at work you want to be as specific as possible because put it this way,

99
00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:29.900
you've got to think in the mind of the client, right.

100
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.600
When they come to the search engine and

101
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.540
they're looking to find somebody to build them a WordPress site,

102
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.460
they're going to go down here and look for somebody who knows WordPress.

103
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.065
They're not necessarily going to care that you know Joomla,

104
00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:43.330
and you know Bootstrap,

105
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.680
unless they're working with a theme that uses Bootstrap.

106
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.965
But essentially the question that you want to answer

107
00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:51.845
in the mind of your prospective client is,

108
00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:55.120
is this the relevant person for my job?

109
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.675
What your title has to do is communicate relevance.

110
00:05:58.675 --> 00:06:01.040
Yes you want to put the right keywords in there,

111
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.945
but you don't want to keyword stuff.

112
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.510
You don't want to throw a bunch of different keywords in there,

113
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.465
trying to rank for all different jobs because you might rank for

114
00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:12.815
all those different jobs but once the client comes to the search results,

115
00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:15.470
they're probably going to go for somebody who's a bit more

116
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.900
specific to their specific need, okay.

117
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.845
To provide you a few other examples of other profiles that are doing this okay.

118
00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:26.465
This guy Pablo K ,

119
00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:28.460
expert Web Design with WordPress.

120
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.155
He's saying he's a web designer,

121
00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:33.465
but he specializes in working with WordPress, that's great.

122
00:06:33.465 --> 00:06:37.160
If I scroll down, there's a few that just say WordPress in their title,

123
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.310
I think that's specific enough,

124
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.665
but surely they can add in a few words saying,

125
00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:47.150
I am a WordPress developer who enjoys this or something.

126
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.700
You don't want to use one word when you can

127
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.055
flush that out a bit and make it into a proper title.

128
00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:54.680
That's all I'll say on titles,

129
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.285
guys, it's pretty simple,

130
00:06:56.285 --> 00:07:00.505
just try and remember to be relevant and specific and

131
00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:04.880
remember the experience of the user coming to Upwork,

132
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.410
searching for a freelancer,

133
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.745
and that's something that you should do throughout everything you do on Upwork.

134
00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:15.720
Remember to think in terms of what the client sees, okay.

135
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.750
That's the title, in the next video,

136
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.460
we're going to go into the overview.
