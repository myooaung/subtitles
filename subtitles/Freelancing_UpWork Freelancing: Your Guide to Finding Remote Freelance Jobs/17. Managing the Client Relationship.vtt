00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
All right guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:04.570
In the last video, we talked about communicating during

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.605
the getting hired process and the actual process on Upwork of accepting an offer,

4
00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.380
starting the contract, and ending the contract.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.280
In this video, we're going to talk about what

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.560
happens when you're on contract with a client.

7
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.600
You've already negotiated the price,

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.190
you've already figured out what it is,

9
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.700
and you've accepted the offer.

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.280
Now, how do you manage the client relationship while you're performing the work so

11
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.105
that the client is happy and it works smoothly for both you and the client.

12
00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:35.770
One of the principles I live by, I call over-communicating.

13
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.950
The reason why I call it that is it because it's a reminder to

14
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.500
make sure that you're communicating as much as possible.

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.804
You don't want to be obnoxious with this obviously,

16
00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:49.190
don't be crazy and communicate unnecessarily.

17
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.815
But anytime there's an update to share with the client,

18
00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.065
anytime there's a thought you had,

19
00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:55.930
don't be afraid to share.

20
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.600
One of the things that you're communicating in a nonverbal way

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.455
while sending multiple messages or contacting the client,

22
00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:08.485
is that they can trust you and that you're always there in case they need you.

23
00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:12.379
One of the tactics I've used with clients is to summarize

24
00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:16.415
the list of things they want because often clients are just sending random stuff to you.

25
00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:18.170
Oh I want this, I want this, I want this.

26
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.395
What I like to do, summarize everything that they've

27
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.415
said to me in the message stream of what they want or in another document,

28
00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:28.565
put it through, here is a checklist of what you want me to do.

29
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:32.660
Then after that, go through and like I've done here,

30
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.075
provide a summary of all the things I've done,

31
00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.750
checking them off and that communicates to the client, Oh, Okay.

32
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.905
I know we're at now.

33
00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:41.510
I know how much he's done.

34
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.060
The one thing you don't want to do when you're working with

35
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.670
clients on Upwork is get the job,

36
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.415
do the work and don't communicate with them at all.

37
00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:51.510
You might think, okay. I'm doing a great job.

38
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.780
I'm not bothering them. But you want to let

39
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.705
them know how it's going throughout the process.

40
00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:59.480
Be responsive when they message you.

41
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.830
Make sure to tell the client as soon as you've done something,

42
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.515
give them regular updates.

43
00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:09.695
Obviously, you'll get a feel for the client's expectations over time.

44
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:14.225
Some are quite needy and want daily or constant communication,

45
00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:17.915
others are happy with communication more spread out.

46
00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:20.585
But if you haven't heard from the client in a while,

47
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:21.785
make sure to follow up.

48
00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:25.175
If you've done something new or need something else to go on with,

49
00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:26.510
make sure to follow up.

50
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.800
It's on you to communicate as much as possible with the client

51
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.110
and let them know that you're there and that you're actually working on their project.

52
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.545
Again, remember here, I want to reiterate this,

53
00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:39.575
once you're on contract with a client,

54
00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:42.940
they have the ability to leave a review on your profile and that

55
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.550
can be very detrimental if they give you a bad review.

56
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.360
You want to make sure if you're on contract with a client,

57
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.355
you not only do great work,

58
00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:54.800
but communicate well with them and make

59
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.040
sure that if there's any issues whatsoever that they have,

60
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.830
that they can bring it up with you and that you'll sort it out.

61
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.255
That's a lot better than letting issues just sit around and then they

62
00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:09.840
won't communicate how they feel and suddenly you'll be getting a two,

63
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.030
three star review at the end when you could have gotten a five-star review.

64
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.000
What you need, especially when starting out, is five-star reviews.

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.165
You want to make sure that every review you get on artwork is five-stars.

66
00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:23.550
Don't leave it up to chance,

67
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.660
make sure that you're communicating constantly with the client,

68
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.040
making sure that they're happy.

69
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.365
One of the areas that I really like to communicate as well is around budget.

70
00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:35.835
A lot of clients on Upwork are budget conscious.

71
00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.960
If they ask you to do something that you think is

72
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.749
going to take a long time and you're on an hourly contract,

73
00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.765
you don't want it to get to the point where,

74
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:50.165
you do this 10 hour task and then it gets charged to them and they're like, "What?

75
00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:52.120
I didn't realize it was going to take that long."

76
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.690
Even though you're in the right to do the work that they asked you,

77
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.745
you want to communicate to them, "Okay.

78
00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.365
That's going to be time-consuming.

79
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.600
It's going to take me around this many hours.

80
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.055
As long as you're cool with that,

81
00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:06.300
otherwise, here are some other alternatives."

82
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.395
You want to make sure that you're respecting their budget

83
00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:13.320
and you're not going to charge them more than they expect.

84
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.775
Even if you've done the work and you're entitled to it,

85
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:20.780
you want to know up front that the client is going to be happy with you doing that.

86
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.480
One of the things I do when I'm communicating with

87
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.680
clients is if they asked me to do something that's going to be very time consuming,

88
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.870
I let them know that that's going to be time-consuming,

89
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.335
here's a more cost effective way to do it.

90
00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:35.855
Clients often will really appreciate it.

91
00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:37.520
If they say, "Look, that's cool,

92
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.855
I want you to still do it."

93
00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.835
That's fine, you've done all you can.

94
00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:45.740
But that's a little extra step that I like to take when communicating with clients.

95
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.180
Also during this process,

96
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.865
you want to keep in mind that this could be a repeat customer

97
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:53.120
and you could actually build a long-term relationship with them.

98
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.725
If that's the case, I would recommend getting on the phone with them every now and then,

99
00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:01.505
maybe meeting up with them if they are in the same city as you.

100
00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:04.610
Try and build a relationship with them because

101
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.030
clients like to come back to the same freelancers again and again.

102
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.340
It's hard to find good people.

103
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.640
As a business owner,

104
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.205
I've outsourced once before and it was a terrible experience.

105
00:05:15.205 --> 00:05:19.835
The freelancer just couldn't figure out even a basic task.

106
00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:23.570
This is the environment that clients are working with.

107
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.345
That's where trust and relationship become so important to you and the client.

108
00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:31.535
You want to make sure that if

109
00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:34.430
you trying to build a long-term relationship with these clients,

110
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.035
which you ideally should be,

111
00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.750
that you communicate with them in as many ways.

112
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.790
That's going to communicate, trust,

113
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.840
familiarity, and build a relationship with them.

114
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.080
Get them on the phone,

115
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.715
meet them in person if you can,

116
00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:48.935
and build the relationship that way.

117
00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.930
Again, we talked about this in the last video,

118
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.360
but I want to reiterate it again.

119
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.715
One, don't be a yes man.

120
00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:58.625
Two, consult if you can, and three,

121
00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.050
if you don't know the answer,

122
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.860
admit it, but offer a solution.

123
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.775
Again, with the yes man thing,

124
00:06:04.775 --> 00:06:09.695
if it's a question that is really simple to answer and doesn't need any more information,

125
00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:11.270
yes, of course you can say yes.

126
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.685
I'm not saying you can't say yes to anything.

127
00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:17.960
But if it's a bit of a loaded question with a lot of considerations,

128
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.720
don't just say yes, but say, yes,

129
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.350
we can do that or we can do it this way or I don't know about that.

130
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.860
This is the opportunity where you get into being a consultant.

131
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.510
You can say, "Yes,

132
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.310
I can do that, but how about this?"

133
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.335
Or have you considered this?

134
00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:36.440
Again, clients will really appreciate this.

135
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.325
The final point is,

136
00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:40.775
if you don't know the solution, admit it,

137
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.910
but be proactive in coming up with a solution.

138
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.370
Say for instance, if they say,

139
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.115
can you do this, don't just say no.

140
00:06:49.115 --> 00:06:50.705
You want to be honest with them saying,

141
00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:52.385
look, I've never done that before.

142
00:06:52.385 --> 00:06:53.750
I'd be happy to learn it.

143
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.080
Here's what I can do.

144
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.825
You can say no for sure,

145
00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:58.100
but don't just leave it there.

146
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.760
Say, here's what we can do next.

147
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.930
I don't want to harp on about those points too much.

148
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.970
We covered a bit of that in the last video,

149
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.680
but that's essentially it guys.

150
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.645
After you've done a great job,

151
00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:10.160
you've done all those things,

152
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.100
you've communicated thoroughly throughout the project,

153
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.315
the client is happy,

154
00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:16.235
then you can end the contract.

155
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:20.225
You want to make sure that before you end the contract,

156
00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:22.740
that the client is as happy as possible.

157
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.960
If you have to put in an extra few bits of work just to make the client happy, do it.

158
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.175
Because it means so much to your profile to have

159
00:07:31.175 --> 00:07:35.600
a five-star review rather than a three-star review with a few words of,

160
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.650
oh, it wasn't a good experience working with this freelancer.

161
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.665
Make sure that you end on a high point.

162
00:07:42.665 --> 00:07:44.030
Usually the job is completed,

163
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.945
they're happy, they enjoyed working with you.

164
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:50.885
That's a good point to end the contract and then you get that sought after review.

165
00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:53.570
It feels great. You got to five-stars on your profile.

166
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.830
You're looking good, you're on your way to a 100 percent jobs success score,

167
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.330
and top rated status.

168
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.120
Actually one of the things when you're getting started on platform,

169
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.250
if you starting to build some momentum,

170
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.670
Upwork will give you a badge as well called rising talent,

171
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.485
I think they call it at the moment.

172
00:08:09.485 --> 00:08:13.160
These are the things that incentivize you to do great things for your clients.

173
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.080
It's going to make your profile look much better.

174
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.735
Make sure that if the client is not happy,

175
00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:20.990
try and fix that up as much as possible before you actually

176
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.400
end that contract and start to exchange those reviews.

177
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.300
That's basically the whole Upwork process from setting up your profile,

178
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.610
to finding work, to submitting proposals,

179
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.710
to managing the client relationship,

180
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.570
and then ending that contract.

181
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.780
This is pretty much the bulk of the course completed.

182
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.160
The next two videos are going to be

183
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.400
bonus lessons that I mentioned at the start of the course,

184
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.260
and that is my tactic that has really supercharged my results.

185
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.450
I'm excited to share that one with you very soon.

186
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.530
But first of all,

187
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.735
let's talk about the job success score.

188
00:08:53.735 --> 00:08:56.730
I'll see you in the next video.
