00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
All right guys. So for this video,

2
00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:05.115
I have removed those other jobs that I

3
00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.310
clicked on before because I'm going to use my own filters here.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.460
I will show you how I evaluate

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.620
the different opportunities that I come across in my daily search if I'm doing it.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.180
So like I said,

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.465
I'm only looking at intermediate and expert with a minimum of $100.

8
00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:28.450
Web development, obviously Australia.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.435
If I close filters,

10
00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:35.470
that narrows it down to the 700 jobs. All right.

11
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.490
Out of those 700 jobs,

12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.925
a small percentage might have been posted in the last 24 hours.

13
00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:45.635
There's not that many jobs to go through in the last 24 hours, I would suspect.

14
00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:47.330
Okay. So as I scroll down,

15
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.960
I'll go through the projects that are of interest to me and I'll open them up in

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.600
a new tab and I'll do my best to share with you my thought process.

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.275
So here we go.

18
00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:01.630
Our website is built on weeks.

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.605
Okay. Let's have a look at that.

20
00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:09.860
Create WordPress theme and copy data from archive.You might be interested in that.

21
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.890
WordPress developing needed for small projects.

22
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.740
Okay. Yeah, maybe.

23
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.975
Again, I'm not super fussy.

24
00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.750
For the purpose of this video,

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.750
I'll open up a few ones that we can evaluate.

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.620
Try and get a good variety here for you guys.

27
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.974
WordPress expert to build full time.

28
00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:32.990
So I can go through the results here.

29
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.180
I'm already up to 13 hours.

30
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.135
As you can see, if I go further,

31
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:43.130
I'm moving up to 24 hours pretty quickly.

32
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.910
By page even page three,

33
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.910
I've hit the 24-hour mark.

34
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.870
Okay. So for you,

35
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.990
you might want to have less filters so that you

36
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.290
can actually find more jobs within that 24-hour period.

37
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.470
But for me, I'm happy to take

38
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.205
the sniper approach rather than the shotgun approach to finding work.

39
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:07.190
Okay. So let's have a look at some of these jobs here.

40
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.100
I'm going to bring this down again so we can look at the tabs

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.225
and have a little squeeze at that these and evaluate them.

42
00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:18.770
So the first thing I would recommend is that you

43
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.300
evaluate these jobs as much as the client is evaluating you.

44
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.690
Okay? So you don't want to be coming from the mindset of you groveling for work.

45
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.400
All these people are doing you a favor.

46
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.050
All these people have something of value for you and you're just grasping at it.

47
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.270
So get that mindset out of your head,

48
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.130
you are a value as well.

49
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.180
These clients are desperately looking for somebody to do a good job for them as well.

50
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.620
Maybe they're not desperate,

51
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.690
but that's the mindset that you should have.

52
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.270
You shouldn't come from a mindset of desperation.

53
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.040
If anything, you should be thinking that these clients desperately want to work with you.

54
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.840
So it's just good to have that mindset and

55
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.395
evaluate clients as much as they would evaluate you.

56
00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:07.230
Actually, I did an interview with another freelancer

57
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.245
on my YouTube channel last year, Brett Dev.

58
00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:12.105
One of the things he said was,

59
00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:15.440
"When I go to interview with somebody, I'm interviewing them.

60
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.395
They're not interviewing me."

61
00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:23.175
Switch that mental mindset around this value exchange.

62
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:27.095
So I think it goes back to that employee mindset.

63
00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:31.380
There's one job and there's maybe hundreds of applicants.

64
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.305
So you almost feel like you got to prove yourself.

65
00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:38.435
Here you obviously got to demonstrate that you can do the work.

66
00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:42.610
But they're looking for somebody just as much as you're looking to get hired.

67
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.125
So keep that in mind when you're evaluating jobs.

68
00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.290
So the first thing I look for,

69
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.715
I've got a bit of a list here;

70
00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:51.785
a detailed job description.

71
00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:56.750
So right now, this is not the best job description because it's one paragraph,

72
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.150
haven't split it out into multiple paragraphs.

73
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.365
It's small.

74
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.030
If I go in and read it,

75
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.760
we are looking for a talented designer and

76
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.235
developer to an existing website is built on weeks.

77
00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:13.250
So as I'm going through this job description,

78
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.674
I'm thinking to myself,

79
00:04:14.674 --> 00:04:16.415
Is it clear what they're after?

80
00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:18.485
Is this something that I want to do.

81
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.730
Is this something I can position myself well to?

82
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.505
As I'm reading this job description or any other for that matter,

83
00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:30.245
I'm trying to find the key points where I can actually respond in my cover letter,

84
00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:34.460
covering that key point and sharing why I'm a good fit for

85
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.900
each of these key points and overall a good fit for the project.

86
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.145
Now just in general,

87
00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:46.415
you've got this one paragraph and you've got a pretty non detailed job title.

88
00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:48.530
Website redesign and refresh.

89
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.695
So this project is probably is not the best example.

90
00:04:51.695 --> 00:04:55.325
But if I look at the client information here,

91
00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:59.330
the client has a five-star rating from three reviews, which is good.

92
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.175
They've spent a little bit of money,

93
00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:04.510
but not a huge amount of money on the platform.

94
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.990
So the client looks okay.

95
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.700
I'd be happy to work with a client who's five-star rated.

96
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.390
With that level of experience,

97
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.445
they look like they've done a good job on the platform so far.

98
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:17.930
If I go down to the client's recent history,

99
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.570
I can actually see the reviews that freelancers have given this client.

100
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.145
So it all looks good.

101
00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:26.585
All these five-star reviews,

102
00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:29.225
nothing but good things to say about this client.

103
00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:32.585
So in terms of evaluating the client specifically,

104
00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:34.325
they look like a pretty good client.

105
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:37.840
But there's other parts that I look at as well in terms of the actual job.

106
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.270
One is the budget and whether they're going to pay well.

107
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.880
So this person is looking for expert level of freelancers.

108
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.910
But if you scroll down here,

109
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.270
you can see the fixed price that they have paid people.

110
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.720
It's hard to judge what the hourly is on these jobs,

111
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.090
the effective hourly, but you can see some of the money they've paid in the past.

112
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.860
That tells you how much money you can expect them to pay in the future.

113
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.020
If we go to the bid range, let's see.

114
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.930
This is a hourly job,

115
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.880
but the average bid on this hourly job on expert level is $17.10.

116
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.560
So I wouldn't be too deterred by this because maybe

117
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.420
your competition aren't as good as you and you shouldn't be scared off by competition.

118
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.495
But it is something to consider that if I applied for this job,

119
00:06:26.495 --> 00:06:31.050
I would be the highest bidder by far at $50 an hour.

120
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.780
So maybe I would consider dropping my rate if I really wanted to work on this project to

121
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.765
$40 or maybe this is a sign that I'm a little bit too pricey for them.

122
00:06:40.765 --> 00:06:43.850
So another section we should look at is the questions.

123
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.840
Right here, you can see that there's three questions that they've included here.

124
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.480
These are ones that you'll have the opportunity to

125
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.085
answer when you click submit a proposal.

126
00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:56.554
Right here in this particular project,

127
00:06:56.554 --> 00:07:02.010
we can see that the questions are quite generic and maybe even generated by UpWork.

128
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.605
So they're not very specific to this job or to this category of work.

129
00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:09.830
So it shows perhaps a little bit of laziness on

130
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.040
the client's part to just choose generic questions.

131
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.350
So that is a consideration as well.

132
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.240
Otherwise, if they're asking

133
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.330
good specific questions that you feel you have a good answer to,

134
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.900
that's a good sign that you can actually position yourself for these jobs

135
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.160
by answering these questions and having a really good answer to them.

136
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.700
The final thing I would do with this one is check out their link.

137
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.475
So I would open this up in a new tab.

138
00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:38.030
UpWork are going to ask you if you are willing to leave UpWork.

139
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.230
That's there disclaimer saying you're not on UpWork anymore, so be careful.

140
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.480
You can actually research more about their company and maybe you'll find

141
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.084
some information about them that will help you to create your proposal.

142
00:07:52.084 --> 00:07:54.950
One example, sometimes they tell you

143
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.270
a specific problem that they're having and then they give you the website link and

144
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.540
you're able to actually look at the problem and advise

145
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.050
them on what the issue is upfront so that's a really good one as well.

146
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.280
But basically, that's how I would evaluate this client.

147
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.435
Based on all that,

148
00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:16.040
I probably wouldn't bother with this one and so let's move on to the next one.

149
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.420
We've got create WordPress theme and copy data from Archive.org.

150
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.160
That's a pretty good title,

151
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.435
I think that's pretty specific so let's have a read of the job description here.

152
00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:28.325
I actually like this job description,

153
00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:31.490
I like how they've broken it out into paragraphs which

154
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.300
shows that they've made some effort with their grammar and making it readable,

155
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.140
they've told the story of what happened and what they need done.

156
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.930
It's pretty clear to me what the job is and that to me is a big thumbs up.

157
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.950
That not only it makes it easier for me to write my proposal but it

158
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.870
shows that these people know what they want

159
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.780
which is going to make it easier to work with them.

160
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.845
The budget is a little bit low but if I look at the client,

161
00:08:57.845 --> 00:09:01.010
they've got a pretty good rating from two reviews,

162
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.510
they're in my location and they've spent a small amount of money so far.

163
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.345
Let's go down and look at their work history.

164
00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:10.114
In their client history,

165
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:15.170
they've only paid freelancers $8 and $3 an hour.

166
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.825
What have they put the experience level for this one?

167
00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:22.445
They're looking for intermediate but judging from what they've hired in the past,

168
00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:26.150
they're maybe looking for somebody in more of that range.

169
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.760
Now, when you're looking at these rates that they

170
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.420
have had been charged to by previous freelancers,

171
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.810
make sure to look at the work that these freelancers performed as

172
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.725
well because if it's something low value like data entry,

173
00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:43.415
maybe they're going to pay somebody $3-$5 an hour

174
00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:47.330
but if it's something that's more complicated and more specialized,

175
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.370
maybe they'd be willing to pay more.

176
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.750
That's something that you can't necessarily judge but it's another factor to look at,

177
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.945
how much have they paid freelancers in the past?

178
00:09:56.945 --> 00:09:58.520
Going back up again,

179
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.200
you can see the bid range.

180
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.375
They've put their budget as 200,

181
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:05.930
and the average bid is around that 200 mark.

182
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.685
If you're happy to do it for 200,

183
00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:11.465
click that "Submit a Proposal" button and go straight into it.

184
00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:14.075
I'm going to keep this one open because I like it.

185
00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:15.275
Budget is a bit low,

186
00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:19.145
but I think that everything else is pretty okay.

187
00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:20.630
The only worry I'd have with

188
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.305
this particular client is that they're not willing to pay that much.

189
00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:26.480
But again, I don't know until I speak to them and

190
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.225
so I think I might send a proposal for this one.

191
00:10:29.225 --> 00:10:30.515
Moving onto the next one,

192
00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:33.095
WordPress developer needed for a small project.

193
00:10:33.095 --> 00:10:36.650
Down here we've got a job description and again,

194
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.965
I like that they've broken it down into tasks.

195
00:10:39.965 --> 00:10:43.040
They're getting really clear with what they're after,

196
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.990
they've attached a screenshot.

197
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.910
The job description is pretty good,

198
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.575
the title is pretty descriptive.

199
00:10:48.575 --> 00:10:49.670
If I look at the client,

200
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.035
they've got good reviews,

201
00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:54.050
they've spent a total of 952.

202
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.625
If I go down here,

203
00:10:55.625 --> 00:11:00.740
we can see how much they've paid freelancers in the past and for what work.

204
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.555
All of these fixed price jobs that are pretty low budget,

205
00:11:05.555 --> 00:11:10.205
I'd have the same concern with this client as the previous client.

206
00:11:10.205 --> 00:11:13.760
They seem to know what they want and they seem to have pretty good reviews

207
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.555
but it may not be the budget that I'm looking for.

208
00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:20.540
Let's have a look at one more; front-end developer.

209
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.940
I wanted to build our fundraising theme.

210
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.620
Here and in this section,

211
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.085
senior level that communicates to me

212
00:11:28.085 --> 00:11:31.760
that they're looking for somebody quite senior and experienced so you

213
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.629
need to evaluate whether you fit that criteria

214
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:39.725
of somebody who you consider senior or very experienced.

215
00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:42.425
Let's have a look at what else they put here.

216
00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:47.555
They use a lot of technical speak here like Pug and LESS.

217
00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:51.770
I'm not familiar with Pug but I've heard of LESS before,

218
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.000
I don't have much experience in either Pug or LESS so I'm thinking with this one,

219
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.700
it may not be a perfect fit for my skills.

220
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.480
That's what I'm thinking with this but in terms of has the client got a budget?

221
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.850
He or she has paid good rates before,

222
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.275
they've spent over $30,000 on the platform and

223
00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:14.075
they have a close to five star, perfect average review.

224
00:12:14.075 --> 00:12:18.455
I think that this client will have the budget to hire somebody like me.

225
00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:23.150
At my rate, I'd be on the higher end but I think they'd be willing to look at it judging

226
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.550
from their history but I'm not sure whether

227
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.355
that'd be the right fit in terms of experience.

228
00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:30.830
Let's do one more and then we'll wrap up this and

229
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.260
talk about how to actually submit your proposal,

230
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.030
let's have a look at this.

231
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.640
Somebody has a clunky and old website for

232
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.390
the dance business and they want us to take a look so let's have a look at that one.

233
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.250
They weren't lying, their website looks pretty terrible and

234
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.520
old so let's see what they're after.

235
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.560
This person knows they want a website,

236
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.600
they already know they want it on WordPress,

237
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.350
but they want somebody who knows design.

238
00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.110
I'm definitely more on the development side than the designer side.

239
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.010
Maybe they're looking for more of a designer than somebody to actually build

240
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.895
it or maybe they're looking for somebody to do both,

241
00:13:07.895 --> 00:13:10.550
which is often the case with small clients,

242
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.535
they want design and development in the one go.

243
00:13:13.535 --> 00:13:19.145
I like the price that they're giving it for a basic WordPress website,

244
00:13:19.145 --> 00:13:21.335
that's an okay budget but

245
00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:25.370
the issue with this client is that they're pretty much new to the platform.

246
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.900
Their payment is not verified and they have no previous reviews.

247
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.150
Also your competition here is going to be

248
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.455
50 plus proposals because they have made the job pretty enticing.

249
00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:40.250
This particular client, I think I would still submit but of course,

250
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.655
I wouldn't work with them unless their payment is verified.

251
00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:45.830
That's something that can be set up later.

252
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.610
I think I would still have a look at this job and make a bid,

253
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.850
and that's because it's pretty clear to me what they want and it's

254
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.600
pretty clear to me that I can do what it is they're after.

255
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.625
That's my thought process around evaluating four different jobs here.

256
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:07.250
What I want you to keep in mind when you're looking at any job ad is three questions.

257
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.260
One, am I right for this job?

258
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.030
Two, can I compete?

259
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.730
Three, do I have the answer to their problems?

260
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:18.455
Or in other words, can I position myself as the answer to their problems?

261
00:14:18.455 --> 00:14:20.435
The first one, am I right for the job?

262
00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:23.885
You have to evaluate that on your own personal basis,

263
00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:26.030
figure out whether it's a right match for your skills,

264
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.310
whether you can actually deliver on that job.

265
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.800
Number two, in terms of can I compete?

266
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.470
Again, I don't want you to get too caught up on your competition

267
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.290
because there's a lot of low-level freelancers on UpWork

268
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.365
that'll send through copy and paste proposals

269
00:14:39.365 --> 00:14:42.455
and they don't have the guidance that you're getting right now.

270
00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:47.135
Your competition is unlikely to be that strong but even still,

271
00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:49.430
you want to make sure that if the client has

272
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.800
a really low budget and that's what they're looking for,

273
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.720
you are probably not going to be able to compete with a really high hourly rate.

274
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.660
On a flip side, if they're looking for somebody who's really

275
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.365
experienced and knows all this stuff and they're paying well,

276
00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:05.795
maybe you can't compete at that level.

277
00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:07.205
You have to judge,

278
00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:10.955
do I have a good chance at getting this job for the price I want?

279
00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:13.805
The final question to answer yourself is,

280
00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:15.350
can you answer their problem?

281
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.575
Can you communicate that you are the answer?

282
00:15:18.575 --> 00:15:21.935
A lot of this goes into how much information they've given you.

283
00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:24.500
If they give you a vague job description and they say,

284
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.755
''I want a website,'' there's some job ads out there that just say,

285
00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:29.105
''I want a website.''

286
00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:32.150
Well, there's not much you can say to that except for,

287
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.810
''I know how to make a website and I'm pretty good at it.''

288
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:41.105
So that's why this goes into the evaluation stage of looking at these jobs.

289
00:15:41.105 --> 00:15:42.350
You've got to ask yourself first of all,

290
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.260
has the client given me enough information to be able

291
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.235
to figure out whether I have the answers to the problem and if so,

292
00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:51.560
do I have some good answers to their problems,

293
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.490
and can I position myself as the answer to that problem?

294
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.560
Once you have that in mind,

295
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.370
you can go to Submit a Proposal and then in the next video,

296
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:06.545
we're going to talk about how you actually put those ideas into

297
00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:14.190
a text form and send that off to your prospective client and hopefully win the job.
