Hello and welcome to UpWork freelancing,

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:05,310
your guides of finding remote freelance clients.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,060
My name is Christopher Dodd and for the last almost three years now,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,530
I've been using UpWork to find

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,950
remote freelancing jobs that allow me to work from literally anywhere in the world.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,039
You see before I got started on UpWork,

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,720
I used to rely quite a bit on personal networking to find my freelance clients.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,840
But the great thing about using UpWork is that whether I'm working from

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,440
the beach in Thailand or from an apartment in Brooklyn, New York.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,670
I can both find the work and perform the work from literally anywhere.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,040
All I need is a computer and an internet connection.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,050
In fact, I've used UpWork extensively as one of

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,500
my major tools in order to enable my current nomadic lifestyle,

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,614
which has seen me travel to over 21 countries in search of Wi-Fi and adventure.

15
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:52,025
So in this course I want to take you through my story with UpWork, but more importantly,

16
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:56,300
share with you a system that I've refined over the last two years to attract

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,310
better clients and more money with

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,135
UpWork countless hours I used to spend sending out proposals.

19
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:03,800
So if you're ready to get started,

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,740
