To finish off this section on completing your profile,

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.595
we're going to go below this first box here which as we mentioned is very important,

3
00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:13.665
but talk about some other important areas to fill out on your profile.

4
00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.480
The first one and most important,

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.450
of course, is your work history and feedback.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.630
Unfortunately, there is nothing you can really do to edit this directly.

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.320
You just have to provide a good service to

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.700
the clients that you end up finding through this platform.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.245
The only thing I can say about this is make sure that you

10
00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:38.300
understand everyone you work with on Upwork is going to have the opportunity to rate you,

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.890
so you definitely want to do the best that you can.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.770
Over-communicate, over-deliver, we're going to talk about

13
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770
those things in a later video but for this video,

14
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.040
just understand that it's all going to go on your profile.

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.985
If you get good reviews,

16
00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:59.020
this is going to be a great asset to your profile and make you a top rated freelancer.

17
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.805
Take the work you do on Upwork very seriously and it'll come back to your profile.

18
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.265
The next one is portfolio,

19
00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:12.910
and portfolio is going to be important or not that important depending on who you are.

20
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.360
I think portfolio is a largely visual thing.

21
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.895
Look at how Upwork are presenting it here.

22
00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:22.085
They've just got an image and a title here.

23
00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.450
I've actually updated my profile recently to have

24
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.890
the websites that I've done look nicely and shown off in different screen sizes.

25
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.410
But for something like web development,

26
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.924
or something really technical,

27
00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:38.110
or something that doesn't have a huge visual element to it,

28
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.050
I don't think the portfolio is as big of a deal.

29
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.620
That being said, if you are a designer the portfolio is going to

30
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.370
be very important for you because when people are hiring designers,

31
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.950
they want to know that they can create good designs,

32
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.010
which is largely visual.

33
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.140
If you click into any of these,

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.830
you will go into a little bit of an extra section where you can see some skill tags,

35
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.160
a description that I've put in there and a link to the website to check out.

36
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.620
I'm not sure how many clients actually will click on this or even know to click on this,

37
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.590
so this box on the surface layer is very important.

38
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.875
I would make sure good title and just really a good image.

39
00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:25.100
Consider this a place to showcase images of your work.

40
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.690
Like I said, if you are in a field that is highly visual,

41
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.940
you want to make sure you're doing this really well.

42
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.830
Even still with something I do,

43
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.890
there is a big visual element to it as well so I made

44
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.080
sure to display some of the websites I've built here.

45
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.070
Skills is something that you can put up to 10 different tags in and so number one,

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.980
I would recommend using all 10 available tags.

47
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.870
There's no reason to leave one out unless it's highly irrelevant,

48
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.405
you can't actually do that skill.

49
00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:03.230
But there's often multiple ways of saying similar things like for instance here,

50
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.490
WordPress and WordPress e-Commerce, PSD to WordPress.

51
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.045
They're all WordPress related so I included them,

52
00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:13.725
and website development sits across all those as well.

53
00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:18.140
Basically, start typing skills that you think might be relevant

54
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.060
and sought after by your clients and stick them in there and see if they're available.

55
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.535
You won't be able to put in your own tags,

56
00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:28.670
only ones that are available to you so you just start

57
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.690
typing and it'll come up with what tags are available,

58
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.435
and just click all the relevant ones.

59
00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:37.310
If you wanted to take this a step further,

60
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.450
you could go on other people's profiles and look at their tags for inspiration.

61
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.880
Again, it's quite a simple section.

62
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.165
Just fill out as many relevant tags as you can.

63
00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:48.470
In the certification section,

64
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.520
there's not much to say about that except for if you do have any certifications,

65
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.045
definitely include them here.

66
00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:58.260
A while back I did an AdWords Display Ads Certification so I

67
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.800
decided to put that in Upwork but it's not highly relevant to what I do.

68
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.710
But again, I don't think it can hurt to have a certification in there.

69
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.955
Down here we have employment history and I actually do have.

70
00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.280
That's actually probably not that relevant,

71
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.555
so I should probably remove it.

72
00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.330
I haven't edited this section of my profile in

73
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.050
quite a while but we are getting down to the bottom sections here.

74
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.685
My advice for this section,

75
00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:25.355
if you do have relevant employment history,

76
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:29.810
of course put it in but it's something that comes further down the profile.

77
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.245
The other thing I would say in order to complete your profile,

78
00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:36.500
maybe you don't have any relevant employment history.

79
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.060
What I'd do in that sense,

80
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.860
is just put yourself as a freelancer as a job and just say that,

81
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.125
"I have experience working as a freelance."

82
00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:49.000
Say you're a web developer, freelance developer,

83
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.710
"I have experience working as a freelance designer."

84
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.925
Put that into a job and call yourself a freelance,

85
00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:57.140
whatever it is you do,

86
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.305
and at least that fills that box for Upwork of having some experience and

87
00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.695
a client is not going to look at that and dispute that because

88
00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:10.525
you're already demonstrating that you are a freelancer by being on this platform.

89
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:14.060
It does say employment history but it doesn't necessarily have

90
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.380
to be a situation in which you were employed by a company.

91
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.090
You can put in any work that you've done

92
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.975
here that you think might be relevant and if you haven't got anything,

93
00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.510
just put down that you're a freelancer.

94
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.180
Education, again it's like certifications.

95
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.200
If you have it, put it in.

96
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.685
If you don't, don't worry.

97
00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:37.040
But again, you don't need a degree to work on Upwork so if you've done any course,

98
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.370
maybe you've taken my courses on Skillshare

99
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.970
about web development or taken another online course,

100
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.830
maybe you want to include that there.

101
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.355
But, again, like I'll reiterate at the end of this lesson,

102
00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:53.260
you want to make sure that your profile is complete.

103
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.740
The final section is other experiences and in here,

104
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.755
I talk about my online brand, Chris the Freelancer.

105
00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:05.010
I don't consider it work experience because I don't have a client with that.

106
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.450
It's not me being employed by a business or working for a client.

107
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.370
It's just a project that I've done.

108
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.815
But at the same time, it demonstrates certain skills that I have like video production,

109
00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:17.515
web development, seeing I built my own website,

110
00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:22.700
and content writing too because I wrote all the articles on my own blog,

111
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.950
and then I provide a link to check it out.

112
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.895
Here, maybe you want to include some volunteering projects you've done,

113
00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:33.230
some of your own projects that demonstrate what you can do.

114
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:39.135
This is where you put any experience whatsoever that is relevant to your audience.

115
00:06:39.135 --> 00:06:43.040
Maybe if you are trying to be a travel writer,

116
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.140
you could even put it in travel experience here like,

117
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.375
I've been to this many countries and I understand the world of travel.

118
00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:55.355
Anything that's relevant that's not necessarily work related,

119
00:06:55.355 --> 00:06:57.470
definitely put in there.

120
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.885
That's about it, guys. That's the whole profile.

121
00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:04.105
Again, I want to reiterate that you want to complete all of your profile.

122
00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:09.170
Now, I don't know for sure whether Upwork will promote your profile more or how

123
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.365
much they will by having it complete

124
00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:14.135
but they constantly encourage you to complete your profile.

125
00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:16.805
That shows that it's actually important to Upwork.

126
00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:20.435
Like I said, once you get down to these smaller areas,

127
00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:23.540
you don't want to leave them blank and so if you can

128
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.600
include anything that you can think of that will be relevant,

129
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.960
that's not going to be too out there,

130
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.290
definitely include it and you can see once we go into find work,

131
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.020
which we'll get into in the next few videos.

132
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.235
You can see this bar here saying 100 percent

133
00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:42.965
and that's telling me that I've completed my profile 100 percent.

134
00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:44.270
If you don't have that,

135
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.760
that bar is obviously not at a 100 percent

136
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.200
and it will remind you to complete your profile.

137
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.400
Make sure at the very least,

138
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.800
that you complete your profile as much as possible

139
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.890
because there's two people that you've got to satisfy on Upwork.

140
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.055
There's the client, or groups of people, the client,

141
00:08:01.055 --> 00:08:05.505
and then you've got to satisfy the platform itself, Upwork.

142
00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:07.695
You want to do good by Upwork,

143
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.760
you want to do everything they ask you to do.

144
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.385
You also want to do well by your clients,

145
00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:16.225
which is going to help you and is going to help Upwork.

146
00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:19.909
On the platform, it's all about doing well on the platform,

147
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:21.515
building experience on the platform,

148
00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:26.855
showing Upwork that you are a great member of their freelancer community.

149
00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:30.800
That's going to help you as well to make sure that you get good support from

150
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.485
Upwork and that your account never gets suspended, God forbid.

151
00:08:35.485 --> 00:08:39.120
Yeah, that's all on the profile stuff, guys.

152
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.325
In the next section,

153
00:08:40.325 --> 00:08:45.100
we're going to talk about actually using this to find work.

154
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.170
I'll catch you in the next video.
