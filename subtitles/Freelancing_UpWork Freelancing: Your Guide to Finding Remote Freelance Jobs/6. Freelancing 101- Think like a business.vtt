00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
A common mistake I see freelancers make and one I've actually made

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
myself is taking on an employee mindset into freelancing.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.010
Sometimes I get questions like,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.535
do I need a degree to freelance as a blank.

5
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.970
I am 18, am I too young or I'm 60 am I too

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.110
old or how many years experience do I need to start freelancing?

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.530
To me, all these questions come from the mindset of an employee as when you apply for,

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.165
let's say a regular job,

9
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:35.575
employers might be very particular about your qualifications or years of experience.

10
00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:38.060
However, in the freelance world,

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.725
there are virtually no rules.

12
00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:44.090
Essentially, it all comes down to whether you can convince a particular person,

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.775
usually just one decision-maker at the company,

14
00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.840
that you can provide the results that they're looking for.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.300
Now, I'm not saying that experience and qualifications don't

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.750
count and should be ignored but at the end of the day,

17
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.760
the client just wants to trust that you'll do a good job for them.

18
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.030
If you're a 15-year-old high school dropout with zero experience,

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.820
but can somehow convince a client that they can

20
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.630
trust you to do a great job on a particular project,

21
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.055
then kudos to you.

22
00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:17.300
Obviously that's impede of an extreme example but what I'm getting at

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.420
here is that the client is not paying you for your degree or years of experience.

24
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.235
What they are paying you for is a certain experience and certain result.

25
00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.255
They are more concerned about things like,

26
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.920
can I trust this freelancer?

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.585
Will I like working with them?

28
00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.420
Can he or she get the project done within budget?

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.820
Will they produce a high quality result?

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.980
These are the real questions that you should answer,

31
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.830
whether it be in your profile or in your proposal. Now, don't get me wrong.

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.655
There are, of course, some clients on Upwork who may

33
00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:50.240
evaluate you based on your experience and qualifications,

34
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.270
but don't let that deter you if you're lacking in either of those two things.

35
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.370
The key here is to think of yourself as a business, not an employee.

36
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.830
What do I mean by that?

37
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.384
Well, if you head to the website of any successful agency,

38
00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:06.320
let's say you do web development,

39
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.810
you would head over to the website of any of

40
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.285
these successful firms and have a look at how they market themselves.

41
00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:15.800
Does their front-page read like a resume?

42
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
Do they talk about their list of skills and years of experience?

43
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.040
Maybe they do, but I'm sure what you'll find is

44
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.040
that there is a clear focus on the result that they can deliver to

45
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.440
their clients and a portfolio that

46
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.450
demonstrates that they have done so for clients in the past.

47
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.895
That is the mindset I want you to take into designing

48
00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.270
your Upwork profile and writing proposals to clients.

49
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.455
Stop getting hung up on how many years of experience you have,

50
00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:43.490
or a matter of college qualifications you

51
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.370
have and focus on how you can communicate trust,

52
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.670
quality, and reliability to your prospective clients.
