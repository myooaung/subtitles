00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.595
We are now on to the final point in this first section here that you have control over,

2
00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:08.220
and that is your hourly rate.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.530
Knowing how to price yourself as a freelancer in general is a really tricky subject,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.080
but I think it's actually a bit simpler on Upwork,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.600
especially if you're just starting out.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.185
One thing I'd say is don't price yourself too low.

7
00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:23.580
You might be asking,

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.605
what's too low, Chris?

9
00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.420
Essentially, you don't want to be working for below minimum wage in your country.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.180
Number 1, why would you do that to yourself when you

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.340
could just go get a minimum wage job and number 2,

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.420
that's going to look weird to clients that are hiring.

13
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.850
I don't know about you,

14
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.655
but when I look at somebody from the US,

15
00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.370
maybe they live in Los Angeles and they are charging $5 an

16
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.015
hour to do web development or do the similar job to me,

17
00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:53.615
I get a bit [inaudible] to why are they charging that little?

18
00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:57.170
Is that really how much they believe in the quality of what they do,

19
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.210
that they're only going to charge $5 an hour?

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.045
That being said, if you're from a country where $5 an hour is a good amount of money,

21
00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.700
maybe you are an expert in what you do and that

22
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.795
$5 means a lot more than what it does in the US.

23
00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:16.115
Again, take into consideration where you're coming from,

24
00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:17.660
but as a minimum,

25
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.400
I would say charge at least $25 for most things.

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.740
All the skills that are on Upwork,

27
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.800
they're things that require a certain level of expertise.

28
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.915
If you can build a basic website,

29
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:33.875
you're already more proficient than most people in the world.

30
00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.765
If you can design a logo,

31
00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:40.180
you're already better at design than most people in the world by far.

32
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.440
Don't price yourself lower than the minimum wage in your country.

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.475
I think a good rate that I've heard people talk about as a minimum would be $25.

34
00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:57.665
Again, if you're from a country where $25 is a lot of money and you're just beginning,

35
00:01:57.665 --> 00:01:59.630
you might want to price yourself lower.

36
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
But don't bite yourself in the foot or stab yourself in

37
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.130
the foot by trying to bid too low on jobs.

38
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.160
Say for instance, you live here in

39
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.870
Australia and you are trying to get jobs so desperately that you'll bid at $10.

40
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.430
I wouldn't recommend it,

41
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.150
start at at least 25 because that really is

42
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.020
a bare minimum for that kind of work done here in Australia.

43
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.790
I'm sure in the US,

44
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.170
it would be a similar thing.

45
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.420
The reason why I recommend starting at

46
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.530
25 or your equivalent base hourly rate in the country that you're working from,

47
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.860
is because you want to build up your profile on the platform.

48
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.395
Right here you can see I've got all this experience right on Upwork specifically.

49
00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.635
But when I started years ago,

50
00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.405
I had nothing on there.

51
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:52.790
I was happy to bid a little bit lower in order to

52
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.105
get some reviews on my profile because ultimately,

53
00:02:56.105 --> 00:03:01.100
those reviews are going to build your profile up and increase the amount of

54
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.255
trust factors that the client has to look at when they're looking at your profile.

55
00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:12.304
Regardless of whether it's Amazon or YouTube or Upwork,

56
00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:13.385
any of these platforms,

57
00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:20.740
you have to show success on the platform before you get taken really seriously.

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.850
That's what the platforms will look for,

59
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.500
and that's what the clients will look for.

60
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.670
I definitely would recommend starting at maybe a bit lower

61
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.095
than what you should be getting or you feel like you could be making,

62
00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.005
if that's going to help you to find more jobs.

63
00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:40.520
Just make sure that as you get more experience and as you build up those reviews,

64
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.340
that you start putting up that rate until you feel

65
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.440
like this is the right rate and you're confident at charging that.

66
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.000
Another thing you might wanna do with pricing is taking to account your category.

67
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.805
There's actually a section in the Upwork website that you can see if you're a client.

68
00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.090
I don't have access to it because I don't have a client account,

69
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.580
but I have seen screenshots of it.

70
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.790
Maybe I can bring one up here.

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.870
I remember seeing this on a blog somewhere.

72
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.470
I think it was this post.

73
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.175
You can see here,

74
00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:14.780
a lot of freelancers don't know this,

75
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.595
but when a client posts a job,

76
00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:19.895
Upwork shows them how much they can expect to pay.

77
00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:22.460
This is all dependent on your category.

78
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.395
If the client sets a project at an experience level of entry level,

79
00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:30.050
they're going to expect to pay around this amount.

80
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.120
Then if they set it at intermediate,

81
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.890
they're going to expect to pay this amount.

82
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.830
At this expert level,

83
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.230
they're going to expect to pay more than that.

84
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.770
That's not to say that necessarily if you're an expert that you should be earning that.

85
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.355
But these are just things to keep in mind that this is the messaging

86
00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:50.570
that the client is receiving when they make a project.

87
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.980
You want to keep this in mind and these numbers are not for every category in Upwork.

88
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.590
I don't know which category this one is,

89
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.630
but each of them are different.

90
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.140
If you'd really like to know what the rates are in your category,

91
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.915
create an Upwork client account and login.

92
00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:09.335
Start to create a project and then once you're doing that,

93
00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:14.300
you'll be able to see what the rates are in the category that you select.

94
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.085
That's another one to note.

95
00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:22.835
If you are intermediate and your category range is 20-46.50 in that category range,

96
00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:24.350
maybe price yourself there.

97
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.130
It really depends on your experience level and skills in terms of

98
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.860
these three levels and also the category that you sit in on Upwork.

99
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.510
Another thing you could do to figure out a good rate for you is

100
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.895
to go for the Upwork search bar here

101
00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:45.050
and type in a search term that you would hope that clients would

102
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.255
find your profile from and you can start to see how much other people are charging.

103
00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:55.360
What I'd recommend for this is actually to open up an incognito window.

104
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.050
What an incognito is,

105
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.530
is a private browser that isn't logged in as you.

106
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.405
I'm just going to resize the browser

107
00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:10.160
here and right now I'm in an incognito window and I'm just going to go to upwork.com.

108
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.150
Now if I go to find freelancers and I

109
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.920
look for what I'm targeting when clients are looking for me.

110
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.975
I want to rank for WordPress developers for the country of Australia.

111
00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:29.570
If I close that, you can see that I'm usually in the top five here,

112
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.270
so I'm number 2 in the results.

113
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.300
You can see here, I think I've got a pretty good rate at

114
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.940
50 an hour because if you look at other people in

115
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.165
this search result with the same amount of

116
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:46.020
job success as me they're charging around 50,40,37.50,33.33,50.

117
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.990
Not many people are charging more than 50 an hour and the ones that are,

118
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.920
they don't have the best job success score.

119
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.815
I could probably push it a little bit further and I might experiment with that.

120
00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:07.595
But right now I feel like I'm at a good rate.

121
00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:10.145
Again, it's no hard rules to this.

122
00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:13.025
It's based on what your specialization is

123
00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:16.460
within your category and where your skills are at within that,

124
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.769
and also audience, industry,

125
00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:21.050
there's no limit to how much you could set it.

126
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.940
I'm sure I could set it to 100 an hour and maybe score at least one client.

127
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.679
Going back to my own profile,

128
00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:32.270
my final words on choosing your hourly is to not price

129
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.640
yourself too low that the client actually has to ask questions about your quality.

130
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.855
Because say for instance,

131
00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:42.085
if I had all these job success scores top rated,

132
00:07:42.085 --> 00:07:44.269
I'm looking good on the platform.

133
00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:47.060
If I was to charge $10 an hour,

134
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.010
that would probably go against me because there would be questions in the client's head.

135
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.735
Well, does this guy value his time only as much as $10 an hour?

136
00:07:56.735 --> 00:07:59.360
That sparks some confusion to me.

137
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.810
You don't want to confuse your client and you want to make sure that

138
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.815
your price point is both affordable for your target audience,

139
00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:11.090
but also communicates that you believe in the quality that you're producing.

140
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.225
If you have your rate too low, you may think,

141
00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:17.600
oh wow, the client is getting a great deal.

142
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.560
But often price is not the biggest issue here.

143
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:28.605
It's more about choosing the right quality at the appropriate rate.

144
00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:31.605
It's a tricky one knowing how much to price yourself.

145
00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:33.255
You get a feel for it over time.

146
00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:35.270
A lot of it really comes down to confidence.

147
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.510
There's no reason why you can't jump on Upwork and

148
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.915
for your first job bid a $100 an hour and snag that job.

149
00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:46.085
But what holds freelancers back a lot is having the confidence to charge that.

150
00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:52.040
I think your confidence is sometimes a good reflector of where you see your skills at.

151
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.255
Sometimes you might be under confident and not value your skills enough,

152
00:08:56.255 --> 00:08:59.930
but you could be overconfident as well and you don't want that to happen

153
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.950
where you sell somebody on a job where you're earning a 100 an hour,

154
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.620
and you really don't have the skills to back that up.

155
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.020
It comes down to experience.

156
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.985
It comes down to understanding your audience,

157
00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:15.335
and it comes down to the confidence in what you can do for your clients.

158
00:09:15.335 --> 00:09:17.555
That's a little bit on pricing.

159
00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:19.775
Guys, just to simplify it once again,

160
00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:21.695
if you are starting out on Upwork,

161
00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:26.870
my rule of thumb is start at 25 an hour and then get some jobs on

162
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.885
your profile and then test bumping your rate up

163
00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:33.235
and targeting higher paying clients and see how that goes.

164
00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:34.790
I'm pretty sure I started,

165
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.740
I think at 20 or 25 an hour and now I've bumped it gradually up to 50.

166
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.605
Just start small, build up your profile and over time,

167
00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.780
you'll get to a point where your profile is

168
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.635
an asset that feeds you work and then you can start to charge more.

169
00:09:51.635 --> 00:09:54.980
That is the biggest area of your profile.

170
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.665
This box here in the next video we're going to look

171
00:09:57.665 --> 00:10:00.380
at the other areas of your profile which

172
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.110
aren't necessarily so much in your control or so important as this first box here,

173
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.110
which is the first impression.

174
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.940
I'll see you in the next video.
