1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,950
I wanted to bring up a completed profile as an example for

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,090
you guys and we can go through the different parts of the profile,

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,760
and what better profile to bring up than my own.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,820
This is how the client will see me on Upwork,

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,150
and as you can see, we've got a first box here that sits above the fold,

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,940
and then as you scroll down,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,684
work history, portfolio, skills,

8
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:31,935
certifications, employment history, education, and other experiences.

9
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:33,935
If I scroll back up to the top,

10
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:37,190
this box is what the client sees first,

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,350
and so this is your first impression.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,935
I count this box as the most important parts of your profile to get right.

13
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:49,925
As you can see, we've got your name, your headshot,

14
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,345
you're registered location, we've got a title,

15
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,640
we've got an overview, hourly rate,

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,419
number of jobs completed or in progress,

17
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:02,540
number of hours worked and you've got your job success score up

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,025
here and I've got my top rated badge right there.

19
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,685
This information is also what comes across in

20
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:14,730
the preview box when clients will search for freelancers,

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,565
so if I go up here and do my own search and type in WordPress developer,

22
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:22,940
and I'll search for somebody like me,

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,085
somebody who does WordPress.

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,495
As you can see here,

25
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:29,720
this is what some people have referred to as the preview box

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,575
and you can see that it's got the name,

27
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:36,330
the headshot that title, the hourly rates.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,430
It's also got amount that has been earned in total on the platform,

29
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,195
where you can hover over and see the number of hourly jobs,

30
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:46,250
the number of fixed price of jobs,

31
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,450
the number of hours worked.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,820
You've got the job success score with a big badge and you've got the location,

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,350
which is a bit broader than a specific suburb or city,

34
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,865
it's got the country.

35
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:02,860
Then you've got the first line of your overview here.

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:11,285
If I was to look up myself by going into filters and filtering by Australia,

37
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,980
this should bring up my preview box.

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,545
If we scroll down,

39
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,645
we can find my profile here.

40
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:20,150
Honestly, I think it's pretty on point we've

41
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,105
got all blue here with the jobs that says score,

42
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,920
we've got the badge right next to it,

43
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,480
and pretty happy with how this is showing up.

44
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,265
If I go back to my profile now.

45
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:37,150
Remember, everything that you put in this box will also go in

46
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,975
the preview box when people searching for your profile.

47
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:43,760
This is really the most important part of your profile.

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,700
Obviously some of these things and not directly

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,450
editable like the job success score and the badge,

50
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,170
the amount of jobs I've worked and the hours worked,

51
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,305
so if you're starting out,

52
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:56,075
you're not going to have a job success score,

53
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,190
you're not going to have a badge to start with,

54
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,590
and you won't have this work history.

55
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,300
But what you can control,

56
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,999
is your headshot, your title,

57
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:07,025
your overview, and your hourly.

58
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,840
What we're going to do in the next few videos,

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
is we're going to go through and cover each of these in

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,820
its own video and then we're going to go cover the rest of the profile down here.

61
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,470
I'll see you in the next video.
