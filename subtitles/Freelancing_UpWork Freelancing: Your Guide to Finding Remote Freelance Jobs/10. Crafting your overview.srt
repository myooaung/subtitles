1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
All right, we've talked about your title and your headshot.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,625
Now let's talk about your overview,

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:09,795
which for those of you who didn't know is this section right here.

4
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:12,180
Sometimes it shows up condensed,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,450
but you can just click the more link here and you'll be

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,560
taken to the full overview of any freelancers profile.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,390
There's a few theories about how to write your overview but for me I keep it very simple.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,480
Again it just goes back to what we talked about in

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,735
the theory lessons basically what's your pitch?

10
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,545
What audience are you speaking to?

11
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:35,705
Essentially, the overview is a place

12
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:39,020
for you to talk about the different selling points of

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,425
yourself that you think clients and your audience would be

14
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:46,760
interested in and help them make a decision about whether to hire you.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,470
I know that's quite vague.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm actually going to share with you a bunch of tips that I've learned

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,495
from other resources online that you may want to try but

18
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:56,000
before that I'm going to go through

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,910
my own profile just to share with you the parts that I

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,240
think are particularly important and also share with you what not to do.

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,080
Let's go over that right now.

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,170
One thing that I've tried myself that I wouldn't necessarily

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,760
recommend is going super salesy in your overview.

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,655
I've learned this from some courses that have this salesy tone in their overview.

25
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,730
You don't want to be talking like say for instance,

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,200
if you're a web developer,

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,280
talking in the salesy tone, that's something like,

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,095
hey are you at your desk struggling with this website and you just almost given up hope,

29
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,480
well, never fear because I'm here.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,970
I'm this expert developer who's had

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,640
all these years of experience and I'm going to solve your problem,

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,170
your life is going to be so much,

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,205
but you don't want to give off that tone of being a sleazy salesperson.

34
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:52,220
It does work on certain contexts on the web really well.

35
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,450
There's a lot of sales letters that are written like that but for this purpose,

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,235
for LinkedIn and for Upwork,

37
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:01,325
they're pretty much the same thing they're professional network.

38
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:06,105
You don't want to give off too much of a sleazy salesperson vibe.

39
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,830
That's all I'll say on that one.

40
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,560
I think that's pretty common sense but basically to go over my overview here,

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,015
if we look at the first line,

42
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,280
I state again what I do.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,545
I state that I'm from Australia.

44
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:21,715
Again, that's going back to targeting my audience.

45
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:26,030
I've found an audience of Australian clients who like working with other Australians.

46
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,150
I make sure to reiterate that in the first line of

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,470
my overview and I enjoy working with clients who appreciate quality.

48
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,100
Who doesn't appreciate quality?

49
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,860
I just go into a story of what I've been doing,

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,410
how long I've been doing it and I make sure to mention

51
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,050
that I've done small websites with WordPress,

52
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,140
but I've also worked on large web applications.

53
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,990
I talk about why I specialize in WordPress,

54
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,685
but I tell them that I also contract as a front end web developer and I

55
00:02:55,685 --> 00:03:01,540
list a few of the technologies I'm familiar with and can use proficiently.

56
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,210
I also talk about kind of broader experience here.

57
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,770
I can advise the basics on SEO, content, marketing,

58
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,095
social media and I reference my experience through my personal brand and blog,

59
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,970
Crystal freelancer for that.

60
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,890
They can actually go to that website and see those skills demonstrated.

61
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,060
I talk here about other services that I offer clients.I actually had an overview

62
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,080
that targeted all these different things in the one and it was confusing clients.

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,940
I actually had one client reach out to me and say,

64
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,200
your title says you're a WordPress developer,

65
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,450
but you've got marketing in here,

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,950
you've got video editing,

67
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,945
like what is it you do?

68
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:43,865
You want to make it super clear.

69
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,785
What do you do?

70
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:48,740
I mentioned that I can do video editing,

71
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,770
YouTube marketing consulting, which is something I've done before.

72
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,960
I've edited podcasts for people before,

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,645
and I've done voice-over work.

74
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:58,670
I just mentioned that as just t one sentence at the ends

75
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,855
because I want to tell people that I have that in case they need that later,

76
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:07,775
but I don't want to confuse them with I can do all these different things.

77
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:10,250
The final part of the overview and this is something I

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,365
recommend for everyone is a call to action.

79
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:16,790
For me this came naturally because I'm like how else am I going to end off

80
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,405
the overview but if it didn't come naturally to you,

81
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:23,220
make sure to give them a call to action.

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,390
Which is basically tell them what option

83
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,910
you'd like them to take up after reading your overview.

84
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,730
That's kind of my overview and my thinking behind it.

85
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,260
It's working for me and I feel like I'm not an expert writer.

86
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,200
I could probably write something better or hire somebody to do it

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,565
but I think that this covers all the important points.

88
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:50,270
I'm just going to go over a few of the other tips that I learned

89
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,715
from different other resources that I learned Upwork marketing from.

90
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:58,845
One of the other things you might want to do is develop a point of difference.

91
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:02,645
Maybe you have a unique offer that nobody else has.

92
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:06,820
Maybe you have this unique experience that nobody else has.

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,320
It's always good marketing. If you have a point of difference, share that.

94
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,155
Another tip is study

95
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:15,815
other successful freelancers and see what they write in their overview.

96
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,450
If they've done over 10-K,

97
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,500
20-K on the platform and they have a top rated status.

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,140
Look at what they've put in their overview and

99
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,270
evaluate the different themes or different things that each of them are doing.

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,925
Obviously you want to format your overview.

101
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:36,395
So if I didn't use paragraphs here and had it all as one paragraph,

102
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:38,735
not only would that be hard to read,

103
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:41,765
but it doesn't show I'm very professional when I

104
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,900
don't even know how to break up my profile,

105
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,900
breakup sentences into paragraphs.

106
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,200
Make sure your formatting is done.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,970
It's pretty simple, I don't know if you can even bold on this,

108
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,345
but you want to at least use paragraphs.

109
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:58,280
Another tip I've heard is stating who you want to work with,

110
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,525
like who is your audience.

111
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,850
I think I've done it kind of implicitly here.

112
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,510
I'm from Australia and I enjoy working with clients who appreciate quality.

113
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,915
That's vague in the sense that everyone appreciates quality but

114
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:13,129
basically what I'm saying with this line is I'm from Australia.

115
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:15,100
Your probably from Australia as well,

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,855
from maybe the United States or the UK.

117
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,989
You're going to be talking with another westerner who understands

118
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:25,680
English fluently and who's going to give you a high-quality.

119
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,450
Some people have actually been banned on Upwork,

120
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,990
working with people who have

121
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,230
poor communication skills that may be charge a really low rate,

122
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,030
but just ends up producing low quality work or wasting the client's time.

123
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,285
They want to avoid that and I think with this I'm implicitly stating, I'm from Australia.

124
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:47,330
I have that Australian professional experience and

125
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,365
I enjoy working with people who appreciate quality.

126
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:53,960
The final tip I have here is just don't treat this like a resume.

127
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,695
Don't list a bunch of things you can,

128
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,420
list your skills and things that you can help with,

129
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,820
but don't make the whole thing a list.

130
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,960
Essentially you just want to write in a simple but professional tone,

131
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,235
what it is you do,

132
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:10,195
what are your experience is and your selling points.

133
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,980
The principles are the most important thing here.

134
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,310
You want to make sure that you're appealing to your audience.

135
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,860
You want to know what your pitch is and you want to

136
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,080
communicate that through your overview.

137
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,650
I hope that helps you out with how to write your overview.

138
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,730
There's a bunch of resources I'm sure online to help

139
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,335
you create a template around it but essentially everyone's story is different.

140
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:35,200
Everyone's preference is different.

141
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,215
Everyone's skills are different.

142
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,755
It's going to be slightly different for everyone.

143
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:43,760
I think again keep those principles in mind and I

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,710
look forward to seeing what your overview looks like in the class projects.

145
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,200
Thanks for listening. In the next video we're going to cover ricing.
