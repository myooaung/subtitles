00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350
In the last video,

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.400
we were putting together our proposal and the only thing left to

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.520
do is click the Submit A Proposal button right here.

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.350
I'm not going to do that because I don't actually want to submit a proposal.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.230
But what happens after you submit a proposal it's up to the client.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
Don't feel discouraged if you don't get a response back.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.705
This is just the nature of Upwork.

8
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.715
If somebody doesn't want to work with you,

9
00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:30.945
usually you weren't receive a response and on the odd occasion,

10
00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.500
you actually receive an email from Upwork saying that

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.545
your proposal was rejected or that they hired another person.

12
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:43.520
Oftentimes, however, you don't know if they even read your proposal.

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.765
I wouldn't get too worried about it when you send up that proposal,

14
00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.570
stop thinking about it and let the client come back to you.

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.730
There's nothing else that you can do.

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.990
The next stage after sending your proposal is you get a response back.

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.100
What will happen is, in Upwork,

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.135
you can go to your messages tab right here,

19
00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:07.385
we can also access this using the Upwork app.

20
00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.755
But essentially what will happen will be,

21
00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:12.485
a new message will appear in your inbox.

22
00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:17.590
I've blurred out the names here to respect the privacy of my clients.

23
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.805
But if I go down and find an example to bring up for you guys.

24
00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:25.670
Right here you'll see your proposal sent as

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.000
a message and then you'll see as the next entry,

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.060
a response from the client,

27
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.495
if of course they go back to you.

28
00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:39.140
Now the process here is just to chat with the client and figure out if it's a good fit.

29
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.520
Figure out if the client is easy to work with.

30
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.195
You want to know exactly what thereafter.

31
00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:48.430
This is where you can negotiate on price as well,

32
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.585
just because the job had a budget of $400 and you bid that and they're talking to you,

33
00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:57.215
or you put your hourly in and now they're talking to you,

34
00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.870
doesn't mean that that's going to be the exact hourly

35
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.800
or project budget that will be sent in the offer.

36
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.540
You can also negotiate price during this stage.

37
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.255
You chat it out and then hopefully you'll get an offer.

38
00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:13.435
Once you get the offer, you can click on this link to view details.

39
00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:18.695
It'll take you to this page right here where you can see the offer details.

40
00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:22.850
Usually there's buttons on the side here to accept the offer.

41
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.400
Currently, this is one that I've already accepted,

42
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.830
so I don't have those buttons there,

43
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.525
but you can either accept or decline the offer on this page as well.

44
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.370
This is the official offer.

45
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.080
If you accept this offer,

46
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.290
you are now under contract with the client and that

47
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.100
means that you can start charging time to the time sheet

48
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.800
if it's an hourly job or you can

49
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.645
submit a request for payment if you've actually completed the job.

50
00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.400
Once you're on the contract,

51
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.770
it means that you guys are connected now on Upwork and once the contract closes,

52
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.005
you'll be giving each other reviews.

53
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.940
It's very important that you evaluate the client and you don't just accept any offer.

54
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.640
You make sure that the client is going to be good

55
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.550
to work with and that you're not going to have any issues

56
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.970
because once you've already accepted that offer you now

57
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.950
have an obligation to them and Upwork definitely looks at that.

58
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.035
The next stage of course after accepting the offer and signing the contract,

59
00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.000
is to actually perform the work and manage the client relationship.

60
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.060
Obviously, we're not going to cover performing the work in

61
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.840
this course because it's going to be different depending on what work you are performing.

62
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.950
That is where your existing skills come into play.

63
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.374
In terms of managing the client relationship,

64
00:03:38.374 --> 00:03:41.100
that's something we'll get into in the next video.

65
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.745
For now, on this video on getting hired,

66
00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.185
the next stage after this,

67
00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:51.320
I guess you've already been hired but just to cap off the contract process on Upwork,

68
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.380
is pausing or closing the contract.

69
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.970
This is important for a few reasons which we'll talk about in a later video but,

70
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.440
you want to either pause or close the contract or follow up with

71
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.750
the client if the contract is just idle for a few days to a few weeks.

72
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.300
Just to run through the whole process,

73
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.160
after you've accepted the offer,

74
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.215
you're under contract, you've done the work,

75
00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:16.445
the client is happy,

76
00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:19.100
you are asked to end the contract.

77
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.600
Then once you end contract,

78
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.120
you'll fill out some details about did this go

79
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.825
well and you'll give a review to your client,

80
00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:29.315
and I'm sure the client will receive something similar.

81
00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:31.460
They'll select whether the job was completed

82
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.530
successfully and they'll give you a rating and a review.

83
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.140
After that, you're done the contract is over and the client may or

84
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.085
may not contact you again in future. It's up to them.

85
00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:47.435
I believe you can still message them on Upwork through the same message stream,

86
00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:52.295
but you're not under any obligation to do anything for them at that point,

87
00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:56.390
the contract is over and you've completed that specific job.

88
00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.740
This process is virtually the same anytime you do a contract on Upwork,

89
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.005
except for the case in which you're invited to apply for a job.

90
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:08.405
Actually clients have the opportunity or the option

91
00:05:08.405 --> 00:05:11.700
to send you an invitation to apply for a position.

92
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.400
This is something that you'll get more

93
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.610
commonly as you start to build a really good profile.

94
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.120
So what you'll get when a client invites you to a job is you'll

95
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.110
get a notification in your email or in your Upwork dashboard.

96
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.345
What you'll do is arrive at

97
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:30.394
a certain page that looks a little bit like a job description,

98
00:05:30.394 --> 00:05:31.895
but it has a few buttons.

99
00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:37.490
One to accept the invitation and another to decline the invitation.

100
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.175
If you decline, it asks you to give a reason.

101
00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:44.270
You're free to decline any invite that you get sent through.

102
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.640
I declined most of the invites because they're not a good fit or the budget is too low,

103
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.965
you can flag that reason in the form when you're declining the invitation.

104
00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:58.640
Otherwise, if you like the sound of the job or you want to know more about it,

105
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.630
click accept, and it'll go through and ask you to send a proposal.

106
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.320
Now I say proposal because I don't structure these proposals the same

107
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.780
way that I send proposals when I'm basically cold messaging these clients,

108
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.870
what I do is I am bit more casual with it.

109
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.310
If they've already looked at my profile and are interested in me doing the job.

110
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.520
I basically just say whether it's a good fit and I'm

111
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.455
excited to work with them and maybe ask them a question that I have about the project,

112
00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:34.955
move the conversation forward or I will say something like this where I say,

113
00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:37.160
hi, I would love to hear more about your project

114
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.935
and find out if it's a good fit for my services.

115
00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:43.565
Sometimes I get them to book in for a chat

116
00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:47.225
and for me that just shows if they make a booking for a chat,

117
00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:50.795
they're serious and I can do a lot more on the phone,

118
00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:53.915
then I can do going back and forth on chat.

119
00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:57.200
That's basically another step that you could get

120
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.370
to that stage of getting in the chat room of the client but for now,

121
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.715
it's exactly the same as what we've just discussed.

122
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.320
They'll send you an offer, if it's all good,

123
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.305
and then you accept and then you're in contract together.

124
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:12.950
There's three things to remember here that I just wanted to make clear.

125
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.770
Number one, this is your chance to further evaluate the client.

126
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.350
Remember, we don't want to accept anything that comes our way.

127
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.400
Once you're in contract with the client,

128
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.560
there are certain responsibilities you have to

129
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.310
them and they're able to give you a review.

130
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.030
If you have a bad relationship and the job doesn't go too well,

131
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.830
then that's going to be a problem and you might actually get a low review from it.

132
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.815
What you want to do is make sure that

133
00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:43.460
the client is going to be good to work with as best as possible.

134
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.495
I mean, you get a better feel over time but if they seem too demanding,

135
00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:49.850
they seem like they don't know what they want,

136
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.060
you don't know if you're even a good fit for this job,

137
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.580
if you feel uneasy about it whatsoever,

138
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.400
besides being a bit nervous as to your confidence

139
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.095
of completing a job that you know you should be able to complete.

140
00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:04.650
Don't question your confidence in completing a job,

141
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.245
but just in terms of the client,

142
00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:10.115
if they seem hard to work with or not the best fit,

143
00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:13.250
don't feel too rushed to accept the offer.

144
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.835
In fact, what I like to do is wait a little bit,

145
00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:18.095
get a feel for the client,

146
00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:20.900
make sure they've got all their requirements in place and then

147
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.910
accept the offer if they've sent it quite early.

148
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.055
My second tip is to not be a yes man during this process.

149
00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:32.910
What I mean by that, is just saying yes to everything that the client ask.

150
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.395
If the client says can you do this or can this be done,

151
00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.705
don't just say yes.

152
00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:40.430
There's a certain cultural difference,

153
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.740
I see in certain cultures where yes means something different to different people.

154
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.180
In the West where you're probably getting the majority of your clients from,

155
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.015
yes means a 100 percent yes. If that makes sense.

156
00:08:55.015 --> 00:08:56.870
If you're a Westerner watching this,

157
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.430
you probably get it a 100 percent.

158
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.260
But what I mean is,

159
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.730
if you can't do something,

160
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.670
don't say yes to get the job.

161
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.645
If you aren't happy with something,

162
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.445
don't say yes to get the job.

163
00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:10.820
Clients actually will appreciate it

164
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.430
if you don't know how to do something instead of saying,

165
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.955
yes, you say, actually I don't know how to do it,

166
00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:19.670
but here's the extra information I need in order to figure

167
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.430
out how to do it or I don't know how to do it,

168
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.465
but here's the process I would go about to find the answer.

169
00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.220
They're going to appreciate that.

170
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.310
Remember, and this is something we'll get into in the next video,

171
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.325
is to communicate a lot.

172
00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:35.610
I call it over-communicating.

173
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.690
You want to make sure that you're telling them

174
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.770
as much information as possible and that's going to put them at ease,

175
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.335
so don't be a yes man.

176
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.920
That's another tip for you.

177
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.935
This goes directly into my third point here,

178
00:09:49.935 --> 00:09:52.380
which is consult if you can.

179
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.510
What I mean by consult is,

180
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.275
don't just be the freelancer who takes

181
00:09:57.275 --> 00:10:00.785
direct instructions on what the client wants them to do,

182
00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:03.245
but help the client through the process as well.

183
00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:07.430
If they're leading you down a direction that you think is not going to help the client

184
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.900
and you can offer a better solution or a suggestion of how to do the job better.

185
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.145
Definitely, go ahead and do that.

186
00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:15.975
Clients really appreciate it.

187
00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:20.130
A lot of them actually don't know what exactly they want anyway.

188
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.930
If you can guide them through that process and kind be their consultants,

189
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.155
as well as the person who implements and performs the work,

190
00:10:27.155 --> 00:10:30.159
then you're going to have a great client relationship.

191
00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.495
Finally, speaking of client relationships,

192
00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:34.910
that's what the next video is going to be all about,

193
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.220
so we segueing into that right now,

194
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.630
this video I wanted to make on the process of getting hired.

195
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.800
What happens from when you send your proposal to when you get sent an offer?

196
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.690
Then you click "Accept",

197
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.260
and then you start the contract.

198
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.790
That is basically the process that happens on Upwork.

199
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.405
The things to remember during this process is again,

200
00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.475
to continue evaluating the client,

201
00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:04.700
but then also negotiating If you haven't decided on the payment or what the scope of

202
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.250
the project is and get that sorted out as much as

203
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.785
possible before you click on any offer that they send through.

204
00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:16.820
It's good to be aware of the process and it's good to be as prepared as

205
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:22.065
possible for when you click that accept offer button and you start a contract.

206
00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:24.770
In the next video, we're going to talk about how you manage

207
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.450
that client relationship while you're on contracts with them.

208
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.945
We talked about a few of them here in this video,

209
00:11:29.945 --> 00:11:34.309
but in the next video we're going to dive deeper into managing the client relationship,

210
00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:37.410
so I'll see you in the next video.
