00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,445
Before we get started with all the lessons,

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:04,890
I just wanted to share my personal story,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,520
in order to explain how I came across Upwork and how I managed to

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,110
overcome many of the challenges that I first experienced on the platform.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,685
To briefly cover my story,

6
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:16,920
I started out working here in Brisbane,

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,650
Australia at a co-working space called River City labs.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,235
Through that co-working space,

9
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:26,000
I was able to meet people that would ultimately hire me to work out of

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,095
the co-working space with them or at their own private offices.

11
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:35,345
It was great. I got to work on some good projects, but in 2016,

12
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:37,370
when the lease ended on my apartment,

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,095
and I wanted to go traveling,

14
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:42,004
I needed a way to find clients remotely,

15
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,360
and that's where Upwork came in.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,170
As the biggest marketplace for finding freelance work online,

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,100
I saw it as my best opportunity to find work while on the road.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,870
Starting out, however, we have

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,725
no previous clients for IT or of what I was doing on the platform,

20
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,965
I really struggled to find work.

21
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:04,410
It was a real wake-up call for me and something I really want to stress in this course,

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,060
and that is, you don't just need the skills to perform the work,

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,180
but also the skill of selling them.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,725
In other words, you can be the best programmer,

25
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,380
the best designer, the best writer in the world,

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,674
but if you don't know how to sell your services,

27
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:20,965
you won't have too much luck convincing clients to work with you.

28
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,510
I realized that I had the skills to do the work,

29
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,165
but I needed to learn more about sales.

30
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:31,345
That is when I started to take some courses on how to better market myself on Upwork.

31
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,760
Honestly, some of it worked and some of it really didn't,

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,380
and I couldn't tell whether it was my strategy or my patients that was wearing out,

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,675
but it just wasn't working.

34
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:44,660
I kept going and occasionally I would get

35
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,380
a good client who would pay me and treat me well,

36
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,670
but it wasn't until about six months ago that I decided to look

37
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,715
back on the previous two years and figure out what was working and what wasn't,

38
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:01,670
and then I started to get a grip on Upwork.

39
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,700
I stopped doing the things that weren't getting me results,

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,015
and I started doing the things that did.

41
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,670
Plus I went back to the Internet to search for the freshest information

42
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,615
on how to succeed on Upwork and found one tactic in particular,

43
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:16,955
that is really supercharge my results.

44
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:20,180
In this course I'll be sharing that one with you also.

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,670
Today I have a pretty good profile on Upwork,

46
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,940
I have a job that says score of over 100 percent.

47
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,750
Top rated status and a bunch of five-star reviews, and let me tell you,

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,010
regardless of whether you are able to make good money from day one on

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,040
Upwork or it takes you a little while to build up your profile.

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,035
What you have at the ends over the long-term is an asset that sits

51
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:46,910
on the web and starts to feed you work without you even having to look for it.

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,230
That is the big reward that you'll get from putting in that initial effort.

53
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,595
That's a little bit of my story.

54
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,990
In the next video, we're going to go into the nuts and bolts of the course.

55
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,640
I'll see you on the next one.
