1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,265
All right. Guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:07,710
By this stage, you should now have your profile

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,605
completed and be ready for the next stage,

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:14,565
which is to now actually go and find some work.

5
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:16,995
If you're currently logged in, which you should be,

6
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:20,535
you can click right here on the Upwork logo,

7
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:23,530
and that'll take you to the Find Work page.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,135
You can also get to this page by clicking this link.

9
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:31,035
But the place I would recommend you to look is in

10
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:36,240
a different section that you can find by clicking on this magnifying glass here.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,490
If this view, you can actually see

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,820
all these different listings like you would in the Find Work section,

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,890
but what you have is these really awesome filters,

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,190
and these filters will allow you to filter by any number of these different attributes.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,155
The experience level desired,

16
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,110
the budget, category, client location.

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,390
It's very powerful to use these filters.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,545
Whereas if you go into the Find Work section,

19
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:05,525
there is a link for advanced search,

20
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:09,390
but it's pretty much an advanced text level search.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,230
You don't get those selection boxes,

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,960
you don't get those check boxes,

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,985
and basically you're searching the title and the skills here.

24
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:23,890
I definitely recommend you go and use this one over here,

25
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,470
and the reason why we want to use

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,925
filters is because there are simply too many jobs on Upwork to look at.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:37,700
I mean, we can't just sit here all day filtering through 100,000 jobs,

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,350
many of which are going to be irrelevant to you or not a right fit for you.

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,425
This is essentially how it looks,

30
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:50,030
but we can filter these results by using these filters up here.

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,550
Now just a word on filtering and choosing what jobs to put into your search.

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,625
You don't want to take an approach like I just mentioned,

33
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:03,265
where you're sifting through lots and lots of jobs that aren't going to be right for you.

34
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:07,445
You want to be strategic with your filters to make sure that you're being efficient.

35
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:10,114
But of course you don't want to filter out anything,

36
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:14,360
any opportunities that might actually be a good fit for you.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,270
When you're starting out,

38
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,830
what you want to do is start a bit more broad.

39
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,855
Look for opportunities, maybe jobs that are a little bit smaller,

40
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,775
maybe for small amounts of money.

41
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:28,849
But as you build on the platform,

42
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,950
you're going to get more fussy,

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,195
determine what you like,

44
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,860
what you're willing to work for,

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,210
and your profile is going to be more valuable over time.

46
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,775
It makes sense to go bidding for those bigger jobs,

47
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:42,310
for those higher paying jobs.

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,900
But again, it depends on where you are in your Upwork journey, of course.

49
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,440
For me, for example, who has had a few years and the platform now,

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm not looking for anything entry-level,

51
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,230
so I'd be filtering via intermediate and expert.

52
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,655
By that, I'm able to filter out 27,000 jobs.

53
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:05,535
I wouldn't work for any less than $100.

54
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,760
That's actually less than $100.

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,365
But if I go down here and set a minimum,

56
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:16,715
any project that is less than $100 is simply not worth my time.

57
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:20,330
In fact, I would probably choose a higher number than that.

58
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,300
Even $100 is a little bit small for me.

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,605
The other thing is category.

60
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:30,275
I make sure to filter by a category that should go without saying.

61
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,500
Obviously you don't want to have in the search results

62
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,150
all these different jobs that are completely different fields and skill sets to you.

63
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,400
You want to filter by category.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,830
As I've determined in my audience,

65
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,885
I'm looking for Australians.

66
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:48,560
If I apply all those filters and then close that box,

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,910
you can see I've significantly cut down the amount of jobs in that criteria.

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,390
If 700 jobs sounds a bit small,

69
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,285
remember, as you get more mature on the platform,

70
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:03,020
you go for a more sniper approach than a shotgun approach

71
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,105
of just sending out tons of proposals and hoping to get something back.

72
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:12,800
Now I'm at the stage where I'm not willing to just work with anyone who pay me.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,400
I want to work with high-quality clients that are paying well,

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,785
but when you're starting out, again,

75
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:21,860
you want to find as much work as possible.

76
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,170
You still don't want to work with bad clients,

77
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,460
which we'll get to in a sec,

78
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,675
but you want to work on as many jobs as possible,

79
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,675
and if those jobs are small budget,

80
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:35,570
maybe that's good just to get experience on

81
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,785
the platform so you can get to this point where you're more targeted.

82
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm going to clear those filters,

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,340
go back to the over 100,000 jobs and I'm just going to go back

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,050
to filters now and talk about some of the filters that you might want to use.

85
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,880
Experience level is one of the more important filters,

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,055
and that's because it's not only dependent on your skills as a freelancer

87
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,570
but also dependent on what the budget of the client is.

88
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,310
As you can see here,

89
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,710
they've not only got expert, intermediate,

90
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,080
and entry level, but they've got these $ signs next to it.

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,450
If you're trying to earn a lot of money per hour,

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,800
you really don't want to be looking at

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,535
these entry level jobs because as we've discussed earlier,

94
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,159
when the client goes to make a project,

95
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:31,395
they look at the skill level that they desire and they're given a range of values.

96
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:33,995
They might get entry level,

97
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:38,225
you're looking at below $20 an hour and they might look at expert,

98
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,715
you're looking at more than $40 an hour.

99
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,150
They have an expectation of how much it's going to cost

100
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,895
them as well as their intended experience level.

101
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,390
Price is a big factor in this as well.

102
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,150
If you're just starting out and you don't mind taking a few jobs at entry level,

103
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,625
you don't want to filter that.

104
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,530
Maybe you want to filter out expert level jobs

105
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,255
because you might find a lot of jobs that are just too expert level for you.

106
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:07,250
Maybe you might want to do the opposite of

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,085
me and just look at entry level and intermediate.

108
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:14,420
Intermediate, I pretty much always use because it's somewhere in the middle.

109
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,590
I definitely am not looking for entry level and maybe you're definitely not looking

110
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,015
for expert but intermediate adds in a little bit of a buffer.

111
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,250
Moving onto client history, of course,

112
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,225
it's better to work with clients who have worked with other freelancers in the past.

113
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,380
It gives you more data to work with in terms of seeing how they've paid

114
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,090
other clients and also shows you that they have experience on the platform,

115
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,430
so they're just more reliable as a client.

116
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,250
But I still don't filter people out based on their client history because they might

117
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,399
be a new client to the platform

118
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,850
and they may have hired freelancers in the past and be a really good client.

119
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,000
This goes hand in hand with payment verified as well.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,910
I wouldn't start a contract with anyone who isn't

121
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,015
payment verified but to begin with searching for jobs,

122
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:07,085
I don't mind applying for jobs where the client isn't payment verified.

123
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:12,215
I just make sure that they are payment verified by the time we start our contract.

124
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:16,580
The reason why I feel strongly about this is because my friend Denise,

125
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,220
one of her biggest clients, ever,

126
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,175
wasn't payment verified when he came onto the platform.

127
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,065
She looked at that, she thought,

128
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,430
they are not payment verified,

129
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,740
that's seems a bit dodgy but then she

130
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,200
brought it out with the client and the client was okay,

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,715
sorry. I'm new to Up-work.

132
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:36,200
He verified his payment and that client was worth thousands and thousands of $

133
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,135
to my friends Denise over the span of many months.

134
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:44,330
You don't want to choose your filters too harshly.

135
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,420
I would make sure your clients are payment verified by the time you start

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,440
your contract but I don't filter by these personally.

137
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,540
Moving on to the number of proposals,

138
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,330
you may want to filter this just so that you can apply

139
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,090
for jobs that are less competitive but I don't

140
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,090
think you should shy away from any job that you feel is

141
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,210
a good fit based on the level of competition.

142
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,730
In fact, I do sometimes look at the number of proposals but

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:16,400
that's always a last stage though when on the fence about a certain job,

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,205
am thinking, I don't know if I can position myself.

145
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,740
If they've got over fifty proposals already,

146
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,990
maybe that's a sign for me to say,

147
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,015
I'm not sure about this job,

148
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,835
plus they got a hip proposals already.

149
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:32,405
I'm going move on. But in terms of the preliminary search,

150
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:34,520
I wouldn't filter out by that.

151
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,700
For budget, obviously, it's up to you how much you want to work for.

152
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,645
Like I said, you want to build up experience on the platform in the beginning,

153
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:45,545
so I wouldn't necessarily filter by this in the very beginning but of course,

154
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:49,145
as you get more experienced and you can start to be more choosy,

155
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:53,950
think about the minimum job that you would be willing to do and filter by that.

156
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,600
The other ones here are related to time and honestly,

157
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,165
I don't ever filter by this because

158
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,045
the client sometimes doesn't know how long it's going take or

159
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,695
how many hours of a week it's going to be

160
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:09,950
and you don't know where you're going to be necessarily.

161
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,015
I always just suss that out by actually talking to the client,

162
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,180
I don't use it as a preliminary filter.

163
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,955
Finally, you've got these select boxes down here.

164
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:22,805
You want to make sure that you're filtering via your category,

165
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,440
if you're in web development,

166
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,475
obviously you want to filter out skills that you don't have,

167
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:32,630
you're probably not an interior designer or a contract manufacturer,

168
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,540
so you want to make sure that you're filtering out all

169
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,750
of those jobs that aren't in your category.

170
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,165
That one is a very important one.

171
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,225
In my case, I look at certain locations,

172
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,310
that's just a personal preference,

173
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,605
I guess that I've developed over time,

174
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:52,010
you don't necessarily need to filter by location.

175
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,410
Maybe time zones are consideration for you,

176
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,825
you only want to work in locations that are on the same time zone as you but otherwise,

177
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,805
you can just leave that blank.

178
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:03,065
If I close the filters,

179
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:05,330
you can see here that we've already cut out

180
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,470
80 percent of the jobs that we were looking at before.

181
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,980
Very important to use at least some filtering, otherwise,

182
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,110
you're going to be sitting there for hours scrolling through a ridiculous amount of jobs.

183
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,600
Even still 16,000 is a lot.

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,765
A lot of them are going to be older jobs,

185
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:29,490
so I recommend only looking within a 24 hour period of posting.

186
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,500
Sometimes I push that a little bit but I usually don't

187
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,605
apply for jobs that have been up for more than a day.

188
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,230
The reason for that is,

189
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,280
Upwork is not really like a normal job board.

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,440
People post jobs really quickly and there's so much volume of applicants that come in,

191
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,205
so I usually makes sure that I'm only applying for jobs that are as recent as 24 hours.

192
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:53,870
I've heard from other freelancers that they

193
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,215
recommend applying within four to eight hours.

194
00:10:57,215 --> 00:11:01,565
So maybe you want to do this as a twice daily routine,

195
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:04,085
for me when I'm in finding work mode,

196
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:07,550
I do this as a daily routine and so each

197
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,195
day that's a 24-hour difference, I'll go through,

198
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:14,975
look at all the jobs that have been posted in the last 24 hours and then

199
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,150
the next day I'll go through look at

200
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,075
all the jobs that have been posted in the last 24 hours.

201
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:21,990
By the time I get to Friday,

202
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,905
I've looked at every job that's been posted from that Monday to Friday period.

203
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:29,860
That's what I'd suggest for you and suggest getting

204
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,190
into a routine with it and choosing how many times you're going to

205
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,090
look for this search results per day and what times you're going to do it

206
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,155
because if you are trying to go for that four to eight add gap,

207
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,755
maybe you want to check three times a day.

208
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:48,230
It's up to you. I think once a day is a good balance for me and

209
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,520
I like having a daily routine. That's how I do it.

210
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,965
The final step in this whole process for me,

211
00:11:54,965 --> 00:12:00,875
is going through the listings and actually opening up these job adds in a new tab.

212
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,685
With the computer I'm using now, this mac book,

213
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:08,840
I'm able to hold down "Command" and click on the link and that'll open up

214
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,295
a new tab without having to transition over to that page.

215
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:14,855
This is how I like to do it.

216
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,990
You can also right-click open a new tab up here,

217
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,720
it's off screen but a new tab is opening and I can click over to that job right there.

218
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,760
Okay. If I go back here,

219
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,525
what I do is I just quickly evaluate these jobs.

220
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:32,345
I'm going to talk about evaluating jobs in

221
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:37,025
the next video but what I do in my preliminary search,

222
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:40,040
I just go through and I'm not very fussy,

223
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,190
I just pick at every everything that could be relevant.

224
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,875
I could make a travel agency website.

225
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,600
I'm looking for an expert developer.

226
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,065
Okay. Responsive one pager.

227
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:56,420
I were to click on this but the budget is less than 50 and so I'm not going to.

228
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,765
Now there's senior PHP developer.

229
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:03,410
Okay. Let's have a look at that WordPress expert.

230
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,750
Maybe this is a good video to watch in

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,290
conjunction with the next one about evaluating jobs

232
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,210
but all I'm doing here is a really preliminary evaluation on these.

233
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,710
I'm just trying to filter out anything that is

234
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,115
definitely not going to be relevant or definitely not something I want to do,

235
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:23,810
otherwise, I go through and open them up in new tabs.

236
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,895
We've got WordPress expert here,

237
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:29,030
budget's too low but apart from that,

238
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,820
it might be something I'm interested in.

239
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,910
Then what you'll get at the end is a bunch of tabs.

240
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,740
If I just bring this down,

241
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,465
you can see here that we've got all these tabs now.

242
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:45,080
Depending on whether it's a good day within those filters,

243
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,680
I might have a long list of tabs here and then I go through and evaluate them one by one.

244
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,685
If you're not sure about whether it's the right job or not,

245
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:58,715
just my thinking is give it the benefit of the doubt,

246
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:02,735
open it up in the new tab and have a look at it in more detail.

247
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:05,465
This section here, as you're scrolling through,

248
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,580
is to just pick out the opportunities that

249
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,770
might be of interest to you and then you can get

250
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:15,665
to the different tabs here and evaluate them with more information.

251
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:19,430
All right. That's pretty much the finding work,

252
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,900
at least getting to this stage,

253
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,015
where you're actually on the job page.

254
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:25,190
That's where we're going pick up in the next video.

255
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,990
So I'll see you in that one.
