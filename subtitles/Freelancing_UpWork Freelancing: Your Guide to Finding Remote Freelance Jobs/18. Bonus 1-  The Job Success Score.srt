00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,105
All right guys, welcome back to the course and in this video,

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,225
I want to talk about the Upwork job success score.

3
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:07,920
So if we look at the computer,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,750
you can see my profile here,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,015
and in the top right corner,

6
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:14,910
I've got 100 percent job success,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,690
and I've got top rated status.

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,705
If we hover over job success here,

9
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:23,460
we can see a little tool tip appear says that the job success rating is

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,715
the percentage of this freelance jobs that resulted in a great client experience.

11
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:33,920
So what you might think from this job success score is that it's simply a measure of

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,695
the number of successful jobs over

13
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:40,280
the total number of jobs that I've done on the platform.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,970
Actually, it's a little bit more complicated than that.

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,140
The reason why I know for sure that it isn't as simple as that,

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,055
is because my job success score at its lowest point was 89 percent.

17
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:56,660
Suddenly, after I fixed up a few things on my profile,

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,065
my job success score went up to 100 percent again.

19
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:01,910
Actually it went to 91 percent,

20
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,080
I think first and,

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,810
then shot up to 100 percent.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,015
If my job success score is related to

23
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:12,500
the number of successful jobs over the number of total jobs,

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,390
then theoretically, I can't go from 89 percent to 100 percent.

25
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,795
I could get to 99.9 percent,

26
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:24,515
but technically I could never get to 100 percent job success score

27
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:28,390
if I had even just one job that didn't succeed.

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,040
So some people get frustrated about the job success score,

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,600
think that, "Oh my God,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,190
I've done one job bad.

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,915
Am at 80 percent now."

32
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:40,530
Or maybe they've done every job well and they've got a low job success score,

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,965
and they're thinking like, "why is Upwork punishing me like this."

34
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:48,930
It can be a bit of a mystery and actually Upwork does provide a document here.

35
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,995
I'll bring it up right now on the job success score.

36
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:57,215
So it'll say down here how my job success score is calculated.

37
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:00,110
Here it says at a high level,

38
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,770
we look at job success score this way.

39
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,280
So that's how initially I thought of it as well,

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,550
but if you look down here,

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,430
there's other factors that affect the job success score as well.

42
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,325
There's all of these different things that can boost your score.

43
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:17,270
They even understand that some projects have bad outcomes,

44
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,190
because the client is difficult to work with.

45
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,630
So the fact that one client marks your job is unsuccessful does

46
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,330
not mean that that's going to negatively affect your job success score.

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,485
Then they say here explicitly,

48
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,190
we don't reveal the exact calculation for your score.

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,280
Doing so would make it easier for some uses to artificially boost their scores.

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,120
We need to maintain some privacy with this metric to ensure fairness and accuracy.

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,615
Then you can go down to here and about how it's all calculated.

52
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:51,845
I definitely recommend you go and read this article,

53
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,710
at least to get an understanding of what Upwork is telling you,

54
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,860
but essentially the Upwork success score,

55
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,920
the main thing to realize with it is it's not simply

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,075
a measure of the number of successful jobs you've done over the number of jobs.

57
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:09,450
If you have a unsuccessful job,

58
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,609
it doesn't mean that you can't get to 100 percent job success.

59
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,035
As I mentioned before,

60
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,660
I lost my top rated status at one point.

61
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,180
It was down to 89 percent and I thought,

62
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,300
well that's it, I won't ever get back to 100 percent.

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,675
Then I got there, and actually I went to a rep and ask why my job successful was lower,

64
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:32,595
and I asked how I could get it better,

65
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:36,890
and then he told me a few factors that I could do to improve my profile,

66
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,920
which I implemented straight away and got to 100 percent.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,890
So unfortunately, I've lost that conversation,

68
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,420
I don't have a record of it,

69
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,040
but what I will say,

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,445
is the things that I did to fix my profile and fix my jobs success score was number one,

71
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,200
close any idol contracts.

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,170
So oftentimes clients will start a contract with

73
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,545
you and as long as the work is performed and they've paid you,

74
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,000
which if you're in an alley,

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,090
they'll have already paid your time sheet,

76
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,990
or if you're on a project,

77
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,339
they can pay you a milestone without closing the contract,

78
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,725
they may just leave the contract open,

79
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,450
because they don't really care.

80
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,635
You've been paid, the job has been completed,

81
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,620
but you want to make sure that if you finish the job,

82
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,845
and they don't want you to do any more work on that contract,

83
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,875
that you close it as soon as possible.

84
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,370
This I've found has directly impacted my job success score.

85
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,609
So I call this cleaning up your profile,

86
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:36,110
but you want to make sure that any contracts you have open,

87
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,780
that you're actually communicating with the client,

88
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,275
and following up at least to see if there's anything else they want done.

89
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:45,715
If not, encouraging them to close the contract.

90
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:48,350
This is one of the biggest things and easiest things you can

91
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,000
do to help increase your job success score.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,190
The obvious one of course,

93
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,090
is to just deliver a great customer experience to your clients.

94
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,670
So that goes back into what we talked about in

95
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,565
the previous video on managing the client relationship,

96
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,170
but in this video,

97
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,780
I just wanted to share that the job success score isn't what you might think it is,

98
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,280
and you can actually improve it,

99
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,070
and make sure to manage the client relationship smoothly,

100
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,755
and provide a great service for your clients,

101
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:19,955
but also do things on the platform that make Upwork happy.

102
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:22,759
Close open contracts, complete your profile,

103
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,220
respond to invitations quickly,

104
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,275
respond to client messages quickly.

105
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,615
Don't just leave the platform for

106
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:33,260
a week without touching anything unless you go on vacation mode,

107
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,060
so you want to be constantly maintaining your Upwork profile and your Upwork account.

108
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,530
All of these factors,

109
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,670
I think will contribute to making sure that you have a good Upwork job success score.

110
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,500
So that's all I wanted to cover on the job success score,

111
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,115
as I mentioned, the article is there on the Internet for you to check out,

112
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:55,460
but just make sure to not be too discouraged if you

113
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,105
start off with a job success score of not that great.

114
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,940
You can always get it to 100 percent.

115
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,520
It's not over. So that's the job success score.

116
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,645
In the next video,

117
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:08,809
we're going to talk about my secret tactic,

118
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:11,960
which is not so secret anymore, it's video proposals.

119
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,850
So I'll see you in the next video.
