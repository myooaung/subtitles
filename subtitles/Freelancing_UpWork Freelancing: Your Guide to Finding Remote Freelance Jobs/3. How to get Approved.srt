1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
In this class, we're going to cover how to build

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,660
your profile and how to actually find work.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,075
But in recent years,

4
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,715
Upwork has added in another step.

5
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,785
Now, if you sign up to Upwork,

6
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:14,730
your information will go through an approval process that could see you

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,750
getting rejected before you even get to apply for any jobs.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,320
But don't worry, if your profile does get disapproved,

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,460
you can always try again until you get on the inside.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,940
Now, I have to admit I don't have any personal experience with

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,245
this as I got into Upwork before this whole approval process started.

12
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:38,905
But if you do a little bit of a Google research, like I just did,

13
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:43,990
you can start to find a bunch of different tips that might help you to get approved.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,265
This article here by Freelance To Win has a bunch of really good tips on it,

15
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:53,020
as does this one by Fulltime Nomad.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,890
You can also check out the list of

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,980
the most in-demand skills published by Upwork themselves,

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,765
by searching for Upwork,

19
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:01,835
fastest-growing skills in Google,

20
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:04,390
and finding the article in the search results.

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,745
Chances are that if you're applying for work in any of these fields

22
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:11,140
that your profile would be much more likely to be approved.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,320
One thing I've heard from a friend whose profile was initially disapproved

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,030
was that when she changed her title and skills to something more in demand,

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,770
she was able to get approved,

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,315
and then she changed those skills when she got on the inside.

27
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:28,835
I don't know if I would necessarily recommend that approach, though,

28
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:32,135
because I have heard stories of accounts being suspended,

29
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:36,760
which goes to show that Upwork is still monitoring you once you're on the inside.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,225
A general idea to remember when making your first application to Upwork is that

31
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:45,785
Upwork is trying to provide the best experience possible for the clients on the platform.

32
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:51,370
Try and be as professional and complete in your application as possible.

33
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,135
Once you do get approved,

34
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:57,230
you'll be thankful that Upwork actually weeds out competition for you,

35
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,550
meaning a high chance that you actually be able to find work.
