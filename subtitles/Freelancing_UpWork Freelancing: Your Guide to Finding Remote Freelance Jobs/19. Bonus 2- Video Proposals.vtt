00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Alright guys, I hope you're excited because in this video,

2
00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.860
I'm about to share with you something that

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.365
I started doing it in the start of the year that really

4
00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:12.480
supercharged my results and that is the video proposal.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.445
Now, credit where credit's due.

6
00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.185
Actually, found this idea from this article by Rich 20 something.

7
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.790
It's called Hacking Elance,

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.970
the step-by-step breakdown slash guide to how I made 23,704 weeks.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.210
It's a pretty big article but the part that really got my attention and the strategy I

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.035
decided to implement was creating these videos or pictures or video proposals.

11
00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:44.360
He actually even provides you a script of what he

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.815
sends to clients and he actually provides some video examples.

13
00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.745
What I did was I ran with this idea and I started doing it in

14
00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:58.220
my own way to set myself apart from the competition much more.

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.040
Before I show you some of my video proposals,

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.870
you might be thinking Chris,

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.520
you've spent a lot of time on video,

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.920
you've been on YouTube for over two years,

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.610
your grade on video, I can't do this.

20
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.130
Don't think like that.

21
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460
As you watch these videos and you watch my videos,

22
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.030
you'll see that it's not like a regular YouTube video or even

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.345
presenting a class on skillshare, It's very casual.

24
00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:27.110
I just use my webcam and my Apple earphones and I don't edit the video at all.

25
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.745
That's the other thing. I just talk on camera.

26
00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:33.305
The important things about these video proposal is, number one,

27
00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:35.000
you're setting yourself apart instantly

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.879
because who else is going to be sending a video proposal,

29
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.520
maybe one other person if best,

30
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.340
so you're already standing out amongst the heap.

31
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.410
Two, the client can actually see you.

32
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.625
They can actually put a name to the face and actually hear your voice.

33
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:54.200
He heard genuine you are and so they're going to feel like they're interacting with

34
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.020
a real person much more than if they just

35
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.740
receive a bunch of texts from some no-name freelancer.

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.290
Thirdly, it allows you to communicate

37
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.010
better that you're understanding the job description,

38
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.550
you're researching their company,

39
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.985
and you're figuring out ways to solve their problems.

40
00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.340
In this video, I'm going to share with you

41
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.550
two video proposals that I sent out that landed me jobs on Upwork.

42
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.100
But before I do that,

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.525
I want to talk about some principles with doing your own video proposal.

44
00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:26.690
Number one, and this is something I learned from the original article

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.215
from "Rich 20something."I'm following this structure.

46
00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:31.445
We've got attention grab,

47
00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:32.525
lead into the video,

48
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.925
website reference high-energy close.

49
00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:40.475
The main thing that I've done is grab their attention and lead them into the video.

50
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:42.245
I do say something like,

51
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.430
this is not a Cannes[phon] proposal,

52
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.480
I am actually sending you a recorded video just for you.

53
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.945
That will often intrigue clients more than anything is,

54
00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:54.950
somebody recorded a video for me personally,

55
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.700
I want to watch this even if they see nothing else,

56
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.835
they're like, okay, well,

57
00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:00.170
you've got my attention,

58
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.270
I want to see this freelance actually talk about

59
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.645
my job on camera and then they click on the link.

60
00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:09.545
That would be my first tip is be very succinct with the proposal.

61
00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:11.600
Chances are that the client is going through

62
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.730
a lot of proposals and so they don't have a lot of time.

63
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.835
You don't want to bombard them with a bunch of text and a video.

64
00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.000
The video is going to be the thing that

65
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.750
communicates all the information and puts you forward for the job.

66
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.070
The text is just to get them to click on the video.

67
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.580
Once they've clicked on the video,

68
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.300
what they can do after that,

69
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.615
so you want to grab their attention,

70
00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:35.285
draw them into the video and once they've watched the video,

71
00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:36.870
make a call to action.

72
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.280
I actually like to put the call to action in the video as well.

73
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.590
Next, when you're actually recording the video,

74
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.390
I want you to be very casual.

75
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.580
Use the person's name if you can,

76
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.610
bring up the actual job description on your screen,

77
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.200
as you'll see in the examples.

78
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.740
I do a full-on screen-cast while also having

79
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.940
a box down the bottom that they can actually see me on the webcam.

80
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.470
If you're wondering how to do that,

81
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.045
you can probably look that up.

82
00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:04.280
I use QuickTime media player for it.

83
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.690
It's an easy thing to do but I'm using a Mac but you'll see the formula

84
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.300
that I go through in my example videos is I start with a job description,

85
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.770
I go over me reading it and breaking it down and answering the points directly.

86
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.560
We can apply all the principles that we've learned in

87
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.490
this class so far to the video proposal now.

88
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.180
The great thing about the video proposal is we can do it in real time.

89
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.775
I can highlight certain points of their job description

90
00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:35.500
and talk about how I can position myself for that.

91
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.990
The other great thing about video is that I can open up

92
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.280
a new tab in my website browser and find actual examples.

93
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.440
If I have a portfolio piece to bring up,

94
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.480
I can show them that in real time,

95
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.375
if I don't know how to do something but I've done my research,

96
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.560
I can go and show them articles where,

97
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.015
look I found a process of how we could do this,

98
00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:59.295
I've never done this before but I think using this approach would be good.

99
00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:02.480
You can do all the things that we've talked about in

100
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.395
this course and you can apply them and do them on video.

101
00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:09.110
Makes it so much more powerful and the client

102
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.095
doesn't have to go around clicking different links and interpreting it.

103
00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.435
You just click on the next tab in the browser,

104
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:15.560
show that to them.

105
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.730
Just physically show them on camera what you're talking about and what you

106
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.455
would have put in your text proposals that in itself can be very powerful.

107
00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:28.625
Between this video and the article on 'rich20something.com',

108
00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:33.560
you guys have all the information you need to go out there and put out a video proposal,

109
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.140
I think of course it helps to see examples.

110
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.455
I'm going to play two examples for you now in this video,

111
00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:43.730
back to back of jobs that have actually won on Upwork and if you have any questions

112
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.765
about the video proposal definitely leave them in the discussion box.

113
00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.565
I hope you guys try it.

114
00:05:50.565 --> 00:05:52.370
Let me know how you go with it.

115
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.060
Let me know if it's something that has really worked for you because it's

116
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.820
really worked for me and I highly recommend it.

117
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.950
That's pretty much the course guys.

118
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.245
Thanks so much for watching in the next video,

119
00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:04.670
I'm going to conclude the course,

120
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.265
so stick around for that but for now,

121
00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:12.380
I want to talk about the class project make sure to post your profile once

122
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.805
you've finished completing it in the project section of this skillshare class.

123
00:06:17.805 --> 00:06:21.140
The great benefit of that is that other students can go in,

124
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.890
give you feedback, I can go in and give you feedback on your profile.

125
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.010
It'll just give you more incentive to go out there and set up that profile.

126
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.030
If you have any issues, discussion box below and I'll see you in the final video.

127
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.640
Thanks so much. Hi Vanessa,

128
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.410
Chris here calling but doing this video proposal

129
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.675
for you from up north in the Gold Coast in Australia.

130
00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:50.735
I see you guys run a video production company in Sydney.

131
00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:52.610
I'm a huge fan of video.

132
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.775
Actually, have three YouTube channels.

133
00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:57.980
Feel free to talk to me about video anytime I love it

134
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.480
but this job is about web development.

135
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.875
Lets get talking about that.

136
00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:09.305
I see you're interested in an interactive price list.

137
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:14.615
I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to but I did take a look at your example.

138
00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:19.830
I see that down the bottom there is a pricing table.

139
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.200
It's interactive in the sense that there's different tabs that you can click

140
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.800
on and they open up different sections.

141
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.765
You can click Choose and it opens up a modal.

142
00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:35.194
When the modal opens,

143
00:07:35.194 --> 00:07:39.610
you can start to make payment and get a membership.

144
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.569
To me this is pretty standard functionality,

145
00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:44.460
a lot of websites have this.

146
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.645
We can find a plug-in for this or code it.

147
00:07:48.645 --> 00:07:52.645
I'm sure there's many plug-ins available to do this,

148
00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:56.750
just it would have to integrate with your membership plug-in.

149
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.950
I'm not sure if you have that yet or you have a payment gatemay or something like that.

150
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.370
That's probably the biggest level of complexity to this

151
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.945
but honestly it's not that tough and maybe you've already figured that out.

152
00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:11.495
I want to hop on about that.

153
00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:17.690
Basically, pretty standard functionality I can't see it being

154
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.390
too challenging for myself a little bit about

155
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.765
me because I didn't actually introduce what I do.

156
00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:25.375
I'm a WordPress developer.

157
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:33.660
I will link a little bit of my portfolio in the job cover letter.

158
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.050
I'm always excited to work with other Australians.

159
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.330
My best clients pretty much all of my best clients are from Australia.

160
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.030
It's always good to work with other Aziz.

161
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.030
I really like what you're doing in terms of video.

162
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.410
That's all I wanted to say.

163
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:58.290
I just wanted to be able to talk on video to you guys have a face to the name.

164
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.185
I don't know what I'm doing with my hand but

165
00:09:01.185 --> 00:09:05.375
anyway just please get back to me either way whether,

166
00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:11.475
it's just to say Chris, you're not a right fit or let's talk more about this project.

167
00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:13.845
I really appreciate a reply.

168
00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.395
Thanks so much for your time.

169
00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:20.690
I'll just speak to you later. Good day, I'm Chris.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:25.445
I came across your ad looking for an Australian based developer.

171
00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:28.040
I'm an Australian-based developer actually here in

172
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.300
the Gold Coast in Queensland at the moment.

173
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.100
You're looking for somebody with experience using the Yii2 framework.

174
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.180
Actually the last contract I did in Brisbane,

175
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.290
was for a startup called PetCloud and that was the code base we were using.

176
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.180
We actually started on coding and then we moved over to Yii.

177
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.980
To be honest with you,

178
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.700
I was mainly front end for that job.

179
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.775
Sir, I'm not a specialist back-end developer

180
00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:07.540
but I do have experience plugging into Yii and we did use postgres for the database.

181
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.750
You have a developer actively involved but you just need extra resources.

182
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.230
I can definitely help with that.

183
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.885
I can start immediately,

184
00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:23.715
used Yii before and I think the front end stuff is my specialty.

185
00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:26.400
I might be a good fit for this job,

186
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.430
if not send me a message anywhere,

187
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.060
I'd love to hear from you and hope to speak to you soon.
