00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,435
Before we get started with the actual mechanics of Upwork,

2
00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:07,845
I wanted to make sure you have a very important step taken care of.

3
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:12,020
This step is deciding what it is you're actually going to freelance in.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,475
So if you've already decided what you're going to do,

5
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:16,260
feel free to skip this video.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,130
Otherwise, let's go into some of the things you may want to consider.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,035
Like we mentioned in the previous video,

8
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:25,260
there are certain fields that are more in demand than others,

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,630
and certain fields that are much more lucrative.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,744
To use myself as an example,

11
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:32,310
I am predominantly a front end web developer,

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,820
but I also am skilled at creating videos.

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,475
So early in my Upwork journey,

14
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:42,220
I actually experimented with bouncing back between those two disciplines and over time,

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,320
I realized that video editing as a service,

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,700
in general was a much less in-demand skill than web development.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,530
In fact, if you just look at the statistics or login as a client on Upwork,

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,590
you can see that video editing has a lower rate than

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,060
web development and has much fewer jobs.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,860
This is something to take into consideration if you're

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,730
tossing up between two or more disciplines.

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,950
On one hand, you may have a skill that you enjoy more than the

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,920
other and have maybe even a portfolio of work already around it,

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,290
but then on the other hand,

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,505
a skill that is much more lucrative and perhaps less exciting to you,

26
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:22,540
or something that you don't have a big track record in.

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,310
The important thing to remember here is that you can change

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,430
your profile to whatever you want, whenever you like.

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,190
This allows you to test out certain disciplines and

30
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,010
specializations without the risk of being locked

31
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,040
in and the best part about this is that any work

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,265
you do on Upwork will earn you a higher job success score,

33
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:42,130
a high rating, and more reviews.

34
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,920
So you can always choose something to get started and then update

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,860
your profile details into the more difficult fields later.

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,090
In this class, we're not going to go into a lot of career advice

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,420
on which path you should pursue but in the context of Upwork,

38
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,630
specifically, what you should consider when making your decision is the market on Upwork.

39
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,100
My recommendation would be to head over to

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,310
the the find work area on Upwork and starts searching for opportunities.

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,205
How many projects are out there that fit your skill?

42
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,790
Do they sound like something you might be interested in and are

43
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,300
they opportunities that you think you could realistically be hired for?

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,275
These are some of the questions you should ask yourself during this process.

45
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,080
But again, if you've already made up your mind about what you want do,

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,825
I don't want you to start second guessing yourself.

47
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:32,660
Ideally, you should have already decided what field you

48
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,315
want to work in before arriving in Upwork.

49
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:37,565
But if not, have a look at what's going on,

50
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:42,030
and remember you can always change your profile later.
