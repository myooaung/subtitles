00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
In a few videos, we're going to start setting up your profile.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,725
Before that, we need to cover some basic freelancing theory.

3
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:11,250
This lesson is going to be on determining your pitch.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,595
What exactly is a pitch?

5
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,640
A pitch is just a short summary of

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,715
the offer that you're going to bring to the marketplace,

7
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:25,665
and this is something I learned from my good friend and fellow freelancer, Sergio Sala.

8
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:30,285
The four steps to finding your pitch are: One, what's your skill?

9
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:32,205
Two, what's your focus?

10
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:33,990
Three, who's your audience?

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,615
And four, what's your solution?

12
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,270
In Sergio is case,

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,140
he's a web designer who creates custom WordPress themes with

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,915
the Genesis Framework for online entrepreneurs

15
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,200
slash professional bloggers to generate more sign-ups,

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,075
get more sales, and establish a better personal brand.

17
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,680
Of course, the obvious part and the one that we covered in

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,365
the last video is your skill itself,

19
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:59,585
but if you have a focus, an audience,

20
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:02,749
and a solution, your pitch will be ever more compelling.

21
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:07,490
Now, while having a focus audience and solution is awesome in theory,

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,050
for people just starting out,

23
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,695
it may be hard enough just to choose a skill and a specialization,

24
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:17,255
so I don't expect everyone to answer these questions straight away.

25
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:22,070
What I will recommend is that you seek to refine your message over time.

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,570
If you're just starting out,

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,630
of course you need to know what your skill is.

28
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,205
If you have that figured out,

29
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:32,044
then you should seek to find a specialization or focus,

30
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:35,015
then determine your audience, and finally,

31
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:39,820
if possible, get really specific on what solutions you can provide to them.

32
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,400
This is a process I believe should happen naturally as you

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,275
gain more experience and reflect on the work you've done over time.

34
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,684
For example, as a web developer,

35
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:54,215
one of your first gigs might be building a WordPress website.

36
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,895
Once you've built one of them,

37
00:01:55,895 --> 00:02:00,200
maybe somebody else sees your work and wants a WordPress website as well,

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,245
and suddenly, you're starting to form a specialization.

39
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:06,620
Let's take that example one step further and say that most of

40
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,600
your clients that you've worked with happen to be in the financial services industry.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,500
Suddenly, you've found yourself an audience, and finally,

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,530
you might find yourself producing a similar solution

43
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,724
or grouper solutions to each of these clients,

44
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:26,600
and now you've naturally come across solutions that you can offer to others.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,085
Do you see now how your experience can lead to answering these questions?

46
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,605
This doesn't just have to be freelancing,

47
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:36,950
your experience could relate to a specialization and

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,160
an audience that you worked with in a previous, say, corporate job.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,190
Once you've done one job working in a certain specialization for a specific audience,

50
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,520
then you can reference that experience when applying to work

51
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,300
in that specialization again with that same audience.

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,885
Again, it's a good idea to hold these questions in your mind,

53
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,650
but don't let it hold you back to start with.

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,010
Just know that specificity will work to help your marketing message.

55
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,700
Anytime you can be specific with what you can do for clients,

56
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,480
let that come through on your profile and in your proposals.
