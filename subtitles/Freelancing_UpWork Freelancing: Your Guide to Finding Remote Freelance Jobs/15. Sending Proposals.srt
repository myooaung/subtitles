00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
In this video, we're going to talk about actually sending proposals,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,970
what to include in your application and honestly all of

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,165
these different videos or different parts

4
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:15,705
of the finding work and applying for work section,

5
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:20,280
they all blend into each other because you should know what your pitches,

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,320
what you're looking for,

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,300
and that will dictate all the way from your job search to actually applying for the job.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,040
But in this video, I got rid of those previous examples because those were just

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,950
from that short period of time searching and I

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,150
found some other examples here for us to look at,

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,540
and let's talk about how you might position yourself for these jobs.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,910
Here you've got a very simple job.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,280
The budget might be small,

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,220
but it might be what you're after and they're

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,550
looking to mobile optimize a WordPress website.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,565
They've only got really one requirement here,

17
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:59,269
and that is that they want it mobile optimized.

18
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:02,390
If you have anything in your experience or anything that you can

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,230
show them of how well you can make mobile first websites,

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,725
then definitely that's something that you would want to address.

21
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,035
That's one example. In this job,

22
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,570
you can see here that they've listed a whole bunch of

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,685
things that they want the developer to do.

24
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:20,650
Number 1, adding a live.
