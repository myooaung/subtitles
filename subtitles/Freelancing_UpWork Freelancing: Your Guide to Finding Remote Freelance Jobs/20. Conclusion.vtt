That pretty much covers my UpWork process from setting up your profile to finding work.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.455
As I mentioned throughout this course,

3
00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:12.209
you will start to see things change over time as you build up your profile.

4
00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.140
Soon enough, you'll go from being the one constantly applying for jobs,

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.000
to now being invited to apply for jobs by the client themselves.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.610
The long-term goal of succeeding on UpWork is

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.640
not just to find a few clients and make a bit of money,

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.510
even though that's great.But what you can do with UpWork is

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.555
build your profile into an asset that attracts the work to you.

10
00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.920
Remember to keep this in mind as you work with clients,

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.070
reassuring yourself that the benefits of doing great work

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.390
for one client help your business in the long-term,

13
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.095
helping you to work with more clients and bigger projects.

14
00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:50.555
As always, if you need any tips or guidance,

15
00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:53.300
be sure to leave a comment in the discussion box below,

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.270
and I'll do my best to point you in the right direction.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.400
Anyway guys, thanks for watching and I hope to see you again in some of my other courses.
