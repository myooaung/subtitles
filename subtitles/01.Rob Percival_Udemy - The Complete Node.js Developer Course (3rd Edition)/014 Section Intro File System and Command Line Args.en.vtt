Welcome to section number four in this section.

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.490
You're going to continue to learn how to work with the node module system.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.220
So in the last section we ended up working with a few little scripts to explore this functionality in

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.870
this section.

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.450
We're gonna start to put all of that together and actually create the note taking application.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.660
Now throughout this section the focus is going to be on two main topics.

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.230
The first is the file system and the second our command line arguments the file system is going to allow

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.650
us to store the user's note data and command line arguments are going to allow us to get input from

9
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.490
the user.

10
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.670
Now don't worry later on in the class you're going to learn how to store data in a real database and

11
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.530
you're going to learn how to get input from the user via forms in the browser.

12
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.460
But for now this is a great way to get started.

13
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.300
So let's jump right into the section.
