Welcome to section number 10 on databases and Mongo D.B. in this section.

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.300
You're going to learn how to connect your know J.S. application to a database so you can store user

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.170
data.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.910
We're also going to be starting our third of four apps in this section.

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.780
That is our task manager REST API.

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.570
This application is going to have all of the features you'd expect from a real world app.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.780
We'll have user authentication with an email and password.

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.050
We'll have database data storage for user data.

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.120
Well I'll file upload support for a user profile images and we'll have email notifications and more.

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.850
Now before we get to any of that the focus in this section is on the very basics.

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.460
We're gonna start by setting up the database server on our machine.

12
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.270
Then we're gonna figure out how we can connect to that database from no J.S..

13
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.450
And from there we'll move on to explore how we can perform those four basic CRUD operations.

14
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.190
That is C for creating data are for reading data you for updating data and D for deleting data.

15
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.370
I'm excited to get to it.

16
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.700
So let's jump right in.
