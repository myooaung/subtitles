00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,600
Welcome to section number five in this section.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,380
You're gonna learn how to debug your know J.S. applications.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,930
So as you might have already seen when you run your program things don't always work as expected.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:21,230
You might introduce a typo into your program causing your app to crash or you might misuse a function

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,260
causing strange and unexpected behavior.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,070
The goal in this section is to give you the tools needed to actually fix these problems so you're going

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,600
to learn how to debug and inspect your app as it's running so you can figure out exactly where your

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,780
program is going wrong and why that's going to give you the information needed to fix the mistake in

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,040
the code and get back on track.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,500
Now in the beginning all of this is going to be a little frustrating as it's going to take a lot of

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,440
time to debug your issues.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,040
It might take 10 or 15 minutes to figure out what's going wrong and to solve it.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,320
The good news is that as you make mistakes which you will it's only going to get easier to fix them

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,670
over time by the end of the class.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,150
What might have taken you 10 minutes to debug will only take 10 or 20 seconds to fix.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,190
You'll notice you start to see a lot of the same issues and patterns over time.

17
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,540
So what we're going to focus on in this section is not perfection.

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,030
Perfection isn't a realistic goal.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,910
Anyone who's writing software is making mistakes.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,680
The real goal is to be able to recover from them quickly and get back on track so we can continue to

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,900
be productive.

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,970
All right let's jump right in and learn how to debug our note apps.
