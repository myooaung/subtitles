1
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.060
Welcome to the class once again.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.790
I'm Andrew Meade and I'm excited to show you everything that no JSA can do.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.430
When I first started teaching node on udemy over five years ago node was already a super popular choice

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.090
for new developers and that hasn't changed in the last five years.

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.040
New features and functionality have been added to node making it more popular and mature as a tool being

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.250
used by professional developers everywhere.

7
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.230
Now in this class you are going to learn everything you need to become a professional node j s developer.

8
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.290
But before we get to that in this video there are three important things I want to cover.

9
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.390
First up we're going to talk about the course curriculum.

10
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.960
We'll figure out how we're going to get from where we are now to where we want to be which is a professional

11
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.300
no developer.

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.350
Second up we're going to talk about how you can get the most out of the class and the most out of our

13
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.610
time together.

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.630
And third we'll talk about how you can get help if you need it.

15
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.660
All right let's jump right in and talk about the course curriculum

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.530
this course is broken into four major parts and in each part you'll end up building a complete no J.S.

17
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.680
application from scratch.

18
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.130
So in part 1 you're going to build a note taking application in part two you'll build a weather application

19
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.170
in Part 3.

20
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.370
You'll build a task manager app.

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.450
And finally in Part 4 you'll build a real time chat app.

22
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.720
Now as we explore new features of no JSA and the eco system we're gonna be integrating everything we

23
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.650
learn into one of those four projects.

24
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.180
The goal here is not to explore no J.S. features in isolation.

25
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.800
The goal is to figure out how we can use all of these features together to create interesting and meaningful

26
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.180
applications.

27
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.300
So let's take a quick moment to break down the four apps we're going to build the first app.

28
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.490
The note taking application is how we're gonna get started.

29
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.710
So this one is going to be pretty basic as we explore the fundamentals we have to figure out how we

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.210
can do things like create our first node app use basic features from node and run the application for

31
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.300
the first time.

32
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.690
Now along the way we'll explore features from node like the ability to read and write from the file

33
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.080
system and we'll start to explore our very first third party no J.S. libraries.

34
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.060
That brings us to part two in part two.

35
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.600
You're building the weather app and that's a web application so the user is going to be able to use

36
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.900
and interact with your app from their browser.

37
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.810
Now to build this one we have to explore a lot of interesting topics like how we can create web servers

38
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.860
with no J.S. how we can build out our own node API eyes how we can launch our applications to a production

39
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.360
server and how our apps can communicate with third party services such as a third party service that

40
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.190
allows us to fetch real time weather data for a given location.

41
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.430
Now that brings us to the third app and the third app is the biggest of all.

42
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.840
This is the task manager app the task manager app has all of the real world features you'd expect you'll

43
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.530
learn how to setup authentication with an email and password.

44
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.600
You'll learn how to setup database data storage with Mongo D.B. into the very popular Mongoose library.

45
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.420
We'll also explore other topics like file uploads email sending and more.

46
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.140
Now that brings us to the fourth part in Part 4.

47
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.170
You're going to build that real time chat app here.

48
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:44.000
We'll explore how we can use socket I O and web sockets to create real time no JSA applications.

49
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.160
The goal of the course is to give you the tools and real world experience needed so you can go off and

50
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.920
build useful and interesting applications.

51
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.380
Once the class is over.

52
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.540
So now you know what you're getting yourself into.

53
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.200
And we're going to move on to Part 2 of this video where we're going to explore how you can get the

54
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.460
most out of the class

55
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.860
this course was designed to be completely interactive so to get the most value out of the class you

56
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.650
need to interact with it.

57
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.510
Everything that I do on my machine is something that you should be doing on your machine as well.

58
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.940
So as we explore a new feature of node we'll be writing some code together.

59
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.830
We'll talk about what the feature is and how it works.

60
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.770
Then we'll run our program to see it in action.

61
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.410
This is something that you should also be doing on your machine.

62
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.850
Now this is a little bit of monkey see monkey do behavior where you're just following along but that's

63
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.330
ok.

64
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.590
It's actually essential for exploring new features and figuring out how they work.

65
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.190
Now when it comes to building up your problem solving experience this monkey see monkey do approach

66
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.720
no longer works.

67
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.570
That's why I've included over one hundred unique challenges requiring you to solve problems on your

68
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.570
own using what you've learned in the class.

69
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
So I'll set you up with a problem.

70
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.220
I'll give you some time to go off and solve it.

71
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.260
Then we'll come back together and work through a potential solution.

72
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.670
So both of these things are essential.

73
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.710
Follow along with what I'm doing on my machine and give these challenges an honest try.

74
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.620
If you do both of those things you're going to get to the end of the class.

75
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.820
You'll have the tools and real world experience necessary to go off and build note applications on your

76
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.450
own.

77
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.940
All right let's jump into Part 3 of this video which is the final part where we're going to talk about

78
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.710
how you can get help if you need to

79
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.270
we're about to spend a lot of time together learning something new and it's likely that at some point

80
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.780
along the way you're going to need a little help.

81
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.530
Maybe you're running the application locally on your machine but when you run it you get a different

82
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.310
result than what you're seeing me get in the video.

83
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.350
Or maybe you run your app and it completely crashes printing some sort of long cryptic error message

84
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.530
regardless of what's going wrong.

85
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.180
Of course a Q and A is where you can go to get help you can find a link to the Q and A below the video

86
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.540
player for each and every lesson there you can browse previously asked and answered questions and you

87
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.950
can likely find a solution to your problem right away.

88
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.800
If not you can always crack open a new question in the Q and A.

89
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.560
All I ask is that you provide as much information as possible so if you're running into a problem running

90
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.900
your project zip up your project code and include that with the question if you're getting some sort

91
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.400
of error message.

92
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.580
Take a screenshot and upload that with your question.

93
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.030
The more information the better that's going to allow us to get you unstuck and back on track faster.

94
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.140
Now don't worry.

95
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.480
Throughout the course I am going to teach you how to debug your own applications and how to read those

96
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.430
cryptic error messages.

97
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.690
But the course Q and A is always there if you need it.

98
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.710
All right that's it for this video.

99
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.860
Let's continue on with the rest of the class.
