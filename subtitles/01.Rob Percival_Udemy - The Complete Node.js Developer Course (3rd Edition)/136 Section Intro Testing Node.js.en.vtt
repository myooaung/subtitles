Welcome to Section 16 on testing no J.S. applications.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.470
Now when we're talking about testing our no J.S. apps we're not talking about manually testing them.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.290
That's where we perform some operation in our application and we use our eyes to verify that we're getting

4
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.750
the correct result.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.370
What I'm talking about is setting up an automated test suite.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.980
That's where we write a little bit of code that performs an operation in our app.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.220
Then we add a little more code that asserts we got back the result we were expecting.

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.360
So this is going to help us out tremendously especially as our application grows.

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.570
When we start off we might only have a few features to manually test and it might only take a couple

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.350
of minutes.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.420
But as our application grows in complexity that's quickly going to get out of hand.

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.990
The great thing about an automated test suite is that we write the test case a single time and we can

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.660
run it as many times as we need to.

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.460
I could run it 10 times in a minute one time for every single change I make to the project that's going

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.850
to give us a lot of confidence that we're not shipping broken or buggy code to our paying users in production.

16
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.970
So in this section you're going to learn how to set up that automated test suite.

17
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.870
Now even if you don't plan on testing me side project you're working on I still recommend working through

18
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.750
this section as if you use no J.S. in a professional setting.

19
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.280
They're likely going to require you to perform some sort of automated testing and if you work through

20
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
the section you'll have the skills to get that done.

21
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.700
All right.

22
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.600
Let's jump right in.
