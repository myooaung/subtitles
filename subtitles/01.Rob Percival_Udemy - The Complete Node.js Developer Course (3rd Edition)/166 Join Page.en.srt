1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,980
In this lesson you're going to set up the join page for the chat application.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,290
So we're going to allow users to provide their user name and the room they'd like to join.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,720
They'll submit the form and then they'll be redirected over to that chat room.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,950
So what we need to do is create a separate HDL file right here in the public directory.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,850
We're going to create one called Chat dot HMO.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,760
Now index dot HDL that's the home page and that's actually going to be the join page chat that HDL is

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,860
going to contain everything we have in the other file that means to get started.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,960
We're gonna head over to index dot HDL.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,800
We're gonna highlight everything in this file copying it to the clipboard and we're going to paste it

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,820
over in chat.

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,060
Dot HMO.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,380
This file doesn't need to be changed any more.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,610
We are just taking all of that chat code and moving it over here.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,240
Now index down HDL is going to be the join page and we're going to get started by gutting everything

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,860
we're not going to need.

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,330
We're going to leave the head of the document exactly as it currently exists.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,960
Down below for the body we're going to remove everything so we're removing our div with all of the chat

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,040
content we're removing all of our templates and we're removing every single script tag down below.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,190
That's going to leave us with an empty body and we'll focus on building up the markup for the chat page.

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,720
So to get started let's go ahead and create a div.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,010
This is going to have a class on it since we're still taking advantage of our styles right here.

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,710
That class is centered hyphen form.

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,010
And from there it will add another div right inside.

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,160
The reason for the divs is to just provide us with a nice layout which we'll see in a few moments right

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,820
here.

26
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:03,990
That is going to be a another div with the class centered form underscore underscore box.

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,480
Now inside of here we're gonna put the actual form content and I'll start off with a title tag using

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,640
an H1.

29
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,980
Right here I could say something like join or something similar.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,450
Now with this in place let's go ahead and refresh our index dot HDL page just to make sure it's looking

31
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,600
good so far over here.

32
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,260
I'll give things a refresh.

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,640
No longer do we see our chat content instead I see my join forum.

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,030
Now from here we're actually going to add the form into the mix.

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,190
Right here we are going to set up the form with the following elements inside.

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,100
We'll start off with a label.

37
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,490
We're gonna use labels to describe the form fields.

38
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:55,330
And the first thing we'll ask the user for is their display name so I'll set the label equal to display

39
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,010
name and down below.

40
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,690
We're going to create the input where the user can type that name in.

41
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,170
Now we are going to set up some attributes for this input.

42
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,200
First up the type that will equal to text.

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,130
It's a simple text field where they can type anything they'd like.

44
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,770
Then we'll go ahead and give this a name.

45
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm going to name it.

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,950
User name from there.

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,270
Just a couple more.

48
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,520
We're gonna set up placeholder to show some text in the input when nothing is typed.

49
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,480
I'll just match it up with the label.

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,060
So that would be display name

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,490
and lastly we're gonna go ahead and set required and no value is provided.

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,000
We just listed out.

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,860
This is gonna use a little HDMI L5 form validation to make sure a value is actually typed in.

54
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Next up down below we'll be creating a another label for the other field.

55
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:56,000
This is the room name I can call this room and then we'll set up the input for that as well.

56
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,370
Very similar to what we have up above.

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,870
So the input type is indeed text.

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,030
We'll setup a name for this input something like room gets the job done right here.

59
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,890
I'm also going to set up a placeholder room followed by finally required.

60
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,320
Since you are gonna have to provide a value for that as well.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,410
Now the last thing we need here is a button.

62
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:27,590
This button can have the text of something like join or submit or whatever you'd like.

63
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,750
Now this alone is gonna get everything rendered correctly.

64
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,280
The only problem is that it's not going to bring us over to the chat page when the user submits the

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,940
form to fix that.

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,760
We're going to set up the action attribute on our forum and we just provide forward slash chat dot HDMI

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,900
out the path to the page we want to redirect them.

68
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,170
Now we can go ahead and actually test things out so to get started we're going to refresh the home page

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,730
right here.

70
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,780
Local host three thousand and I see my form showing up and it looks really nice.

71
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,640
If I try to submit it.

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,520
I can see that I do have to fill out these fields so I'll pick a name something like Andrew and I'll

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,780
pick a room.

74
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:19,270
Let's go ahead and use something like South Philly and then I'll go ahead and click join and to join

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,880
that room with this username.

76
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,210
Now currently we don't have any code for actually doing that.

77
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,600
That's okay if we click the Join button though.

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:36,100
We should get redirected over to the chat page and you can see our form data as part of the query string

79
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,910
up above.

80
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,070
So now this page can extract that data and use it when connecting to socket dot I.

81
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,090
Oh and that's exactly what we'll end up working on.

82
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,180
So we have that joint page and we have our chat page and users can switch between them.

83
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,180
So at this point we do have the HDL for the page in place and that's where we're gonna stop for this

84
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,870
one.

85
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:07,180
We'll be continuing on working on this page and the chat dot HDL page actually using both the display

86
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,770
name and the room name when connecting to the server.

87
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,170
I'm excited to get to that.

88
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,960
It's where we're going to stop for this one so I'll see you in the next lesson.
