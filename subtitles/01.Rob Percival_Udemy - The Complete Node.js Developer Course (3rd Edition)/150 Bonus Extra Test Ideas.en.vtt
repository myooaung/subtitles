00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.870
In this lesson I'm going to provide you with some other ideas as to what you can test with these skills

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.900
you now have.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.960
So throughout the last 15 videos you learned everything you need to know in order to test your express

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.380
applications to kick things off.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.050
In this lesson we'll talk about some of the other tests you could create for this project with the skills

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.580
you now have.

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.070
Now there are two ways we could go about this.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.340
We could have five or six more videos added on to the section where we write tests with techniques we

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.050
already know how to use.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.290
Or I could just provide you with a list of additional tests you could create.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.770
And that's what we're going to go with.

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.720
So we can continue on to more exciting new content.

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.090
So over in the browser you can find this list over at links.

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.150
Dot Mead dot I O forward slash extra tests when you visit this.

15
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.130
It's going to redirect you over to a get hub just with some ideas for other test cases you could create

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.790
and you have all of the skills necessary to create all of these should you choose to.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.410
You're more than welcome to continue on to the next section and start the content on real time web applications.

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.280
Otherwise here are some ideas for user tests as an example.

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.580
You could make sure that you can't sign up a user with an invalid name email or password.

20
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.760
This could actually be three separate test cases.

21
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.120
Another example you should not be able to delete a user if you're on authenticated and down below we

22
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.520
have even more ideas for testing.

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.420
Are tasks as we created less of those together.

24
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.440
So right here for an example should not create task with invalid description or completed value should

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.970
delete user task.

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.840
So when I'm logged in I should be able to delete my own task or others like should fetch only incomplete

27
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.830
tasks.

28
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.220
There I'm using one of the filters that I setup.

29
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.100
Now if you actually go ahead and create any of these do share your work over in the course Q and A.

30
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.280
If you have any questions about the work you're doing when you're creating these if you get stuck.

31
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.340
Once again feel free to ask a question in the Q and A and as always we will work with you to get unstuck

32
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.310
and back on track.

33
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.920
All right.

34
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.940
That's where we're gonna stop for this video and that's where we're going to stop.

35
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.220
For our section on testing we now know how to test our no J.S. applications in the next video which

36
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.710
is the section introduction for the next section.

37
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.630
We're gonna die in two real time web applications.

38
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.490
I'm really excited to get to that.

39
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.070
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
