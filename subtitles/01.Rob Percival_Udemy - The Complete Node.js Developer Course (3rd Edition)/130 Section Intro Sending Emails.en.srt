00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,670
Welcome to Section 15.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,400
On email sending in this section you're going to learn how to set up email notifications in the task

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,140
manager application.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,600
And we're going to do this by simply calling a function and providing the necessary data like who the

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,580
email should go to and what the subject and body of the email should be.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,280
Now to do this we'll be using the very popular send gridded service send the grid as a service specifically

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,340
designed for developers who want to send emails from their applications and it's not alone in this space.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,230
There are other similar tools like postmark and man drill but send grid is definitely my favorite sand

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,960
grid also comes with a handy NPM module which means that we can install it and load it into our application.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,650
Sending emails with maybe 15 lines of code.

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,170
All right let's jump into the section and integrate e-mail notifications into the task manager app.
