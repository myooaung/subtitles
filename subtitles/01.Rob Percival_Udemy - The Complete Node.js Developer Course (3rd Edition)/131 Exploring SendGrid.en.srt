1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,100
In this lesson and we're gonna kick off this section on email sending by well sending an email from

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,600
node.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,500
J ust the first thing we're gonna do is explore these service.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,640
We'll be using.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,950
And then from there we will actually write a little bit of code to send our very first email from our

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,440
node application.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,690
And then throughout the section we'll actually set up emails that get sent as users do things like create

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,210
their account and delete their account.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,260
But for the moment let's just see what it takes in terms of code and modules to actually get this done.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,340
Now when it comes to picking a service for sending emails you have plenty of options available to you.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,590
And the one that we're gonna be using in this course is called Send grid.

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,830
We can find it by heading over to send grid dot com inside of the browser and we're gonna have to create

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,490
an account and set it up before we'll be able to send emails from node j s.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,930
Now one of the reasons I'm picking send grid is that there is a nice free tier so you can get started

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,810
integrating email into your app before you ever need to pay.

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,120
And it also doesn't require you to have a custom domain to setup other email services typically do even

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,970
to just test things out.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,110
So with send grid we'll be able to start completely for free and there's no need to provide anything

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,130
like a credit card.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,020
So if we head over to their pricing page real quick we can take a look at the plan that we'll be using

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,000
for the class.

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,630
It is the free plan.

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,030
We get 40000 emails for the first 30 days as a sort of trial period.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,440
Then we can send 100 a day thereafter forever.

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,110
Now that might be OK for a real application but it seems unlikely if you were creating a real application

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,690
and you were charging your customers you would probably upgrade to this other plan for 15 bucks a month

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,730
where you could send a hundred thousand emails a month and that should be more than enough.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,240
As you're getting started.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,980
So once again the free plan is going to allow us to send emails from no J.S. forever.

30
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,700
There's just a restriction after a certain point in time.

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,780
Let's go ahead and actually create an account down below on the pricing page we've selected that free

32
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,310
option.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,870
And down here we have a try for free.

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,810
We're going to sign up for an account send grid is going to give us an API key and we'll be able to

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,660
use that from no J.S. to actually send those emails.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,960
The setup process here can be a bit confusing at first solo work through it together.

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,300
We'll pick a user name down below a password

38
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,090
and we'll do the same thing down below for confirming

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,520
and then finally an email address.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,470
Now from there we just confirm we're not a robot and agreed to those terms of service.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,330
There's no need to have a custom domain or provide a credit card or anything like that right here we

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,680
have to provide just a little more information which I'll take a quick moment to go through

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,180
ad for the Web site.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,540
You can just say something like no cite yet down below you can just say you're the owner of your non-existent

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,300
company.

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,200
And then we just need to pick how many e-mails we plan to send.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,170
We'll just do zero to one hundred thousand.

48
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,460
Next up how many employees.

49
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,950
Well obviously just us.

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,450
And then we can get started now from here it's offering up some suggestions as to how we can get started

51
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,920
with these service down below.

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
There are a few different ways we can send our first e-mail.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,470
We can send it using their API.

54
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,310
We can integrate with popular applications like WordPress or we can build and send marketing campaigns

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,090
if we were creating an email list for our service maybe before it launches.

56
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,520
In this case to send one off emails from no Jay S. We want to use their web API.

57
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,910
So right here I'll click Start.

58
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,510
Now we have a web API and an S MTBE relay.

59
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,970
We'll be using their Web API because that's going to allow us to take advantage of these send grid NPM

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,920
module which we can use to send emails.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,730
So down below I'm going to pick choose and from here it's going to walk us through a little wizard allowing

62
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,990
us to get set up.

63
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:14,080
We're going to integrate with node j as the first option available and then to make sure things are

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,300
actually working.

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,270
It's going to walk us through a what five step process to getting these send a grid service integrated

66
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,740
into the node app and we're actually going to work through this in Visual Studio code.

67
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,910
Well let's go ahead and work through this together the first step is to make sure we have node.

68
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,160
That's an easy one.

69
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,050
The next one is to create an API key.

70
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,450
So this is something we're going to provide in node j s when we send the e-mail and that will allow

71
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:46,820
send grid to associate the email we're sending with our account and we have to provide an API key.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,330
You can't use send grid anonymously so down below we can pick a name for our first API key.

73
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,230
I'll go ahead and use something like task app or task manager app or anything that makes sense for you

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,510
right here.

75
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,400
We'll go ahead and create that key and down below.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,920
It's going to show the key to us.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,680
We want to take a moment to copy that to the clipboard as we're going to need it from inside of node

78
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,980
j s now to get started over in Visual Studio code.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,480
We're going to create a new directory in the source folder.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,050
And we're also going to create a new file.

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,310
So for the moment we can actually collapse all of the other directories in the source folder and we

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,490
can close all of the open EDS.

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,310
We're going to start with just a single file.

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,310
So right here in source we'll create a new folder I'm going to call this e mails and inside of the e

85
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,520
mails folder we'll create a single file which I'll call account dot J.

86
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,670
S So this will be the file that contains all of the code for sending emails related to user accounts.

87
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,150
So for things like signing up or deleting your account.

88
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,420
Now for the moment we're not going to worry about actually doing that.

89
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,280
We're just going to add a little code that sends a test email.

90
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,460
Let's get started by just creating a variable to store that API key.

91
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,530
So right here a constant I can call it send.

92
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,080
Grid API key and we'll just set it equal to a string and write inside.

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,900
We'll paste the API key that was generated for us now from here.

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,900
We want to go ahead and actually install the NPM module for seven grid as we can use its methods to

95
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,210
send emails now over inside of the instructions in the browser.

96
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,420
They're essentially doing the exact same thing.

97
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,800
They're walking you through the necessary steps to get all of this done.

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Though we'll do this as part of the video.

99
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,950
Now the only major difference is step number three they're creating what's known as an environment variable

100
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,930
to store the API key.

101
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,470
Don't worry we're going to get to this in about three videos.

102
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,600
We'll learn how to get this out of our code so it never winds up on something like get hub.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,870
But for now it's perfectly fine to leave it where it is.

104
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,870
We'll address that shortly.

105
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,390
So over inside a visual studio code we want to take a quick moment to install these send grid NPM module

106
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,710
so we can actually use it to send e-mails.

107
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:17,440
So down below what we're going to do is use clear to clear the output and we'll be using NPM AI with

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:26,080
the following the module name is at send grid forward slash mail and the latest version that is aft

109
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,110
right here six point three point one.

110
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,290
So let's take a quick moment to install that.

111
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,000
And up above on line one of account dot J S we'll be requiring it.

112
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,720
So const s g mail which is the common variable name you'll see in the send grid documentation its value

113
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:51,610
comes for him using require with that module send a grid forward slash mail and on s g mail which is

114
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,120
an object itself.

115
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,320
We have methods for actually sending emails.

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,870
Now before we can send an email we have to let these send grid module will know we want to work with

117
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,720
this API key and that's what's going to make sure that things work as expected we can do that using

118
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:17,980
s g mail don't set API key and we pass to this our API key which I have stored in my variable up above

119
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,120
that's send grid API key.

120
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,360
Perfect.

121
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,330
Now that we have the API key set up when we send an email send grid will know it's associated with our

122
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,740
account and down below we do that using s g mail dot send.

123
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,700
This allows us to send an individual email and we pass to it an object.

124
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:47,230
And on this object we specify everything about the email who it's to who it's from the subject of the

125
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,680
email and the actual text content right here.

126
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,060
Let's go ahead and specify that information.

127
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,430
So to I'll send it to myself.

128
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,360
Andrew at Meade dot I.

129
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,980
Oh and I'll send it from that same account

130
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:11,460
next up we have the subject line for the email and I'll go ahead and say This is my first creation and

131
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,500
then below that we have the text for the email.

132
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:22,050
So the text is going to be something along the lines of let's just say I hope this one actually gets

133
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,130
to you.

134
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,170
Perfect.

135
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,380
Now in addition we can provide an H2 UML property to set up a styled and l email if we wanted to but

136
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,580
we're not going to worry about that we'll just stick with basic text for the moment.

137
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,350
Now we can save account not J.

138
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:44,730
S and to actually send this email off all we need to do is run this script so down below in the terminal

139
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:53,790
what I'm going to do is use node then source forward slash emails forward slash account dot J S to send

140
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:01,350
the e mail off right here I run the script the script seems to work successfully and now we can go ahead

141
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,550
and see if it actually worked via two ways one we can use these send grid interface and two we can go

142
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,250
ahead and actually open up our email accounts so down below as you work through this little tutorial

143
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,550
it eventually gets to the point where it asks if you've sent a test email and it's going to verify that

144
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,100
it actually went through that you were able to correctly send the email with your account go ahead and

145
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,640
try to go through the verification process right here I am going to make sure that it actually did work

146
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,740
and we can see that it did work.

147
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:42,170
So the email that we sent from no J.S. was received by these send grid server and sent off to the g

148
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,570
mail server which is where my email is hosted.

149
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,210
Now we'll go ahead and take a quick moment to pull that up.

150
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,390
So I'm going to open my email account right here.

151
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,510
It should be loading up in just a second and I would expect a couple of emails inside of there.

152
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:04,600
I have a couple greeting me to the send grid platform and then I have this email which I sent to myself

153
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,430
right here.

154
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,380
The subject line and this is my first creation.

155
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,010
And if I crack it open I have the correct text as well.

156
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,010
Now this email might not have made it to your inbox.

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,370
It might have made its way to your spam folder and you'll also see this right here.

158
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,480
A really big warning letting you know that this email might be spam.

159
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Now if you read the error message here it says this may be a spoofed message.

160
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,070
This message claims to have been sent from your account but Andrew Meade mail couldn't verify the actual

161
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,620
source and G mails right.

162
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,020
I just typed two addresses over here.

163
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,800
Now two should be able to be anyone but from should have to be an account that I actually own.

164
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,640
Now I do own that account but Gmail does not know that I was the one to actually call the send method

165
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,490
in node j.

166
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,930
S now to address this and to get send grid working reliably.

167
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,160
All you have to do is verify your email they sent you a welcome email to confirm your email address

168
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,720
and the next step would be to have a real domain you link with your account.

169
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,010
So if I'm creating an application I would buy a domain.

170
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:21,490
I actually do own Mead dot I oh I would link that with my send grid account and that would make sure

171
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:28,480
that other services like Yahoo Mail outlook Gmail and others know that I actually have rights to send

172
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,380
emails from addresses ending in at Mead dot I.

173
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,300
Oh and we would no longer see those warnings.

174
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:41,530
You can learn how to link your custom domain to send grid in the documentation though buying a domain

175
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:47,500
is not a requirement for this course we'll still be able to send all of the emails necessary but for

176
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,410
the moment they will have that warning.

177
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,180
Once you actually purchase a domain and link it once you're creating a real professional application

178
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,600
you plan on publishing all that will go away and you'll have a nice reliable email solution.

179
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,610
So now we have our first e-mail sent and you should be seeing it whether it's in your inbox or your

180
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,020
spam folder.

181
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,970
And we were able to verify that everything with send grid worked as well in the next lesson.

182
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,780
We're going to start to send emails based off of the users interaction with our application.

183
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,070
I'm excited to get to that.

184
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,250
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the next one.
