00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.150
This course contains a lot of new information.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.250
So to make that information a little easier to digest.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.050
I've included a PD f reference guide with the third edition of this course.

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.060
This is essentially a one hundred and twelve page e-book which contains lecture notes code examples

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.950
and documentation links for each and every lesson in the class.

6
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.930
So video is my favorite medium for learning something new but it ends up being a poor reference tool.

7
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.530
If you forget what something was called or how it works it can be really time consuming to dig through

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.250
hours of video to find that one little piece of information you're looking for.

9
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.810
The goal with the PD f reference guide is to give you this information in a way that's easily scandal

10
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.220
so you can find exactly what you were looking for.

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.110
You can download the F reference guide as part of the lecture downloads for this lesson so take a moment

12
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.450
to download it now.

13
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.040
So you have it when you need it.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.780
All right that's it for this welcome section.

15
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.700
Let's jump in to the rest of the class.
