Welcome to Section 13 on data sorting filtering and Padgett nation.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,780
Right now whenever the client requests a list of data from the server like a list of tasks for a user

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,580
the client has very little control over what data comes back.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:24,460
If the client does request the list of tasks for a specific user they get back every single task for

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,350
that user in the order in which it was originally created.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,740
And that's not ideal.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,590
As users add more tasks to the database all of those tasks are constantly going to get transferred back

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,180
and forth which is going to slow down our app significantly.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,190
It would be much better to give the client a little bit of control choosing what exactly it wants back.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,560
This is going to allow us to add some awesome features to the application where a client can provide

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,250
a search term and it just gets back tasks that have that search text in the task description.

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:03,820
It's also going to allow the client to get back just completed tasks or just incomplete ones.

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,880
The client will be able to filter the data alphabetically or by when it was created and we'll be able

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,560
to set up pages nation.

15
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,920
So we're not fetching every single record constantly.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,480
All of this is going to create a way more efficient application.

17
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,770
I'm excited to get to it.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,940
So let's jump right in.
