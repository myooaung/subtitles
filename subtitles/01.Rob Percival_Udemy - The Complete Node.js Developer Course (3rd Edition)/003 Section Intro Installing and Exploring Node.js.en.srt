00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,600
Welcome to your very first section for the class.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,990
The first video for each and every section is a little section introduction.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,700
That's where we come together face to face for just a minute or two to talk about what exactly we're

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,860
going to cover in the section and how that's going to fit into the bigger picture goal of the class

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,200
which is to get to the point where we can build and launch our own no J.S. applications.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,690
So here's an example in this section section 2 you'll be getting your machine set up for the rest of

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,580
the class.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,730
We'll start by installing no J.S. on your computer.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,700
And I'll set you up with a text editor that works really well with note.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,040
We're also going to talk about what exactly know James is and why it's something you should spend your

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,920
time learning we're about to invest a significant amount of time learning something new.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,280
And it's always a good idea to know what exactly you're getting yourself into.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,170
All right let's jump right into the section.
