00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.020
In this video you're going to learn how to install Mongo D.B. on your machine.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.020
That's going to allow you to start up the server locally and actually connect it to the database from

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.500
node j s so you can read and write data.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
Now this video is for Windows users only if you're on Mac or Linux.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.260
The last video was the installation video for you.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.870
This one is just for my Windows users if you're still watching.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.120
I am going to assume you're running on Windows to actually kick the process off.

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.250
What we're gonna do is head up to this link at the top right hand corner of Mongo D.B. dot com.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.420
This is the get Mongo DB page where we can download what we need in this case from these three options.

10
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.790
We want to download a server so we can get Mongo D.B. up and running locally.

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.770
Now there are two options from here.

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.850
We have the Mongo DB community server and we have their enterprise server.

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.590
We'll be using the community server which is completely free and that's going to allow us to use Mongo

14
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.140
D.B. locally on our machines.

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780
Now there are three options here.

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.140
The version the operating system and the package type you want to pick the most recent version of Mongo

17
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.340
D.B. available.

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.860
The current release even if it's greater than what you're seeing here for me which is four point zero

19
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.930
point four.

20
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.390
That's because I update these videos to support the latest version.

21
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.160
So make sure to grab that current release.

22
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700
Next up the OS.

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.500
It should have automatically detected your Windows operating system inside of this dropdown there are

24
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.610
other OS is for Linux and for Mac here we do indeed want Windows and then down below we have our package

25
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.490
type and we're gonna go ahead and grab these zip archive which we'll be able to use to actually get

26
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460
Mongo D.B. up and running.

27
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.040
Now you'll notice that there is no 32 bit version available but you can grab an older version of Mongo

28
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.450
D.B. in 32 bit if that's the operating system you're running on.

29
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.390
So for 64 bit users you have these options configured and you click the download button that's going

30
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.280
to grab the zip we need.

31
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.380
If you're running on Windows 32 bit you can head over to the following You are all that is Mongo D.B.

32
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.760
dot org forward slash DL forward slash win 32 forward slash AI 3 8 6.

33
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.370
When you visit this you're gonna be greeted with a very ugly page that contains the 32 bit versions

34
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.940
available with the most recent releases up top and the older releases down below you want to go to the

35
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.260
very top and you'll see two versions available for each.

36
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
The MSCI and the zip you want to grab these zip.

37
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.280
That's going to be what you need to install for 32 bit Windows.

38
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.610
So take some time to grab the correct zip for you.

39
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.860
And once it's done we're gonna go ahead and extract the contents of that archive.

40
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.870
So right here from the downloads folder we can move into the archive.

41
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.610
We can click extract and we can extract everything.

42
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.340
Now where do I want to put the extracted files.

43
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.170
I'm gonna put them right in the downloads directory.

44
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.540
So right here in my users folder forward slash downloads I'm going to extract them and right here it's

45
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.090
moving through the extraction process.

46
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.880
Now one of the things included in here is an executable that's going to allow us to start the server

47
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.390
up.

48
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.210
It also comes with a bunch of other executable is for doing other interesting things.

49
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.640
So at this point we have two things in the downloads folder.

50
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.800
I have the old archive and I have a folder when I open that folder I should see the following in there.

51
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.820
I have the bin directory.

52
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.110
So this is the folder that we're going to need to use because in there we have executable is for doing

53
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.550
things like starting our server up.

54
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.990
Now we don't want to leave this folder in the downloads directory.

55
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.400
We want to move it to a more permanent place on our machine before we do.

56
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.660
Let's go ahead and rename this folder right here.

57
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.380
I'm going to rename it from its current long name to something a bit simpler.

58
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.010
Mongo d be perfect.

59
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.020
Now that we have this in place let's go ahead and take this folder to a more permanent location.

60
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.900
What I'm going to do is put this on the user directory for my user profile so down below.

61
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.730
I have this P.C. in there I have all sorts of files and folders.

62
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.800
We're going to scroll down past that to a local disk right here we're cracking that open in there I

63
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.130
have users in there I have my user which is Andrew and that's where we're going to move this Mongo DB

64
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.210
directory.

65
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.380
So I'm going to take it and I'm going to move it over to that folder.

66
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.000
Now if I crack open the user directory I can see that Mongo D.B. is indeed listed right inside of here.

67
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.360
Now this contains what's needed to manage the server.

68
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.120
We also need to create a place to put the data that the database stores.

69
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.630
We're going to do this by creating a new folder right alongside of this one.

70
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.490
So I'm going to create a new directory.

71
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.740
I'm going to call this Mongo D.B. hyphen data that's going to set right alongside of the Mongo DB folder

72
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.310
and that's where we're going to store the data for the database.

73
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.920
With this in place we're now ready to actually start up the database from the terminal.

74
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.280
We're going to do that by using Visual Studio codes terminal right over here we have power shell running.

75
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.920
I'm going to start by using clear to clear the terminal output and the next thing we need to do is run

76
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.810
one of the executable is in that bin directory to get started.

77
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.810
We need to navigate to the executable that is going to be for me forward slash users forward slash my

78
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.340
user name in this case.

79
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.900
Andrew you can swap it out with yours.

80
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.570
Notice we're just starting with the path that we're seeing right here.

81
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.460
Then we're going to go into the folder we created and put in that directory which we had called Mongo

82
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:14.760
D.B. in there we have that bin folder and in there we have Mongo D dot e x e Mongo D is the executable

83
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:21.690
we're going to use to start up the server next up we're going to provide the hyphen hyphen DV path argument

84
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.330
which allows us to provide the path to the folder where the data should be stored and we just created

85
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.310
one for that.

86
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.540
That's forward slash users forward slash for me.

87
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.490
Andrew forward slash Mongo D.B. hyphen data.

88
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.480
Now if you chose to put these folders in different locations or you named them something else you're

89
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.570
gonna have to adjust your commands accordingly.

90
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.970
Right here though if I go ahead and hit enter it's going to actually start up the server for the very

91
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.200
first time.

92
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.960
Now we get a ton of output showing up.

93
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.030
The important thing though comes maybe five lines before the end.

94
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.210
Right here we have the following message waiting for connections on Pt. 2 7 0 1 7.

95
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.670
This is Mongo DB default port.

96
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.440
And by seeing this message it means that your server is up and running and it's waiting for connections.

97
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.580
For example connections from node j asked to read and write data.

98
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:26.740
Now if we navigate back over to the file explorer and open up that folder we created Mongo D.B. data.

99
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.550
You'll notice there's actually a lot of stuff inside of there.

100
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.540
Now this is all just boilerplate needed to get started.

101
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.270
None of it actually contains documents since we haven't created any just yet.

102
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:43.380
But as we move through this section and we start the process of adding documents to our collections

103
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.510
and storing those in our database all of that data is going to live inside of this directory.

104
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.760
So for the near future you're just going to leave this command up and running.

105
00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.660
We can create multiple terminal tabs when we want to do other things like run our node J.S. applications.

106
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.180
But it is important to leave this running for as long as you want your database up and running which

107
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.810
for us is going to be for a while.

108
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.530
All right.

109
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.030
So that's where we're going to stop for this video.

110
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.600
We have Mongo D.B. running on our machine which is a great start in the next video.

111
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:23.730
You're actually going to connect to your database from node j s that's what's going to allow us to start

112
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.480
the process of reading and writing data.

113
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.000
I'm excited to get to that.

114
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.690
So let's go ahead and jump right in to the next one.
