1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,060
In this video you're going to install Mongo D.B. on your machine that's going to allow you to actually

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,190
start up the Mongo DB server and connect to it from node j s.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,170
Now this video is for Mac and Linux users only if you're on Windows.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,640
I've created a separate installation video for you.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,840
That's the next one so you can stop watching now and jump over to the next video if you're on Windows.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,080
If you're still watching this one I'm gonna assume you're running on either mac or linux and we're gonna

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,450
work through the installation process.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,490
You can grab mango D.B. by heading over to get mango D.B. now from here.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,070
There are a lot of different things we can download.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,160
We have cloud options server and tools.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,620
We want to grab a server that we can actually run on our machine and there are two options here.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,380
The community server or the enterprise server we're gonna be using the community server which is the

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,440
free version of Mongo D.B..

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,340
We'll be able to get up and running on our machines down below before we can download.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,190
There are three things we can pick version OS and package now right here.

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,160
You want to pick the current release even if that's greater than what you're seeing for me.

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,480
So the current release right now is four point zero point four.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,310
If you're seeing a more current release you want to grab that as I'll be updating the videos to account

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,990
for any changes.

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,730
Next up is the OS.

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:33,810
So for Mac users you want to stick with Mac OS and do you want to grab the T GC archive of all of the

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,890
Mongo D.B. files.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,880
If you're running on Linux you want to change the OS.

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,480
You can see a bunch of different distributions listed here.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,270
So as an example if you were running on the latest a boon to eighteen point zero or you could grab that

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,810
here then you can pick your package.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,620
Now for Mac the only option you had was the GC archive for a boon to an other Linux distributions.

28
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,360
You're gonna have other options.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,400
You want to switch that over to teh GC to get everything working correctly.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,380
So if you're on Linux.

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,700
This is what you want.

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,570
I'm going to switch over to Mac to actually grab the archive for myself.

33
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,160
I don't have Mongo DB installed.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,640
We're going to work through the process together as it's a more manual setup then something like no

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,390
JSA where we have a nice wizard the installer walks us through all the steps with Mongo D.B..

36
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,610
There's a little manual work that needs to be done to get everything up and running once the download

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,380
is complete.

38
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,690
You want to go ahead and crack open the finder on Mac or your file explorer on Linux and navigate over

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,720
to the downloads directory.

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,640
Here we have our archive and I can double click that to extract its contents.

41
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,830
What's inside of there is what we need it to actually manage our Mongo DB server.

42
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,290
So in here we have they been directory the bin directory contains a bunch of executable is which we

43
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,510
can use to perform various tasks.

44
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,810
The main one is Mongo DB which we can use to start up the Mongo database server.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,860
So before we actually run this executable we want to take this directory and move it to a more permanent

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,570
place on our machines.

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,910
I don't know about you but for me the downloads folder is basically a temporary directory that gets

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,200
deleted every few days or so.

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,650
So we want to move this to a place where it can live long term.

50
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,440
Before I move it I'm going to update the name of this directory.

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,650
Right now it contains a lot of additional unnecessary information.

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,800
All I'm going to do is rename this folder from what it currently is just over to something simple like

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,770
Bongo D B.

54
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,150
Now from here what we want to do is put this somewhere permanent and a great place to put it is the

55
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,070
user folder on your machine.

56
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,740
I'm gonna crack open another finder window.

57
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,520
I'll navigate over to the user directory and from here I'm going to take that Mongo DB folder move it

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,290
out of the downloads directory and move it into its more permanent location.

59
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,680
Now once it's over here we're almost ready to start up the server.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,060
The next thing we need to do is create a place for our data to be stored.

61
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,220
Now by default Mongo D.B. expects you to create a data directory at the root of your hard drive and

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,180
in there it expects a D.B. directory.

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,270
That's not ideal for many users as you're going to run into a ton of different permissions errors.

64
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,850
It's much better to create a directory inside of your user folder to store the data.

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,460
So right here I'm going to create a new directory in the same folder where I have Mongo D.B. and I'll

66
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,540
call this Mongo D.B. hyphen data.

67
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,450
So I have Mongo D.B. which contains the executable is necessary to actually start things up and manage

68
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,840
our database and they have Mongo D.B. hyphen data which is currently empty but which will shortly start

69
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,550
to contain our databases data.

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,000
Now that we have both of these in place we're ready to actually start up the database and we do that

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,930
by running a single command from the terminal.

72
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,660
For me I'm going to navigate back over to visual studio code and from the terminal we are going to run

73
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,680
one of the executable is in that bin directory.

74
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,940
Now if you put the directory somewhere else on your machine your command is going to look a bit different.

75
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,120
To start we need to get the path to our user directory.

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Now if you already know that you can simply type it out.

77
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,750
If you don't know it you can run C.D. space tilled up to navigate to your user folder and from there

78
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,650
you can use it p WD to print the current working directory when you run that command.

79
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,400
It's going to spit out a path.

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,280
And this is something we're going to use in the command to start up Mongo D.B. so to kick things off

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,890
we have to list out the path to the executable.

82
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:57,240
So for me it is forward slash users forward slash Andrew which is exactly what I got right here.

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,280
Then forward slash Mongo D.B. which is the name I picked for my directory.

84
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,550
Forward slash bean forward slash Mongo D.

85
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:13,590
Then we use the D.B. path argument to provide a path to that data folder we created.

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,720
So that would be once again forward slash users forward slash Andrew.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,760
Then forward slash Mongo D.B. hyphen data.

88
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,670
So this is the complete command for me.

89
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,260
Make sure to just swap out the beginning portion with whatever you got from TWD when you were running

90
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,930
that command from your user folder.

91
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,540
Now when I kick this off we're gonna get a ton of output as it initialize is the database and gets the

92
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,220
database up and running.

93
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,750
Right here I'll hit enter to run the command.

94
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,890
We have all sorts of output as it starts itself up and we can see that after all of that happens it's

95
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,700
just sitting and waiting.

96
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,390
The server is up and running and now it's waiting for connections to the database where the connector

97
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:04,080
can read and write from the database adding documents querying documents updating documents or deleting

98
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,940
them.

99
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:11,700
Now if we go back over to the finder we can see the Mongo DB data directory now has a ton of information

100
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,040
inside of there.

101
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,300
This is all just to initialize things.

102
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,350
There are no actual documents as we haven't created any just yet but we now do indeed have the server

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,080
downloaded on our machine and we know the command we can use to get the server up and running.

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,230
One thing worth pointing out from the output comes maybe 8 or so lines before the end.

105
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,020
Right here we have the following message waiting for connections on Pt. 2 7 0 1 7.

106
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,890
This is letting you know that your Mongo DB database is up and running.

107
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,300
And this is just the default port that Mongo D.B. uses.

108
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,790
Now that the database is up and running you can connect to it from node J.S. to start reading and writing

109
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,610
data.

110
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:01,290
Now the next video is the Mongo DB installation video for Windows users so you can skip that and move

111
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,330
on to the following video which is the video where you'll actually connect from node.

112
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,500
I'm excited to get to it.

113
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,690
So stay tuned and I'll see you soon.
