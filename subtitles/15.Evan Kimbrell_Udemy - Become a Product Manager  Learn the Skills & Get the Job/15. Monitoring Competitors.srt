Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, in the previous lectures in this section, we covered how to find competitors,
1

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,890
gather information on them, figure out if they're
direct or indirect, and then compare them.
2

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,230
Now, those are all crucial skills for gathering the information you need to make judgments on your competitors.
3

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,560
Now, those are all crucial skills for gathering the information you need to make judgments on your competitors.
4

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,650
However, competitors are always going to be there,
if not forever, at least for a while.
5

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,380
And like you, competitors will change.
6

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,850
Competition is an ever changing landscape, and, as a
good product manager - which is what you want to be,
7

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:44,850
right? - you want to keep tabs on your competition so that as soon as they make a change you can redirect or adjust.
8

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,890
right? - you want to keep tabs on your competition so that as soon as they make a change you can redirect or adjust.
9

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,940
Now, remember the five dimensions that we
judge our competitors on?
10

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,350
We have the product team - how good are they
or how bad are they?
11

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,190
We have the product team - how good are they
or how bad are they?
12

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,090
We have design - is it pretty?
13

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,310
We have brand - how important is their brand? Is it a positive asset for them? Is it so strong it prevents you from doing things?
14

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,200
We have brand - how important is their brand? Is it a positive asset for them? Is it so strong it prevents you from doing things?
15

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,910
We have brand - how important is their brand? Is it a positive asset for them? Is it so strong it prevents you from doing things?
16

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,110
We have brand - how important is their brand? Is it a positive asset for them? Is it so strong it prevents you from doing things?
17

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,360
How big is their user base? Is it big or is it just girthy?
18

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,710
How big is their user base? Is it big or is it just girthy?
19

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,260
And the last one is speed - how much of it are they on?
20

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,620
And the last one is speed - how much of it are they on?
21

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:21,390
Now, those are the five criteria that we want to keep in our minds constantly about our competitors and it's always going to change.
22

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,610
Now, those are the five criteria that we want to keep in our minds constantly about our competitors and it's always going to change.
23

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:31,140
They are going to make changes and take initiatives that
will increase certain ones of the five and
24

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,860
sometimes they'll make mistakes and they'll lose some ground on some of those five and you need to be 
25

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,010
there to know when it happens.
26

27
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,740
So, in this lecture, we're going to cover three different events that you should constantly be looking for, and we're going to
27

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:53,260
cover three different ways that you can keep tabs on
if those events happen. Alright, now there are
28

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,070
obviously a ton of tiny little things that can happen with your competitors and it's worthwhile to know.
29

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,830
Maybe they move a button over here, maybe they make a big change to their web app, whatever it is, it's all worth knowing.
30

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,200
Maybe they move a button over here, maybe they make a big change to their web app, whatever it is, it's all worth knowing.
31

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,270
But there are three things, as a product manager, that I think
stick out more than the others, because
32

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:18,420
they have the ability and the potential to change all of those five criteria we previously mentioned.
33

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:18,450
they have the ability and the potential to change all of those five criteria we previously mentioned.
34

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,020
So the first one is funding.
35

36
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,030
Now, this is not really something I've talked a ton about before,
but a lot of companies receive money.
36

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,250
If you're in the startup space, a lot of companies
receive venture capital. The amount of money that's
37

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,160
in their bank account can make an enormous difference
for a number of our five variables.
38

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,440
More money means they can hire more people.
39

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,290
More money means they can spend more money on ads, means that they can hire more contractors, it can pay for more press.
40

41
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,450
More money means they can spend more money on ads, means that they can hire more contractors, it can pay for more press.
41

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,720
So that means that they can dramatically change their speed.
42

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,270
More money also could mean that they now have more to work with for recruiting, for their product team,
43

44
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,120
and so you should keep your eye out
in case their product team improves.
44

45
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,020
It adds small changes to brand, that doesn't necessarily change their design, but it could allow them
45

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,600
to bring on people who can add more design and usability,
46

47
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,370
and it also could or could not have an effect with user size.
47

48
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,960
Oftentimes, especially with startups, when they raise money they do spend a lot of it on advertisement and growing their user base.
48

49
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,570
Oftentimes, especially with startups, when they raise money they do spend a lot of it on advertisement and growing their user base.
49

50
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:27,780
All right, but how do you know when they get funding?
50

51
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,570
All right, but how do you know when they get funding?
51

52
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,530
Where are you supposed to put your ear to the ground for this?
52

53
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,030
Well, actually it's pretty easy.
53

54
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,950
Generally, when companies get funded, there's a web site that keeps track of all of that for us and it's incredibly useful.
54

55
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,780
Generally, when companies get funded, there's a web site that keeps track of all of that for us and it's incredibly useful.
55

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,880
It's called Crunchbase. So let's check it out.
56

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,330
It's called Crunchbase. So let's check it out.
57

58
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,760
This is what Crunchbase looks like, just crunchbase.com.
58

59
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,670
All they do is keep track of how much money people have raised.
59

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,020
Oh my God, WeWork raised $430 million dollars. That's insane.
60

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,070
Oh my God, WeWork raised $430 million dollars. That's insane.
61

62
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,530
Sorry, and back to what we were talking about.
62

63
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,410
Sorry, and back to what we were talking about.
63

64
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,660
All you have to do is search up here for
the organization that you're trying to keep tabs on.
64

65
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,240
Let's say I worked for Spotify - sorry again, Cole -
and I wanted to keep track of SoundCloud.
65

66
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,850
SoundCloud, honestly, is the least of their worries,
I'd be more worried about Apple Music.
66

67
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,140
But let's say that we wanted to keep tabs on them.
67

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,340
Right here we can see information about them,
all of this stuff is really nice.
68

69
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,410
But the most important thing is it gives us
a timeline of their funding right here.
69

70
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:35,490
So not only can we get historical information,
we can also see when this gets updated, and that'll tell
70

71
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,020
us that they just received a new round of funding.
71

72
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,040
So how do I get notified when this happens?
72

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,150
Well, it's pretty easy. You just hit follow, and then it'll ask you
to create an account, do that, and then you'll get
73

74
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,110
emails directly to your inbox every time something major happens with your competitors, specifically their funding.
74

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,990
emails directly to your inbox every time something major happens with your competitors, specifically their funding.
75

76
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,610
There you go.
76

77
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,490
Another thing that Crunchbase is really,
really helpful for happens to be our
77

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,870
number two thing that we want to look out for, and that is acquisitions. Acquisitions, if you're not familiar,
78

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,120
is when a company buys another company.
79

80
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,060
Imagine a really big fish and a really small fish
and then the big fish eats the small fish,
80

81
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,260
except in this scenario that small fish actually attaches to the big fish and makes it larger, kind of like the angler fish.
81

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,320
except in this scenario that small fish actually attaches to the big fish and makes it larger, kind of like the angler fish.
82

83
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,530
I know that's random, but look it up,
it's the creepiest thing in the world.
83

84
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,830
When a company buys another company, they're doing it for a number of reasons, and it usually comes down
84

85
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,130
to the five reasons that we care about.
85

86
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,500
Oftentimes, companies will buy another company because they have a good product team and they want to
86

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,800
integrate that into their own team.
87

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,510
Sometimes they want to buy a company because they have a lot of users and they would like to integrate
88

89
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,640
those users into their own user base or at least cross sell them information or gather information on their users.
89

90
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,470
those users into their own user base or at least cross sell them information or gather information on their users.
90

91
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,050
Either way, bad for you.
91

92
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,780
They could also buy them because of design.
92

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,500
There are examples of companies that have bought other companies to absorb their design team. Remember
93

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,970
how we talked about Path?
Path got bought for pretty much that reason.
94

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,260
Now, the only two things that doesn't necessarily affect are brand unless acquisitions are prestigious, I mean, 
95

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,970
they kind of are, or speed. Speed is tough.
96

97
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,530
they kind of are, or speed. Speed is tough.
97

98
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,740
Oftentimes, companies will buy another company because that company seems to get stuff done really quickly.
98

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,070
Oftentimes, companies will buy another company because that company seems to get stuff done really quickly.
99

100
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:38,260
But you kind of run into a problem where larger organizations as a whole, as they get larger and larger, get slower and slower.
100

101
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,790
But you kind of run into a problem where larger organizations as a whole, as they get larger and larger, get slower and slower.
101

102
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,450
So it's... I don't know, it's kind of a wash.
102

103
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,130
How we find acquisitions is you just go up here
and they'll list it right at the top. Click it and it will
103

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,480
take us to a page that gives us all their acquisitions,
gives us the date, we can actually click through
104

105
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,480
and read about the company if we want to.
105

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,870
And since we're already following it, we will get an update.
It will even give us the terms of it. That's pretty cool.
106

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
And since we're already following it, we will get an update.
It will even give us the terms of it. That's pretty cool.
107

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,550
And the last event that we really care about are
feature or new product launches. Why?
108

109
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,120
And the last event that we really care about are
feature or new product launches. Why?
109

110
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,880
Well, because those are major maneuvers that your competitors are making and you absolutely have to know
110

111
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:26,080
if they're doing it, especially if they make a product or a new feature that is in some way competing directly with you or copying you.
111

112
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,210
if they're doing it, especially if they make a product or a new feature that is in some way competing directly with you or copying you.
112

113
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,800
The best way of keeping tabs on that and a number of other things is a web site called Mention.com.
113

114
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:33,810
The best way of keeping tabs on that and a number of other things is a web site called Mention.com.
114

115
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,650
Now, it's not free, but it is incredibly useful and it has a free trial,
115

116
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:46,450
more importantly. What mention.com does is it tracks all of your competitors' social media accounts
116

117
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:55,870
it looks at chatter between customers and the company,
it looks for major updates on the company's blogs,
117

118
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:55,950
it looks at chatter between customers and the company,
it looks for major updates on the company's blogs,
118

119
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:03,220
any large seismic shifts, they will email you, and you can even
set your preferences to tell it how often
119

120
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,560
to email you: only e-mail you when big things happen,
or email me any time anything moves at all.
120

121
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,620
Let's check out Mention really quickly.
121

122
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,600
Sign up, it's free, and then you can create your first alert.
122

123
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,350
So all you want to do is tell it what you're trying to
train their listening system to.
123

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,260
So we're looking for a competitor.
124

125
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,700
Tell them the name of your competitor, let's say SoundCloud.
125

126
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,550
There we go.
126

127
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,350
And move on to the next step.
127

128
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,780
Here we can set our priorities, what we care about the most.
128

129
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,340
If you're more concerned about what they say in their social channels, you can make sure to listen to 
129

130
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,180
that more, add more of them.
130

131
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,810
But we're just looking for feature changes, product launches, so when those happen it's going be a seismic shift.
131

132
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,190
But we're just looking for feature changes, product launches, so when those happen it's going be a seismic shift.
132

133
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,520
They're gonna have a blog post about it,
133

134
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,450
they're going to have a Twitter post,
and probably a Facebook post as well.
134

135
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
You'll get one of them.
135

136
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,700
So just move on.
136

137
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,280
You can pick all you want to pull in.
137

138
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,440
This is incredibly useful, the news setting. Why?
138

139
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,780
This is incredibly useful, the news setting. Why?
139

140
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:06,520
Because a lot of times you might not see the feature launch, but news will pick up on it or news will
140

141
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,430
pick up on it way before it launches.
That's really helpful.
141

142
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,290
pick up on it way before it launches.
That's really helpful.
142

143
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,660
Also for tracking things like perception, which affect their brand.
Move on to check out your results, we're almost done.

144
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,720

144

145
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,930
And there we go. Our account is already set up.
145

146
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,450
And there we go. Our account is already set up.
146

147
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,570
Look, we have 76 new mentions for the alert SoundCloud. Alright, so I went out and gathered quite a lot of
147

148
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,350
information about SoundCloud, it's going back in time.
148

149
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,220
If I wanted to look at the mentions, I would just go here, and then I can just scroll down this feed and
149

150
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,440
I can check it out. Here I can search and I can filter through it.
150

151
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:46,480
There are a lot of really cool tools for picking out
the signal in the noise, so to speak. You can set
151

152
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,450
things like keywords you're looking for, or even exclude keywords, so certain things don't ever show up in your feed.
152

153
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
things like keywords you're looking for, or even exclude keywords, so certain things don't ever show up in your feed.
153

154
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,780
You can also, in your settings, change how often they email you and what type of interactions they consider
154

155
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,990
important and will notify you about.
155

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,580
All right, cool. Mention is a very powerful tool.
156

157
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,300
All right, cool. Mention is a very powerful tool.
157

158
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,070
Check out what you can use it for, you can find
a million and one things you can do with it.
158

159
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,530
This is fantastic for figuring out when they get money, when they get acquisitions, and when they launch
159

160
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,740
new things. And the last thing we're going to cover is Google Alerts. Google Alerts is not as powerful as Mention,
160

161
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,270
but it's a broader blanket.
161

162
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,980
All you have to do is type in the company name that you want to stock and what it's going to do.
162

163
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:37,370
It's going to frequently e-mail you and notify you,
if you want to do desktop notifications, any time
163

164
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,770
new search results show up for your competitor.
164

165
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,190
That is the broadest sweep you can use.
165

166
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:51,000
Incredibly useful though to see how their CEO changes,
to see how anything is popping up, conversations,
166

167
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,460
things way out there you might not have seen,
all this information - really helpful.
167

168
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,470
All right, guys, keep track of your competitors,
because if you don't, they might get out of your sights
168

169
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,740
and they'll come back to bite you later.
169

170
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,230
All right. See you in the next lecture.
170

171
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,470
All right. See you in the next lecture.
