Hey everyone, what's up?
Now we're going to talk about roadmapping.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,360
Hey everyone, what's up?
Now we're going to talk about roadmapping.

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,810
Hey everyone, what's up?
Now we're going to talk about roadmapping.
3

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,170
Okay, I'm sorry in advance, but I'm not going to actually
show you a real life roadmap right now, and there's
4

5
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,160
Okay, I'm sorry in advance, but I'm not going to actually
show you a real life roadmap right now, and there's
5

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,360
a good reason behind it. This is because every company you go to, every single company out there does roadmapping differently.
6

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,000
a good reason behind it. This is because every company you go to, every single company out there does roadmapping differently.
7

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,530
Furthermore, roadmaps are always, if not
mostly always, just inaccurate.
8

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,940
So we know about how Agile works.
9

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,080
So from what we know there, can we
think about why roadmaps are inaccurate?
10

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,590
Because if you're doing things in Agile fashion,
do you think you're going to be able to predict, you
11

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,870
know, three to four months out what we're
going to be doing at that point?
12

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,940
The whole purpose of Agile is to say that we're going
to try some stuff right around this period of time,
13

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,270
The whole purpose of Agile is to say that we're going
to try some stuff right around this period of time,
14

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,820
this is what's coming next for sure, because it's a big user problem,
15

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,030
we're going to try to solve it, but we may solve it now with this initiative, or maybe we don't and we get rid of that,
16

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,710
we're going to try to solve it, but we may solve it now with this initiative, or maybe we don't and we get rid of that,
17

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,230
we do something else to solve that,
so these things can shift around.
18

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,210
we do something else to solve that,
so these things can shift around.
19

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,490
So if you ever see roadmaps that say "In quarter one
we're doing this, in quarter two we're doing this,
20

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,750
in quarter three, this is what we're doing,"
21

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,340
in quarter three, this is what we're doing,"
22

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:22,500
It's okay to have those things as a general guide, in
terms of what might be coming, in what parts of the
23

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,930
year, the first half, the second half of the year, as a general guide,
24

25
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,250
but it's not going to be accurate down to the date that you say it is,
25

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,550
and if it is, then you are not being Agile.
26

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,140
So why do you ever see roadmaps that are like "In Q1
we're doing this, in Q2 we're doing this, in Q3 we're
27

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,530
doing this"? It's because, well, for a couple of reasons.
One, executives, and other departments, and investors,
28

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,710
they like to see these sorts of things,
29

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,430
but the good ones will realize that stuff that's like,
three quarters out there is not going to be accurate
30

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,480
but the good ones will realize that stuff that's like,
three quarters out there is not going to be accurate
31

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,030
if you're being Agile, right? It could be that it takes us
a whole quarter to figure out one problem through
32

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,170
a bunch of different user tests and solutions,
and it moves stuff back.
33

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,410
Or it could be that something becomes a non-problem,
maybe we were going to build something to compete
34

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,360
with another company and that company
goes away, or they go bankrupt.
35

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,900
Oh okay, now we don't have to do that anymore.
36

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,380
Oh okay, now we don't have to do that anymore.
37

38
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:23,370
The second reason you sometimes see these roadmaps
that are, you know, Q1, Q2, Q3, that sort of thing, is
38

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,670
because sometimes, and especially in business to business
companies, you actually are going to be against
39

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,070
an actual real world deadline.
40

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,610
So large companies will do this a lot because they
have investors that say that they have to have a
41

42
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:45,660
certain thing, certain functionality to compete with
somebody, done by a certain date, or maybe you're at
42

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,780
a software as a service company, and your salespeople
sell a new feature that you haven't built yet to
43

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,480
a customer, and the customer is like,
"We need this by, you know, February."
44

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,370
So, at that point, you can put something like that on
a time based roadmap, and you've got to stick to
45

46
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,260
it, you've got to figure out how you can do it before that time.
46

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,860
But I just want to let you know that these types of roadmaps are generally inaccurate, but it's okay to still look at them,
47

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,790
But I just want to let you know that these types of roadmaps are generally inaccurate, but it's okay to still look at them,
48

49
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,350
just keep in mind that they're inaccurate.
49

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,490
So what's the alternative, like what do we do instead?
50

51
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,660
Well, what a lot of product managers do and a lot
of development teams do out there is they
51

52
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,330
just basically sort things into kind of priorities,
it's like "Here's what we're doing now,"
52

53
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,970
they'll have, like, a column and then, "Okay,
53

54
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,730
this is now, that's what we're doing immediately, in the next
few weeks and next month," and then they have another column
54

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,090
that's like mid-term,
55

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,260
"So here's the stuff we're going to do after that,"
and then they'll have another bucket that's called long term,
56

57
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,430
"So here's the stuff we're going to do after that,"
and then they'll have another bucket that's called long term,
57

58
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,130
and "This is stuff that we want to get to eventually,
but it's not a huge priority right now."
58

59
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:53,940
So those three columns, the near term, mid-term, long term,
are usually pretty helpful because it intentionally
59

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,900
doesn't say any particular dates on there and it keeps everyone
in line by not expecting things by a certain date.
60

61
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,770
doesn't say any particular dates on there and it keeps everyone
in line by not expecting things by a certain date.
61

62
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:08,010
This three bucket model is something you're going to find
a lot at consumer tech companies, especially ones
62

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,000
that have the luxury of building products that, where they don't really have any deadlines, like Google and Facebook.
63

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,030
that have the luxury of building products that, where they don't really have any deadlines, like Google and Facebook.
64

65
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,710
They - and even, like, Twitter - they're not really
having any financial trouble, so they can really take
65

66
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,980
as long or as little time as they want to do something,
they don't really have to put it into a certain
66

67
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,580
quarter, or a certain date, or a certain month.
67

68
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,030
So you'll see a lot of these things at the
really big money high tech companies.
68

69
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,910
So that's what I wanted to mention about roadmapping.
69

70
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,630
Don't worry, I really put plenty of resource guides and
articles to read about roadmapping, because you do
70

71
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,780
need to understand the ins and outs around it,
71

72
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,560
but those are the two major things about roadmapping.
72

73
00:04:51,570 --> 00:05:00,180
One, the quarterly or monthly roadmaps are okay to
make and show as long as you are on the same page
73

74
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,820
as everyone else and you're telling people, like,
"Look, this stuff may change."
74

75
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:11,760
And then two, the more appropriate way or the more
product management, or lean way, or Agile way is to do
75

76
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,780
sort of a near term, mid-term, and long term bucket.
76

77
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,070
All right everyone, I'll catch you in the next lecture.
