00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.610
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.380
So, now that we have a list of some dumb competitors,
we now need to talk a little bit more about how we
2

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.170
can chop this list up and better strategize.
3

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.990
Now, there are a lot of different shades of competitors out there.
4

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.310
There is the wimpy, not trying very hard competitor,
you might have a, let's say, scatterbrain and
5

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.310
doing everything competitor, and you might have a big scary competitor that is looking straight at you.
6

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.910
doing everything competitor, and you might have a big scary competitor that is looking straight at you.
7

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.890
We need to sort these beasts out
so we don't have a cluttered mess of threats.
8

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.420
Don't be Chicken Little, the sky is not falling.
9

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.820
In order to do that effectively and be effective as a product manager we need to introduce the four different types of competitors.
10

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.070
In order to do that effectively and be effective as a product manager we need to introduce the four different types of competitors.
11

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.560
Now, if you have an MBA, good for you. Skip this lecture.
12

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.470
Now, if you have an MBA, good for you. Skip this lecture.
13

14
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.950
Now, if you have an MBA, good for you. Skip this lecture.
14

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.340
But if you do not, I think you should stay in
because you'll learn something.
15

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.520
There are four different types of competitors.
16

17
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.770
There's direct competitors, indirect, potential, and substitute.
In order to explain the four, let's use a terrible metaphor.
17

18
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990
There's direct competitors, indirect, potential, and substitute.
In order to explain the four, let's use a terrible metaphor.
18

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.870
Now, let's just imagine that you are running a restaurant that serves Italian food, and specifically you like to sell the tortellini.
19

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.090
Now, let's just imagine that you are running a restaurant that serves Italian food, and specifically you like to sell the tortellini.
20

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.460
Tortellini is the pasta that has like cheese and meat
inside of a thing of pasta.
21

22
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.870
I'm not really an expert in this.
22

23
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.730
Now, direct competitors are competitors that are not only going after the same target customer group as you are,
23

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.360
Now, direct competitors are competitors that are not only going after the same target customer group as you are,
24

25
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.550
they're also trying to solve the same problem
25

26
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.610
you are. Now, direct competitors usually have very similar
solutions and users are often going to have
26

27
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.460
to make a direct and conscious decision between using your product and using the competitor's product.
27

28
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.860
In the restaurant metaphor,
28

29
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.440
these are the guys that are literally across the street from you serving Italian food in a fancy dining
29

30
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.720
atmosphere as you, with the same price range,
30

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.920
atmosphere as you, with the same price range,
31

32
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.750
oh and also they specialize in tortellini. Now, indirect  competitors are competitors that solve the same problem,
32

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.830
oh and also they specialize in tortellini. Now, indirect  competitors are competitors that solve the same problem,
33

34
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.790
but generally in a different way and for a different
target customer group. They could be serving a smaller
34

35
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.690
subset within your target customer group or they might include your target customer group but they have a much larger market,
35

36
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.610
subset within your target customer group or they might include your target customer group but they have a much larger market,
36

37
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.480
it just so happens to also address your group.
37

38
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.430
They could also be targeting entirely different verticals or sectors.
In the restaurant metaphor,
38

39
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.580
this is the restaurant that's in a different neighborhood that serves Greek food that people often confuse for Italian food.
39

40
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.570
this is the restaurant that's in a different neighborhood that serves Greek food that people often confuse for Italian food.
40

41
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.990
Now, the third type of competitor, potential competitors, are competitors that offer something to the same
41

42
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.220
target customer group or a similar target customer group,
but they don't address the same problem you
42

43
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.890
do, or they don't have anything remotely
in the same product line as you. I also like to refer to
43

44
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.010
these as peripheral competitors, because you like to keep them in your periphery, because they're worth keeping tabs on.
44

45
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.030
these as peripheral competitors, because you like to keep them in your periphery, because they're worth keeping tabs on.
45

46
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.240
These are the metaphorical dolphins in your tuna net.
You were looking for tuna, but you got some
46

47
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.120
dolphin in there. In the restaurant metaphor,
this would be like an Italian grocery store.
47

48
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.880
They don't serve hot meals on location, but they could
foreseeably add chairs and a restaurant function.
48

49
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.060
They don't serve hot meals on location, but they could
foreseeably add chairs and a restaurant function.
49

50
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.970
Now, the last one, our substitute competitors.
What exactly is a substitute?
50

51
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.430
Now, the last one, our substitute competitors.
What exactly is a substitute?
51

52
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.930
It's a product that solves the same core problem but it's not angled or delivered in even remotely the same way.
52

53
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.840
It's a product that solves the same core problem but it's not angled or delivered in even remotely the same way.
53

54
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.740
It also doesn't generally target the same people.
54

55
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.670
Now, with an Italian restaurant, you're probably targeting people who want to go out to eat,
55

56
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.720
want Italian food, and are also hungry.
Now, a substitute might be
56

57
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.040
DiGiorno's pizza. It solves the core problem,
which is you're hungry, you want Italian food,
57

58
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.450
technically, but it's not going out to eat.
58

59
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.090
It's not even remotely anything like it,
59

60
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.220
but you could substitute it for going out to eat.
60

61
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.390
Now, how this relates to what we're doing in this section?
Well, it's actually rather obvious. Go back to your list.
61

62
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.140
Now, how this relates to what we're doing in this section?
Well, it's actually rather obvious. Go back to your list.
62

63
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.770
Now, remember, in the last lecture I was using GoPro, so I made my own list of competing products for
63

64
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.770
GoPro before we had it in known and unknown.
64

65
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.460
Now, what I'm going to suggest is you actually get rid of those and instead list off each one based off of
65

66
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.570
the four different types that I've suggested to you.
66

67
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.910
Are they a direct competitor, an indirect,
a potential, or a substitute competitor?
67

68
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.210
Once you have that, then what you can do is you can prioritize in your head and have a much cleaner idea
68

69
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.640
of what the competitive landscape looks like.
69

70
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.810
Put at the top direct competitors,
70

71
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.070
we are the most concerned with those, put below those indirect competitors, because we are also interested
71

72
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.390
in what they're doing, not as much as the direct,
72

73
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.330
then we look at potential competitors
and the last one is substitute competitors.
73

74
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.820
Now, the reason why you want to rank these in kind of a tier system, Tier 1 - direct, Tier 2 - indirect, Tier
74

75
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.750
3 - potential, Tier 4 - substitute, is that Tier 1s are the ones that we're concerned the most about,
75

76
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.030
3 - potential, Tier 4 - substitute, is that Tier 1s are the ones that we're concerned the most about,
76

77
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.610
but also we need to make sure that our product offerings
are as competitive as possible to those.
77

78
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.380
Do we care whether or not our product or feature is competitive to the other three? Yes, but not as much
78

79
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.820
as the direct. The substitutes, we need to at least make sure that we are a viable alternative to, potentials,
79

80
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.690
we need to make sure that our product offering is something they can't themselves do easily, and indirect,
80

81
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.020
we need to make sure that our product offering is something they can't themselves do easily, and indirect,
81

82
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.650
we, again, just need to make sure that we're not losing
too many customers to them.
82

83
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.690
And there you go. That's what that would look like
under the four different categories.
83

84
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.030
That's a lot easier to understand.
84

85
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.630
Now you could direct your attention to the ones that actually matter.
85

86
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.620
All you have to do is dig into them and see exactly what they do.
86

87
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:56.580
These up here in the direct category do almost the exact same thing as a GoPro Hero 4. In the indirect category
87

88
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.030
we have things like the CyberShot and the PowerShot, which were cameras that could be used as action cameras.
88

89
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.990
we have things like the CyberShot and the PowerShot, which were cameras that could be used as action cameras.
89

90
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.720
In fact, they're used for moving objects and they do solve that problem but they're not for the same people.
90

91
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.170
In fact, they're used for moving objects and they do solve that problem but they're not for the same people.
91

92
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.920
They're targeted for people who want to take videos of their kids' tennis match or track and field match,
92

93
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.520
not strapping it to their head and jumping out of a plane.
93

94
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.570
We also see things like the Vievu, which I thought was a GoPro direct competitor, it turns out it's not.
94

95
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.670
We also see things like the Vievu, which I thought was a GoPro direct competitor, it turns out it's not.
95

96
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.220
It's a body camera for police officers.
96

97
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:38.160
So, same problem, need to shoot things in action settings that are small and portable, but not the same people.
97

98
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.780
So, same problem, need to shoot things in action settings that are small and portable, but not the same people.
98

99
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.040
And then there are a couple other ones. Under potential I put the Eyeshot 360, which I realize actually
99

100
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.670
is a Wi-Fi enabled camera and they target it primarily for surveillance means, like putting on your dash
100

101
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.030
and recording, or putting it in your apartment
and recording - not the same problem,
101

102
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.720
not really the same people, but they have
the same expertise, the same general area,
102

103
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.410
they could be a potential competitor. And the last one is a substitute, which is Opteka, which I didn't
103

104
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.750
realize was not a competitor, it's actually a grip handle that you can put other cameras on and then use it like an action camera.
104

105
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.390
realize was not a competitor, it's actually a grip handle that you can put other cameras on and then use it like an action camera.
105

106
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.000
So that would be a substitute.
106

107
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.800
They could use it, but it doesn't
solve the problem at all the same way.
107

108
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.140
Ok, guys. Questions, concerns, post in the group discussion,
108

109
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.690
otherwise we're moving on to more analysis
of how to judge your competitors.
