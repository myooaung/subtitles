Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,570
Once you've prepared to look for product management
jobs, and you've got that good online brand, and you
2

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,750
think you can point to some relevant experience, you
have to know where to go to look for the jobs, and
3

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,270
really what you want to be looking for. In this lecture,
4

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,950
we're going to talk about three things: one, looking at your own company, two, networking, and three, looking online.
5

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,790
we're going to talk about three things: one, looking at your own company, two, networking, and three, looking online.
6

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,530
Firstly, it's important to understand that if you're really
serious about getting into product management,
7

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,620
then the best place by far that you can look
for a job is in your own company.
8

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,490
Trust me on that.
9

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,150
It's so much easier to move internally than it is to get a new job
as a product manager with no previous experience.
10

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,820
It's so much easier to move internally than it is to get a new job
as a product manager with no previous experience.
11

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,450
If you already have a product management team at your
office or your company, ask to shadow some product
12

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,840
managers in meetings to learn more about what they're
working on. What you should do here is demonstrate
13

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,900
that you're interested in helping them out and offer to
do some work in your spare time for their team.
14

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,110
that you're interested in helping them out and offer to
do some work in your spare time for their team.
15

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,840
The goal here is to learn as much as you can.
16

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,780
If you don't have a product team already at your company,
then you can still start offering to do tasks
17

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,810
and projects that will add to your product manager resume,
18

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,850
things like prioritization of initiatives, technical implementations, user interviews and research, and that kind of thing.

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,690
things like prioritization of initiatives, technical implementations, user interviews and research, and that kind of thing.
20

21
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:34,290
Secondly, it's very common for people to get jobs based
off of references rather than just applying to them.

22
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:34,760
Secondly, it's very common for people to get jobs based
off of references rather than just applying to them.
22

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,040
This is the case with every type of job,
23

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,720
but so much more so for product management.
24

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,690
But in order to get references, you need to meet
people in the product management industry.
25

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,490
For that, I recommend you go to web sites like meetup.com
and look for product management or product
26

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,610
strategy meetups in your area.
27

28
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,990
You can go to these events, you can talk to people that
are product managers, you can find out who's hiring,
28

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,660
and maybe even meet somebody who would be willing
to provide you a reference for a job, or tell you about
29

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,470
an opening. Outside of finding product
management jobs through networking,
30

31
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,440
there's a few places I recommend you look online.
31

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,770
Number one, go to angellist.com, which has a big
focus on Silicon Valley tech companies, and look
32

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,110
for product management jobs.
33

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,240
Number two, go to Hacker News, and they have a tech,
34

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,150
it's a technology message board, basically, and you can
Google it or you can search on their site, because
35

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,860
they have a monthly thread called "Ask HN: Who is Hiring?"
36

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,200
Just Google it and you'll find the threads that I'm talking about.
37

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,800
They do this every month, and it's just full of
openings for product management positions.
38

39
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,050
The third place I would recommend is do a search on
Facebook for any local Facebook groups around your
39

40
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,200
city that involve any type of job,
but especially product or technology jobs.
40

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,910
These are really good to browse through and something
good to keep your eye on in case some listings come up.
41

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,540
These are really good to browse through and something
good to keep your eye on in case some listings come up.
42

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,740
I've seen a lot of product jobs go through
these types of groups.
43

44
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,050
Number four is mailing lists, and there
are some good ones out there.
44

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,960
I recommend a mailing list by a guy named Ken Norton.
45

46
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,300
You can go to kennorton.com, It's K-E-N-N-O-R-T-O-N,
46

47
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,860
and he's a really well-known product manager.
47

48
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,000
He has a great little newsletter, but he always
has job postings at the end of each e-mail.
48

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,010
Alright, so those are some tips on where to look for your
product management job if you're looking to get one.

50
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,660
Alright, so those are some tips on where to look for your
product management job if you're looking to get one.
50

51
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,340
And in the next lecture I'm going to give you a little
bit more inside advice on how to go about your
51

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,710
product management job hunt.
52

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,750
I'll see you there.
