00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.070
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.690
Hey, I totally lied at the end of the last lecture.
2

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.090
We're actually just going to jump in and start working
with a real example and then go over what are
3

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.190
some example assumptions that we can think of for this product.
4

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.510
Yes, I know, I lied, you will get over it, I'm over it already, let's start.
5

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.540
All right, so for our example we're going to use a service that is somewhat well-known in the San Francisco Bay area.
6

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.910
All right, so for our example we're going to use a service that is somewhat well-known in the San Francisco Bay area.
7

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.150
It's not really outside of New York and San Francisco, I think,
right now it might be in Chicago and Boston,
8

9
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.410
but it's enough of an idea that's a little bit out there that we can come up with some assumptions relatively easily.
9

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.590
but it's enough of an idea that's a little bit out there that we can come up with some assumptions relatively easily.
10

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.440
It's a good example to use. So the example is called Zirx,
Z-I-R-X, and what they do is they build
11

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.280
a mobile app that allows you, when you are driving your car,
to hail an on demand valet person who picks
12

13
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.260
up your car, and then takes it to storage, and then
you can request your car back at any time.
13

14
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.850
So, basically, what they're trying to do is on demand valet
and the idea is that if you're driving, let's
14

15
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.360
say, downtown, you're going out to eat, you have a car.
In any big city, parking is just a disaster.
15

16
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.060
And garages are typically inconvenient, they're hard to get into, they're hard to find, especially when
16

17
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.500
you're trying to do 100 different things at once,
and they're expensive.
17

18
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.430
you're trying to do 100 different things at once,
and they're expensive.
18

19
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.240
So for all the same reasons you would use a valet,
you would use an on demand valet.
19

20
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.750
But the advantage of being an on demand valet is that I can call a valet person and they can take that car literally anywhere.
20

21
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870
But the advantage of being an on demand valet is that I can call a valet person and they can take that car literally anywhere.
21

22
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.850
They don't have to park it in a garage near me.
22

23
00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.180
They can take it out to the suburbs, where it costs
nothing to store, and then all I have to do is just
23

24
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.710
tell them a little bit before when I need it,
and it works the exact same way.
24

25
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.640
It's an interesting service.
25

26
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.900
Check it out if you guys are ever in San Francisco,
and have a car, and want to do it.
26

27
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.820
They have a lot of funding, and they are launching
in a lot of different cities, and they have a lot of
27

28
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.170
competitors, mainly copycats.
28

29
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.400
There's one called Lux and there's one called Carbon.
29

30
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.130
So get familiar with them,
because we're going to do some assumptions.
30

31
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.820
Now, the core problem-solution set for Zirx is,
the problem is that it's hard to park your car
31

32
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:39.440
in big cities and/or it's hard to find garages,
which are inconvenient and expensive.
32

33
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.460
And then the solution to that is by using flexible
on demand valets through a mobile application to
33

34
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.240
take advantage of technology for speed and for proximity
so they can save money on the storage costs.
34

35
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.450
take advantage of technology for speed and for proximity
so they can save money on the storage costs.
35

36
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.890
All right, so we're building that product.
What did we assume?
36

37
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.310
All right, so we're building that product.
What did we assume?
37

38
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.980
Well, a whole lot. Pretty much every sentence I said to you
about why they work or why they're appealing,
38

39
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.960
which is loaded with assumptions.
39

40
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.510
Now, let's use the technique that we learned before
and say "The following must be true
40

41
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.370
in order for our idea to be successful." So what has to be true? Well, we'll start off with one of the more obvious ones.
41

42
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.960
in order for our idea to be successful." So what has to be true? Well, we'll start off with one of the more obvious ones.
42

43
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.680
Remember how I said that parking is hard to find in big cities?
43

44
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.190
That's an assumption. I do not know that
for an absolute fact, so I'm going to write that out.
44

45
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.370
Parking is bad or difficult in big cities.
45

46
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.280
Maybe it's the case that people don't find parking to be an issue.
46

47
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.650
Or maybe most cities don't have this issue.
47

48
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.390
So what are some other examples that we can think of?
Well, let's use those examples that we learned in the last lecture.
48

49
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.940
So what are some other examples that we can think of?
Well, let's use those examples that we learned in the last lecture.
49

50
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.000
Well, most times we're making assumptions about the problem
we think we're solving. so remember how I said
50

51
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.840
that people find parking garages inconvenient?
51

52
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.000
That is an assumption.
52

53
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.630
Do people really find them inconvenient?
53

54
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.950
It could be the case that people have no issue
with them. They're everywhere.
54

55
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.780
It could be the case that people have no issue
with them. They're everywhere.
55

56
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.960
They're easy to spot, they have signs, and maybe those guys who twirl their signs in the middle of the road, or whatever.
56

57
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.010
They're easy to spot, they have signs, and maybe those guys who twirl their signs in the middle of the road, or whatever.
57

58
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.700
The corollary to that was that people find them expensive, right?
58

59
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.660
The corollary to that was that people find them expensive, right?
59

60
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.060
I said that, you know, there's a cost advantage
by using an on demand valet system.
60

61
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.790
But do people really think the alternative,
which are garages, are too expensive?
61

62
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.250
It might be the case that people who use garages are used to those prices and so they don't actually think of it as a problem.
62

63
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.780
It might be the case that people who use garages are used to those prices and so they don't actually think of it as a problem.
63

64
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.430
Let's move on to the other one. What are things we are
assuming that matter to our potential user?
64

65
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.000
Well, I mean, think about the value proposition of this app, right?
65

66
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.860
We're trying to save the money and make it more convenient. Those are the two biggest things.
66

67
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.750
We're trying to save the money and make it more convenient. Those are the two biggest things.
67

68
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.390
So we're kind of assuming that someone who is driving
their car downtown and wants to park it for dinner,
68

69
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.110
or work, or whatever, cares about price and convenience, and we're also assuming that they don't really care about speed, right?
69

70
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.170
or work, or whatever, cares about price and convenience, and we're also assuming that they don't really care about speed, right?
70

71
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.560
or work, or whatever, cares about price and convenience, and we're also assuming that they don't really care about speed, right?
71

72
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.840
Because if we're using the on demand system, it might actually be slower than if you're using a garage where you know where it is
72

73
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.780
Because if we're using the on demand system, it might actually be slower than if you're using a garage where you know where it is
73

74
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.030
or a valet service that's already embedded into the
restaurant you're going to. Now, there aren't any
74

75
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.770
satisfactory substitutes. Well, we kind of already
addressed it when we said parking on the street is
75

76
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.230
a substitute, or parking in a garage is a substitute,
but we could just say that people are not satisfied with
76

77
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.230
parking their car in a garage.
77

78
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.700
Now, let's think about some things that
we're assuming about the market.
78

79
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.530
We're assuming that the market that we're going to be able to serve, let's say, has enough drivers with smartphones.
79

80
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.620
That is actually an important assumption. If you're
going into a market, you're building a smartphone app,
80

81
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.350
and the vast majority of people don't have smartphones,
81

82
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.450
then it could potentially be a venture
that's not nearly as lucrative or interesting.
82

83
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.540
We're also assuming in a weird way that the driver can operate
the smartphone while they're driving the car, right?
83

84
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.090
We're also assuming in a weird way that the driver can operate
the smartphone while they're driving the car, right?
84

85
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.170
I mean, texting and driving is terrible, but I can't even
imagine what it's like trying to place a pin
85

86
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.210
on the phone while you're, like, navigating traffic because
you're downtown. So it might be the case that,
86

87
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.550
you know, everyone who uses this
service has someone else in the car.
87

88
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.270
Maybe solo drivers - not a great idea.
88

89
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.760
Another area that we're making assumptions about
actually is the other side of the market, right?
89

90
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.760
We have to hire people to be the valets.
90

91
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.160
So we're actually assuming that people
want to be on demand valets.
91

92
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.780
And then the last thing I would say is just trust and safety.
92

93
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.650
We are assuming that people are going to be comfortable
giving their car to what they call a Zirx
93

94
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.730
agent. Seriously, Zirx - terrible, terrible name,
but interesting service.
94

95
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.890
agent. Seriously, Zirx - terrible, terrible name,
but interesting service.
95

96
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.520
All right guys, so we've got 10 assumptions right there.
96

97
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.990
Those are all big ones. If you guys have
any other ones you want to add,
97

98
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.530
post actually in the group discussion, tell me which ones I left out,
98

99
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.780
and if you disagree with some of these being assumptions,
I would love to hear it.
99

100
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.570
We can fight it out and then we'll see who's right.
100

101
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.890
All right, so in the next lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to take these assumptions and organize them by risk.
101

102
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.650
All right, so in the next lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to take these assumptions and organize them by risk.
102

103
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.200
All right, see you in the next lecture.
