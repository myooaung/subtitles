Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:10,500
Let's talk a little bit about startups or pre-product
situations and how this process differs for
2

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,430
calculating your minimum criteria for success.
3

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,930
Now, when you're running the show with an existing product,
an existing user base, and potentially existing
4

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:27,150
revenue, you're going to be, one, more concerned
with certain metrics, and two, less sensitive to certain
5

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,750
types of risks and certain types of costs.
6

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:38,250
PMs at a big company generally care about metrics
that are just not of concern to entrepreneurs or people
7

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,480
who are trying to figure out whether or not
their product should exist in the first place.
8

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,530
Average minutes consumed is not very important
if you have zero customers and you're only getting 1%
9

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,730
of your people to even sign up for your service.
10

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,100
Two different worlds. Specifically, in the case of a startup,
you're looking for what we call validation 
11

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,650
metrics - is my product a good idea?
12

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,710
Does it meet a user need?
13

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,230
Does my identified problem really exist?
14

15
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,410
What exactly is a validation metric?
15

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,840
Well, it's something that demonstrates real interest
from your potential customers: percentage of people
16

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,180
that sign up, percentage of people that share your post,
average purchase price,
17

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,980
how many people open your email. 
18

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,400
Those are examples.
19

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,650
You're also more concerned with the
economic viability of the project as a whole.
20

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:37,050
It's hard to justify how much money exactly a feature
will make, but a product is relatively easy, so
21

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,150
we're probably going to look at things like
lifetime value and things like gross margins.
22

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:49,680
So the biggest difference when you're doing this pre-product
it's really going to be the right side of our equation.
23

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,860
So the biggest difference when you're doing this pre-product
it's really going to be the right side of our equation.
24

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,940
Rewards are just going to be different for you.
25

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,840
You're going to be looking for specific things that
signal interest and not necessarily some behavioral
26

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,440
change you expected to happen. You're also not going
to be as concerned with opportunity cost, because
27

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,990
if it fails and you flop, you're probably looking for a new job.
28

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,310
So make sure that you understand the nuance between the two, because, as a product manager, you might find 
29

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,590
yourself in both situations.
30

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,570
All right, so at this point in the process we know
what we want to build Ideally, whether it's a
31

32
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:32,790
product, or a feature, or a big change to the product you
already have, we know what we need to test assumption
32

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,710
wise, and we know what outcome we want to get out of these tests.
33

34
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,460
All right, now let's shift our focus to the ways and the tools that are available to us to get the actual testing job done.
34

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,030
All right, now let's shift our focus to the ways and the tools that are available to us to get the actual testing job done.
35

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,210
When you run MVP experiments, you're always going to
present in some way, shape, or form something
36

37
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,600
that implies your new feature or product is already real
and/or coming very soon.
37

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,480
This obviously is not the case, because internally
we actually haven't decided yet whether or not we
38

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,590
want to build it. Now, the extent to which you need to
fake this in order to get the information you need
39

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,840
is what's going to determine what type of MVP you need.
40

41
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,200
So let's list them out and briefly discuss them.
