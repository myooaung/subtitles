Hey guys, welcome back to the course, and welcome
to the new section. We're going to talk in this section about MVPs.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.710
Hey guys, welcome back to the course, and welcome
to the new section. We're going to talk in this section about MVPs.
2

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.580
First off, we're going to talk about MVPs,
what they mean in definition, and how the lean startup
3

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.020
framework wants us to think about them.
4

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.740
Then, after we're done talking about the theory, we'll talk about how do MVPs get used in actuality by product managers.
5

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.030
Then, after we're done talking about the theory, we'll talk about how do MVPs get used in actuality by product managers.
6

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.930
Now, MVP - if you don't know this - stands for
Minimum Viable Product. The term was originally coined in a
7

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.740
book called The Lean Startup framework written by Eric Ries,
8

9
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.310
and, for the most part, it's extremely popular. Startups
nowadays often follow this religiously, and even
9

10
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.800
big companies have taken a lot of the core concepts
and integrated it into their workflow.
10

11
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.350
All right, let's look at the actual definition of MVP as the book
says it, pull it up on the screen, you guys can read it.
11

12
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.200
All right, let's look at the actual definition of MVP as the book
says it, pull it up on the screen, you guys can read it.
12

13
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.950
.
13

14
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.470
All right, and we're back.
14

15
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.390
That was ridiculous and I'm sorry for how long that definition is.
I don't know why it's so bloated.
15

16
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.340
That was ridiculous and I'm sorry for how long that definition is.
I don't know why it's so bloated.
16

17
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.990
MVP just means the smallest amount of a proposed product
that you can build, push out there, and then
17

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.600
get real feedback from users about
whether or not they are actually interested in it.
18

19
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.110
These are primarily designed to test hypotheses
and test assumptions that you have.
19

20
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.140
Now, if you want to be more accurate you would call an MVP
"an MVP experiment" because, actually, an MVP
20

21
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.400
is a process, not necessarily a thing, and
that process is very much like a science experiment.
21

22
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.040
You'll start with things like assumptions, a hypothesis,
a minimum criteria for success, and then you'll
22

23
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.640
go about testing your hypothesis in a very scientific,
measured way. MVP experiments rely heavily
23

24
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.670
on a concept called "validated learning" and they
draw the distinction between learning and validated
24

25
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.220
learning. Validated learning is anything you learn
from a customer that's done in a test environment,
25

26
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.130
in a way that you know for a fact you're not biasing your customer,
and you're studying them in an environment
26

27
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.160
where they have no undue pressure and they act naturally.
Learning, on the other hand, is just pretty much
27

28
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.610
anything else you do that's not designed like an experiment,
not done well, and you can't trust the results you get from it.
28

29
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.450
anything else you do that's not designed like an experiment,
not done well, and you can't trust the results you get from it.
29

30
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.860
Think of MVPs in the metaphor of walking in a park,
and you're on a path, and you reach a fork in the
30

31
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.860
road, except fork is three different ways you can go,
and you don't know where to go.
31

32
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.290
Why are you doing this?
32

33
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.800
Why do people hike in general? Probably because they love trees.
33

34
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.300
Now, in this metaphor, you have to pick which path to go down.
34

35
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.930
And I'll give you a little bit more information:
right at that intersection,
35

36
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.850
there is a town, and this town has people, and these people
presumably know which path is the right one to take.
36

37
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.880
there is a town, and this town has people, and these people
presumably know which path is the right one to take.
37

38
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.260
So how do you decide?
38

39
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.650
Well, most people would say "Ask someone in the town,"
but actually, with an MVP experiment,
39

40
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.780
you don't want to ask the town's people. Why?
40

41
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.830
Because even if they swear that they know which path it is,
we don't know for 100% certainty that 
41

42
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.730
they have any idea what they're talking about.
42

43
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.700
Can you really trust those town's people
with their quaint way of life?
43

44
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.350
No, you can't, because it's entirely subjective and qualitative.
44

45
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.220
So the only way to actually tell for sure is to walk down
each individual path until you can see enough
45

46
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.750
of the path to know if it's the right direction.
With an MVP experiment,
46

47
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.060
it is the art of walking down those paths, putting in
the minimum amount of effort to get to the point
47

48
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.920
where you can say "Ah, wrong path." If you were going to
build a website that sold shoes online and you weren't
48

49
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.310
sure if people wanted to buy your shoes online,
what would you do?
49

50
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.120
sure if people wanted to buy your shoes online,
what would you do?
50

51
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.820
Would you go all in, build out a fancy website, hire
some people to program, and buy some inventory, which
51

52
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.620
is, this is the equivalent of just sprinting down one path,
or would you try to do the absolute minimum
52

53
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.700
just to figure out first whether or not this is the right path,
and whether or not people want to buy your shoes online?
53

54
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.120
just to figure out first whether or not this is the right path,
and whether or not people want to buy your shoes online?
54

55
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.670
That's actually a classic example of the MVP.
If you guys are familiar with Zappos, the way that they
55

56
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.920
started was exactly what I'm talking about.
56

57
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.880
They wanted to know if people would buy shoes online, and this is back in the day when buying shoes online was kind of crazy,
57

58
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.440
They wanted to know if people would buy shoes online, and this is back in the day when buying shoes online was kind of crazy,
58

59
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.880
so what they did is they made a very basic web site,
they didn't buy any inventory whatsoever,
59

60
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.400
they walked across the street to a shoe store, took photos
of the shoes, and then when people bought them,
60

61
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.290
they physically walked over, bought the shoes, and then shipped them. Once that happened enough, they knew this is the right path,
61

62
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.280
they physically walked over, bought the shoes, and then shipped them. Once that happened enough, they knew this is the right path,
62

63
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.740
they knew that this was validated. Now, a common misconception with MVPs is that an MVP is some sort of
63

64
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.870
prototype, and when I say MVP it means, you know, a really basic version of what you're trying to build, and that's just not the case.
64

65
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.300
prototype, and when I say MVP it means, you know, a really basic version of what you're trying to build, and that's just not the case.
65

66
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.930
MVPs are about idea validation at the end of the day,
and what it takes to get to that point,
66

67
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.220
well, that's your MVP. In most situations, you can
actually get away with not building much of anything.
67

68
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.240
well, that's your MVP. In most situations, you can
actually get away with not building much of anything,
68

69
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.010
just anything you can use to figure out whether or not
people are interested in what you're about to build.
69

70
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.600
just anything you can use to figure out whether or not
people are interested in what you're about to build.
70

71
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.340
The other core reason we make MVPs is that
we use them as a way to mitigate risk.
71

72
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.500
If you had the option of building a big fancy platform
that created forms, or just using a Google Form
72

73
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.490
or a basic platform to validate your idea beforehand,
why wouldn't you go with the faster, cheaper, easier
73

74
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.270
option? By picking that simpler version,
by walking only partway down the path,
74

75
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.700
we save an enormous amount of resources: time resources,
money resources, and things like opportunity cost.
75

76
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.000
we save an enormous amount of resources: time resources,
money resources, and things like opportunity cost.
76

77
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.620
The last thing I'll say about MVPs in the actual lean framework
is that there is a very strong focus
77

78
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.400
on speed, and that's where the mantra of "Fail fast" comes from.
78

79
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:08.040
If you can fail fast and build your MVP experiments,
run them quickly, then you can run more MVP experiments
79

80
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.430
in the same amount of time and collect exponentially more data,
which means that you're more likely
80

81
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.770
to find a product or find a feature that fits, works, and is successful.
81

82
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.470
All right, guys.
82

83
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.250
Maybe that sounds familiar to you, maybe it doesn't.
83

84
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.280
That is the academic way of explaining MVPs.
In the next lecture, we're going to talk more about the
84

85
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.830
relationship between product managers and MVPs.
85

86
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.870
MVPs are different depending on who you are as a product manager and what company you are working for.
86

87
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.350
MVPs are different depending on who you are as a product manager and what company you are working for.
87

88
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.530
Alright. See you guys in the next lecture.
88

89
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.580
Alright. See you guys in the next lecture.
