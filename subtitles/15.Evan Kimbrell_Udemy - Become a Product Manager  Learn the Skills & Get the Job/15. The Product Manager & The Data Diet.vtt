Hey guys, welcome back to the course. This lecture,
we're going to talk about a concept in product management
1

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900
called the data diet.
2

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.040
Now, what do I mean by data diet?
3

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.170
Well, what I mean and what I'm getting at is that when
you are a product manager or an entrepreneur, you
4

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.340
do not make decisions in a vacuum.
5

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.660
You also are not going to make product decisions
with only one single source of information.
6

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.700
Let's say that you wanted to go see a movie.
Would you be satisfied in just pulling people over randomly
7

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.200
in the street, asking them what they thought of the movie, and then basing your decision about whether
8

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.090
or not to see it off what they said.
9

10
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.100
Well, no.
10

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.340
And if you said yes, that's because it's a low risk maneuver
or you have really low standards.
11

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.100
Shame on you. Building products compared to going to movies,
12

13
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.530
a little bit different. Building products are a much bigger risk.
When you're building a product, there are no do overs.
13

14
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130
a little bit different. Building products are a much bigger risk.
When you're building a product, there are no do overs.
14

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.150
And if you make a mistake in building your product,
that can haunt your company's legacy for years. That
15

16
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.080
movie in this terrible metaphor would instead last,
let's say, a year, or at least one of those ridiculously
16

17
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.210
long four-hour movies, and you can't leave to go pee.
17

18
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.950
So you better figure out for sure whether or not you're watching The Shawshank Redemption or Eternal sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
18

19
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.820
So you better figure out for sure whether or not you're watching The Shawshank Redemption or Eternal sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
19

20
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.030
God, that was awful.
When the stakes are that high,
20

21
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.530
you probably will look for other sources of information.
You might ask your friends or your family, people you trust,
21

22
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.550
you probably will look for other sources of information.
You might ask your friends or your family, people you trust,
22

23
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.370
you might read reviews online, you might even
preview it by watching the trailer.
23

24
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.140
you might read reviews online, you might even
preview it by watching the trailer.
24

25
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.310
You get the point, and the same goes for product decisions.
When you make a product decision, you're going
25

26
00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.170
to be using a mix of different information sources.
You might use internal feedback from your company,
26

27
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.230
to be using a mix of different information sources.
You might use internal feedback from your company,
27

28
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.010
you might use data you got from user testing, you might use feedback that was submitted online, you might
28

29
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.390
use the analytics and the engagement stats
from visitors on your page.
29

30
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.410
You'll even base your decisions off the news, and market trends,
and watching what your competitors do.
30

31
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.440
You'll even base your decisions off the news, and market trends,
and watching what your competitors do.
31

32
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.360
There are a lot of different inputs. Customer interviews
and everything we just learned in this section
32

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.660
are a crucial part of making decisions as a product manager.
33

34
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.760
But they are only one dish in your data diet.
Customer interviews are great but they do have a pair of
34

35
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.910
vulnerabilities, and that's why it is crucial that you
supplement this information with other sources.
35

36
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.090
vulnerabilities, and that's why it is crucial that you
supplement this information with other sources.
36

37
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.170
The first vulnerability is that customer interviews,
they don't really scale, it's only you talking to a customer.
37

38
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.360
The first vulnerability is that customer interviews,
they don't really scale, it's only you talking to a customer.
38

39
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.210
You can have one, maybe you can have 10, maybe
you're crazy and you have 50 interviews. That's a lot.
39

40
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.090
You can have one, maybe you can have 10, maybe
you're crazy and you have 50 interviews. That's a lot.
40

41
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.370
But you could be working with an application that has
thousands of users, so it's actually quite risky to take
41

42
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.150
three or four interviews and extrapolate that for the entire group.
42

43
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.980
Who knows if those three people you talked to
were the crazy ones?
43

44
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.310
Who knows if those three people you talked to
were the crazy ones?
44

45
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.720
The second vulnerability is that this is qualitative data,
and qualitative data is very important,
45

46
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.480
but you also need quantitative data.
46

47
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.000
Qualitative is the fluffy stuff, the why, the what, I like this,
47

48
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.950
Qualitative is the fluffy stuff, the why, the what, I like this,
48

49
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:33.150
I like that. Quantitative is the data that is hard numbers.
0.25% of people clicked on this button.
49

50
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.190
I like that. Quantitative is the data that is hard numbers.
0.25% of people clicked on this button,
50

51
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.630
people stayed on your page for 4 minutes and 25 seconds, etc.
51

52
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.900
Qualitative data is nice and it helps you understand,
but it's kind of left out to dry,
52

53
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.110
because it's not precise enough, and that's why
you need quantitative as well. Think of qualitative
53

54
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.420
information more like a barometer of temperature
and quantitative data like an actual thermostat.
54

55
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.030
So, keep that in mind, you have a data diet. Customer
interviews are just one piece of your dinner meal.
55

56
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.230
So, keep that in mind, you have a data diet. Customer
interviews are just one piece of your dinner meal.
56

57
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.590
You, as a product manager, will have to make hard
decisions about what inputs to use in your decisions,
57

58
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.850
which information sources are relevant and which are junk.
In the rest of the course,
58

59
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.540
we cover a lot of these different input signals and
we also cover in more depth how you can synthesize
59

60
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.110
this information and make good judgments for your product.
60

61
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.480
All right, guys. See you in the next lecture.
61

62
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.400
All right, guys. See you in the next lecture.
