Hey, what's up?
1

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,060
So before we jump into product development, it's important to understand the market stages that products
2

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,900
and companies go through on a macro level,
a zoomed out level first.
3

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,280
This is what we call the product lifecycle.
4

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,610
.
5

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,340
Once a company has started or once they have developed a new product, there are four stages that that
6

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,470
product or that company go through. The four are: introduction, growth, maturity, and then decline. Products
7

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,690
and companies progress through these stages of development and the way that you know which stage they're
8

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,430
in is how much revenue they're making over time,
9

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,650
also some other things like how fast the revenue is growing and what their monthly recurring revenue is.
10

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,220
also some other things like how fast the revenue is growing and what their monthly recurring revenue is.
11

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,440
So let's talk about each one of these four phases really quickly. The introduction phase, first of all.
12

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,170
This is when a company first introduces a product to the market. Usually the product will have little
13

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,470
to no competition in the market. At this phase of the lifecycle, the business typically loses money on the item
14

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,290
to no competition in the market. At this phase of the lifecycle, the business typically loses money on the item
15

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,040
and the only people that are buying it like immediately
are the early adopter types.
16

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,100
The second phase is the growth phase,
17

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,130
and at this point, the product has been accepted by the marketplace and sales start to rise, usually, again,
18

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,960
starting from the tail end of those early adopter users.
19

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,730
The organization may choose to create improvements to the item to stay competitive, and at this point
20

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,910
they're usually still few challengers out there in the marketplace trying to compete with them.
21

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,010
So then we have the third phase, maturity. In the maturity stage of the product lifecycle, sales will reach their pinnacle.
22

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,500
So then we have the third phase, maturity. In the maturity stage of the product lifecycle, sales will reach their pinnacle.
23

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,830
The other competitors enter the market with alternative solutions
24

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,280
at this point because it's so attractive and they start making a lot of competition in the marketplace, it gets pretty crazy.
25

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,890
at this point because it's so attractive and they start making a lot of competition in the marketplace, it gets pretty crazy.
26

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,200
The company that introduced this new product may start to find it pretty difficult to compete with everyone else in the industry.
27

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,050
The company that introduced this new product may start to find it pretty difficult to compete with everyone else in the industry.
28

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:15,720
Lastly, we have the decline phase, and at this phase of the product lifecycle, as merchandise, and products, and
29

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,240
the company just reach its saturation point,
the sales begin to diminish.
30

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,450
And remember, we have all that competition out there.
31

32
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,780
Most products are phased out from the marketplace right about this time because of the drop in sales
32

33
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,050
and all of the competitive pressure. The marketplace sees this item and says, "Okay, this is no longer new
33

34
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,590
and great, its a little bit old, not very relevant anymore."
34

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,960
Now, its important to know that, depending on the product or the industry, this stuff might shift a little bit.
35

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,710
Now, its important to know that, depending on the product or the industry, this stuff might shift a little bit.
36

37
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,440
It's also really important to mention that there is no definitive guide to telling where a company or
37

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,660
product is within these phases.
38

39
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,960
It's really just a way of thinking, a framework so that we can understand how companies and products begin and end.
39

40
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,670
It's really just a way of thinking, a framework so that we can understand how companies and products begin and end.
40

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,090
So we've named these four phases, you've got introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.
41

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,100
Can you think of some real life companies in each one of these phases?
42

43
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,020
We're going to take a look at some of these real life examples
in the next lecture.
