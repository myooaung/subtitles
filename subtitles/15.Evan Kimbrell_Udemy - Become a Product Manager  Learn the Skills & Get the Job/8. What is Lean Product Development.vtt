00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.570
So, what is lean?
1

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.910
Well, lean is a product development philosophy that revolves around cutting out all of the unnecessary work
2

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.950
or effort until you're absolutely sure you need to do it
for your users or customers.
3

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.210
Let's say I have an idea for a food delivery business where someone can just text on their phone their
4

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.770
order to a cell phone number and we bring them the food - like that.
5

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.800
What would you need to make this business a reality?
6

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.690
Seriously, put yourself in the position of someone that's going to be starting this business and think
7

8
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
about what you would need to get it to be a real thing.
8

9
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.860
Normally, we'd incorporate, we'd hire some drivers, we would build a web site, we would put out some advertisements,
9

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.480
and we would buy a cell phone number
for people to text for the food.
10

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.490
So to better use resources here I could have done some work upfront myself by doing things like having
11

12
00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.120
people text my own cell phone number or putting out flyers myself or driving the food to people's houses myself
12

13
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.620
people text my own cell phone number or putting out flyers myself or driving the food to people's houses myself
13

14
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.020
once I got a text message. This would require a lot more work from me upfront but it guarantees that
14

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.870
I'm not spending money on stuff until I know I actually have to.
15

16
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.350
So at the point that I get enough business where I can no longer do these things myself, where I can
16

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.290
no longer drive to the people's houses myself or take the orders myself, then I'd start hiring the drivers.
17

18
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.860
This is a lean approach so lean is really just about building something in an intelligent way where
18

19
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.340
This is a lean approach. So lean is really just about building something in an intelligent way where
19

20
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.740
I'm not using the resources until I know I actually have to.
20

21
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.430
And this way we save a ton of money.
21

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.040
Lean is not specifically for software though.
22

23
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.500
There is a process called Agile that is specifically for software.
23

24
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.390
But I do recommend reading more about lean, and if you'd like,
24

25
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.300
there's a whole book on the topic called Lean Startup by Eric Ries, and it looks a lot like that.
25

26
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.000
So in the next lecture we're going to talk about Agile.
