00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,380
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, last lecture
we talked about how do you reach out and get these
1

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,360
potential customers or customers you already have
to connect with you and give you feedback.
2

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,900
It's a bit of an ask to get someone either on the phone or in person, so you need to have some skill with it.
3

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,860
It's a bit of an ask to get someone either on the phone or in person, so you need to have some skill with it.
4

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,460
So let's get some practice in the actual realm where
you're going to be contacting them - your email client.
5

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,490
So let's get some practice in the actual realm where
you're going to be contacting them - your email client.
6

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,440
So I just kind of whipped open this email right here
and we can use this as a practicing space.
7

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,470
I wrote at the bottom, remember the three things:
short, personable, and valuable.
8

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,450
I wrote at the bottom, remember the three things:
short, personable, and valuable.
9

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,260
We need to be short, four to seven sentences, less is more.
Personal,
10

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,080
We need to be short, four to seven sentences, less is more.
Personal,
11

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,810
we need to make sure that whatever we say to the person is specific to them, doesn't feel like a robot is saying it, and valuable,
12

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,610
we need to make sure that whatever we say to the person is specific to them, doesn't feel like a robot is saying it, and valuable,
13

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,640
we need to highlight that they can get some sort of
benefit from talking to us. Alright, building off of
14

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,280
what we said in the last lecture on how in general people are probably going to read only one or two
15

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,660
sentences of what you send them, since this is a cold email,
16

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,930
we need to front load our emails and make sure that
whatever we write that's personal to them, we make
17

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,930
sure that's at the beginning. You can make a crucial mistake
by using your template at the beginning of your e-mail.
18

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,650
sure that's at the beginning. You can make a crucial mistake
by using your template at the beginning of your e-mail.
19

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,770
That's what they read, they think it's an auto-system
sending it to them, and they bail.
20

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,610
That's what they read, they think it's an auto-system
sending it to them, and they bail.
21

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,670
So the first thing you want to do is write
one to two sentences of an introduction.
22

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,920
Now, when I say introduction, I don't mean
introduce yourself necessarily.
23

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,800
One of the things that people generally dislike is that
in the first couple of sentences they hear you 
24

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,720
talk about yourself and not them.
25

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,000
That's another crucial mistake people make
when reaching out to people.
26

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,640
They make it all about me, me, me, me, me, when in reality
it needs to be about the person who's receiving
27

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,080
it, because they're the ones that are, you know,
you're asking them to respond.
28

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,100
This is where we get personal, and whatever
you write here, it needs to be specific.
29

30
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,730
I read your blog post on [...], it was great. I've noticed
that you are struggling with X feature and our product.
30

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,510
I read your blog post on [...], it was great. I've noticed
that you are struggling with X feature and our product.
31

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:15,210
I read your blog post on [...], it was great. I've noticed
that you are struggling with X feature and our product.
32

33
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,480
I saw that you had a problem with this. A lot of people
have that problem and I'd like to help you.
33

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,260
I saw that you had a problem with this. A lot of people
have that problem and I'd like to help you.
34

35
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,720
The next thing you want to do is generally
write two sentences of why you want to talk.
35

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,630
Now, this is your opportunity to insert
the value portion of your email.
36

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,000
Once they get to this section, this is where you kind of
hook them in and give them an incentive to actually respond.
37

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,680
Once they get to this section, this is where you kind of
hook them in and give them an incentive to actually respond.
38

39
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:49,140
Now, two classic go-to ways of adding value
in these cold emails is to do one of two things.
39

40
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:57,990
One - you can say, you know, "I think I can help you
use our product better," in the case of a post product
40

41
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,320
customer, or in the case of a pre-product potential customer,
41

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,350
you say something along the lines of how
you specifically want to solve their problem.
42

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,110
Those always seem to be the go-to sentences. You see this
pretty much everywhere. If you've ever received
43

44
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,730
an e-mail, they probably said that. "I would like to
solve this problem for you" or "I can show you how you 
44

45
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,800
can get more out of our product."
45

46
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,630
Alternatively, if you didn't want to use those two,
you can go a different route.
46

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,510
Now, there are three different avenues or paths
I think you can use that are quite effective.
47

48
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,280
One is instead of just saying generically
"You have a problem, I want to solve it,"
48

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,600
you appeal to pride.
49

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,780
Pride is a very, very useful thing to use
when you want someone to respond to you.
50

51
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:58,340
What I mean is you have the opportunity to say things like,
"You appear to be an expert on [...]."
51

52
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,340
"You would be able to give us so much valuable information."
52

53
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,840
Everyone likes to hear that someone has recognized you know more information or you are better in some 
53

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,580
way than everybody else.
54

55
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,010
If you want to appeal to the pride of someone who's
an existing customer, you could say things like, "You have
55

56
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:24,300
been a customer so much longer than all of our other customers" or "It seems like you understand our product
56

57
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,480
much better than other customers."
57

58
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,350
That relates back to what we talked in the previous lecture.
58

59
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,990
Make them feel special.
59

60
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,170
That is one technique that is always open to you
as a product manager and it is very effective.
60

61
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,360
The second avenue you can go down is appeal to money.
61

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:50,190
You can use this section, this two-sentence section,
to say why you want to talk, and then incentivize
62

63
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,160
them by saying that there's some sort of monetary reward
at the end of that rainbow. Who doesn't like money?
63

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,850
them by saying that there's some sort of monetary reward
at the end of that rainbow. Who doesn't like money?
64

65
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,610
The third thing you can do is imply association.
65

66
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:12,510
So what I mean by association is you can imply that
you know people or are well situated in a space
66

67
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,010
that the person you're emailing cares about.
67

68
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,280
Oftentimes what you can do is you can look at their LinkedIn profile, see what space they're in, and you can
68

69
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,530
imply that by connecting with you, you know
a lot of other people, that in itself is valuable.
69

70
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,300
imply that by connecting with you, you know
a lot of other people, that in itself is valuable.
70

71
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,160
Some people do that, some people are more than willing to talk
just because they think you're a valuable contact.
71

72
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,330
Some people do that, some people are more than willing to talk
just because they think you're a valuable contact.
72

73
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,720
After that, we have one last thing that you
want to do, and this one is amazingly crucial.
73

74
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,940
The last thing you want to do is schedule a time.
74

75
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,420
Now, do you say, "Are you willing to talk?"
75

76
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,130
No.
76

77
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,590
Do you say, "Do you have any time next week?"
77

78
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,240
No.
78

79
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,410
What you say is "Are you available 
79

80
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:00,690
Wednesday at 3:30 PM Pacific Standard Time?"
What you're doing here is you're reducing the friction
80

81
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,320
in between them responding and talking to you.
81

82
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,120
If you say next week and they're interested, the next time
they'll say "Yes, which day?" and you'll say, "How
82

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,300
about Tuesday?" and they'll say, "Great, propose a time."
It just goes on, and on, and on, you went from one email
83

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,680
to six emails. If you just pick a time and say it,
they're much more likely to say yes
84

85
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,890
and you don't run the risk of losing them throughout
that process of trying to schedule them.
85

86
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,460
Don't forget that one - you've probably seen
that technique in your inbox.
86

87
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,810
Another pro-tip you can use in conjunction with this is
use some of those online scheduling softwares, like Calendly.
87

88
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,940
Another pro-tip you can use in conjunction with this is
use some of those online scheduling softwares, like Calendly.
88

89
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,860
There's a ton of them where you don't even have to suggest a time, you just let them click through and pick a time.
89

90
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,300
There's a ton of them where you don't even have to suggest a time, you just let them click through and pick a time.
90

91
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,970
All right, so let's look at a well-crafted e-mail that
follows that same template we just went over.
91

92
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,010
All right, so let's look at a well-crafted e-mail that
follows that same template we just went over.
92

93
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,670
All right, so it says "Hi Sam, I read your article on volunteering your professional skills in Guatemala - it was really inspiring."
93

94
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,750
All right, so it says "Hi Sam, I read your article on volunteering your professional skills in Guatemala - it was really inspiring."
94

95
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,960
All right, so it says "Hi Sam, I read your article on volunteering your professional skills in Guatemala - it was really inspiring."
95

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,910
"I'm looking to travel more and you've got me thinking about incorporating volunteering when I do." So
96

97
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,530
right there, that is two sentences.
97

98
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,790
It's personal. It connects it to his article on
volunteering in Guatemala.
98

99
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,560
It's personal. It connects it to his article on
volunteering in Guatemala.
99

100
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,010
You showed that you read their article and you understood it,
and you're responding because of it.
100

101
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,070
Now, the next sentence is what we call the value section.
It's just divided for purposes of reading it.
101

102
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,150
Now, the next sentence is what we call the value section.
It's just divided for purposes of reading it.
102

103
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,860
It looks like they still used two sentences, but they said,
"I have a software company trying to improve remote
103

104
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,020
medical record coding," and then it says, "I'm not looking to sell anything, but since you have so much expertise
104

105
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,660
with remote coding, I'd love to get your advice on
our products so we don't build the wrong thing."
105

106
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,820
with remote coding, I'd love to get your advice on
our products so we don't build the wrong thing."
106

107
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,110
This is a masterful set of sentences.
107

108
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,430
Whenever someone sees "I have a software company..."
they usually cringe, but if it's followed
108

109
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:55,470
by "trying to improve remote record coding, which is
something you do and probably are frustrated with,"
109

110
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,350
it instantly sounds like this could be something
that is game-changing.
110

111
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,240
Then they move on and we use that technique
where they said "I'm not in sales."
111

112
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,410
"I'm not trying to sell you something."
112

113
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,540
And then they appeal to their pride by saying "You have expertise."
113

114
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,570
So what's the value of responding to this e-mail?
Well, it is the fact that, one, you can help them, two, you have
114

115
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,920
a specific expertise that would benefit them
more than talking to someone else,
115

116
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,750
and three, and this is the big one,
116

117
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,900
they're building something that could actually solve your problems.
117

118
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,970
And then the last one is "If you're available, I'd love to
chat for just 20 minutes Thursday or Friday morning."
118

119
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,430
And then the last one is "If you're available, I'd love to
chat for just 20 minutes Thursday or Friday morning."
