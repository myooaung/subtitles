Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,830
So, last lecture, we covered how to take your assumptions and then convert them into testable and easy to understand hypotheses.

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,730
So, last lecture, we covered how to take your assumptions and then convert them into testable and easy to understand hypotheses.
3

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:18,090
And since we've been using that company called Zirx before,
as our example, let's go ahead and try out
4

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,040
making a hypothesis for Zirx.
5

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,310
Let's first go back a little bit and refresh ourselves on what
some of the assumptions we made about Zirx were.
6

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,490
Let's first go back a little bit and refresh ourselves on what
some of the assumptions we made about Zirx were.
7

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,060
Well, we were assuming a lot of different things.
8

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,590
We were assuming that parking in cities was going to be limited.
9

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,340
We were assuming that people thought garages
were too expensive.
10

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,950
Maybe they also thought that garages were inconvenient,
and we even had assumptions that were on the
11

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,550
supply side, where we assumed that people would
even want to park cars as part of our service.
12

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
Now, out of all of those ones we went over, we didn't cover
all of them in just that second, but do you remember
13

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,010
the biggest one, the one we were concerned about
the most, the riskiest one? The riskiest one was that
14

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,860
people will be okay letting an on demand valet park their car.
15

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:15,630
Well, let's try to think about how we would build a hypothesis
that turns this assumption into an actionable version of itself.
16

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,910
Well, let's try to think about how we would build a hypothesis
that turns this assumption into an actionable version of itself.
17

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,590
Well, we first need to define out the pieces of the hypothesis
and draw out our handy dandy template.
18

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:22,680
Well, we first need to define out the pieces of the hypothesis
and draw out our handy dandy template.
19

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,410
I'm using the shortened version because we're testing
a new service, so we're not really trying to tie
20

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:35,670
this to things like internal metrics, or, say, you know,
expecting this behavioral change because, well, we
21

22
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,780
don't have any data to compare the past behavior,
we're going to keep it simple.
22

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,350
Now, what are we to put in for the "who"?
23

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,630
Well, I'm guessing it's going to be people that have cars
and are probably in the age range of 30 to
24

25
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,050
50, potentially with incomes over, let's say, $80000 a year.
25

26
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,210
Really, I'm just spitballing.
26

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,590
Realistically, you would probably do some research here,
but this is a pretty plausible subject target.
27

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,750
Realistically, you would probably do some research here,
but this is a pretty plausible subject target.
28

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,400
Now, what's the action we're expecting them to do?
29

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,610
Well, it's let an on demand valet park their car.
30

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,140
Now, what's the problem we think we are solving?
31

32
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,540
Remember, again, we don't have to define the problem,
but I think it's helpful.
32

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,720
Well, you know, there could be a lot of different reasons,
and we highlighted them before in past lectures.
33

34
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,040
Well, you know, there could be a lot of different reasons,
and we highlighted them before in past lectures.
34

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,580
Let's just say that it's because garages are
too expensive and that's their problem.
35

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,860
We can even add a location if we wanted to add even more specificity to this, but that's completely optional.
36

37
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,190
We can even add a location if we wanted to add even more specificity to this, but that's completely optional.
37

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,910
They themselves actually launched in San Francisco,
so we could say San Francisco,
38

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,940
but really, it would be any city that has bad downtown parking.
39

40
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,990
Well, there you go.
40

41
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,100
We've pieced together a one sentence testable hypothesis,
and guess what? We got to wrap into that hypothesis
41

42
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,790
We've pieced together a one sentence testable hypothesis,
and guess what? We got to wrap into that hypothesis
42

43
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,210
several other assumptions that were on our list.
43

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,380
See how that works?
44

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,150
If this hypothesis turns out to be true in its entirety,
then people do think garages are too expensive.
45

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,180
If this hypothesis turns out to be true in its entirety,
then people do think garages are too expensive.
46

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,350
That was one of our assumptions. And if they end up completing a transaction where they use an MVP to book their first Zirx pickup, 
47

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,210
That was one of our assumptions. And if they end up completing a transaction where they use an MVP to book their first Zirx pickup, 
48

49
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,320
well, then that also means that it's probably
not too difficult to use the service while driving.
49

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,850
Remember? That was also one of our assumptions.
50

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,720
Now, realistically, we could go at this in 100 different ways.
We could build a separate hypothesis for each
51

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,430
assumption and then consolidate them down when
we got to the stage of deciding how we need to test
52

53
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,910
each one. Or we could just do the biggest assumptions
in one big test and come back to the later ones
53

54
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,040
after we've done our first round of testing
and if we think it's absolutely necessary.
54

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,390
Like I said, many, many different ways of doing this.
55

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,490
We, in this case, started off with an assumption that
happened to be the riskiest, but it also happened
56

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,580
to be something that's pretty low difficulty.
57

58
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,080
So, according to our quadrant system, that is where
we would start anyway. In the next lecture we're going
58

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,030
to talk about how you measure whether or not
your tests end up being true.
59

60
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,770
It's a really, really important part of this entire MVP process.
60

61
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,340
See you then.
