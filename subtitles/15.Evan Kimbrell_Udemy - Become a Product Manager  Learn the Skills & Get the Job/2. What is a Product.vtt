Hey, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.760
So what is a product?
2

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.330
Bear with me here, because I know this seems like a silly question but it's actually a topic that you
3

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.440
need to really pay attention to as a product manager.
4

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.620
Obviously, everyone knows what a product is.
5

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.900
It could be anything. It could be a keyboard
that I have here in front of me.
6

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.490
It could be a laptop or the device you're using right now.
7

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.820
My shirt is a product.
8

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.710
The web browser that you have on your computer is a product.
9

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
All of these things are products by the classical definition.
10

11
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.400
So we know from the title "Product Manager" that a product manager is someone that manages a given product
11

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.720
However, it's not always the case that a product manager is in charge of an entire device or piece of software.
12

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.100
However, it's not always the case that a product manager is in charge of an entire device or piece of software.
13

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.140
However, it's not always the case that a product manager is in charge of an entire device or piece of software.
14

15
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.980
In many startups, and especially large companies, product managers are in charge of sections of what we
15

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.550
normal consumers would typically think of as a product.
16

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.850
I'll give you an example here.
17

18
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.090
When you use Facebook, you're actually using a multitude of different features. At companies like this,
18

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.140
each feature is so vital and complex that it's usually assigned to a group of people called a product
19

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.210
each feature is so vital and complex that it's usually assigned to a group of people called a product
20

21
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.540
team or a feature team to manage it.
21

22
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.760
So at Facebook the photos are one product.
22

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.460
It's a feature, it's called a product in product management lingo.
The news feed is a product, the user
23

24
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.580
profile is a product, messaging and commenting,
24

25
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.180
those are both products too. Every single one of these products is managed by a product manager and worked
25

26
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.180
on by them and a team of designers and engineers which, again, are called product teams or feature teams.
26

27
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.470
Let's go a little bit deeper with that Facebook example.
27

28
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.120
Let's go a little bit deeper with that Facebook example.
28

29
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.110
The news feed at Facebook has multiple product managers working on it,
29

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.940
believe it or not, because it's such a big piece of technology. One product manager leads a team that
30

31
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.520
works on the ranking algorithm, one product manager leads a team that works on the advertisements, and
31

32
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.720
there are a bunch of other product managers working on different things that have to do with that news feed.
32

33
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.180
there are a bunch of other product managers working on different things that have to do with that news feed.
33

34
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.310
But there are also cases where product managers are not split up by the features in larger applications
34

35
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.220
or products like Facebook, or by pieces of software, but rather split up by platform.
35

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.880
For instance, at a company there may be a product manager in charge of everything on the Android app
36

37
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.130
and another one in charge of everything on iOS,
37

38
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.130
and another one in charge of the website.
38

39
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.310
This is just a different model of working.
39

40
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.720
There are also product managers that work on things like advertising and subscription services, depending
40

41
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.640
on the business model of the company.
41

42
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.200
We'll talk more about the different types of product managers
in a little bit.
42

43
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.610
So now we should be clear that as far as the role of a product manager goes, a product can be anything
43

44
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.900
from an entire real life product as a consumer sees it, or in some cases split up into smaller sections
44

45
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.560
for larger companies or more complex products. 
Alright, in the next lecture,
45

46
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.050
we're going to talk about the different types of product managers.
I will see you there!
