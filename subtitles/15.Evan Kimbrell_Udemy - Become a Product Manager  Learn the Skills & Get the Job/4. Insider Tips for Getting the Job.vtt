00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.390
What's up, everybody?
1

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.900
All right, fair warning. This is a longer lecture,
but I promise you it is worth it.
2

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.710
All right, fair warning. This is a longer lecture,
but I promise you it is worth it.
3

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.780
All right, fair warning. This is a longer lecture,
but I promise you it is worth it.
4

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm going to let you in on a little bit of a secret here.
5

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.590
This is one of the best ways for getting any job,
6

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.620
but it works especially well for a product management
role, and it works especially, especially well for
7

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.910
getting your first product management role in a
junior position, which is what you've got to do
8

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.900
if you don't have any experience prior.
9

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.740
We've already talked about how it's very important to demonstrate knowledge of product management in order to land the job.
10

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.510
We've already talked about how it's very important to demonstrate knowledge of product management in order to land the job.
11

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.750
This is why interviews make you demonstrate
this during the interview.
12

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.380
But what about outside of that interview, can you do
anything to demonstrate that you really, really know
13

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.260
what you're talking about?
14

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.380
Well, if you followed along so far, you're probably
already well under way to demonstrating knowledge
15

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.020
by establishing an online brand and doing a side project
16

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.570
if you've never had any experience at work before.
But there is one more thing you can do to maximize
17

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.490
your chances at getting the job.
18

19
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.160
However, I've got to tell you that this is not easy.
19

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.770
This is going to require some more time and effort from you.
20

21
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.790
If you aren't serious about getting your dream job
as a product manager, and you don't want to go the
21

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.930
extra mile to stand out from the tons of other people
that want that job, then you don't need to finish
22

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.590
this video and I am super disappointed in you.
23

24
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.960
So go ahead, if you're one of those people, turn off the video,
24

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.870
the rest of us will wait here.
25

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.540
Go ahead. No, no, yeah, go.
26

27
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.670
Okay, so now that the lazy people are gone,
I'm going to let the rest of you in on this secret.
27

28
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.600
Okay, so now that the lazy people are gone,
I'm going to let the rest of you in on this secret.
28

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.310
Okay, so now that the lazy people are gone,
I'm going to let the rest of you in on this secret.
29

30
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.490
But it's not that complex, it's actually pretty simple.
30

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.930
But it's not that complex, it's actually pretty simple.
31

32
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.050
Do a demonstration project for the company that you're applying to
and send it to the hiring manager and the recruiter.
32

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.610
Do a demonstration project for the company that you're applying to
and send it to the hiring manager and the recruiter.
33

34
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.250
It's like doing a generic project that we already talked
about, but it's much more targeted and that's the key.
34

35
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.720
It's like doing a generic project that we already talked
about, but it's much more targeted and that's the key.
35

36
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.670
You're probably thinking like, 
"Well, does this work? Why am I going to do this?"
36

37
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.780
You're probably thinking like, 
"Well, does this work? Why am I going to do this?"
37

38
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.900
You're probably thinking like, 
"Well, does this work? Why am I going to do this?"
38

39
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.500
It does work.
39

40
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.100
In fact, this is how I got my first few product management
jobs, and I've also gotten a ton of offers
40

41
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.430
by doing this that allowed me to basically choose the
company I wanted to work for instead of having
41

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.920
to accept the first offer that came my way.
42

43
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.190
So the basic technique here is to find out what sorts
of things the company is working on with their
43

44
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.240
product currently, and their strategy, and that sort of thing.
44

45
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.400
Show them how you would approach the problem
45

46
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.240
if you were to be hired. You can do this by either doing
some generic research on the company and finding
46

47
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.490
out through news articles and that sort of thing
what they're trying to build or the challenges they
47

48
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.280
face, or you can be even more effective
and ask them some questions
48

49
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.110
during your first interview with them, and with all
of the work you've done so far in this course, with
49

50
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.460
the online branding, and your social media profiles,
and just knowing what you're talking about, it should
50

51
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.500
be pretty easy to get at least a first round interview or a phone call.
51

52
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.070
So here's how I do it,
52

53
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.560
and, you know, how I did it back when I was first
starting out. Let's say that I got a first round interview
53

54
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.420
for a product management role. During the first interview,
54

55
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.010
I would answer the questions, but then I would also ask
them why they're hiring, which features this product
55

56
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.440
position would work on, and see if they'd give me any
information I could use on the things that they're
56

57
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.140
trying to build, or the markets they're trying to get into,
or the clients that they want, that type of thing.
57

58
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.560
trying to build, or the markets they're trying to get into,
or the clients that they want, that type of thing.
58

59
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.470
So what I would do after that, I would immediately leave,
after the interview I would immediately go home and
59

60
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.220
I'd do research on the product, the industry, the technology,
and the competition around the stuff that they
60

61
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.540
told me when I asked them those questions. Then I would spend
at least 24 to 48 hours developing a comprehensive
61

62
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.230
overview of how I would approach that problem.
62

63
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.930
Usually, I would spend an entire weekend doing this.
"But, Cole," you say, "I want to go out with my friends
63

64
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.780
and drink beer on the weekends." Or not beer.
64

65
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.580
I don't know, vodka.
65

66
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.190
Maybe you should do that instead.
66

67
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.550
But the other people are going to be doing this extra
work on the weekends in order to put themselves
67

68
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.050
above the other candidates and show that they really want
that job and they know what they're talking about.
68

69
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.480
above the other candidates and show that they really want
that job and they know what they're talking about.
69

70
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.670
So, in the past, these projects I've done have ranged
from a small four-page PDF document all the way
70

71
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.990
to a 60-page slide deck, and I'm not kidding,
I actually put together 60 slides once for a company.
71

72
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.280
They freaking loved it.
72

73
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.950
These things usually contain things like descriptions
of the research I did, the approaches I would
73

74
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.470
consider, the technical limitations I found, wireframes
of potential solutions, A/B tests I would run, competitive
74

75
00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.000
overviews, and sometimes I even have gone so far
as to find friends of mine that use their product, then
75

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.550
I call up those friends and say "Can I talk to you for 30 minutes?"
76

77
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.160
I interview them about their feedback and
their experiences with that product,
77

78
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.730
I record it or at least I transcribe it, and I include
those interviews and the conclusions I drew from
78

79
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.040
those interviews in that project.
79

80
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.480
So once I'm done with the project, I will usually e-mail
the completed document in, like, a slide deck or PDF
80

81
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.030
to the recruiter and the hiring manager, thanking them
for the interview, telling them that I put together
81

82
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.370
some suggestions to demonstrate my interest in working
with them, and what I know about the industry.
82

83
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.550
some suggestions to demonstrate my interest in working
with them, and what I know about the industry.
83

84
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.310
So the silver lining to all of this, even if it doesn't
help you get the job, is that if you do it, you
84

85
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.000
will get an even better chance of getting the next job.
85

86
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.770
This is because, first of all, you've done a lot of
product thinking while you've been putting this thing
86

87
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.730
together, and trust me, it builds up and it helps,
87

88
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.140
but mostly because you can just take that case study
and you can just put it on your web site or your blog,
88

89
00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.970
but mostly because you can just take that case study
and you can just put it on your web site or your blog,
89

90
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.990
and then the next recruiter that talks to you about
this position is going to check it out, and they're
90

91
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.600
going to say "Well, this person really knows their stuff.
91

92
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.650
Look at all of these case studies they've done
in their free time." It's going to be awesome.
92

93
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.670
On top of that, you can even talk about these suggestions and case studies for that company that you didn't get the job for,
93

94
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.850
On top of that, you can even talk about these suggestions and case studies for that company that you didn't get the job for,
94

95
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.470
you can talk about them in the next interviews with
other companies, it has so many benefits.
95

96
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.300
you can talk about them in the next interviews with
other companies, it has so many benefits.
96

97
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.580
All right. So, use this information wisely.
97

98
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.560
All right. So, use this information wisely.
98

99
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.680
This is really a great technique, not only for getting a job,
but thinking through that product management mindset,
99

100
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.280
This is really a great technique, not only for getting a job,
but thinking through that product management mindset,
100

101
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.410
like I said, you're going to have to go through that
process, and doing it is just going to improve your
101

102
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.010
product mind as you go through it every single time.
102

103
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.820
Look, if you apply to a company and you sit back waiting
for them to call you with a job offer or waiting
103

104
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.660
for them to call you for the next interview, you're
doing the exact same thing as everybody else.
104

105
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.440
Stand out from the crowd by putting in the effort,
showing them that you really want this position, and
105

106
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.340
demonstrate to them that you've got the skills to do it.
106

107
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.920
I hope a bunch of you are motivated now with that
lecture, but also the stuff before it. If you do all
107

108
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:21.900
of that, you're going to be in such a good place that
you're going to be so far beyond where I was,
108

109
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.570
I mean, when when I first started, I had nearly no experience,
109

110
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.270
I did not take this course.
110

111
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.050
Obviously, that would be weird. At that point, there
were no schools teaching product management,
111

112
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.410
I had no product management experience,
I kind of had to just figure it out.
112

113
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.850
I had no product management experience,
I kind of had to just figure it out.
113

114
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.900
But now you've got someone like me that's gone
through all of this telling you exactly how to do it.
114

115
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.250
But now you've got someone like me that's gone
through all of this telling you exactly how to do it.
115

116
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:52.100
You are leagues above every single other person
out there trying to get this position.
116

117
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.060
I hope you enjoyed the lecture.
117

118
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.150
I know it's a lot of work, but it's totally worth it.
118

119
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.980
I'll see you in the next one.
