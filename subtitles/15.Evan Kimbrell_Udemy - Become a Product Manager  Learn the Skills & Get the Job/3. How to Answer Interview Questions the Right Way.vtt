Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.870
Like I said, this lecture is going to be one of the most important tips I can offer you for interviewing as a product manager.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.250
Like I said, this lecture is going to be one of the most important tips I can offer you for interviewing as a product manager.
3

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.810
As you already know, if you've been watching this
course so far - and I hope you have because, you know,
4

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.940
what are you doing here if not? -
5

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.780
product management positions are based on
making good decisions based on data.
6

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.490
If someone asks you what you would do for a product
in a particular situation, you never just give them
7

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.490
an answer without mentioning how you came
to that conclusion, and then why,
8

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.500
an answer without mentioning how you came
to that conclusion, and then why,
9

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.280
and then what are the alternatives? Ok, so
here's a real life example from my actual career.
10

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.660
and then what are the alternatives? Ok, so
here's a real life example from my actual care
11

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.650
I was once interviewing a candidate for a product
management role at an e-commerce company.
12

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.160
Everyone's like "Oh, you've got to interview this person.
13

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.300
She's great. She's got a great resume, great product manager.
14

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.430
She's great. She's got a great resume, great product manager."
15

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.220
So I'm like "Okay, I'll interview her. We'll see."
16

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.080
So I'm like "Okay, I'll interview her. We'll see."
17

18
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.590
And I asked her if she thought we should develop a
native mobile app or just continue focusing on just
18

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.400
doing a normal mobile web site, like we had been doing.
19

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
The problem is, without even thinking, I mean,
she had like a three second delay,
20

21
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.590
she goes "Yeah, you should do a mobile app, native mobile app."
21

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.620
And she didn't give any other details.
22

23
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.560
So whether or not she was correct with her answer is not the issue.
23

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.120
And, in fact, it did even matter.
24

25
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.880
The problem is that she just gave an answer without
asking for more information to help her make the
25

26
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.880
decision, and she didn't follow it up with any reasoning
behind how she arrived at that conclusion, or
26

27
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.860
how her answer may change based on data.
27

28
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.680
So you're thinking "Well, Cole, what was the right answer?"
28

29
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.410
Look, the answer I was looking for in that situation was for her to say "Okay, I need more information to help make this decision."
29

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.700
Look, the answer I was looking for in that situation was for her to say "Okay, I need more information to help make this decision."
30

31
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.960
How many of your customers shop for mobile devices?
What volume of traffic do you have?
31

32
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.660
What sorts of engineering knowledge does
your team have and what's your budget?
32

33
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.690
These things help make better decisions.
33

34
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.010
I would have also loved to see her follow up her
answer by telling me the reasoning behind it,
34

35
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.530
and then, most importantly, tell me what other options
were on the table besides just, you know, a mobile
35

36
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.050
web site or a native mobile app, because there
are things you can do besides that.
36

37
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.890
There's an in-between, you can do like a hybrid app,
or, yeah, there's other options, so you need to mention
37

38
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.940
these types of things when you're answering
questions. As a product manager,
38

39
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.870
there is never a single correct answer to a question.
39

40
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.170
There are always multiple possibilities, and it's your
job to synthesize information, to come up with
40

41
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.100
a good approach, and be clear about why this is the best option.
41

42
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.300
We work on data, not feelings. Just like if someone in
your company asks you why you're doing a particular
42

43
00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.690
initiative or adding a certain feature, you can't just say "Because." No, you've got to say "Because the
43

44
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.020
data says this, the user interviews say this, the market
is going this way, and our competitors are doing this.
44

45
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.190
data says this, the user interviews say this, the market
is going this way, and our competitors are doing this.
45

46
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.270
But here's the other options we considered, this one
seems to be the best approach for this reason."
46

47
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.690
But here's the other options we considered, this one
seems to be the best approach for this reason."
47

48
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.000
That is how you think and act like a product manager.
48

49
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.390
So, in interviews, always ask clarifying questions when possible.
49

50
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.930
It shows that you're being thoughtful
and thinking like a product manager.
50

51
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.790
By the way, I don't mean to start asking them questions
if they ask you simple things, like "Where did
51

52
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.890
you go to school?" or "Where did you work before here?"
52

53
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.000
What are you going to ask them?
"Oh, what do you mean by that question?"
53

54
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.660
No, I mean, if you get to the point where they're asking
you about your opinions on their product or "What
54

55
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.330
would you do in this situation?"
55

56
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.240
There are a lot of tech companies out there,
56

57
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.710
Google, and Facebook, and Twitter, and a lot of the big
ones out there, where the entire product management
57

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.460
interview process is just sort of hypothetical situations.
58

59
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.220
They're like "Hey, what do you think about this?
59

60
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.160
What if this happened? What would you do?"
60

61
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800
You've got to reason through it.
61

62
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.900
It's like showing your work on a math test in high school.
62

63
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.470
Man, I sucked at math in high school.
I don't know why I like this job though.
63

64
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.210
Man, I sucked at math in high school.
I don't know why I like this job though.
64

65
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.850
Anyways, that's a really big tip.
65

66
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.510
If you can internalize that, you can start thinking about
these things behind the questions, and asking
66

67
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.020
for more information to make the correct or at least most
correct decision on the answer, then you're going to go far.
67

68
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.000
for more information to make the correct or at least most
correct decision on the answer, then you're going to go far.
68

69
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.800
I'll see you guys in the next lecture for some real
insider tips on actually getting that job.
