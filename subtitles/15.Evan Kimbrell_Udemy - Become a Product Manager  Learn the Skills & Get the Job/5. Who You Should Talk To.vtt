00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.670
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.770
So let's, in this lecture, start the process of customer development.
2

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.630
So let's, in this lecture, start the process of customer development.
3

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.880
So let's, in this lecture, start the process of customer development.
4

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.220
All right. So in this lecture we're going to cover
the first step of the customer development process.
5

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.830
All right. So in this lecture we're going to cover
the first step of the customer development process.
6

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.490
There are four steps to this and I will fill you in as we go.
7

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.350
So, step one in the process is figuring out
who exactly we want to talk to in the first place.
8

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.680
Now, you obviously don't want to talk to just literally anyone,
you want to make sure it's either a potential
9

10
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.580
customer, or a customer you already have that is relevant to the new features or new products you're trying to launch.
10

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.570
customer, or a customer you already have that is relevant to the new features or new products you're trying to launch.
11

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690
Now, as I explained in the last lecture,
12

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.510
pretty much everything we're going to do is divide it down the middle between pre-product and post product.
13

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.850
So, first I'm going explain the process by which we can figure out who we are targeting and who to interview for pre-product,
14

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.990
So, first I'm going explain the process by which we can figure out who we are targeting and who to interview for pre-product,
15

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.200
and then, at the end of the lecture, we'll cover post product.
Ok, for the pre-product scenario, you have not yet created it.
16

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.370
and then, at the end of the lecture, we'll cover post product.
Ok, for the pre-product scenario, you have not yet created it.
17

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.830
You are probably in the validation section of development,
you're still trying to figure out what should go in it,
18

19
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.520
You are probably in the validation section of development,
you're still trying to figure out what should go in it,
19

20
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.080
Do people actually want it? Is there a market?
Now, in 90% of circumstances,
20

21
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.860
Do people actually want it? Is there a market?
Now, in 90% of circumstances,
21

22
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.800
you probably in your head have already thought of a target group of people that you think this new product is going to appeal to.
22

23
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.030
you probably in your head have already thought of a target group of people that you think this new product is going to appeal to.
23

24
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.390
If that's the case then you're a step ahead.
24

25
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.570
Take the idea that you have and write it down.
25

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.920
We're going to try to get to at least three
potential groups of people to talk to.
26

27
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.570
Now, if you're sitting there right now and you have absolutely
no idea who a potential customer for your
27

28
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.560
new product is going to be, I would be worried.
You're in a situation that we call a solution
28

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.280
looking for a problem, and I hope the next exercise
we go through will be beneficial.
29

30
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.430
Now, I want you to write down at least a minimum of three different types of customers or customer groups
30

31
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.460
that you think would find your product appealing.
31

32
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.470
Why do I ask for three?
32

33
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.600
Well, because any product out there is going to appeal
to not just one type of customer, it's going to
33

34
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.210
have appeal to other types as well.
It might not be as strong, but it still has an appeal.
34

35
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.880
have appeal to other types as well.
It might not be as strong, but it still has an appeal.
35

36
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.570
Now, write down the customer groups you think
36

37
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.700
answer that question. Once you have three, then we're going to decide which of these three is worth targeting
37

38
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.690
first, and we're going to do that by playing a game
called "Three questions stud."
38

39
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.840
I just made it up. "Three questions stud" is
based off of the game "Five cards stud,"
39

40
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.010
and if anyone plays poker and has played "Five cards stud,"
you know it's the dumbest game in poker.
40

41
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.470
But for our purposes of figuring out who to target,
this metaphor works perfectly.
41

42
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.980
Now, the reason I call this "Three cards stud" is that we're going to judge our potential customer groups
42

43
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.310
on three different criteria, and, much like a game of stud,
you get three criteria, three ratings, and that is it.
43

44
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.820
on three different criteria, and, much like a game of stud,
you get three criteria, three ratings, and that is it.
44

45
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.440
If you were playing "Three cards stud" in real life,
like the poker game, you would get three cards,
45

46
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.330
your opponent would get three cards,
46

47
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.490
you would look at them, whichever one adds up to more,
or as a pair or whatever, wins. That's it.
47

48
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.300
you would look at them, whichever one adds up to more,
or as a pair or whatever, wins. That's it.
48

49
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.880
Now, the first step in this game is to ask yourself
a question and then answer it to yourself.
49

50
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.540
Your product solves a problem for someone,
and that is the case with 100% of new products.
50

51
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.060
If you think about it long enough,
you will think of a problem that it solves.
51

52
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.650
Google Maps solves the problem of
"I don't know how to get where I'm going,
52

53
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.720
I get lost easily," and even frivolous things like mobile app games,
those solve the problem of being bored
53

54
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.030
during short periods of time, when you can't engage in other things.
54

55
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.250
So, once you figured out what the problem is,
ask yourself the question "Who has this problem?"
55

56
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.380
Now, if you dwell on that, you should be able to come up
with at least a couple of answers to that question.
56

57
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.450
Now, if you dwell on that, you should be able to come up
with at least a couple of answers to that question.
57

58
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.830
They might be customer groups you've never even considered,
and obviously, they'll be the ones that you
58

59
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.350
probably had in the back of your mind.
59

60
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.860
All right, so grab a pen and a piece of paper, or an Excel sheet,
or a Word document, Evernote doc, whatever
60

61
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.300
it is that you're using to capture your ideas and your thoughts.
61

62
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.430
Draw a table and make it three columns and three rows.
Now, on the top,
62

63
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.880
we're going to write our customer groups. Customer group one, customer group two, and customer group
63

64
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.790
three. Fill in the actual names of the ones
you previously came up with.
64

65
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.540
Now, on the left side, we're going to write down the three criteria,
and this is pretty much the name of the game.
65

66
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.600
Now, on the left side, we're going to write down the three criteria,
and this is pretty much the name of the game.
66

67
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.330
So the number one we're going to write is size,
67

68
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.880
the second one we're going to write is called pain to payment,
and the third one we write is accessibility.
68

69
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.060
the second one we're going to write is called pain to payment,
and the third one we write is accessibility.
69

70
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.380
Together, these criteria are probably the fastest
and the most relevant criteria to use to determine
70

71
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.680
who is actually worth going after right now.
71

72
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.150
Now, size might not be obvious.
When I say size, I mean market size.
72

73
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.170
Think of the customer group you are talking about.
73

74
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.640
How big is your customer group?
74

75
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.540
Is this something that has thousands of people
or millions of people?
75

76
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.060
Let's say you are building a system that helps
property developers and real estate agents, and those
76

77
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.900
are the two that you're going after - people who run
property development companies, like CEOs and real
77

78
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:37.270
estate agents. How many CEOs in the world are there that run
real estate or property development companies?
78

79
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.330
estate agents. How many CEOs in the world are there that run
real estate or property development companies?
79

80
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.000
And conversely, how many real estate agents are there?
So, in the first case, there's not a lot of them.
80

81
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.630
So that customer group would rate low on this criteria.
81

82
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.760
The second one, real estate agents,
there's a bajillion of them, so this would rate high.
82

83
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.370
The second one, real estate agents,
there's a bajillion of them, so this would rate high.
83

84
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.920
Now, the second criteria, pain to payment, this is a ratio.
84

85
00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.730
Now, I want you to think about each customer group and
think about how much pain do they have associated
85

86
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.190
with the problem you are trying to solve.
86

87
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:11.890
Someone who constantly gets lost in the city probably
has a decent level of pain, and someone who is
87

88
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.960
bored waiting for their doctor, that's not a huge level of pain.
88

89
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.220
The second part of this criteria is payment.
89

90
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.310
How likely are they to pay you for this service?
And, if they are willing to pay you, are they willing
90

91
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.410
to pay you a lot of money or a little bit of money?
And based off of those two,
91

92
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:40.510
you can kind of come up with a good ratio or a bad ratio. High pain - high payment is very good, low pain - low payment is quite poor.
92

93
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.250
you can kind of come up with a good ratio or a bad ratio. High pain - high payment is very good, low pain - low payment is quite poor.
93

94
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.800
In the Google Maps example, we have high pain, but we have very low payment, because there's tons and 
94

95
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.450
tons of free options out there, so it actually would rate somewhere in the middle. And with a mobile app game,
95

96
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.070
tons of free options out there, so it actually would rate somewhere in the middle. And with a mobile app game,
96

97
00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:02.410
again, we have low pain, and payment is also quite low.
You rarely pay more than, say, $5 for a mobile app game.
97

98
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.740
again, we have low pain, and payment is also quite low.
You rarely pay more than, say, $5 for a mobile app game.
98

99
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.830
And the last one is accessibility. Accessibility just means,
how easily can you get in contact with these people?
99

100
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.510
And the last one is accessibility. Accessibility just means,
how easily can you get in contact with these people?
100

101
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.740
Are they easy to find?
101

102
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.110
Do they have their contact information posted somewhere?
Are they used to receiving queries from the outside
102

103
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.510
world and responding to them?
To go back to that first example,
103

104
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.830
CEOs of property development companies - very inaccessible.
104

105
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.660
Their information is not going to be public and
if you e-mail them, they're probably not going to respond.
105

106
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.940
Their information is not going to be public and
if you e-mail them, they're probably not going to respond.
106

107
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.000
They are trained to do that.
107

108
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.460
They get too much e-mail and that's not their job,
whereas real estate agents publicly post their information.
108

109
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.480
They get too much e-mail and that's not their job,
whereas real estate agents publicly post their information.
109

110
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:44.710
They do that on purpose and they are very used to
responding quickly to people who inquire from the
110

111
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.680
outside world, because that is part of their job.
111

112
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.540
Alright, and quickly, try to think about each criteria and
each customer group, give them a rating from 1 to 10.
112

113
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.770
Alright, and quickly, try to think about each criteria and
each customer group, give them a rating from 1 to 10.
113

114
00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:01.480
Or if you want to do it based on the card metaphor,
1 through 10 or Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and then at
114

115
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:08.450
the bottom, I want you to add up the value of your hand
or the value of your 1 through 10 total.
115

116
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.770
One of those will have a higher number than the other two.
116

117
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:17.260
And that's how we know this customer group has
the most potential and we're probably going to be the
117

118
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
most successful reaching out to them.
118

119
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.550
Alright. You got it? Just answer the question of
"What problem does your product solve?"
119

120
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.940
Alright. You got it? Just answer the question of
"What problem does your product solve?"
120

121
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.090
Who has that problem?
121

122
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:33.100
And once you have three groups, try to evaluate them
on three criteria: size, pain to payment, and accessibility.
122

123
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.210
And once you have three groups, try to evaluate them
on three criteria: size, pain to payment, and accessibility.
123

124
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.720
All right, now for the post product people. If you are post product, that means you already have
124

125
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.410
an established customer base, you probably have people
who are paying and engaging with your product,
125

126
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.480
and you probably also have a lot of prospective leads and prospective customers that have already established
126

127
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.440
themselves as being interested in your product.
127

128
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.160
In this case, who do you interview?
Well, it's actually relatively simple.
128

129
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.240
In this case, who do you interview?
Well, it's actually relatively simple.
129

130
00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:02.200
Think about the products that you are proposing to launch,
or the feature you're trying to add, or the

131
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.420
problems you are trying to smooth out in your existing product line.
131

132
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:12.070
Try to think of it in terms of your user base, try to apply
basic demographics. Are they older people
132

133
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.140
that you're going to be targeting?
133

134
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.410
Are they younger people? Are they married people?
Are they people that have slow internet?
134

135
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.770
Try to think of basic demographic data, use that information, and then filter out your customer group and reach out to them.
135

136
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.820
Try to think of basic demographic data, use that information, and then filter out your customer group and reach out to them.
136

137
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.380
That one is infinitely easier, because you have a big pile of customers, and you just need to decide which
137

138
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.640
ones are probably going to give you better information.
Whatever problem you're trying to fix or whatever
138

139
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.970
initiative you're trying to run probably pertains to some
defined group within that customer base, and
139

140
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.940
it's your job to pick them out and contact them.

141
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.170
Alright, guys. In the next lecture, we're going to do an
example of playing "Three cards stud" with a real idea.
141

142
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.720
Alright, guys. In the next lecture, we're going to do an
example of playing "Three cards stud" with a real idea.
142

143
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.410
Alright, guys. In the next lecture, we're going to do an
example of playing "Three cards stud" with a real idea.
143

144
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.200
If you guys don't care, you think you got the idea,
skip over that into step two, where we start
144

145
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.700
If you guys don't care, you think you got the idea,
skip over that into step two, where we start
145

146
00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.180
talking about finding potential interviewees.
146

147
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.730
Alright, see you then.
