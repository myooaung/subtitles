00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,640
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So in this lecture we're going to do more feature tables, but we're
1

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,080
going to do it this time from a different angle in a different way.
2

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,340
Now, watching the last few lectures, you probably think that feature tables are only helpful for comparing
3

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:25,020
large products on everything they do to other products and everything they do, and that's not actually the case.
4

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,710
large products on everything they do to other products and everything they do, and that's not actually the case.
5

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,500
The other feature tables, they kind of look like postmortems.
They look like, after you've built your product,
6

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:39,270
you know, what do we need to work on improve or de-prioritize compared to what our other competitors are doing.
7

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,000
you know, what do we need to work on improve or de-prioritize compared to what our other competitors are doing.
8

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,990
And that's really important. As a product manager, you're constantly doing that and you will have a large
9

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,390
product to hold onto, maintain,
and make sure that you're not losing ground.
10

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,910
But how do we use this technique going forward?
11

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,590
Well, let's say we're proposing a feature, proposing a new product. Can we use this as a way to determine
12

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,400
what we should put into our product
or know whether or not it's feasible?
13

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,550
So let's do just that. We're going to use this now for a proposed feature and we'll go back to our other
14

15
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:18,190
example, not GoPro, we're going to use Udemy. Now,
you're using Udemy, online marketplace for education,
15

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,950
anybody can create a course, anybody can take one,
and for the most part they're expensive,
16

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,500
anybody can create a course, anybody can take one,
and for the most part they're expensive,
17

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,920
but they also discount very cheaply.
18

19
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,200
Let's say you're a product manager at Udemy, okay?
19

20
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,780
Let's say you're a product manager at Udemy, okay?
20

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,830
And we're going to imagine that we're going to add
the feature that we had previously, which is group
21

22
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,890
discussions. We think this would be interesting for students to interact with the course in a different way,
22

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,080
discussions. We think this would be interesting for students to interact with the course in a different way,
23

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,540
post discussions, and that way the instructor can post back
or other students can post to it.
24

25
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,300
Now, what would you think would be important to that feature?
25

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,640
So, answer those at home while I make my feature table.
26

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,050
It's going to take a little bit, because this time I want to make sure that the lines are actually somewhat straight.
27

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,630
It's going to take a little bit, because this time I want to make sure that the lines are actually somewhat straight.
28

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,200
Ok, on the left, let's start with some of the aspects that we think would be important in a group discussion
29

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,750
or a lecture discussion feature.
30

31
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,190
What we're going to do is we're going to fill these out and then we're going to fill out our competitors and then
31

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,720
we're going to see what they have and offer
before deciding what we're going to do.
32

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,980
So, the first thing I'd like to ask is,
can you actually post a discussion for a lecture?
33

34
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm assuming some competitors might not actually have that.
34

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,270
Another aspect I think would be important is time markers.
35

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,750
If I put a group discussion, ask a question, can I tie that
specifically to one specific piece of the lecture,
36

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,170
If I put a group discussion, ask a question, can I tie that
specifically to one specific piece of the lecture,
37

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,600
so it's not just generic,
38

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,750
you don't know what you're referring to. The next one I think is important are probably engagement features.
39

40
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,050
If I'm posting, it's a good thing to get other students to post,
and what better way to do that than have things like
40

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,450
If I'm posting, it's a good thing to get other students to post,
and what better way to do that than have things like
41

42
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,840
likes, and shares, and different ways that people can engage and say whether or not they like the content.
42

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:54,910
likes, and shares, and different ways that people can engage and say whether or not they like the content.
43

44
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,230
The next one I think might be important is location.
44

45
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,060
It might be important for a group discussion that
everyone knows where it is and it's prominent,
45

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,760
otherwise people might not use it.
46

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,880
And the last one I'm going to put is post images.
Can you post images?
47

48
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,980
And the last one I'm going to put is post images.
Can you post images?
48

49
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,910
I think that would be interesting and
could make the discussions more enriched,
49

50
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,290
something I would guess that's probably par for the course
for a group discussion tool.
50

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Ok, and so I'm just going to fill out some of the competitors based off of the list that I made before looking for Udemy.
51

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,890
Ok, and so I'm just going to fill out some of the competitors based off of the list that I made before looking for Udemy.
52

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,190
And they're the usual suspects. Skillshare is probably
the first one that comes to mind.
53

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,770
Then we probably have Coursera, which is quite a bit different,
but still a competitor. Then we have Udacity,
54

55
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,750
still a little bit different, but still a direct competitor,
and then the last one is Lynda.
55

56
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,530
If you guys have ever taken a Lynda tutorial course,
56

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,550
those are competitors. Again, the solution is different,
but they go for the same exact people.
57

58
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,200
And then of course we're going to put ourselves at the very end. That's us.
58

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,060
And then of course we're going to put ourselves at the very end. That's us.
59

60
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,310
Ok, so follow along with me, I want to jump into each product and we're going to find the answers. Now, lucky
60

61
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,900
for you, I've already logged into all of these different web sites, created accounts, and now I'm going to get
61

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,910
blasted by them every single day with their
promotional emails, but I'll take the hit.
62

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,250
blasted by them every single day with their
promotional emails, but I'll take the hit.
63

64
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,590
Ok, so this is Skillshare. This is what it looks like.
64

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,550
Ok, so this is Skillshare. This is what it looks like.
65

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,310
This is their viewer player.
Notice how it's different than Udemy?
66

67
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,840
This is their viewer player.
Notice how it's different than Udemy?
67

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,580
Now, let's see. Do they have - this is the question
we're going to answer - a group discussion tool?
68

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,590
Now, let's see. Do they have - this is the question
we're going to answer - a group discussion tool?
69

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,700
Now, let's see. Do they have - this is the question
we're going to answer - a group discussion tool?
70

71
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,380
Oh, there they go. Yep.
71

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh, there they go. Yep.
72

73
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,370
You post group discussions right there.
So the answer to that one is yes.
73

74
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,740
You post group discussions right there.
So the answer to that one is yes.
74

75
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
The second thing I want to put is integrated,
75

76
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,910
meaning that it's integrated into the actual lecture viewer.
It's on the same page.
76

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,430
meaning that it's integrated into the actual lecture viewer.
It's on the same page.
77

78
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,280
Moving on to Coursera. Now, this is what
the Coursera viewer looks like.
78

79
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,900
So, the question is, can you post a group discussion?
79

80
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,440
Looks like you can down here. 
80

81
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,720
You can post right here with a new thread
and these are the discussions.
81

82
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,480
You can post right here with a new thread
and these are the discussions.
82

83
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,230
So I'm going to say yes and, again, I'm going to say integrated.
83

84
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,550
Moving on to Udacity.
84

85
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,610
Ok, this is what their player looks like.
This is a quite snazzy looking player, to be honest.
85

86
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,890
Do they have discussions? Yes, they do.
86

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,590
Do they have discussions? Yes, they do.
87

88
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,600
I just click this. It just kicks me out to a page that looks like this.
88

89
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,110
I just click this. It just kicks me out to a page that looks like this.
89

90
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,380
I can add discussions and it looks like kind of like a forum, ok?
90

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,680
I can add discussions and it looks like kind of like a forum, ok?
91

92
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,740
So I'm going to say yes, but then I'm going to say standalone because it's not actually integrated into the player,
92

93
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,620
you have to hit a button to then get to it in a separate page.
93

94
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,070
All right, and the last one we're going to look at is Lynda.com
and this is what the Lynda player looks like.
94

95
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,900
All right, and the last one we're going to look at is Lynda.com
and this is what the Lynda player looks like.
95

96
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,110
If you guys have used Lynda before, you probably know the answer to this, which is no, they don't have a discussion tool.
96

97
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,550
If you guys have used Lynda before, you probably know the answer to this, which is no, they don't have a discussion tool.
97

98
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:31,480
I've looked through this quite a bit and it doesn't appear.
They have note taking tools, but nothing where
98

99
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,150
I can post a question and have it answered
or talk to other students.
99

100
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,950
Theirs is a little more two dimensional. They're the instructor,
I am the student, and they are not there.
100

101
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,140
Theirs is a little more two dimensional. They're the instructor,
I am the student, and they are not there.
101

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,780
All right, on to the next one. Can we time mark our posts?
So here on Skillshare, yes, you actually can.
102

103
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,390
All right, on to the next one. Can we time mark our posts?
So here on Skillshare, yes, you actually can.
103

104
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,860
All right, on to the next one. Can we time mark our posts?
So here on Skillshare, yes, you actually can.
104

105
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,110
All right, on to the next one. Can we time mark our posts?
So here on Skillshare, yes, you actually can.
105

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,300
It's right here, and you can add a note,
and it will actually time mark where you are,
106

107
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,560
It's right here, and you can add a note,
and it will actually time mark where you are,
107

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,300
and it will reference it specifically. So I'm going to say yes and I'm going to put lecture + time, because I can do either one.
108

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,080
and it will reference it specifically. So I'm going to say yes and I'm going to put lecture + time, because I can do either one.
109

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,200
I can either reference the lecture or have this note reference
the actual second that I made the question.
110

111
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,240
Moving on back over to Coursera.
111

112
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:17,060
Let's look at some of the discussions, and I can tell
pretty easily that no, these are not even attached
112

113
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,400
at all to a lecture or a time, so we're going to say no.
Udacity, let's look at their discussions. Ah, again, it's
113

114
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,540
a standalone, so we go over here.
Let's see... the Linux command line basics.
114

115
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,010
a standalone, so we go over here.
Let's see... the Linux command line basics.
115

116
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,260
Can we tell whether or not they're attached to anything?
116

117
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,670
If you can't tell very quickly, chances are it's not. Ok.
117

118
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,910
If you can't tell very quickly, chances are it's not. Ok.
118

119
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,370
I don't see anything that says what lecture they're talking about.
119

120
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,650
I'm not even totally sure what course they're talking about,
I guess it's that one. So that's a no.
120

121
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,760
I'm not even totally sure what course they're talking about,
I guess it's that one. So that's a no.
121

122
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,920
Lynda, we don't have to fill out, obviously, because they don't have discussions, so we're just going to toss it out.
122

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,520
Lynda, we don't have to fill out, obviously, because they don't have discussions, so we're just going to toss it out.
123

124
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,650
All right, so let's take a tour of the engagement features. Ok.
124

125
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,100
All right, so let's take a tour of the engagement features. Ok.
125

126
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,930
Over here on Skillshare, it looks like I can like and I can reply.
So, relatively simple.
126

127
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,420
Over here on Skillshare, it looks like I can like and I can reply.
So, relatively simple.
127

128
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,060
Doesn't look like we have anything more than that
like mentions, or linking, or threading, or anything like that.
128

129
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,050
Doesn't look like we have anything more than that
like mentions, or linking, or threading, or anything like that.
129

130
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,400
Pretty simple, but they do have engagement features,
so I'm going to say they have the like and the reply.
130

131
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,640
On to Coursera. Let's see what they have.
131

132
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,020
On to Coursera. Let's see what they have.
132

133
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,160
Well, they actually have a bit more. They have upvoting.
133

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,250
Well, they actually have a bit more. They have upvoting.
134

135
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,800
That's actually kind of cool. You can vote on questions and that way the best questions go to the top and that helps everybody.
135

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
That's actually kind of cool. You can vote on questions and that way the best questions go to the top and that helps everybody.
136

137
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,610
And I can also reply directly to them.
137

138
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,120
The other thing I noticed is you can also
follow them right over here, which is interesting.
138

139
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,370
So, if I follow a question and someone answers it,
it will notify me in some way.
139

140
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,030
So I'm going to write down voting, following, and replying.
On to Udacity.
140

141
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,680
Ok, let's see what we can do here. Oh wow, actually quite a lot.
141

142
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,350
Ok, let's see what we can do here. Oh wow, actually quite a lot.
142

143
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,260
Ok, let's see what we can do here. Oh wow, actually quite a lot.
143

144
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,860
Looks like we can reply, we can favorite it, or like it,
we can link to this or share a link to this post, we can bookmark it.
144

145
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,430
Looks like we can reply, we can favorite it, or like it,
we can link to this or share a link to this post, we can bookmark it.
145

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,800
Looks like we can reply, we can favorite it, or like it,
we can link to this or share a link to this post, we can bookmark it.
146

147
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,820
Let's see.
147

148
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,440
That's about it.
148

149
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,800
So those are five features.
149

150
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,450
It's a decent one, so I'm going to write all those down: bookmarking, linking, replying, and liking. As usual, we're going
150

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,020
to cross off Lynda - get your head in the game, Lynda -
and go back to Skillshare.
151

152
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,310
Now, the question is, where is the location?
Remember? It could be important
152

153
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,310
if people can see it, or if it's really close to the player,
or put in a way that everyone's going to
153

154
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,950
use, that could be an important factor in whether or not the feature launch is successful. Well, Skillshare has it down here.
154

155
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,470
use, that could be an important factor in whether or not the feature launch is successful. Well, Skillshare has it down here.
155

156
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,480
So, it's on the same screen that we're going to watch the videos on, but it's below the fold, so I'm going
156

157
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,390
to say below the fold, which means basically it's
below the point where I have to scroll the web page.
157

158
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,660
In Coursera, it's the same thing. If I'm viewing it like this,
158

159
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,780
I have to scroll down, which means that, you know, it's important and it's accessible, but it's not immediately obvious.
159

160
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,260
I have to scroll down, which means that, you know, it's important and it's accessible, but it's not immediately obvious.
160

161
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,750
I have to kind of look for it.
161

162
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,260
Udacity, we remember it's a button over here.
162

163
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,460
It's always present but it's a tab, like a separate tab
I would have to click on and then exit out to go to.
163

164
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,190
It's always present but it's a tab, like a separate tab
I would have to click on and then exit out to go to.
164

165
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,890
And then Lynda.
165

166
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,230
Lynda, Lynda, Lynda... We know what we're going to say.
166

167
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,480
All right, so the last one in Skillshare. Can we post a photo?
167

168
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,980
All right, so the last one in Skillshare. Can we post a photo?
168

169
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,300
I believe you can. There we go.
169

170
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,760
I believe you can. There we go.
170

171
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,400
So, you know, I post something, I can put a photo right there and it'll insert it, kind of look like that - my ugly mug.
171

172
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,360
Coursera. Can you insert photos?
172

173
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,070
Coursera. Can you insert photos?
173

174
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,410
I believe you can as well. There we go.
174

175
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,040
I believe you can as well. There we go.
175

176
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,230
Now, you can see that we have a rich text editor.
You can throw that in there.
176

177
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,450

177

178
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:32,380
Looks like it's the same story here if I were to reply to something.
It would pop up and, again, I can put a whole lot of stuff in here.
178

179
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,960

179

180
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,940
I can even do custom HTML links or I can upload
something there, which is probably like an image.
180

181
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,860
Lynda obviously doesn't do that. Give it a big X.
181

182
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,830
Lynda obviously doesn't do that. Give it a big X.
182

183
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,520
Ok, so now we know what the competitive landscape looks like
with regards to making a discussion button.
183

184
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,820
Ok, so now we know what the competitive landscape looks like
with regards to making a discussion button.
184

185
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:56,530
You at home, ask yourself this question: how would you as Udemy build your discussion tool based off
185

186
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,780
of what you've seen in your competitors?
186

187
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,780
Would you try to beat them on all different categories or would you de-prioritize the group discussion because you think you can't win?
187

188
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,960
Would you try to beat them on all different categories or would you de-prioritize the group discussion because you think you can't win?
188

189
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,050
Or is it the case that you just want to get something there
so you can say you have it?
189

190
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,520
It's entirely up to you as a product manager.
You have to make these strategy decisions.
190

191
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,770
It's entirely up to you as a product manager.
You have to make these strategy decisions.
191

192
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,620
You have the data now to make it, so make your call.
192

193
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,890
Post that in the group discussion, let's talk about it.
193

194
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,810
Post that in the group discussion, let's talk about it.
194

195
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,760
I'd love to see what you guys come up with but for now
I'm going to fill out what Udemy actually does.
195

196
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,900
Can you post a group discussion in Udemy?
196

197
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,660
Let's pretend we're flashing forward. We've
implemented the tool, let's answer the question.
197

198
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,330
Let's pretend we're flashing forward. We've
implemented the tool, let's answer the question.
198

199
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,410
Let's pretend we're flashing forward. We've
implemented the tool, let's answer the question.
199

200
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,080
So can you? Yes, you can.
200

201
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,510
So can you? Yes, you can.
201

202
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,490
It's right there when you're using the viewer and it is integrated.
202

203
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,310
Can you add time markings?
203

204
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,360
No, actually you cannot, sadly,
but you can reference the lecture.
204

205
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,970
So, I would say no, but you can reference lectures.
What engagement features do they have? Sadly, they
205

206
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,130
only have the basics, like and reply, but they do have
a search feature, which I did not see on any of the
206

207
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,200
other ones. We can search through discussions and
look for ones that we want. Location, it is prominent.
207

208
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,850
other ones. We can search through discussions and
look for ones that we want. Location, it is prominent.
208

209
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,820
It takes up like one third of the screen and it's directly on the right. When you log into a course, it's 
209

210
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,390
like the first thing you will see right there, hard to ignore it.
210

211
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,120
like the first thing you will see right there, hard to ignore it.
211

212
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,400
And can you post images? Yes, you can.
212

213
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,010
And can you post images? Yes, you can.
213

214
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,930
Some of you guys don't ever seem to take advantage
of that and it makes me sad, but you can.
214

215
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,980
Some of you guys don't ever seem to take advantage
of that and it makes me sad, but you can.
215

216
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,650
Ok, there you go. Now we've made a table for our features.
216

217
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,750
Ok, there you go. Now we've made a table for our features.
217

218
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,410
Ok, now we can do the post-mortem and decide: do we need to make changes to the feature we've already implemented?
218

219
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,550
Ok, now we can do the post-mortem and decide: do we need to make changes to the feature we've already implemented?
219

220
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,850
Is it important? How far away are we from becoming
the best in this category and should we care?
220

221
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,490
All right, guys, in the next couple of lectures we're going to talk about analyzing your competitors,
221

222
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,360
things to keep in mind as a product manager to make sure
you're looking in the right direction.
222

223
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,150
See you in the next lecture.
