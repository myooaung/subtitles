Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.670
So, in this lecture, we're going to talk about what are
some of the best practices with regards to talking
2

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.660
to your customers and running customer interviews.
3

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.870
Now, you need to talk to your customers in order to
make, create products, that is unavoidable, but in
4

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.430
order to collect the right information and get the
right signals for your product, you need to know how
5

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.260
to talk to your customers and what not to do.
6

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.100
Now, customer interviews are not as intuitive as you think.
You might think that the point of a customer
7

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.720
interview is to just sit down, have a conversation,
talk to them about your product, see how they react,
8

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.070
interview is to just sit down, have a conversation,
talk to them about your product, see how they react,
9

10
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.600
pitch them on whatever new feature or idea
you're rolling around in your head.
10

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.180
Now, that's not even remotely true.
11

12
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.870
The only thing that was true in that is that
you are sitting down what the customer.
12

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.520
I would hardly call it a conversation.
It is an interview.
13

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.170
I would hardly call it a conversation.
It is an interview.
14

15
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.350
Now, what's the actual purpose of running a customer interview?
15

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.120
Well, it's to get the most real and accurate information
as you can from your customer.
16

17
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.670
If you just sit down and start rattling off pitches,
and if you domineer the conversation or act the
17

18
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.690
same way as you would in any other normal conversation,
you will not get accurate or real information.
18

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.830
same way as you would in any other normal conversation,
you will not get accurate or real information.
19

20
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.040
So, I'm going to go over for applicable best practices to
help you understand how to run a customer interview 
20

21
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980
and what you should do.
21

22
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.270
First of all, let's tackle the misconception that when you run a customer interview your topic is going to be your product.
22

23
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.690
First of all, let's tackle the misconception that when you run a customer interview your topic is going to be your product.
23

24
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.810
It's actually not. When you talk to your customers, you want to
talk to them about their problems and their needs.
24

25
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.240
It's actually not. When you talk to your customers, you want to
talk to them about their problems and their needs.
25

26
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.700
You rarely - if ever - will talk about the solution.
26

27
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.760
If you're talking about your solution directly with the customer,
the information you're going to get
27

28
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.530
it's going to be limited and it's not going to help you
understand the why, the deeper level of why they
28

29
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.400
make certain decisions, why they think a certain way.
29

30
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.410
There's a great quote about talking to your customers,
and that's "Customers might not know what they
30

31
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.380
want, but they can't hide what they need."
31

32
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.410
So, when you talk about the solution, you're talking about
what they want, and they often don't know what
32

33
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.910
exactly they want or how in an accurate way to
process that information or describe it.
33

34
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.610
But their needs are as simple as it gets.
34

35
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.890
Anyone can talk about what problems they have or what they need.
35

36
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.400
And we care, because those conversations are much,
much richer than a conversation about the surface of
36

37
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.580
a solution and whether or not it looks nice.
37

38
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.420
The second thing you need to understand is that
you are here to ask questions and not really direct
38

39
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.760
conversation or give your own opinions or your own thoughts.
39

40
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.740
In general, the ratio between how much a customer
is going to talk and how much you talk in one of these
40

41
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.970
interviews, it should be 95% or 90% to 10% or 5%.
It is very, very skewed.
41

42
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.470
interviews, it should be 95% or 90% to 10% or 5%.
It is very, very skewed.
42

43
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.950
You want to set this up so that you ask one question
and that question leads to your customer talking
43

44
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.500
about multiple things in detail.
44

45
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.670
The point here is that you want to get them to talk.
45

46
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.820
One of my favorite rules about customer development
or customer interviews is "the point is to get off
46

47
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.640
point." Basically what that means is that, don't worry
about whether or not they're answering the question
47

48
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.970
the exact way that you expected them to or going
onto the topics that you wanted them to.
48

49
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.680
You have to embrace the idea of tangents. Sometimes you'll ask
a customer a question, they'll answer it or they might not,
49

50
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.000
You have to embrace the idea of tangents. Sometimes you'll ask
a customer a question, they'll answer it or they might not,
50

51
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.970
and then they'll go off on their own and start telling
a story, or an anecdote, or something that's entirely
51

52
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.930
not related. And you've got to understand that tangents
are good, sometimes they're even goldmines.
52

53
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.930
Sometimes the best ideas come from your customers
going off the cuff, off the record, saying things
53

54
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.870
that you never would have thought to ask.
54

55
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.890
The third thing is make sure that you create an
environment where they feel comfortable talking.
55

56
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.650
That means creating a rapport with them.
56

57
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.630
Don't run a customer interview where you just sit down with them and immediately start asking them detailed questions.
57

58
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.620
Don't run a customer interview where you just sit down with them and immediately start asking them detailed questions.
58

59
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.530
Make sure that they are comfortable with you.
59

60
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.670
Make sure that you at least feign some effort
that you are interested in them
60

61
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.190
outside of this interview, make sure that you're comfortable
in conversation before you actually start.
61

62
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.420
outside of this interview, make sure that you're comfortable
in conversation before you actually start.
62

63
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.380
Along those lines, don't ask them questions that would
be hard for them to answer in person, or make them
63

64
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.250
feel awkward or nervous to answer in person.
64

65
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.810
Also, when they give you negative feedback, don't react negatively.
65

66
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.120
Don't defend the product or the idea that you were projecting.
When they give you negative feedback, they're testing you.
66

67
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.370
Don't defend the product or the idea that you were projecting.
When they give you negative feedback, they're testing you.
67

68
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.930
And if you respond negatively, that has
a chilling effect on the rest of the interview.
68

69
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:17.010
They're much less likely to give you truthful, honest
information in the future, because they don't want
69

70
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.270
to have the confrontation or the argument.
When you respond in a neutral, non-judgmental way, they all
70

71
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.170
then realize that it's okay to tell the truth.
71

72
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.510
The last thing is don't force these conversations, try to guide them.
Depending on what type of interview you're doing,
72

73
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.900
The last thing is don't force these conversations, try to guide them.
Depending on what type of interview you're doing,
73

74
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.270
whether it's exploratory, validation, satisfaction, or efficiency,
74

75
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.470
you probably have a focus in mind, you probably have
some questions you want to answer and some topics
75

76
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.820
that you want to spend time on.
76

77
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:56.220
But don't be forceful and forcing them onto that subject.
If you allow them to graze in areas that
77

78
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.590
they actually care about, and then naturally guide them
in the direction of what you want to talk about,
78

79
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.110
they actually care about, and then naturally guide them
in the direction of what you want to talk about,
79

80
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.290
you'll end up in a situation where they give you a lot more information and they feel a lot more comfortable.
80

81
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.620
you'll end up in a situation where they give you a lot more information and they feel a lot more comfortable.
81

82
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.800
You also don't want to risk the chance that, in the process
of getting to the topic that you wanted to
82

83
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.100
talk about, they could have brought up many, many
interesting things you never would have thought of.
83

84
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.730
So, if you keep those things in mind, you will have a
much better chance of running a successful interview.
84

85
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.920
So, if you keep those things in mind, you will have a
much better chance of running a successful interview.
85

86
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.570
And if you get to a point where you're having trouble
talking to the customer, you don't know what to ask,
86

87
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.600
And if you get to a point where you're having trouble
talking to the customer, you don't know what to ask,
87

88
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.360
you don't really know what's going to get them
to respond in a more open, fruitful way,
88

89
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.720
use this one that I use all the time,
my favorite sentence any time I'm stuck,
89

90
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.980
use this one that I use all the time,
my favorite sentence any time I'm stuck,
90

91
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.920
I don't even know what to say, is
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
91

92
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.020
I don't even know what to say, is
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
92

93
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.320
And if you ever find yourself lost in this process, not sure
what direction is up and what direction is down,
93

94
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.310
And if you ever find yourself lost in this process, not sure
what direction is up and what direction is down,
94

95
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.010
just keep in mind the five W framework - I'm sure you've
heard of it, but you probably haven't heard of
95

96
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:10.270
it used in the context of product management - which is,
What? Why? Who? When? and Where? That is,
96

97
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:20.610
you are always, as a product manager, striving to answer 
the five questions and get a better, deeper understanding
97

98
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.150
of what they mean for your product and your customer.
98

99
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.400
And these questions are, "Who are your customers?"
"What are their habits?"
99

100
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.890
And these questions are, "Who are your customers?"
"What are their habits?"
100

101
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.690
"When do they use your product?"
"Where do they need your product?"
101

102
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.930
"When do they use your product?"
"Where do they need your product?"
102

103
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.880
The last and most important one:
"Why do they need your product?"
103

104
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.870
The last and most important one:
"Why do they need your product?"
104

105
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.980
Customer development and customer interviews are really just a process of filling in the gaps of your knowledge of the five W's.
105

106
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.610
Customer development and customer interviews are really just a process of filling in the gaps of your knowledge of the five W's.
106

107
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.380
The more conversations you have with your customers,
the more you'll be able to fill in the five W's
107

108
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:59.430
and have a better, more holistic understanding of what
your product is, its impact, and why people are using it.
108

109
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.390
and have a better, more holistic understanding of what
your product is, its impact, and why people are using it.
109

110
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.780
All right, guys.
110

111
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.900
Now that you know some of the bigger picture of what
makes these interviews successful, what are they like,
111

112
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.530
Now that you know some of the bigger picture of what
makes these interviews successful, what are they like,
112

113
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.830
what are you thinking about,
and how to keep your eye on the prize,
113

114
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.170
we're going to talk a little bit more about the specifics.
We're going to talk about good questions and bad questions.
114

115
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.920
we're going to talk a little bit more about the specifics.
We're going to talk about good questions and bad questions.
115

116
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.360
They make a huge difference in your interviews.
116

117
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.990
All right, see you then.
