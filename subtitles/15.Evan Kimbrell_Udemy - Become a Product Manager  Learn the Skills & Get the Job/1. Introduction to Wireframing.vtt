Hey guys, welcome back to the course and welcome
to the new section on conceptualizing your ideas.
1

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.710
If you want to build a great product,
you first have to conceptualize it.
2

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.720
And any great product, it's a result of a long process
of development and refinement.
3

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.250
And any great product, it's a result of a long process
of development and refinement.
4

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.290
No product can stand on its own without a
well thought out and well built foundation.
5

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.080
And with that in mind, we're going to learn one of the crucial skills for conceptualizing your idea and communicating it.
6

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.120
And with that in mind, we're going to learn one of the crucial skills for conceptualizing your idea and communicating it.
7

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.700
Wireframing. Now, what is a wireframe?
8

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.720
Some of you guys have heard of this before.
9

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.530
Feel free to skip this lecture.
10

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.850
But for those of you who do not know what it is,
a wireframe is a visual guide for a web site, web app,
11

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:51.200
or mobile app that basically lays out a rough structure
for where the content is going to go. When you're
12

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.480
making a web app, or a mobile app, or just a regular old web site,
13

14
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.030
what is the first thing you do
14

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.330
long before you have anything actually built,
and anything to actually play with?
15

16
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.950
Well, the first thing you usually do is you wireframe it.
16

17
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.110
Now, why do we make wire frames?
17

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.460
Well, when you first come up with your product idea or your feature idea, you're in what we call the design phase. In the design phase,
18

19
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.280
Well, when you first come up with your product idea or your feature idea, you're in what we call the design phase. In the design phase,
19

20
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
everything's kind of up in the air. Feature ideas are thrown around,
20

21
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.030
you don't know exactly what's going to go in it,
it's very abstract, it's very amorphous. Wireframing
21

22
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.950
is usually the first step you will take in corralling
that information that's in everyone's head and
22

23
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.800
what's been communicated only verbally up until this point
onto something that is definite and precise.
23

24
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.100
what's been communicated only verbally up until this point
onto something that is definite and precise.
24

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.340
Think of it as the first rough translation of a product idea.
And specifically, when you start wireframing,
25

26
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.830
you're going to start wireframing with what we call
a low fidelity wireframe - low fidelity in this
26

27
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.750
case just meaning not very exact, not a lot of detail, not very precise. So it's: fidelity being accuracy, low - low accuracy.
27

28
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.360
case just meaning not very exact, not a lot of detail, not very precise. So it's: fidelity being accuracy, low - low accuracy.
28

29
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.070
These versions are very basic.
29

30
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.390
They're created really quickly and they're really just meant
to test broad concepts and define the overall
30

31
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.220
vision for what we're trying to build.
31

32
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.540
The idea here is that we're going to paint with broad strokes
and this is going to allow us to then
32

33
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.120
go and do some user research collect some feedback
internally, as well as from potential users,
33

34
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.060
and then, over time, we can slowly define more and more
of the product or feature, and really start
34

35
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.620
to figure out what it does, how it does it, and what it looks like.
35

36
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.350
Generally, teams have a very iterative process with wireframing, and as they gather more and more
36

37
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.440
feedback, they're going to add more and more fidelity,
37

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.140
they're going to add more detail to the actual mockup.
38

39
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.850
We'll go from things like broad sketches of a circle
that just says "button" to a circle that actually
39

40
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.780
has shape, that says "Sign up" or whatever the button's actually supposed to do, to a button that is actually designed.
40

41
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.030
has shape, that says "Sign up" or whatever the button's actually supposed to do, to a button that is actually designed.
41

42
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.200
You'll go from things like writing scribble text,
like Lorem Ipsum, or just gibberish, to writing out
42

43
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.140
a rough outline of what the content should say, to writing out the actual finished copywriting that should go on the website.
43

44
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.060
a rough outline of what the content should say, to writing out the actual finished copywriting that should go on the website.
44

45
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.950
You'll go through that process, and eventually you'll land at the top of the high fidelity curve, and your mockups at that point,
45

46
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.230
You'll go through that process, and eventually you'll land at the top of the high fidelity curve, and your mockups at that point,
46

47
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.320
if you took a glance at them, you might not know
that they were not functional.
47

48
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.910
They'll have graphic design,
48

49
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.800
they'll have the lay out and the information pretty much decided.
Now, do product managers themselves wireframe?
49

50
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.990
they'll have the lay out and the information pretty much decided.
Now, do product managers themselves wireframe?
50

51
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.740
Well, it actually just depends. If you're on a smaller team, like a startup, you probably will be required to do some wireframing.
51

52
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.740
Well, it actually just depends. If you're on a smaller team, like a startup, you probably will be required to do some wireframing.
52

53
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.330
That's just because small teams are going to wear a lot more hats and it's kind of an all hands on deck type situation. If you can do it,
53

54
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.300
That's just because small teams are going to wear a lot more hats and it's kind of an all hands on deck type situation. If you can do it,
54

55
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.930
they're going to ask you to do it. Now, as you move up organizations,
and they get larger, and larger, and
55

56
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.370
larger, your role is going to become more defined and it's going to become more narrow. In those type of situations,
56

57
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.010
you might not be asked to wireframe, it kind of just
depends on the company, but you will need familiarity
57

58
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.360
with wireframing. Typically, what's going to happen
with a product manager in a larger company is that
58

59
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.130
you will be asked to sit down with graphic designers
and together create wireframes, and you will have
59

60
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.790
to contribute to it, but you won't have to be an expert,
or be super polished with the UX skill.
60

61
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.330
Another common scenario is that you might yourself
have to sketch out an idea that you want to propose,
61

62
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.850
because you don't want to take up resources from other
people who can make it in a more fidelity way.
62

63
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.050
because you don't want to take up resources from other
people who can make it in a more fidelity way.
63

64
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.720
So if you want to be effective as a product manager
or as an entrepreneur in web or mobile technology,
64

65
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.460
you need to know how to communicate complex feature and product ideas, and wireframing is the way we
65

66
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.340
do that. You don't have to be a UX guru,
66

67
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.070
you don't have to grow a goatee or anything, but you will
be expected to know the basics, and maybe, in a pinch,
67

68
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.660
you don't have to grow a goatee or anything, but you will
be expected to know the basics, and maybe, in a pinch,
68

69
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.260
whip up some wireframes yourself.
69

70
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.480
So in the first half of the section, we're going to focus
on getting you up to speed with wireframes, show
70

71
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.750
you how, with a very little time investment, get in, get out,
and learn to be dangerous. And, hey, worst case scenario,
71

72
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.310
you how, with a very little time investment, get in, get out,
and learn to be dangerous. And, hey, worst case scenario,
72

73
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.210
you now have a skill that you can impress your coworkers with,
and you don't have to bug people every
73

74
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.220
time you want to draft something up.
74

75
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.470
All right. See you in the next lecture.
75

76
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.390
All right. See you in the next lecture.
