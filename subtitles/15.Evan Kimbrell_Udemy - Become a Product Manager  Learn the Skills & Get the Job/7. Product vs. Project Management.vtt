Hey everyone, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.730
So you might be wondering to yourself, "What is the difference between product and project management?"
2

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.440
So you might be wondering to yourself, "What is the difference between product and project management?"
3

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
Believe it or not, there are a lot of people out there that think these things are one and the same.
4

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.980
In fact, they are not. The roles, that is the job titles of product manager and project manager are very, very different.
5

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.240
In fact, they are not. The roles, that is the job titles of product manager and project manager are very, very different.
6

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.250
However, Project Management as a skill is definitely something you will still need as a product manager.
7

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.390
However, Project Management as a skill is definitely something you will still need as a product manager.
8

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.490
So let's dive right in and talk about the differences between these two.
9

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.970
We already know that product managers are responsible for the success of a product, but are they accountable
10

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.690
and what does success mean?
11

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.480
Well, success is defined by KPIs or metrics. A product manager is responsible for being successful
12

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.610
by reaching certain metrics.
13

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.380
And don't worry too much about that right now, 
14

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.200
we're going have a whole section on metrics later.
15

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.520
So anyways, PMs have a metrics goal
16

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.950
that means success, and they need to reach that goal, and the method by which they reach that goal is not defined.
17

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.360
that means success, and they need to reach that goal, and the method by which they reach that goal is not defined.
18

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
It is totally up to them and their team to decide how they want to achieve that goal.
19

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.520
I'll give you an example here.
20

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.140
Let's say I run an e-commerce company and I hire you as a product manager.
21

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.820
I tell you that I want to increase check out conversion percent by 10 percent this quarter.
22

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.670
You can go off and do user research,
23

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.390
look at all the data, any number of other things that you might want to do to decide how you're
24

25
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960
going to approach solving that problem or reaching that goal.
25

26
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.420
OK, so you might decide to redesign the checkout process because users don't understand it.
26

27
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.850
OK, so you might decide to redesign the checkout process because users don't understand it.
27

28
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.000
Or maybe you decide to put in faster servers because the site is a little bit slow and you find out that
28

29
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.030
it being so slow drops the conversion percentage, because so many people leave before they check
29

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.260
out. No matter which of these approaches you pick,
30

31
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.630
you succeed because you get that 10 percent.
31

32
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.600
However, as you probably already know, one of these approaches is going to be better than the other.
32

33
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.720
However, as you probably already know, one of these approaches is going to be better than the other.
33

34
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.120
That all depends on the upfront research and user testing that you do with you and your designer and the rest of your team.
34

35
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.970
That all depends on the upfront research and user testing that you do with you and your designer and the rest of your team.
35

36
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520
OK. So how about a project manager?
36

37
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620
OK. So how about a project manager?
37

38
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.870
Well, a project manager is different because they are simply responsible for accomplishing a project,
38

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.140
not a goal, and a project usually has a timeline and a budget as a constraint.
39

40
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.630
Project managers are extremely important for rigid things,
like, let's say, building a skyscraper.
40

41
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.750
If I'm the CEO of a construction company and I hired a project manager to build a skyscraper, I would
41

42
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.810
want to hire a very good project manager to get the job done on time, on budget, and I want to know that
42

43
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.840
that person knows how to best react to things like weather delays, or supply shortages, or that sort of thing.
43

44
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.550
that person knows how to best react to things like weather delays, or supply shortages, or that sort of thing.
44

45
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.310
What I would not want in this instance is someone that's acting like a product manager and saying that
45

46
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.090
"I want to build a building that's, you know, 100 stories tall, and holds 10,000 people," and the product
46

47
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.380
manager can kind of do it however they feel like they're going to accomplish that goal because, again,
47

48
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.990
product managers and their teams are doing a lot of experimenting to see what will work best,
48

49
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.950
and you definitely don't want to be experimenting
when you're building a skyscraper.
49

50
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.380
You want to know for sure that
the way you plan to do it is going to work.
50

51
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.690
Now, like I said before, as a product manager you definitely need to know the skill of project management,
51

52
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.640
because on the front end you are collecting requirements and ideas and defining potential future initiatives
52

53
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.700
and then you're actually putting those things into development, you're putting them into,
53

54
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.380
you go into execution mode with your team.
At that point,
54

55
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.000
you do need to know how to project manage things,
at least in a software sense.
55

56
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.310
Don't worry though, later in the course we talk about project management and we have several lectures
56

57
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.030
that go through the various components of project management as a product manager working in a software world.
57

58
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.620
that go through the various components of project management as a product manager working in a software world.
58

59
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.420
Now, once again, what I want to say is that project managers aren't totally useless in software, and in fact
59

60
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.120
there's a lot of things that they're useful for outside of building skyscrapers, and bridges, and that sort of thing.
60

61
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.830
there's a lot of things that they're useful for outside of building skyscrapers, and bridges, and that sort of thing.
61

62
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.680
Can you think of any types of software engineering projects where project managers are completely necessary?
62

63
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.380
Can you think of any types of software engineering projects where project managers are completely necessary?
63

64
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.060
How about when two tech companies combine together and they want to merge their technology platforms?
64

65
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.780
How about when two tech companies combine together and they want to merge their technology platforms?
65

66
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.440
That's already kind of known, how this is going to work, how they're going to merge together,
66

67
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.790
otherwise the companies probably
wouldn't have merged in the first place.
67

68
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:55.890
But there's so many moving pieces here that someone needs to be checking in constantly and making sure
68

69
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.170
that things are happening on time.
69

70
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.330
There's another example where project management is a little more prominent and maybe useful than product management.
70

71
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.930
There's another example where project management is a little more prominent and maybe useful than product management.
71

72
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:12.020
Take, for instance, an agency, like a software consulting agency, or an ad agency, or something.
72

73
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.570
Clients will come up to them and say, "We want you to make a campaign" or "We want you to make a particular
73

74
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.090
piece of software" and kind of everything is defined
on what needs to be built.
74

75
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.160
So then it becomes, again, that execution mode where the project manager really just needs to make sure
75

76
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.180
everything is executed on budget, on time, and there's not a lot of experimenting to try to do things
76

77
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.030
differently or reach a particular goal.
77

78
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.530
Okay. 
78

79
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.070
So that wasn't so hard, was it? There's a really big difference between product management and project
79

80
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:55.020
management, and we know that there is some project management inside the role of product management.
80

81
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:03.000
But as far as careers go and having those titles as a profession, they are two completely separate things.
81

82
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.090
But as far as careers go and having those titles as a profession, they are two completely separate things.
82

83
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.320
Brief recap. Product managers are responsible for accomplishing a goal by any means they feel will be best.
83

84
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.800
Brief recap. Product managers are responsible for accomplishing a goal by any means they feel will be best.
84

85
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.410
After they consult and collaborate with their team, and do user research, and all sorts of stuff like
85

86
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:27.120
that, and project managers are responsible for accomplishing a set of things which is usually do these
86

87
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.840
requirements on this project either in a physical world, like a bridge, or a building, or on big pieces
87

88
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.200
of software, and then do it within this time frame and on this budget.
88

89
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.700
of software, and then do it within this time frame and on this budget.
89

90
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.930
Okay, so I will see you guys in the next lecture.
