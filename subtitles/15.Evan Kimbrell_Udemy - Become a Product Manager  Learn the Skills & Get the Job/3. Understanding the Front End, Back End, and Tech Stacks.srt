00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,270
What's up? You've probably heard of the terms
front-end, back-end, and tech stack before.
1

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,270
So let's demystify these real quick.
It's not hard, it won't take us very long.
2

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,310
So let's demystify these real quick.
It's not hard, it won't take us very long.
3

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,240
So let's demystify these real quick.
It's not hard, it won't take us very long.
4

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,280
So let's demystify these real quick.
It's not hard, it won't take us very long.
5

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,710
So we already talked about the Internet and how it works.
6

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,740
We know that when I type in google.com, my laptop
or phone, or smart internet fridge, or whatever else
7

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,650
is on the internet of things these days,
8

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,680
yeah, it connects to the Google servers through the internet.
9

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,050
If I use a web browser like Google Chrome and I go
to google.com and do a search, the web browser
10

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,820
on my laptop asks Google for the data I requested
and shows me the results that Google sends back.
11

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,590
Okay, in all of this, there's a couple things going on here
12

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay, in all of this, there's a couple things going on here
13

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,400
from the technology perspective, and I don't mean
the internet, I mean the code. Google is figuring out
14

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,870
what I'm requesting from them,
15

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,440
whatever I typed into the search bar, they're getting
that information from their database, and then
16

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,410
when they send it back to my web browser,
they're showing me the results.
17

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:12,780
Each of these levels has programming behind it that is often
referred to as front-end, back-end, and application layer.
18

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,260
Each of these levels has programming behind it that is often
referred to as front-end, back-end, and application layer.
19

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,920
So look, front-end is just a fancy term for
what the users see and interact with.
20

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,430
This is colors, text, and interactions I see on the webpage.
21

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,450
So there are programming languages that make up the front-end,
and they're most commonly used for the front-end,
22

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,260
especially on the internet things, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
23

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,040
We're not going to go into those too much, but I'll
give you a super brief primer. HTML, you can think of,
24

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,160
like, the structure and content of a web site,
25

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,890
so it's the actual text. CSS is a language that is used
for styling that text and that structure.
26

27
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,680
So, okay, this font should be this color, and this big, and
this is how pictures should be stretched across the page.
27

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,630
So, okay, this font should be this color, and this big, and
this is how pictures should be stretched across the page.
28

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,870
And then you've got JavaScript, and that one is basically
in charge of the interactivity on the web site.
29

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,900
And then you've got JavaScript, and that one is basically
in charge of the interactivity on the web site.
30

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,160
So, okay, when I click this button, it does this little animation,
or when the user types this, this happens over
31

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,810
here before it goes to the servers, that's what
JavaScript is doing. Anyways,
32

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,740
here before it goes to the servers, that's what
JavaScript is doing. Anyways,
33

34
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,800
those are the three that really make up most web front-ends.
34

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,110
All right.
35

36
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,480
So back-end is a fancy term for information servers and databases that are located somewhere else - in the back-end.
36

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,160
So back-end is a fancy term for information servers and databases that are located somewhere else - in the back-end.
37

38
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,020
So the technology that is used in the back-end is
things like MySQL, which is a database language,
38

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:46,140
combined with technology that hosts that database on
the internet, like Amazon S3. Amazon S3 is basically
39

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,000
servers for rent, basically that Amazon host, and
anyone can really just go in and sort of rent a server
40

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,710
from Amazon on the internet.
41

42
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,030
And this has, by the way, contributed to how quickly internet businesses have been able to grow or test
42

43
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:08,190
things without spending too much money, because in
the old days, you used to have to buy that server yourself, install
43

44
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,830
it, and put code on it, and all that sort of thing.
44

45
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:19,650
Now you just go to, like, Amazon AWS, Amazon Web Services,
and you just type in, "Okay, I want an S3 server
45

46
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,260
on the internet, I can put my code on it, and I can run
a website without actually ever owning a server myself."
46

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,980
on the internet, I can put my code on it, and I can run
a website without actually ever owning a server myself."
47

48
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,530
Anyways, you might have heard that first term I mentioned, SQL.
48

49
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:40,110
I mentioned MySQL, but it's spelled M-Y-S-Q-L,
and the term SQL is also talked about a lot as
49

50
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,070
a query language, because SQL itself is a query language.
50

51
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,320
So if you hear SQL, or MySQL, they could be
talking about a query language.
51

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,670
This is just a way that we can structure a request to
a MySQL database to get information back.
52

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,020
By that, I mean, quite literally, a lot of people at
tech companies know how to query SQL.
53

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,960
They will say "Hmm, I wonder how many users we have
as of today?" and will just enter in a SQL query, and
54

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,250
something like "select all from the user database, count
55

56
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,870
number of users" and that will just spit out a number,
and says "Well, here's all the users in the database."
56

57
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,880
It's relatively simple to learn, so I do recommend you check it out.
57

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,470
Okay, so what if there's five different screens on
an app that all pull data from one database?
58

59
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,200
How does the front-end know where to get that data, or what if
it needs to do some sort of logic or calculation on it?
59

60
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,690
How does the front-end know where to get that data, or what if
it needs to do some sort of logic or calculation on it?
60

61
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,820
This is where the application layer comes in.
61

62
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:53,070
So the application layer is just a term for some code
or programming that does calculations to the data
62

63
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,410
from the front-end or the back-end and it sends it to the right place.
63

64
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,890
You can think of it as being in between
the front-end and the back-end,
64

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,780
but in reality you just have the front-end and the
back-end, but the application layer is the code,
65

66
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:13,350
and it usually lives on the front-end or the back-end,
but it's not always consistent, you know, where it lives.
66

67
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,150
and it usually lives on the front-end or the back-end,
but it's not always consistent, you know, where it lives.
67

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,550
All of this stuff really just has to do with how
the product or the app is programmed.
68

69
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,370
All right, let's go a little bit deeper into that.
69

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,920
If I'm using a web site like Amazon and I do a search
for products from highest price to lowest price,
70

71
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,520
the application layer takes my search,
71

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,280
it talks to the database, it gets the items I'm interested
in from the database, and then sorts them in
72

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,720
the correct order for the front-end to display
to me in my web browser.
73

74
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,300
The web browser is interpreting the front-end code
that gets generated and showing it to me.
74

75
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,480
So there's a lot of programming languages out there and
there's a lot of them that are used for this application layer.
75

76
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,050
So there's a lot of programming languages out there and
there's a lot of them that are used for this application layer.
76

77
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,570
Some examples though are things like Ruby, Python, or PHP.
77

78
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,580
You've probably heard of Ruby, by the way, because
you might have heard the phrase Ruby on Rails.
78

79
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,620
Well, that's not the same as Ruby,
but Rails is a framework for Ruby.
79

80
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,110
Anyways, I'm not going to talk about frameworks
right now, but we will talk about them,
80

81
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,950
I just wanted you to know that if you've heard it, that's why.
81

82
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,990
Okay, so we've got a good overview of the front-end,
the back-end, and the middle part or the calculations,
82

83
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,670
which is called the application layer.
83

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,780
So what is a tech stack?
84

85
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,150
All right.
85

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,060
A tech stack is just a way of saying the programming
languages or technology that make up a web site
86

87
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,600
or app from the front-end all the way to the back-end.
87

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Some products use different databases or languages
to program the product and all the stuff that happens
88

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:52,230
there than others, because some languages have advantages
over others for certain types of work or services.
89

90
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,370
there than others, because some languages have advantages
over others for certain types of work or services.
90

91
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,740
If you applied this whole tech stack concept to cars,
it would basically be the same as describing which
91

92
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,500
type of engine, tires, transmission, and what
kind of metal your car is built out of.
92

93
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,350
It's basically the same concept. Alright, easy stuff.
93

94
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,170
It's basically the same concept. Alright, easy stuff.
94

95
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,210
But one thing I want to mention lastly here is that
all of the stuff I've been talking about is the
95

96
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,240
same with mobile devices and mobile apps,
96

97
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,840
except that sometimes, instead of a web browser on a
mobile phone, like an iPhone or Android, you're using
97

98
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:32,220
a native mobile app, and instead of those, they have
mobile apps using HTML, and CSS, and JavaScript in
98

99
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:41,700
a web browser, the app likely uses a language like
Swift or, yeah, Swift is for iPhones, or Java for Android.
99

100
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,030
a web browser, the app likely uses a language like
Swift or, yeah, Swift is for iPhones, or Java for Android.
100

101
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,370
So those, in the case of mobile, serve as
the front-ends for mobile devices.
101

102
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,580
All right. Quick recap here.
102

103
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,610
All right. Quick recap here.
103

104
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,200
The front-end is what users see and interact with,
with buttons, text, and colors.
104

105
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,170
The back-end holds all the information in a database
on the internets, and somewhere in between there's
105

106
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,760
some code that basically does some calculations
and sends things back and forth to the right places,
106

107
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:05,970
some code that basically does some calculations
and sends things back and forth to the right places,
107

108
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,530
and this is called the application layer.
108

109
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:16,350
All right, the next logical topic to talk about is APIs,
and you're going to be using a lot of that in
109

110
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,380
product management, you'll hear it all the time.
110

111
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,630
So let's get to it. I'll see you in the next lecture.
111

112
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,600
So let's get to it. I'll see you in the next lecture.
