What's up, everybody?
1

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.420
So this section is all about your resume and interviewing
as a product manager, and this lecture is about
2

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.930
your resume and how we're going to optimize it to have
a better chance at getting a product management 
3

4
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.990
job. So, resumes, in general,
4

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.910
it's true, not as important as they used to be, but you
still have got to have one unfortunately, and you need
5

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.610
to make it the best you can to optimize
your chances for getting a job,
6

7
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.120
especially in product management, because it's pretty
hard to get a job as one. If you don't have any prior
7

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.740
product management experience,
8

9
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.830
what's important here is to frame the experience you
do have in a way that relates to getting that PM job.
9

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.480
what's important here is to frame the experience you
do have in a way that relates to getting that PM job.
10

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.600
So we're going to talk about two ways to optimize
your resume here, and they're pretty simple.
11

12
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.130
So we're going to talk about two ways to optimize
your resume here, and they're pretty simple.
12

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.430
All right, step one. If you haven't already,
13

14
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.610
go back and watch that lecture on preparing for the
PM role with relevant experience, and think through
14

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.020
all of the times you've done something at your current job,
15

16
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.550
even if you're not a product manager, because it's
probably got some stuff in it that does relate
16

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.230
to product management.
17

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.340
Once you've done that, go through and edit the subtext of each position you've held on your resume and make it reflect that
18

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.810
Once you've done that, go through and edit the subtext of each position you've held on your resume and make it reflect that
19

20
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.110
product management experience that you found
using the exercise we did in that lecture.
20

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.620
So, step two. Make sure that all of the descriptions in
your previous positions, and even the current one,
21

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.640
So, step two. Make sure that all of the descriptions in
your previous positions, and even the current one,
22

23
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.070
just make sure your whole resume is like this, quantitative.
23

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.730
All of the examples you give on the things you did,
they need to be quantitative.
24

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.520
What I mean by that is we need to say,
instead of describing what your job was,
25

26
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.730
we need to say how did you do at your job.
26

27
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.370
This is because, as we know, product
management is all about improving metrics.
27

28
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.590
So what we're going to try to do is change, instead of describing
your job, we're going to change it into describing
28

29
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.450
how you, in quantitative way, improved things for your job.
29

30
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.530
Here's an example.
30

31
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.230
If you're a marketer, instead of saying that you managed marketing campaigns, say how many marketing campaigns
31

32
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.960
you managed, and how much revenue
it generated for the company,
32

33
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.330
or do something like "I increased the number of simultaneous campaigns managed at once by 20% over the course of the year."
33

34
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.290
or do something like "I increased the number of simultaneous campaigns managed at once by 20% over the course of the year."
34

35
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.460
You've just got to make it quantitative.
35

36
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.680
So what we're going to do now is we're going to
put some fake resumes on the screen.
36

37
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.050
All right. So this is totally fake.
37

38
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.220
All right. So this is totally fake.
38

39
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.950
I made these up, but it's for someone that works in
marketing currently and wants to go into product
39

40
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.590
management. So you can see the difference
between these two is that we've changed,
40

41
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.320
first of all, everything to be more quantitative, in terms
of what were the things that we accomplished,
41

42
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.730
and then we have also put in more experience that's
relevant to product management, the role, rather than,
42

43
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.160
you know, talking about stuff that's not relevant to
what product managers do on a day to day basis.
43

44
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.220
So I'll include these in the resources section, along with some other guides on how to improve your resume in general.
44

45
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.390
So I'll include these in the resources section, along with some other guides on how to improve your resume in general.
45

46
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.980
But I really want to just tell you about that,
product management is all about those metrics.
46

47
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.650
So make sure stuff is quantitative, and secondly, product
managers do so much stuff that it's pretty easy
47

48
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.110
to think of stuff that you did that's related to product management, like prioritization or communicating between departments.
48

49
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.330
to think of stuff that you did that's related to product management, like prioritization or communicating between departments.
49

50
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.290
Just make sure that's reflected in your resume, and even
if you don't have prior product experience, it's going
50

51
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.190
to give you a much better chance at not being passed over by the recruiter for an associate or junior product manager position.
51

52
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500
to give you a much better chance at not being passed over by the recruiter for an associate or junior product manager position.
52

53
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.220
Alright everyone. I will see you in the next lecture.
53

54
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.830
Alright everyone. I will see you in the next lecture.
