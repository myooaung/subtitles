Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.750
So, in the last lecture, we learned what wireframing is,
and hopefully you remember what that is.
2

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.210
You don't remember? Well, they're visual mockups of a
potential web site, mobile app, or even just a feature,
3

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.620
and they're these things that we sketch out, and they
look like wires, and we do them because it helps
4

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.110
us communicate the vision of the product,
5

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.950
it helps us make sure that everyone's on the same page,
6

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.170
and it allows us to get feedback internally and from potential users. But how do you start wireframing?
7

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.310
and it allows us to get feedback internally and from potential users. But how do you start wireframing?
8

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.600
Let's say you wanted to make a wireframe.
How would you actually start?
9

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.760
Do you need thousands of dollars of software?
10

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.370
No.
11

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.640
Do you need thousands of dollars of equipment?
12

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.930
No, actually you don't.
13

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.240
The easiest way to start wireframing is available to
literally anyone, and it's a lot more simple than
14

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.420
you think, it's literally just pen and paper.
15

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.140
That's what we do.
16

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.830
I'm not actually joking. When product managers,
when UX specialists, graphic designers, project managers,
17

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.980
you name it, when they want to start and actually draft out
their first wireframe, they reach for a piece,
18

19
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.790
a pencil or pen and paper.
19

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.190
Google does this, they sketch. Microsoft, they do it as well,
they sketch. Facebook does the same thing.
20

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
Google does this, they sketch. Microsoft, they do it as well,
they sketch. Facebook does the same thing.
21

22
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.150
Pretty much everyone starts by drawing it out.
22

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.820
Now, why is that?
23

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.110
Well, because when we start wireframing,
the idea here is that we want to do it very quickly.
24

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.490
It's supposed to be a rapid task.
25

26
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.700
We don't want it to take a lot of time.
26

27
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.000
We don't want people to think it's real, or think that
it's well-defined, or something that we've been
27

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.800
working on for a long period of time.
28

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.440
We also really don't want to get attached to it.
29

30
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.560
So when you write it out on paper, you're more likely
to be able to let it go and throw it away if you
30

31
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.970
need to pivot or try something else.
31

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.800
At this stage of the game, your idea is the loosest,
it's the least defined, and we want to stay flexible,
32

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.670
so we use something that's very temporary.
33

34
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.400
So, you guys at home, grab a pen or pencil and a piece of paper
and let's draw some wireframes. Can't draw?
34

35
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.170
Well, guess what? Neither can I.
35

36
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.960
Well, guess what? Neither can I.
36

37
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.770
I've never been able to draw anything more
complicated than a stick figure. True story.
37

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.510
I've never been able to draw anything more
complicated than a stick figure. True story.
38

39
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.680
So we're standing here, looking at a blank sheet of paper.
39

40
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.230
We know what wireframes look like, right?
40

41
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.840
We know what wireframes look like, right?
41

42
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.070
We also know what websites look like, but that doesn't stop us
from getting this kind of "deer in the headlights" effect.
42

43
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.960
We also know what websites look like, but that doesn't stop us
from getting this kind of "deer in the headlights" effect.
43

44
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.420
The possibilities are almost too infinite. What do I even start with?
44

45
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.780
The possibilities are almost too infinite. What do I even start with?
45

46
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.970
Don't worry, I'm going to walk you through a bulletproof
way of getting out of that first kind of analysis
46

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.960
paralysis, and it's really quite easy.
47

48
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.790
So, ask yourself a question. What is something that, no matter
what you draw, you're going to have to actually
48

49
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.930
put down on the paper? If you guessed "browser",
49

50
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.670
you are correct. So, actually, let's just draw out a browser,
because that will help us get something on
50

51
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.300
the paper, and all of a sudden the paper just went from this big
to a very smaller section, much more manageable.
51

52
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.400
the paper, and all of a sudden the paper just went from this big
to a very smaller section, much more manageable.
52

53
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.040
So draw out your browser.
53

54
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.890
You guys can pick whatever browser you want.
54

55
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.910
I'm going to pick Chrome and I'm going to put the
three little colored dots in the top left corner, put
55

56
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.980
some tabs, and put, you know, a search box, and
pretty much everything else you see on Chrome.
56

57
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.080
Doesn't it feel all of a sudden kind of less overwhelming?
57

58
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.440
I've been doing this for years and, for some reason, I always,
it always feels better after I draw the browser.
58

59
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.010
I've been doing this for years and, for some reason, I always,
it always feels better after I draw the browser.
59

60
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.790
So, again. Now what do we do?
60

61
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.690
So, again. Now what do we do?
61

62
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.450
We have a browser, but we have to put stuff inside the browser.
62

63
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.540
We have a browser, but we have to put stuff inside the browser.
63

64
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.420
Well, what's another thing that you probably
will have to draw out regardless?
64

65
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.870
Well, I'll give you a hint.
65

66
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.690
Most web sites are going to have a logo of some sort,
and they're probably going to have a navigation bar.
66

67
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.230
Most web sites are going to have a logo of some sort,
and they're probably going to have a navigation bar.
67

68
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.280
So draw those out.
68

69
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.350
Just put the logo in the top left corner, in the top right corner,
and draw the old navigation bar. In the
69

70
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.970
navigation bar, you can say, like, one of them is Home,
and then just leave empty spaces for other things.
70

71
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.000
navigation bar, you can say, like, one of them is Home,
and then just leave empty spaces for other things.
71

72
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.010
Now, I know this is a little traditional, a lot of web sites now
don't have navigation bars, or they're floating
72

73
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.030
text, but for the most part, we all have some form of this.
73

74
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.750
All right, so it's starting to look like something.
Now, at this point, you just need to close your eyes
74

75
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.210
and try to envision what you imagine it looking like.
75

76
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.970
Open your eyes, look back at the wireframe,
and you probably still don't have any idea.
76

77
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.750
So we're going to move on to the next thing.
77

78
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.640
All right, the next thing you need to do, and this is
probably something you've answered in your head,
78

79
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.080
but you haven't yet written it out or consciously done this,
is write out the question and answer the
79

80
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.800
question "What is the point of this page?"
80

81
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.430
"Why are users on this page?"
81

82
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.180
"What is their goal and what do you think
their outcome of being here is?"
82

83
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.970
Try not to over think this, write it out in the simplest way you can. It's probably going to be something along
83

84
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.970
the lines of "It's going to be to let users do something,
something, something." Alright, so that was easy, so let's move
84

85
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.430
on to the next exercise. Write out
85

86
00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.370
"Users should be able to do..." and answer that question
to yourself. Once you figure this part out, you're
86

87
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.040
pretty much halfway there.
87

88
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.670
So try to think about what are all the things that
your users should be able to do on this page.
88

89
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.430
It's different than the primary function of the page,
which is the main point of why they're there, but 
89

90
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.040
there are also secondary things
90

91
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.540
they should be able to do. Let's call these functions
and write them out. Don't worry if you miss something,
91

92
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.600
they should be able to do. Let's call these functions
and write them out. Don't worry if you miss something,
92

93
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.020
you're always going to miss something and later it'll come to you.
93

94
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.320
These are sketches, they're not supposed
to be taken that seriously.
94

95
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.500
All right.
95

96
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.670
So let's say that we're building a page that shows users
a lot of different videos that they can watch.
96

97
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.700
So let's say that we're building a page that shows users
a lot of different videos that they can watch.
97

98
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.850
So let's the answer the question. What's the actual point of that?
98

99
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.780
Well, the point of that would be to let users see a
thumbnail of all of the available videos, such that
99

100
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.670
they can choose which video they want to watch.
100

101
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.580
So I would just draw that out. I'm just going to draw some boxes
and say it's video. I'm going to put video, video,
101

102
00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.150
video on it, and that satisfies the first question.
I now have established visually what the point of
102

103
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.530
the page is. Then move on to the next one, function one.
What was the first function? Well, let's just take a guess.
103

104
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.000
the page is. Then move on to the next one, function one.
What was the first function? Well, let's just take a guess.
104

105
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:16.320
I would guess that maybe users need to like certain videos,
and some way of communicating that, you know, they like it.
105

106
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.890
I would guess that maybe users need to like certain videos,
and some way of communicating that, you know, they like it.
106

107
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.050
So let's draw little hearts onto the bottoms of the thumbnails.
107

108
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.710
All right, good, so let's check off that function.
Now, let's do function number two.
108

109
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.740
All right, good, so let's check off that function.
Now, let's do function number two.
109

110
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.970
Let's say users probably should be able to search.
110

111
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.590
They should probably be able to search that list, it shouldn't just be a random list that they don't get to curate or play with.
111

112
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.840
They should probably be able to search that list, it shouldn't just be a random list that they don't get to curate or play with.
112

113
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.310
So let's put a search box.
113

114
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.180
It's really simple, it's just an oval with a little symbol in the middle.
114

115
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.840
Great, we satisfied function number two. Function number three,
115

116
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.910
let's say that we need to add pagination, as in there can
be a lot of search results, so we probably assume
116

117
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.230
users might look at page 2, and page 3, and page 4, decide
how many of the thumbnails to display on a page.
117

118
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.040
So I'll put up at the top right,
118

119
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.570
same way that you see it on all web sites,
"Show," you know, "10 results, 20 results, or 30 results, etc."
119

120
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.690
same way that you see it on all web sites,
"Show," you know, "10 results, 20 results, or 30 results, etc."
120

121
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.150
Now, if you get stuck at any point in this, you're thinking
"My familiarity with the web or mobile is just not 
121

122
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.650
good enough to do this,"
122

123
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.920
my suggestion is to always just hop online and start playing
around with some major web sites. Go to the web
123

124
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.510
sites that you go to all the time, play around for a
long enough time, and you'll probably run into a
124

125
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.510
function or a page that has similarities, that will get the creative juices going, and a lot of times you can just outright copy them.
125

126
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.950
function or a page that has similarities, that will get the creative juices going, and a lot of times you can just outright copy them.
126

127
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.050
If that doesn't seem to work for you, try to think
really hard of a web site that you know of that has
127

128
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.090
the same solution or problem that you're trying to solve.
128

129
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:46.920
And if you can think of that, then maybe you can find a web site that might have that function. And worst case scenario,
129

130
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.560
And if you can think of that, then maybe you can find a web site that might have that function. And worst case scenario,
130

131
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:55.320
I would just go to my favorite web site, Dribbble,
D-R-I-B-B-B-L-E.com, and it's just a web site where
131

132
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:05.220
graphic designers put up really good designs of web layouts,
buttons, forms, everything, and it just kind
132

133
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.730

So, now that you know the process, I need to instill
one last thing in your head, this is the most important
135

136
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:26.190
thing you need to know as a product manager
doing wireframes, and that is: it's function, not form.
136

137
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.050
Okay?
137

138
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:34.770
You are not the UX person, you're not the designer,
even as an entrepreneur, no one is going to judge

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:41.760

141

142
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.160
the form is something that someone else will figure out later.

143
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.210
Alright guys, in the next lecture, I'm going to practice
in front of you, making more sketches. If you don't
143

144
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.900
want that, skip on to the next lecture, where we'll talk about POP.
144

145
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.130
All right. See you then.
