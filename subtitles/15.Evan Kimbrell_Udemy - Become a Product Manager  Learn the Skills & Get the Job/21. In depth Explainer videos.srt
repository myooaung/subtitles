Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,620
Let's talk about explainer videos and how best to use them.
2

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,330
First off, let's answer the question
"Why do people use this technique versus others?"
3

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,670
Well, it's simple actually. Video converts
much better than just text pages.
4

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,580
This is what every company on the planet is figuring out
5

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,700
and it's the reason you're seeing more and more videos embedded everywhere, including your Facebook news feed.
6

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,210
and it's the reason you're seeing more and more videos embedded everywhere, including your Facebook news feed.
7

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,040
Another reason we might choose this is because an
explainer video can do a really good job of getting
8

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,850
across a product that needs in-depth explaining.
9

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,260
Some products are just inherently complicated,
which makes pitching them difficult.
10

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,210
You can cover way more ground in a shorter time
through a shnazzy video.
11

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,110
The next question is "When should we use these?"
12

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,860
Well, an explainer video, as you remember me saying,
can be a lot of work to create.
13

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,090
They often need videographers, editors,
and potentially custom graphics.
14

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:08,160
On the flip side, they can really excite your user base,
if done well. Let's look at a couple examples.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,040
Hello. This is Joe.
17

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,020
Joe runs his own business selling local goods,
but Joe has a big problem.
18

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,540
He's got too much to do and he can't find qualified help. Everywhere Joe has looked, he's only found unqualified 
19

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,690
employees.
20

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,950
Then, one day, Joe called The Solution Company.
Over the phone, The Solution Company was able to analyze
21

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,940
Joe's needs and match him with qualified candidates.
22

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,810
Within days, Joe had a wide selection of qualified,
pre-screened workers to choose from.
23

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,750
Thanks to The Solution Company, Joe can now sit back, relax,
knowing he's got the right people for the right job.
24

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,870
Thanks to The Solution Company, Joe can now sit back, relax,
knowing he's got the right people for the right job.
25

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,470
Do you want to find the right people for your business?
26

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,830
Call The Solution Company today.
27

28
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:54,300
Let The Solution Company provide you with pre-screened
and qualified candidates to grow your business.
28

29
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,360
Let The Solution Company provide you with pre-screened
and qualified candidates to grow your business.
29

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,600
So how do you balance this exactly?
30

31
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,830
Well, like anything, it's going to come down
to your organizational profile.
31

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,580
Companies that rely heavily on video already use video
frequently with their users, and they're going
32

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,480
to be much more likely candidates to use this type of test.
33

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,000
Why?
34

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,860
Well, for one, you probably already have the infrastructure to create half decent videos without a significant
35

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,580
amount of work and outside recruitment.
36

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,690
Another reason is that if your users are used to seeing video,
then they're more likely to respond to video.
37

38
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,260
Another reason is that if your users are used to seeing video,
then they're more likely to respond to video.
38

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,630
If you use a service like Wistia, you can see how many
of your users watch the entirety of your video.
39

40
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:39,830
If you use a service like Wistia, you can see how many
of your users watch the entirety of your video.
40

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,150
Wistia, by the way, is just a platform that lets you
embed videos in web pages, emails, really anywhere,
41

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,960
and gives you detailed analytics about how people engage with it.
42

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,420
Very similar to the YouTube analytics system.
43

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,440
If you run a content web site that rarely uses video content,
throwing an explainer video for a new feature
44

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,700
is probably going to get ignored and skew the results of your test.
45

46
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,160
Same goes for web sites that simply have older demographics.
Old people and video are just not really a thing.
46

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,030

47

48
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,420
My grandma, for the most part, thinks the iPad is the
work of the devil, and videos just don't really register
48

49
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,660
with her. As a funny aside, check out our Oculus Rift
activity, if you haven't already.
49

50
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,500
There's a video of old people using Oculus Rift
and it's pretty hilarious.
50

51
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm not going to electrocute myself.
51

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,320
A snorkeling mask? Something you would have in a wartime situation. It's a space mask, I don't know,
52

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,630
or something you wear for the Ebola crisis.
53

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,260
This could be some kind of mind control
hypnotic thing you're going to try to pull on me.
54

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,710
Oh my, walking without using my feet.
55

56
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,650
I mean, it's all very fake-looking, but it's beautiful.
56

57
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,710
Let's not do this.
57

58
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,200
What happened to the track?
58

59
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,500
We just jumped off the tracks! There were no tracks!
59

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,350
Other things to take into consideration are
your size and your users' expectations. If you have
60

61
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,340
no online presence at all,
61

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,450
i.e. you're in that entrepreneurial pre-product
scenario, then you can be a scrappy as you want.
62

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,340
My favorite way of making explainers in this case is to use just cheap softwares like PowToon, GoAnimate, or even
63

64
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,070
just hiring someone on Fiverr to make a video for me.
64

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,850
If you haven't set the bar for quality yet, you can get away
with whatever quality you can afford at the moment.
65

66
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,540
If you haven't set the bar for quality yet, you can get away
with whatever quality you can afford at the moment.
66

67
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,460
That flexibility is fantastic, and embrace it.
67

68
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,930
If you're larger, however, and you have already dabbled
in video in some way, be aware that you do have
68

69
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,860
a quality bar to get over.
69

70
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,760
If you make slick, fun videos that your users are used to,
then out of nowhere you create a poorly produced
70

71
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,180
screencast with low quality voice over, the difference
in what users expect and what they find will taint
71

72
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,970
their perception of whatever you're trying to pitch.
72

73
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,320
The key here is to try to be as ordinary as possible.
73

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,460
You don't want to stick out either way relative to
the other video content you use. Explainers
74

75
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,850
are an interesting way to go, but they're definitely something
you need to internally assess before you try it.
75

76
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,840
are an interesting way to go, but they're definitely something
you need to internally assess before you try it.
76

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,050
The bonus of using explainers is that, in general,
video is just more engaging with your users, and this
77

78
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,510
increases the likelihood of being shared, which is great.
78

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,490
The downside, obviously, though, is that it could
just simply not be your demographic.
