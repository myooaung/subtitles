Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,680
Let's talk about one of the last types of MVPs that
we covered: the piecemeal MVP. Now, piecemeal,
2

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,190
if you remember, is when you piece together other
softwares to create the functionality that you need
3

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,140
To better help you visualize what this concept is,
because it's kind of confusing,
4

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,600
let's go over an example.
5

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,730
Let's say you had an online course, like Udemy.
You're on it right now watching the course.
6

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,900
Let's say you wanted to add a certificate of completion
so that anyone who finishes a course would get
7

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:41,040
e-mailed a PDF that says "Yay, you've finished the course!"
Well, instead of building an auto PDF generator
8

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,470
and setting it up to know when the user finished the course,
9

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,700
maybe you just add a link to the end of the course that
takes them to a form. They can then input their
10

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,240
name into that form with their email, and then they can
get a PDF certificate sent to them that way.
11

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,450
name into that form with their email, and then they can
get a PDF certificate sent to them that way.
12

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:04,320
How you can make this work is by, let's say, using
Typeform, which is a form software, to create an
13

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,120
online form with a public access link.
14

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,950
Then you could have Typeform submit that
information into a Google sheet -
15

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,250
if you've never used Google sheet, it's just Excel but online -
which can then trigger something like Zoho invoice to create
16

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,520
an invoice with the information and send out an e-mail.
17

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,120
There you go.
18

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,360
It was one, two, three steps and you've accomplished your goals.
19

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,700
If you wanted to pursue this option, the best way
would probably be to physically write out what your
20

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,390
feature or product needs to do, and then use those
functions as just search terms in Google by adding
21

22
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,610
things like "software" or "online"
22

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,050
at the end of your search query. You would be amazed
at just how much you can get done with available
23

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,520
softwares that are out there.
24

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,070
Once you mark down what you think will do it,
then you just need to find what combination is going to
25

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,550
work the best and cooperate together. Typically, piecemeal MVPs are best suited for when you want to add
26

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,500
some functionality to your product that's relatively common.
27

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,630
If enough products and people start using, let's say,
text message reminders in their app, eventually there's
28

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,680
going to be an online software that tries to simplify
adding that process and then makes money by saving
29

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,690
companies the hassle and the money of
doing it from scratch themselves.
30

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,390
That's great and can be a seamless integration for you.
31

32
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,150
When a piecemeal MVP is not generally a good idea
to pursue is if you have, let's say, multiple
32

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,860
functionalities you need to implement, because, in general,
it's kind of a pain to get off the shelf software
33

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,520
to cooperate with each other. They can do it,
34

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,780
to cooperate with each other. They can do it,
35

36
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,070
that's the hard part though, especially when you're chaining them together, it can get really complicated.
36

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,610
that's the hard part though, especially when you're chaining them together, it can get really complicated.
37

38
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,830
Oftentimes, you'll just end up running into dead ends,
trying to find some obscure software that needs
38

39
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,270
to send some obscure information to another obscure software.
39

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,980
It can become a hairball really quickly
and you'll wish you didn't get into that.
40

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,110
If you do for whatever reason decide
that this is what you want to do,
41

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,200
here are some tips.
42

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,460
Number one: piecemeal MVPs are becoming quite popular
and online softwares are so common that there
43

44
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,040
are systems cropping up that can actually help you facilitate interactions between all of these softwares.
44

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,160
are systems cropping up that can actually help you facilitate interactions between all of these softwares.
45

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,950
The two that are worth checking out are Zapier,
which I can never pronounce, it's Zapier, Zapier,
46

47
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,220
and the other one is IFTTT, which stands for
47

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,550
and the other one is IFTTT, which stands for
48

49
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:36,190
If This Then That. In both of these, you can tell it
to, say, you know, "Every time a new note
49

50
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:42,210
with this text is created an Evernote, send information
to MailChimp," and then it can trigger MailChimp
50

51
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,480
to do something else. With some persistence, you can
actually daisy-chain together a whole list of these
51

52
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,820
different things and you can get quite a bit done,
and these softwares will make it a lot easier for you.
52

53
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,270
different things and you can get quite a bit done,
and these softwares will make it a lot easier for you.
53

54
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,550
Number two: as a product manager, it's rarely the case
that you're going to get away with sending people
54

55
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:06,720
from one external app to another, and another.
Look for softwares that allow white labeling, as in, look for
55

56
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,540
ones that allow you to put in your own images, put in
your own colors, and put in your own fonts, or even
56

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,680
better, look for the softwares that can
integrate into your existing product, so
57

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,590
it looks like it's part of your product. That lowers
the chance for users to abandon the process,
58

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,910
and, in general, it just looks a lot more professional,
which is a problem with piecemeal MVPs.
59

60
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,880
Sometimes they just don't look that great, and people can tell
that you're just sticking a bunch of services together.
60

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,020
Sometimes they just don't look that great, and people can tell
that you're just sticking a bunch of services together.
61

62
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,740
All right guys, so that's piecemeal MVPs.
62

63
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,660
Any questions, post in the Q&A and we'll jump on it.
63

64
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,920
Any questions, post in the Q&A and we'll jump on it.
64

65
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,380
Otherwise, moving on to the next lecture,
where we talk about concierge MVPs.
