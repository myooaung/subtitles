00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,210
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
So let's make a feature table.
1

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,690
Now, you remember what those are.
They are a comparison chart,
2

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,120
Now, you remember what those are.
They are a comparison chart,
3

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,800
and on the X axis, the left side, we put the dimensions that we want to compare ourselves to our competitors
4

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,470
on and on the top, the Y, so to speak,
5

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,030
we put the competitors that we want to compare ourselves to.
6

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,730
Now, you can do it like I'm about to do.
I whip out a piece of paper and I draw it out.
7

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,460
It can get messy very quickly but that's the way I prefer to do it.
8

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,400
You guys can do it whatever way you want.
9

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,730
I suggest, if you're not going to use a written version,
use Google Sheets or Excel.
10

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,960
I suggest, if you're not going to use a written version,
use Google Sheets or Excel.
11

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,290
Why?
12

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,930
Because it'll look clean, it's easier to view, and also the cells can stretch as you type out more.
13

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,140
OK. So let's set it up.
14

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,440
OK. So let's set it up.
15

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,030
All right, so first off, if you're putting your graph on a piece of paper, draw out your graph. If you're using Google
16

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,030
Sheets or Excel, you don't actually have to do anything.
17

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,220
Just make sure that you leave enough space at the top
for, let's say, at least 4-5 competitors.
18

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,440
Just make sure that you leave enough space at the top
for, let's say, at least 4-5 competitors.
19

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,560
You can put as many as you want to,
but I'd say, at a minimum,
20

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,260
for now, let's put 4-5, and then on the other side, leave enough room so that you can put a good variety
21

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,990
of dimensions to compare yourself on.
22

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,280
Now, at the top we fill in our competitors. Now, which competitors do we pick, right? Because we have direct,
23

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,310
indirect, substitute, and potential.
I suggest starting with direct competitors.
24

25
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:23,790
Why?
25

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,630
Because those are the ones that are going to be the most similar to you.
26

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,200
But the differences between you and your direct competitors
are the most important.
27

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,910
I personally then like to take the indirects, and the substitutes, and the potentials, throw those in a separate
28

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,910
graph which I'll analyze after my direct graph.
29

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,150
Now, in general, direct competitors are the ones that you really want to stay up to date with, watch their
30

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,390
products, see how they change,
31

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,150
see what they add, what they remove, and try to get a general idea of how they're going to react to you when you do something.
32

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,580
see what they add, what they remove, and try to get a general idea of how they're going to react to you when you do something.
33

34
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,890
Now, the name of the game for your other types of competitors is to make sure that your solution is obviously
34

35
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,100
better than your substitutes, your indirect competitors, and your potential competitors for your target
35

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,810
customer group. Use that table as a quick reference to make sure that it's obvious you are better.
36

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,780
Now, if you have a situation where it's not obvious you are better than a substitute, you have a serious
37

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,250
problem and you need to go back and start from scratch.
38

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,920
In the restaurant metaphor, that's like your Italian restaurant serving pizza that actually tastes just
39

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,660
as good or worse than DiGiorno pizza.
40

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,470
That's a fundamental issue you have to address.
41

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,470
Now, on the left we're going to put features and factors.
You can really put whatever you want over here.
42

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,680
Now, on the left we're going to put features and factors.
You can really put whatever you want over here.
43

44
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,480
I suggest you start with these two: features and factors.
44

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,220
Why?
45

46
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,610
Because they're not very subjective.
46

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,830
They're pretty easy to nail down and be specific about.
Now, what you choose to put in this part of the table
47

48
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,620
is entirely up to you.
48

49
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:10,130
You need to think really hard about what you think your target customer group cares about with regards
49

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,220
to your product. When they go and they're looking at your product,
50

51
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,840
let's say it's a physical product,
51

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,740
what do you think is going to be the one, two, three, four,
52

53
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,360
and number five reason that they choose yours over the others.
53

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,920
Now, keep in mind, every product has
a different vision and a different positioning,
54

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,960
so the features and factors that you think are relevant
to your target customer might be different than
55

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,020
what your competitors think are the most important.
56

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:47,100
Maybe you think ease of use and price is really the key formula to winning your market, while your competitor
57

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,330
might think instead that it's design, aesthetics, and integrations.
58

59
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,520
The key here is not to put what your competitors think is important,
59

60
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,560
it's to put what you think is important to your customer group, because at the end of the day, your product
60

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,810
vision is how you plan to win the market - it's your bet.
61

62
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,680
It's not realistic to think that you're going to beat every single competitor in every single category
62

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,510
especially if you de-prioritize certain aspects over others.
63

64
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,410
So brainstorm your best.
64

65
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:25,350
And honestly, do some research as well to get a good chunk of what you think is important. Now, for any given product,
65

66
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,900
And honestly, do some research as well to get a good chunk of what you think is important. Now, for any given product,
66

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,530
let's say I might put price as one that's a very common factor.
67

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,470
I might put reliability, that could easily be a common factor in physical products, or, you know, even
68

69
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,630
softwares that are dependent on things like up time.
And then as a feature I could say it needs to do
69

70
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,500
feature X and it needs to have the ability to do Y.
70

71
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,150
Now, this is just a template,
71

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,950
you need to fill these in yourself, but to help you
kind of get through this,
72

73
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,400
let's imagine again, in that restaurant metaphor, what would I mean when I say "features" or "ability to
73

74
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,280
do something"? I know it's goofy to think of a restaurant
in terms of features, but it is actually a way
74

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,620
of thinking about it. So I could say that feature, a feature that I think is important and that my product's
75

76
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,590
going to have is that we offer a price fixed three course meal, and I think that's really important when
76

77
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,040
people pick a high end Italian restaurant.
77

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,810
Now, for the ability to do something, maybe I think that being able to make reservations online is important.
78

79
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:22,830
Now, for the ability to do something, maybe I think that being able to make reservations online is important.
79

80
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,180
It's important to their perception of the restaurant, and that's going to get you more customers and a better experience.
80

81
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,120
It's important to their perception of the restaurant, and that's going to get you more customers and a better experience.
81

82
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,690
Ok, now that you have it set up, go research your competitors,
and the best way of doing that is to actually
82

83
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,350
go out and use their products. Give each product an honest appraisal, put in the box what you need to know,
83

84
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:40,690
go out and use their products. Give each product an honest appraisal, put in the box what you need to know,
84

85
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,640
but keep it short and uniform. Answer a yes or no question with yes or no and then it's up to you. You
85

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,690
can put a comma and put one or two more words that might be a little bit more specific, but the key, try to make them uniform,
86

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,020
can put a comma and put one or two more words that might be a little bit more specific, but the key, try to make them uniform,
87

88
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,500
so when you glance at it, you don't have to read every single cell.
88

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,010
All right, so that is the template.
Next lecture,
89

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,140
let's try to make an actual one.
90

91
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,580
See you then.
