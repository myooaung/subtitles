00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,150
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, in this lecture,
we're going to get some practice with Balsamiq.
1

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:13,380
We're going to create a web site from scratch using
all the tools we covered in the previous lecture.
2

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:13,680
We're going to create a web site from scratch using
all the tools we covered in the previous lecture.
3

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,210
Now, for those of you guys out there that don't want
to follow along or don't feel like you need practice,
4

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:21,270
Now, for those of you guys out there that don't want
to follow along or don't feel like you need practice,
5

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,710
skip the lecture
6

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,480
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
For the rest of you guys, let's get started.
7

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,710
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
For the rest of you guys, let's get started.
8

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,090
Alright, remember what I said in the last lecture?
9

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,010
Balsamiq is incredibly simple and incredibly fast.
So simple and so fast that in the ten minutes we spent
10

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,340
in the last lecture, or whatever it was, learning how
to use this system, that was all we need to create
11

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,270
an in-depth web site. And to prove my point,
12

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,110
let's go ahead and make a web site.
13

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,230
To prove my point, let's go ahead and make a web site.
14

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,860
To prove my point, let's go ahead and make a web site.
15

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,610
To prove my point, let's go ahead and make a web site.
16

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,500
I'm going to make a copy of YouTube. YouTube,
17

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,870
when I speak about YouTube, I'm not talking about
the home page, I'm talking about what the screen looks
18

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,040
like when you're actually viewing a subpage.
19

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:31,630
I would go to All, got to the browser window. In the browser
window, I can type in YouTube, and there you go, see? It
20

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,880
shows it up in YouTube.
21

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,540
Let's expand the size.
22

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,210
Let's expand the size.
23

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,580
Okay.
24

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,610
Now, let's make something like where you'd watch the videos.
25

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,920
Where is the media player? I can go to Media.
26

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,600
Now, Media is where you're going to insert pretty much
anything you want, like, it could be associated with
27

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,750
images, here's a progress bar, here's a street map.
28

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,630
So I'll pull this out so you can see it.
29

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,620
That's like a Google Maps street map. Here's a video player.
30

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:09,420
So let' say that this is, you know, where you watch videos.
31

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,900
So let's say, oh, we want to put a search bar at the top.
32

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,770
You can use the search bar, it's what's called a search box,
put it at the top, where you would be searching for
33

34
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,350
your videos.
34

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's see.
35

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,380
I love this about Balsamiq.
36

37
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:34,980
You can just use icons and they have a lot of the logos
that you would commonly use, like, they have the
37

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,210
Twitter logo, and the Instagram logo, and pretty much
everything you'd want for the most common social
38

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,480
platforms. I'm going to do that, look,
now we have our logo - YouTube.
39

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,360
Let's make that little section over here
where it shows you suggested videos.
40

41
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,260
What I would do for that, since they're thumbnails, I'd
use an image. Now, images just come out like boxes, which is 
41

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,290
perfect for what we want.
42

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,420
I'll just call it "Video" so that
43

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,250
our developer and our graphic designer knows what that is.
44

45
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,300
With image placeholders, what you can do is you can add
borders and you can actually upload images, insert
45

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,460
them into Balsamiq. So what you do is you just double tap it,
46

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,820
browse for a file.
47

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,870
Everybody loves cats.
48

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,460
So, cats, this is a cool feature I like,
49

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,490
you can just sketch it. If I don't sketch it, it's going to
insert this image with the whole color, it's going to
50

51
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,790
look kind of weird with the whole black and white thing going on.
51

52
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:34,090
So I'll just say sketch it. Alright, let's try to put it back
into the size that you'd expect.
52

53
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,510
I guess that looks weird.
53

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,700
Now we want to put, let's put a border on it, yeah that looks better. There you go.
54

55
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,450
Now it looks kind of like one of those
videos you'd have suggested to you.
55

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,370
Now let's add the text that would go next to it.
56

57
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,250
So, again, this is how I do it. Remember, string, string of text,
57

58
00:03:49,830 --> 00:04:01,710
I'll put it as the title, so I'll call it "Cat video,"
super original. Since it's the title, I want to make it bold.
58

59
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,320
Increase the size just a little bit.
59

60
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
Okay.
60

61
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,440
Now, you can use your keyboard too to move things around.
61

62
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:17,060
So if I just go left, it's going to move it one pixel left.
Right, up, down, you get the point. Then right below that,
62

63
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,280
so now if I want to put text right below it,
all I want to do is hit "Duplicate."
63

64
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:32,070
I'll put it right below it, and let's change this, it's called "by," let's just call it the "Cat Person Person," because everybody knows a
64

65
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,740
cat person, but nobody knows a cat person person.
65

66
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,110
Let's see. And we'll make it smaller, get rid of the bolding. Here we go.
66

67
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,010
And let's put a view counter.
67

68
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,810
And let's put a view counter.
68

69
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,390
That's usually just a number, so let's say
a million people watched this video.
69

70
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,560
And usually that is a little bit smaller.
70

71
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,020
I think it's pretty believable.
71

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,460
So what I'm going to do is I want to create this little grouping,
and I want to make it go all the way
72

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,960
down the screen, which is typically what you see in YouTube.
73

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,960
So what we do, click it, and we're going to group these together. Remember how we do group? We hit "Group."
74

75
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,310
Now they're together.
75

76
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,470
Now, when I copy my group,
you could even exit out, doesn't really matter.
76

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,200
Copy my group. Voila.
77

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,810
Let's match the grids up, and here you go,
those are suggested videos.
78

79
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, maybe I wanted to put a container around that,
something light, I'll just go to shape again, you know,
79

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,020
a shape,
80

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:42,000
I am just going to pick a rectangle right here, add it right here.
81

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,700
I want to expand it over. See? Notice how it covered it?
82

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,770
I want to expand it over. See? Notice how it covered it?
83

84
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,380
Now, Balsamiq has a layering, kind of like Photoshop.
84

85
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,200
If you used Photoshop before, it has layers.
85

86
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,800
The way that you would want this to fade to the back
is you would use this little subgroup.
86

87
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,670
This will send it back one, oh no, this will send it all the
way to the back, so this will be the bottom of your...
87

88
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,170
This will send it back one, oh no, this will send it all the
way to the back, so this will be the bottom of your...
88

89
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,700
Imagine this is kind of like paper laying on top of each other.
89

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,850
This would be the bottom piece of paper, if you click this, 
90

91
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,060
it's going to bring it all the way to the top,
so it's going to cover anything behind it.
91

92
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,120
I just want to send it back until it's behind the cat videos.
92

93
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,460
All right, so the rest of it really is just kind of tiny little details.
93

94
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,250
It's up to you how much detail you honestly want to put in here.
94

95
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,460
We can pretend like this is a, here's the placeholder for the image of
95

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:37,260
whoever made the video, we can add in text again,
say, the name of the video.
96

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,640
"My secret webcam video." Because they want it to
be a secret, but they also want the entire world
97

98
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,150
to see it, and let's put this realistically much larger.
Drag this down, add some space.
98

99
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,230
We can add those thumbs up and thumbs down.
99

100
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:03,540
Just pick an icon, put it over here, you could even just search for "thumbs." There you go. I'm going to make that small. 
100

101
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,500
Makes sense, right?
101

102
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:12,950
And you can even copy it there, right next to it, and then just find another, like, thumbs again, so it's
102

103
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,150
thumbs down, like the video.
103

104
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,590
And then we'll just stick someone's face on it,
because it's a webcam, right?
104

105
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,090
You get the drift now.
105

106
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:29,100
You can put an enormous amount of detail into
Balsamiq if you want to, but, as you've noticed, that
106

107
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,650
really did not take me a lot of time,
and I have a wireframe of a video.
107

108
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,180
You're obviously going to put more time and effort
into whatever you actually build yourself,
108

109
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,530
but once you actually get acquainted with it, hopefully
by now you are acquainted, you can really move
109

110
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,980
at lightning speed and you can really
produce these very, very quickly.
110

111
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,220
Now, if I wanted to make the next screen at YouTube,
I could just go up to File, hit "Clone current mockup,"
111

112
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,420
and look, I have the same exact thing, and I can just
move from here and start deleting things wherever
112

113
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,360
I want, and changing things around.
113

114
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,930
Now, when you're done and you're happy with what
you've got, all you've got to do is just go up to File
114

115
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,690
and you can save it as whatever you want it to be.
115

116
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,420
Make sure to back it up. If you guys are on an older
computer, make sure that you don't have tons and
116

117
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,070
tons and tons of tabs open, it can really kind of slow down
your computer, but otherwise just export it
117

118
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,760
to whatever you want.
118

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,050
I like PDF, that's one of the easiest to view,
119

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,260
or you can just do it as an image,
120

121
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,580
that's what you end up sending to your graphic designer
or your developer, and they will thank you a thousand times over.
121

122
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:26,850
that's what you end up sending to your graphic designer
or your developer, and they will thank you a thousand times over.
