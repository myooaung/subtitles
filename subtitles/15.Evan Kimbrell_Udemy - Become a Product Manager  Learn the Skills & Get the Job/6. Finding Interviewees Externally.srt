00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,180
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,240
All right, we're moving on to step two of the customer
development process: finding your potential interviewees.
2

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,480
All right, we're moving on to step two of the customer
development process: finding your potential interviewees.
3

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,540
Now, you can obviously gather feedback about your product
or your proposed product without actually talking
4

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,630
to a potential or an existing customer.
5

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,560
In this lecture, we're going to talk about pre-product scenarios, when we're looking for new customers
6

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,370
or people that are not already aware of us to interview.
7

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,780
Now, there are a lot of different places online or offline
that you can go to connect with people that
8

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,260
might be interested in your product.
9

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:47,310
But, for our sake, I've reduced it down to four different
places or types of places to look that consistently
10

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:54,540
can find you people that are interested. Now, in the
resources of this lecture, I've actually attached a great
11

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:03,510
article called "96 different ways to find people to interview"
and they go through literally every single
12

13
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,560
little thing you can think of. If you want to read that, check it out.
13

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,630
It's a little overkill for us. Now, at this stage of the game,
you know which target customer group you would
14

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:20,160
like to talk to, because we played "Three questions stud"
and you identified one of the three as probably
15

16
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,620
more worthwhile to go after and one that you'll
have more success reaching out to. Now, the first
16

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,290
place and I think probably the best place to start reaching out to potential customers that you can talk to is LinkedIn.
17

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,710
place and I think probably the best place to start reaching out to potential customers that you can talk to is LinkedIn.
18

19
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,070
I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with LinkedIn.
19

20
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,480
It's an online social network that is primarily for networking.
20

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,240
It holds a lot of information about the people that
sign up and a lot of that information is public.
21

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,290
It holds a lot of information about the people that
sign up and a lot of that information is public.
22

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,910
We generally get to see where people go to school, what their job is, what they've done in the past, where they live.
23

24
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,900
We generally get to see where people go to school, what their job is, what they've done in the past, where they live.
24

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,520
We also know generally interests they're in
and groups they participate in.
25

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,070
We also have endorsements that show us what skills they have.
26

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,720
So that is a treasure chest of different ways that you can narrow down on exactly the target customer you have in mind.
27

28
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,930
So that is a treasure chest of different ways that you can narrow down on exactly the target customer you have in mind.
28

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,310
Now, for those of you out there that have a LinkedIn
account and you have lots of connections, this
29

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,080
works extremely well, for those of you that have an account,
but don't have a lot of connections, it still
30

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,170
works very well, and for those of you that don't have an account,
I suggest creating one and connecting
31

32
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,000
with some of the people you know.
It really will only take you 10-15 minutes,
32

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,490
and by this time tomorrow you can actually use it to find people.
33

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,970
Now, the best way to use LinkedIn is actually
just to use their search feature. Now, what the
34

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,400
search feature is going to do is it's going to search based off of
your connections and then your connections' connections.
35

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,450
search feature is going to do is it's going to search based off of
your connections and then your connections' connections.
36

37
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,660
That's why I say, if you only have a medium amount of connections, only 50 people, 20 people, it still works
37

38
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,590
because as long as you're connected to people that
have a lot of them, then the search has quite a large
38

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,790
group of people to look through.
39

40
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,430
So, if you define your customer group by,
let's say, their job type, this is perfect.
40

41
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,960
If you define it based off of their education, where they went to school, what location they live in, this also works very well.
41

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,300
If you define it based off of their education, where they went to school, what location they live in, this also works very well.
42

43
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,350
So, let's use the example of the real estate agents,
if we were building a product that went after real
43

44
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,190
estate agents or appealed to them.
44

45
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,510
All that you have to do is, in the search bar, just
type in "real estate agent" and right at the top it says
45

46
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,960
I can pick between people, jobs, and groups.
46

47
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,550
Those are all very helpful, but I'm probably just going to pick people, because these are actually going to show me
47

48
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,480
people that have it in their title, meaning
right now they are a real estate agent.
48

49
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,190
And even down here it's already started to give me second degree connections, other people that are connected
49

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,190
to people that you are connected to that fit my criteria.
50

51
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,140
But I can click "people" and it'll give me an extensive list of people.
51

52
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,150
All right, so right off the bat, I have tons and tons of people -
10 different pages of people that I could reach out to.
52

53
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,350
All right, so right off the bat, I have tons and tons of people -
10 different pages of people that I could reach out to.
53

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,210
If I then wanted to add some criteria about
where they live, I can use filtering criteria over here.
54

55
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,780
So maybe I only want to interview people that are near
where I live in San Francisco, within 50 miles.
55

56
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:09,890
So maybe I only want to interview people that are near
where I live in San Francisco, within 50 miles.
56

57
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,650
All right, now I have a very good list of people
that I could start to connect with.
57

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,120
I could add in more criteria if I wanted to,
but, for our sake, let's not.
58

59
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,230
I could add in more criteria if I wanted to,
but, for our sake, let's not.
59

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,130
Now, if I wanted to contact these people, the way that
you would use LinkedIn is through one of two means.
60

61
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,150
Now, if I wanted to contact these people, the way that
you would use LinkedIn is through one of two means.
61

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,680
One is you can send them what's called an InMail.
An InMail is a message that goes directly to their
62

63
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,860
message system - now, this is a paid option.
63

64
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,250
I don't think you pay a lot of money for it.
64

65
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,720
You probably have to do a subscription package
and it gives you a certain amount of InMails.
65

66
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,240
If this is something you frequently use,
then it's definitely worth doing.
66

67
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,880
So the second option is to just connect with them, because when you connect with them it'll give you the option of writing a message.
67

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,620
So the second option is to just connect with them, because when you connect with them it'll give you the option of writing a message.
68

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:57,150
So click through to their profile and then you can hit "connect"
and in the message down here I can write
69

70
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,900
something along the lines of "This is what I'm doing and
I would like to talk to you" - we cover that in the next lecture.
70

71
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,580
something along the lines of "This is what I'm doing and
I would like to talk to you" - we cover that in the next lecture.
71

72
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,210
How do we get them to actually talk to us? If they don't see this, they still will probably connect with you,
72

73
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,890
How do we get them to actually talk to us? If they don't see this, they still will probably connect with you,
73

74
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,790
at which point you can then send them a direct message,
and that doesn't cost any money.
74

75
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,060
at which point you can then send them a direct message,
and that doesn't cost any money.
75

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,880
Alright, so the number two place that we're going to cover
are forums. Now what do I mean by forums?
76

77
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,160
Well, forums are generally just online communities
that are all built around some kind of theme.
77

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:33,670
Pretty much any type of affiliation, or job, or interest you can think of has a forum or an online community dedicated to it.
78

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,290
Pretty much any type of affiliation, or job, or interest you can think of has a forum or an online community dedicated to it.
79

80
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,250
And the reason forums work so well is because there's a bunch of people talking about whatever subject or topic you picked,
80

81
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,370
And the reason forums work so well is because there's a bunch of people talking about whatever subject or topic you picked,
81

82
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,720
and it's very easy to search them or find people that
have a problem that you are trying to solve,
82

83
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,080
have experience in the area you are trying to go into.
83

84
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,780
It's pretty much easy pickings, because people will talk about what they're interested in and they'll self-identify themselves.
84

85
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,210
It's pretty much easy pickings, because people will talk about what they're interested in and they'll self-identify themselves.
85

86
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,710
The first place I like to start is a website called Reddit.
If you ever heard of Reddit, it's an 
86

87
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,660
online forum and it's absolutely massive.
87

88
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,480
It's an online community, and the way that it works is
it's actually tons and tons of forums inside of
88

89
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:21,390
one forum. Reddit calls these subforums "subreddits"
and every subreddit in this website is going to
89

90
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,530
be based off of some type of theme, or topic, or subject.
90

91
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,720
So if you can identify some of the things that your target
customer group have in common, are interested
91

92
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,720
in, or anything that they would affiliate with,
you can find a subreddit for that.
92

93
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,090
The best way of doing that is to search through their search box and it will give you lists of subreddits
93

94
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,910
or what you can do is actually search through Google.
And if you use the code site:reddit.com
94

95
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,570
and then followed by searching for the topic you want,
95

96
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,090
you can do it that way as well - sometimes Google
is actually better than Reddit.
96

97
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,780
So, let's see how this works for the real estate idea.
97

98
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,130
All I'd have to do is say "real estate agents"
right there and see if it shows me.
98

99
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,880
And then, right off the bat, we have three subreddits right here,
and it gives you some gauge of how many
99

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,490
people are in it: 41 people, 20 people, 8 people. I can click next
and I can look at other ones, these get more and more specific.
100

101
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,590
people are in it: 41 people, 20 people, 8 people. I can click next
and I can look at other ones, these get more and more specific.
101

102
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,210
But, for the most part, I can dive into any one of these,
102

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,820
start looking around, start interacting,
and then start reaching out to people.
103

104
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,270
Another great option is a web site called Quora.
104

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,350
Now, Quora, spelled Q-U-O-R-A.com, is essentially Yahoo Answers, but for adults. It's a web site where people will ask
105

106
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:40,180
Now, Quora, spelled Q-U-O-R-A.com, is essentially Yahoo Answers, but for adults. It's a web site where people will ask
106

107
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,340
questions and then people who have expertise in that
subject will answer them and it's a website where
107

108
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,840
people kind of trip over each other to give the best answer.
108

109
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,630
But because so many people have asked so many different questions, what you can do is look for specific
109

110
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,790
topics or groups of questions, and then look at the people
that are constantly talking in them, answering
110

111
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,160
questions, interacting, and replying.
111

112
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,110
So I could search for "real estate agents" and then right there
I can pick the actual topic, so it's going to
112

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,760
show me all the questions related to real estate agents.
So all I'd have to do is just jump into any
113

114
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:22,480
one of these and see if the people that are asking
the question or answering the question are people
114

115
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,180
that fit my target demographic - if they are, I can then
message them and try to make a connection.
115

116
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,680
Alright, the third place that I suggest using to find
potential customers to interview is Twitter.
116

117
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,660
Twitter is fantastic as a resource for finding people
that might be interested in your service.
117

118
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,160
The reason why it's so effective at this is similar
to the reason why forums are, in that people are
118

119
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,530
constantly talking on it, and people are constantly self-identifying themselves with things they're interested
119

120
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,990
in, things they affiliate themselves with,
and what they do for a living.
120

121
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,070
Twitter is also just a gigantic complaining fest, which is great because you can find people that potentially
121

122
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,180
have the problem you're trying to solve and reach out to them.
122

123
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,060
Now, the way that you'd use Twitter is you can just go to search.twitter.com, and it will allow you to just search through it.
123

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
Now, the way that you'd use Twitter is you can just go to search.twitter.com, and it will allow you to just search through it.
124

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,310
What you're actually searching through when you use this feature is what people are saying and not specific details about the person.
125

126
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,030
What you're actually searching through when you use this feature is what people are saying and not specific details about the person.
126

127
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,750
So if I said "real estate agent" it might not actually be as effective. Why?
127

128
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,150
So if I said "real estate agent" it might not actually be as effective. Why?
128

129
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,730
Because real estate agents on Twitter probably aren't saying
"real estate agent" over, and over, and over
129

130
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,030
again, it might still work but it's more effective to think
about things they might be saying and then
130

131
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,020
search for that. So a real estate agent might be saying
something along the lines of "Looking to buy a home."
131

132
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,590
And then we can scroll down and it looks like, right off the bat,
132

133
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,930
here's someone that says "Looking for a home?"
"Are you looking for a home?"
133

134
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,940
Lots of people here are self-identifying.
134

135
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,670
And the first one we captured right here is a man named Alan Todd.
135

136
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,160
He works as a real estate agent.
136

137
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,150
See how that worked?
137

138
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,200
Now that we know who they are, we can tweet at them or we can try to follow them in the hopes that they follow us back,
138

139
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,570
Now that we know who they are, we can tweet at them or we can try to follow them in the hopes that they follow us back,
139

140
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,530
at which point we can send them a direct message.
140

141
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,300
All right, and the last go-to place for finding potential customers is...
It's actually your competitors, okay?
141

142
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,440
All right, and the last go-to place for finding potential customers is...

It's actually your competitors, okay?
143

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,380
90% of the time, when you're launching a new product,
144

145
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,520
there are probably going to be competitors already there,
and if they're not doing the exact same thing,
145

146
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,050
they're probably doing at least part of what you propose to do,
146

147
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,660
or they're just servicing the same target customer group.
147

148
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,480
If you can identify your potential competitors right out of the gate, well, then it's relatively easy
148

149
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,460
to just go to their social media pages, see who is engaging,
and you can then figure out that those people
149

150
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,790
probably are customers or are interested customers
for your competitor, and you can contact them.
150

151
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,410
Let's say we were doing that real estate business, never
said what it was, but let's say one of our competitors
151

152
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,400
was Opendoor - it's a relatively well-known startup. We can find their page on Twitter and then just look for who is interacting with it.
152

153
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,480
was Opendoor - it's a relatively well-known startup. We can find their page on Twitter and then just look for who is interacting with it.
153

154
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,510
We can see who is liking their page.
154

155
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,200
There's someone who likes it,  there's someone who likes it,
155

156
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,270
and these are people that interact with their page.
156

157
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,020
We can then go through these people's pages
and contact them in the same way.
157

158
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,530
Now, this works the same for Facebook,
this works the same for Twitter.
158

159
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,290
Now, this works the same for Facebook,
this works the same for Twitter.
159

160
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,840
If your competitor has a blog, you can also go on there
and find people who are commenting on their blog,
160

161
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
that is also a goldmine for finding potential people to talk to.
161

162
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,030
All right. So, as of today, those are the four main categories that product managers are probably going to use to reach
162

163
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:41,440
All right. So, as of today, those are the four main categories that product managers are probably going to use to reach 
163

164
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,910
out to potential customers that they can interview.

165

166
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,640
otherwise we're going to move on to step three, which is
how exactly do you get these people to talk to you?
166

167
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,140
otherwise we're going to move on to step three, which is

167

168
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,720
All right, see you then.
