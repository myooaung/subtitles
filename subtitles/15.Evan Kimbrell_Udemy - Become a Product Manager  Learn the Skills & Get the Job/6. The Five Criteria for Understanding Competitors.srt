Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:06,520
All right. So, this far in the section, we figured out how to find competitors, how to compare them to ourselves,
2

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:15,170
All right. So, this far in the section, we figured out how to find competitors, how to compare them to ourselves,
3

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,690
how to compare potential features and potential products
4

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,810
we're thinking of to our competition, but now we need
to talk a little more broadly about, as a product
5

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,940
manager and as an entrepreneur, what in general do you have to keep tabs on with your competitors.
6

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,990
So I'm going introduce five separate criteria that are crucial for you as a product manager or entrepreneur
7

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,420
to understand about your competitors.
8

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,300
Now, a large part of what makes you successful as a product manager is your ability to keep tabs on your
9

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,180
competitors and make sure that you are ahead of the curve and know what exactly they're going to do.
10

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,380
competitors and make sure that you are ahead of the curve and know what exactly they're going to do.
11

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,060
One way of thinking about it is that it's kind of like a horse race,
and especially if you're working
12

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:04,590
on a team that has an established product, you're going to be constantly jockeying with your competitors
13

14
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:11,310
for users, features, press, funding, amongst a number of different things. And in order to be successful in this
14

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,830
jockeying game, you can't just keep tabs on them,
15

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,890
you have to have a deeper sense of what they can do.
16

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,830
So let's talk about five different dimensions that are absolutely crucial to understand about your competitors.
17

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,060
So let's talk about five different dimensions that are absolutely crucial to understand about your competitors.
18

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,220
The first one I want to talk about is called the product core.
19

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,960
Now, it's a little confusing but what I mean by product core is the product team. I'm talking about whoever
20

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,880
on your competitor's side is in charge of making their product.
If it's a physical product, it's going
21

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,750
to be the physical engineers that are building it,
22

23
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,970
and if it's a, let's say, web application,
it's going to be the developers.
23

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,900
And the question we want to answer here is "How good is our competitor's product team?"
24

25
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,370
Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, made a very notorious public statement when he said that any
25

26
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,940
day he would take one great engineer over 100 average engineers.
26

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,840
Now, that's obviously kind of counterintuitive, right?
You would assume more people can do more.
27

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,180
Now, that's obviously kind of counterintuitive, right?
You would assume more people can do more.
28

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,250
So what exactly does he mean here?
29

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,330
Well, what he means is that, especially in web development or development of applications, having a great
30

31
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,860
engineer actually can do a lot more for you than
a lot of people that can get low level work done. Top
31

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,880
notch engineers in general can outperform
larger groups of good engineers.
32

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,770
Instagram is a great example.
33

34
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,930
Instagram, when it was bought by Facebook for a billion dollars, you would think it was a huge company.
34

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,230
Instagram, when it was bought by Facebook for a billion dollars, you would think it was a huge company.
35

36
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,690
No, actually they only had 13 employees. I believe
only eight of them were product engineers.
36

37
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,040
No, actually they only had 13 employees. I believe
only eight of them were product engineers.
37

38
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,560
So know how good their product core is.
38

39
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:58,280
Make strides and make attempts to figure out that question.
Now, why does this matter to you?
39

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,640
Well, if your competitor has, let's say, a better product team,
that means in general they can out-execute you,
40

41
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,480
they can out-engineer you, and they can outproduce you.
41

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,240
So if you're in a situation where you have a team
that's not as good as your competitors, you need to
42

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:20,100
take that into consideration and probably not wade into features or wade into product categories where
43

44
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,700
one of the key differentiators or the key components of it
is the engineering quality.
44

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,710
Of course, on the flip side, if you have a better product core,
it's the exact opposite.
45

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,690
You can wade into areas that rely heavily
on the quality of engineering,
46

47
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,320
and if you do that, that's something that your competitors
will have a hard time catching up to and imitating.
47

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,530
and if you do that, that's something that your competitors
will have a hard time catching up to and imitating.
48

49
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,140
The second criteria we need to use when considering our competitors is to know the size of their user base.
49

50
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,740
The second criteria we need to use when considering our competitors is to know the size of their user base.
50

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,940
Now, why does it matter how big your competitor's user base is, or how big their customer base is in the
51

52
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,750
case of more traditional businesses?
52

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,770
It's kind of counterintuitive, right?
53

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,140
And immediately it's hard to figure out what that would matter, right? Because if you have a large user base,
54

55
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,400
that doesn't necessarily mean you can build better products faster.
55

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,730
Well, actually this is a pretty important one.
56

57
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:19,140
Companies or competitors that have large user bases have certain advantages that companies with small user bases don't have.
57

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,600
Companies or competitors that have large user bases have certain advantages that companies with small user bases don't have.
58

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,520
Oftentimes, when a company has a large user base, anytime they launch a new feature or launch into a new
59

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,940
market, they have the potential to essentially dominate the market just by virtue of how many people they bring into it.
60

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,230
market, they have the potential to essentially dominate the market just by virtue of how many people they bring into it.
61

62
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,920
They also have an easier time getting press. In general, press and press coverage is going to be more
62

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,750
inclined to cover companies that are larger and more well-known.
63

64
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,330
Another advantage is that a large user base will allow you to strike deals with other companies more easily.
64

65
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,260
Another advantage is that a large user base will allow you to strike deals with other companies more easily.
65

66
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,150
Much easier to negotiate when you say "I'm bringing X amount of users to the table. I'm the largest company in town."
66

67
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,820
Much easier to negotiate when you say "I'm bringing X amount of users to the table. I'm the largest company in town."
67

68
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,100
And then the last thing is that size often is an advantage intrinsically. Think about, like, social products, right?
68

69
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,860
And then the last thing is that size often is an advantage intrinsically. Think about, like, social products, right?
69

70
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,410
A social network is only as valuable
as however many people are in it.
70

71
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,470
So the larger one is inherently going to have a better product.
71

72
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,340
Now, here's the classic example, and it's Apple Music.
72

73
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,320
I don't know if you've heard this, but Apple's launching into the music space, specifically the subscription
73

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,360
music space, and they're going to compete
with Spotify and SoundCloud - sorry, Cole.
74

75
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,950
Now, can Apple make a better music player? We don't really know.
75

76
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,970
Now, can Apple make a better music player? We don't really know.
76

77
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,580
And are they at a disadvantage
because they're coming late to the market?
77

78
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,060
Actually, none of that matters,
because their user size is so large.
78

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,580
Consider this. Spotify and SoundCloud have something
around 30 million combined paying users.
79

80
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,060
Now think about Apple. How many users do they have?
80

81
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,930
Now think about Apple. How many users do they have?
81

82
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,570
It's actually 1 billion.
82

83
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,750
So even if Apple comes into that space, converts 1% of their market into their Apple music product,
83

84
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:57,910
So even if Apple comes into that space, converts 1% of their market into their Apple music product,
84

85
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,840
they are a serious competitor.
85

86
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,090
So be aware, because in this case, size does matter.
86

87
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,620
All right, guys. Take a sec to think about those and I'll catch you in the next lecture, where we cover the next three.
87

88
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,280
All right, guys. Take a sec to think about those and I'll catch you in the next lecture, where we cover the next three.
88

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,670
See you then.
