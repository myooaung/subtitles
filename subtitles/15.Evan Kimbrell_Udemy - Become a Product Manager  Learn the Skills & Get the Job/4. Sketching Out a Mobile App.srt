00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,790
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:08,460
Last lecture, we got introduced to sketching. Sketching is
just a simpler form of wireframing, it's actually
2

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,060
the first form you will use, and the vast majority of
organizations and teams out there first start by
3

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,700
taking pen to paper.
4

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
So we covered a pretty good way of going
about making your first sketches,
5

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,380
but in this lecture, let's get some practice.
6

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,190
but in this lecture, let's get some practice.
7

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,020
So, this time, I'm going to sketch out some wireframes,
and if you guys want to follow along, continue the rest
8

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,290
of the lecture, if you think you got it, skip to the next
so I don't hear you complain.
9

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,270
of the lecture, if you think you got it, skip to the next
so I don't hear you complain.
10

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,790
All right, this time let's not do a web site or web app.
11

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,790
Let's do a mobile application, so let's draw out an iPhone.
12

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,090
All right, so what kind of app do you think we should try to make?
13

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,630
I think what I'm going to try to do is, let's make
a mobile application for ordering groceries.
14

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,110
Okay?
15

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
Grocery delivery, that's going to be the topic of the app.
16

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,730
The idea is, you know, kind of like a web van where you
can get on your phone and order groceries from nearby
17

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,280
stores to where you live. Alright, now that we have
our iPhone template, what should we start with?
18

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,600
Well, I'd say an easy one to start with is a navigation bar.
I'm assuming that we're going to need a navigation
19

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,790
bar, so I can put some space down at the bottom where
I can click some buttons. Later on, we'll fill that out.
20

21
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,130
bar, so I can put some space down at the bottom where
I can click some buttons. Later on, we'll fill that out.
21

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,690
You know, another thing that we could put instead,
we could actually instead make a log in screen. Pretty
22

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,470
much any app that's not a demo or any app that is
complete and something you take seriously has a log
23

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,960
in screen, and log in screens are also called splash pages.
24

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,700
So let's make that splash page or that log in page,
25

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,620
and I like doing this sometimes first
because it gets the juices flowing.
26

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,660
All right, so let's draw out the log in screen.
27

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,650
This is a pretty standard template I'm going to draw out.
28

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,810
This is a pretty standard template I'm going to draw out.
29

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,930
If you guys want to use something else, again,
just go out and find your favorite app.
30

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,920
If you guys want to use something else, again,
just go out and find your favorite app.
31

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,610
It literally takes four seconds.
32

33
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,380
You just hit the app icon and see what the first thing
you see is, what's the log in screen.
33

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,610
I'm going to put the name in the middle
and the logo at the top left, like we always do,
34

35
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,400
and then, how do you think they should be able to log in?
35

36
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,780
Well, I think it would makes sense to log in
with Facebook login and email.
36

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,140
Cool.
37

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,380
Now we have a finished screen. Now, we should ask the question "Should we link these two screens in any way
38

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,320
or at least draw some form of relationship between the two?"
39

40
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,400
Yeah, probably, so I'm just going to draw an arrow
from the log in screen to the main screen, and that
40

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,770
just shows that, you know, the log in screen is first,
and it's a linear process going from left to right.
41

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:40,800
just shows that, you know, the log in screen is first,
and it's a linear process going from left to right.
42

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,700
This is actually how most people when they're sketching will do it.
43

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,930
They'll just use arrows.
44

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,030
And then, often, right next to the arrows, what button they're clicking, or a description of the interaction, or maybe an animation.
45

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,240
And then, often, right next to the arrows, what button they're clicking, or a description of the interaction, or maybe an animation.
46

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,430
We don't need to do that.
47

48
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,570
And also, guys, keep in mind, this is supposed to be rapid.
48

49
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,270
That's why we do sketching.
49

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:06,180
No one's going to judge you based off of your ability
to draw or your ability to make something that
50

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,910
looks crisp, and clean, and makes sense immediately.
Remember: function, not form.
51

52
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,330
All right, great.
52

53
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,090
Now we have them linked, and for our purposes of showing other people, that's perfect, because that's going to show
53

54
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,200
them, and it makes a lot more sense to them
pretty much immediately.
54

55
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,210
Okay, what should we do on the first page?
55

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,800
Again, we're going to have to answer those questions that we asked ourselves as part of the exercise in the last lecture.
56

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,970
Again, we're going to have to answer those questions that we asked ourselves as part of the exercise in the last lecture.
57

58
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,650
Remember the first question? It is
"What is the point of this screen?"
58

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:46,200
Well, the point of the main screen, I would assume, is to let people actually find a grocery store and start picking items.
59

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,970
Well, the point of the main screen, I would assume, is to let people actually find a grocery store and start picking items.
60

61
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,850
I think that speed is probably important, so in the first
screen they should be able to do both those things.
61

62
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,450
I think that speed is probably important, so in the first
screen they should be able to do both those things.
62

63
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,860
All right, so let's draw it out. Let's make it so that
we can select a store that's near us, because we
63

64
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,740
obviously don't want order from the same store over
and over again, that's part of the appeal of the app, then
64

65
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,960
we put a little box where we can display the store names,
just so you know which one you are actually
65

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,260
operating, and then let's just draw in some boxes to show
where the favorite items or most common items
66

67
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,480
for that store would display.
67

68
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:21,840
All right. Awesome.
68

69
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,230
All right. Awesome.
69

70
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,320
So we actually have a decent wireframe right there,
but let's put some more detail into it.
70

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,870
Now, let's answer the second question.
71

72
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,830
"What should users be able to do?"
72

73
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:40,200
Well, I think that users should be able to visually see
the grocery items, just so they can really quickly
73

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:47,790
see what's available, and that's easier for them,
so let's draw in some actual apples, and bananas, and
74

75
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,170
grapes, and that little circular oranges, you got it, in orange.
75

76
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,280
grapes, and that little circular oranges, you got it, in orange.
76

77
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,690
I think users should also be able to see
what the price of the items are.
77

78
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,520
And I don't need to put a range or anything,
78

79
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,570
so I'm just going to put dollar sign, dollar sign,
because I think that the price, let's just put it right
79

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,780
underneath the image.
80

81
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,100
I also think that, since grocery stores have so many items,
and I'm on this screen, it wouldn't make sense
81

82
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,010
to just show me the popular items, regardless of
whether or not the user asked for it, so let's put a
82

83
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,710
search box, so I'll just draw out a little search box.
83

84
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,040
Cool. Check, check, and check.
84

85
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,200
Cool. Check, check, and check.
85

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,400
The point is to be able to find a grocery store
and start the process of ordering items.
86

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,540
Other things they should be able to do,
87

88
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,320
they should be able to search for their groceries,
see them, and know what they cost.
88

89
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,150
Okay, so now, let's say, if I clicked on one of the grocery items,
what do you think would happen?
89

90
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,060
Well, I'd probably go to a page where it gives more information.
90

91
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,390
Why?
91

92
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:52,710
Because a user needs more information about an apple,
or a pear, or whatever they're buying in order to buy it.
92

93
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,060
Because a user needs more information about an apple,
or a pear, or whatever they're buying in order to buy it.
93

94
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,210
They're not all commodities.
94

95
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,500
We need to give more information.
95

96
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,680
All right.
96

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,530
So let's make a new screen, and we can connect
these just like we connected the other ones.
97

98
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,800
So, this one, we'll just call this the detail page, and then
the detail page, we'll just draw a big image
98

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,580
of whatever it is, let's just draw an apple
because I'm great at drawing apples.
99

100
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,410
And now, the user gets a big picture of what it is, and so
that saves us the time of answering the question
100

101
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,770
of what's the point of this screen.
101

102
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,730
Well, the point of this screen is to display the items so they can see it, and give them information so that they can purchase it.
102

103
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,050
Well, the point of this screen is to display the items so they can see it, and give them information so that they can purchase it.
103

104
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,910
What should they also be able to do?
104

105
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,260
Well, they should probably also be able to read about it,
105

106
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,860
so I'm going to put some squiggly lines for text.
106

107
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,790
They should probably also be able to buy it, so I'll put a buy button.
107

108
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,450
They should probably also be able to buy it, so I'll put a buy button.
108

109
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,310
I'm going to guess that they should probably be able
to choose how many of them they're going to buy,
109

110
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,990
so I'll put a little number box where they can manipulate that.
110

111
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,160
And there you go, now you have it.
111

112
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,870
And there you go, now you have it.
112

113
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,650
That is a pretty decent wireframe right there.
113

114
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,160
There's an enormous amount of screens I can make
after that, but I would bore you guys to tears.
114

115
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,450
There's an enormous amount of screens I can make
after that, but I would bore you guys to tears.
115

116
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,030
Notice how, though, we went about it in a very
systematic way, very logical about it.
116

117
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,910
Always ask yourselves the questions that
we went over in the last lecture,
117

118
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,790
that'll get you out of a rut.
118

119
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,950
I always suggest starting with really easy intermediary screens
or elements that are always on the
119

120
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,490
page to get the juices flowing, to get you comfortable.
120

121
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,420
All right guys, in the next lecture, I have a treat for you,
because we're going to use a system called
121

122
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,960
POP, which is a mobile application that allows us
to take sketches and turn them into prototypes.
122

123
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,660
Interesting, right?
123

124
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,260
Interesting, right?
124

125
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,150
All right, see you in the next lecture.
