Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:10,020
All right, so now you are pretty much up to your neck
in information about how PMs look at MVPs and what
2

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:17,670
they are from an academic sense. You understand now
that MVPs, they change depending on the size
3

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,510
of the organization, because organizations have
vastly different amounts of resources to work with.
4

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,750
So, in the next set of lectures in this section,
we're going to go down step by step the process that
5

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,350
a product manager would take to come up with
an MVP experiment, and run it, and then learn from it.
6

7
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,340
Now, I'm going to explain briefly how the general
flow of an MVP experiment is going to go.
7

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,080
There are seven steps and we'll start with the first one.
8

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,940
The first step in running an MVP experiment is just
figuring out what exactly your problem and solution
9

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,630
set is. We're not going to jump on this in this section,
because you should have done that in the last
10

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,440
two sections, where we talked about figuring out what problem
your product or feature is actually aiming to solve.
11

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,310
two sections, where we talked about figuring out what problem
your product or feature is actually aiming to solve.
12

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,470
Now, you don't obviously need to know for a fact that that problem exists and that this solution is the best solution,
13

14
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,750
Now, you don't obviously need to know for a fact that that problem exists and that this solution is the best solution,
14

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,130
that's what we are going to use an MVP experiment for,
to figure out whether or not this is the right combo.
15

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,740
that's what we are going to use an MVP experiment for,
to figure out whether or not this is the right combo.
16

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,550
But once you do have on the table
what you want to try, the next step,
17

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:32,010
step number two is we need to identify the assumptions
associated with this problem - solution set.
18

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,090
step number two is we need to identify the assumptions
associated with this problem - solution set.
19

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,640
Any time you launch a new product, come up with a new feature,
20

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,460
you are assuming a lot of things, there are
a lot of things you just take for granted,
21

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,800
and there's a lot of different things that go into the
success of a product. So we're going to systematically
22

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,730
set down and try to think of what are
all the things that have to go right
23

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,670
for this to be successful. And at the end of that process,
we're going to figure out which of these assumptions
24

25
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:03,630
is the riskiest, which is the gunpowder in the bottom deck
of your ship that could just sink the whole thing.
25

26
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,270
is the riskiest, which is the gunpowder in the bottom deck
of your ship that could just sink the whole thing.
26

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,450
The next step, step number three, is once we have our assumptions, we're going to work on building testable 
27

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,790
hypotheses out of them.
28

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,940
It's a relatively simple, straightforward technique.
29

30
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,400
We'll take the assumptions and we'll figure out
a way of stating what exactly we think they are and
30

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,240
then establish criteria for testing. Building a hypothesis
around an assumption is relatively easy.
31

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,930
then establish criteria for testing. Building a hypothesis
around an assumption is relatively easy.
32

33
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,220
All we're doing is building statements that we are
confident about and we want to test based off of the
33

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,540
assumption. In the next step, step number four,
we're going to set up what's called a minimum criteria
34

35
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,960
for success. If we're going to run an experiment, and try
to test our assumptions and prove our hypotheses,
35

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,260
for success. If we're going to run an experiment, and try
to test our assumptions and prove our hypotheses,
36

37
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,000
we need to know what constitutes success
and what constitutes failure.
37

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,720
If you don't do this step, you have no idea if you succeeded
or you failed. We've got to draw a line in the sand
38

39
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,030
and then later we can look and say, "Ah, no,
I fell right before the line," or, you know, you actually 
39

40
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,750
made it past it. The next step is picking
40

41
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,840
what type of MVP you're going to run. There's a lot of different ways of getting validation from your customers or potential customers.
41

42
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,660
what type of MVP you're going to run. There's a lot of different ways of getting validation from your customers or potential customers.
42

43
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,350
It's just going to depend on what suits you, what suits the feature that you're going to propose and you're trying to build,
43

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,600
It's just going to depend on what suits you, what suits the feature that you're going to propose and you're trying to build,
44

45
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,360
and it's also going to really matter on how big your organization is.
45

46
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,560
The last two steps are executing the MVP experiment,
running it, getting it out there, getting some real, live
46

47
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,570
data, then iterating on that, collecting the data,
and figuring out whether or not you succeeded,
47

48
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,340
what worked, what didn't, and what you would change if you
were going to redo this experiment. At that point, you'll
48

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,440
have a hard yes or no about whether or not this is
a viable option and it's worth your time compared
49

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,510
to other opportunities you might have.
50

51
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,740
All right guys, hope you're excited.
In the next lecture, we're going to start with
51

52
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,080
step number two, which is taking a problem-solution set
and identifying assumptions that we are making about it.
52

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,680
step number two, which is taking a problem-solution set
and identifying assumptions that we are making about it.
53

54
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,200
See you then.
