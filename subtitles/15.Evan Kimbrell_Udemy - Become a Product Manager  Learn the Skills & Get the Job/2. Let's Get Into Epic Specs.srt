00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,780
So now that we understand what epics are in concept,
let's talk a little bit about how they work in reality.
1

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,660
Most project management software gives you the ability
to create an epic and then add features to that epic.
2

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,370
Most project management software gives you the ability
to create an epic and then add features to that epic.
3

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,060
This really depends on the project management
software you are using,
4

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,940
but, in any case, epics always have documentation with them,
and it describes what it is you're building and
5

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,270
then why. This documentation is called an epic spec sheet and
it's sometimes referred to as a requirements document.
6

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:30,880
then why. This documentation is called an epic spec sheet and
it's sometimes referred to as a requirements document.
7

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,420
You can make one pretty much anywhere, like Google Docs, your project management tool, or anything else that you want.
8

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,290
You can make one pretty much anywhere, like Google Docs, your project management tool, or anything else that you want.
9

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,260
It's just got to kind of be out there in the public for
people at your own company to look at. The purpose
10

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,440
of an epic spec sheet is to allow anyone in your company
to read it and understand exactly what you're building.
11

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,740
of an epic spec sheet is to allow anyone in your company
to read it and understand exactly what you're building.
12

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,230
It also serves as a guide for your own team as you build things.
So what do these epic specs look like? Well,
13

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,120
they usually have four main areas: an introduction,
the product requirements, the design requirements, and
14

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,400
then the engineering requirements. As a product manager,
you're in charge of creating and maintaining
15

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,910
the whole epic spec sheet and the epic itself, but you're especially responsible for the first two sections, which, again, are the
16

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,420
the whole epic spec sheet and the epic itself, but you're especially responsible for the first two sections, which, again, are the
17

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,490
introduction and the product requirements section.
18

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,280
Let's go through each section of a typical
epic spec sheet individually.
19

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,100
So, first, we've got the introduction. This is really just a
summary of what the feature or features you're
20

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,040
building are for and why you're building it.
What metrics are you trying to improve?
21

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,380
And you can also put in any links to supporting
documentation or other miscellaneous things like
22

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,000
marketing plans, legal requirements, and that kind of thing.
23

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,420
This is also where you can write down what a feature
or functionality looks like, some early wireframes,
24

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,140
and what it looks like in an ideal state down the road
versus what you're going to start out building
25

26
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,180
for your MVP, and then maybe what it looks like for a V2, etc.
26

27
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,010
So the second section is the product requirements.
27

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,440
And here we're talking about the features or
functionality that we're developing in detail.
28

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,940
We go deeper on what is required.
29

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,500
For instance, we might say that the feature has to be
fast, or it has to be available in a certain language,
30

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,830
or it must generate a certain type of data
and then store it for later use.
31

32
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,040
So the next section is the design requirements.
32

33
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,940
This section is to be filled out by both you
and the designer together,
33

34
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,850
but a little bit more emphasis is to come from
the designer here, since they're the experts.
34

35
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,310
Let's imagine that, for a particular feature, the designer
wants to display the user profile picture with
35

36
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,090
a really high resolution, because they think
that's the best design.
36

37
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,060
This is where that would be stated.
37

38
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,400
This is also where you and your designer will attach
any early wireframes, and sketches, or high fidelity
38

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,310
prototypes to help the engineers better understand
the requirements and what's got to be done here.
39

40
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,980
So now, onto the engineering requirements section of the spec sheet. This is the portion that is mostly filled out by your engineers
40

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,900
So now, onto the engineering requirements section of the spec sheet. This is the portion that is mostly filled out by your engineers
41

42
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,450
after you discuss the product and design requirements with them.
Here is where the engineers can write
42

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:22,650
out database and technology requirements, or outline
the series of things that must be done on the technology
43

44
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,680
side in order to support the new feature.
44

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,520
An example here would be developing a certain API
endpoint in order to get the high resolution picture
45

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,990
stated in the design requirements.
46

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,390
Or they could know that they need to work with another
team to access their database in order to get
47

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,200
the information that's required to make this feature.
48

49
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,460
So let's recap here.
49

50
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:54,540
Epics always have accompanying documentation or spec
sheets to inform other teams or guide ours as we build.
50

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,140
Epics always have accompanying documentation or spec
sheets to inform other teams or guide ours as we build.
51

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,250
In most cases, this epic spec sheet will have a few major
sections, including introduction, product requirements,
52

53
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,250
design requirements, and engineering requirements.
53

54
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,470
It's important that your epic spec sheet is available to
anyone in the company so that they can easily
54

55
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,990
understand who is building what, like which teams are working
on what things, and why they're working on them.
55

56
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,530
understand who is building what, like which teams are working
on what things, and why they're working on them.
56

57
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:23,670
I also want to mention that the way that companies do epic spec sheets is not the exact same from company to company.
57

58
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,610
I also want to mention that the way that companies do epic spec sheets is not the exact same from company to company.
58

59
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,800
Some companies will say "Our epic specs or requirements
docs need to have more information or less,"
59

60
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,890
and some companies don't even use them at all.
60

61
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,460
But this is the standard practice, and you absolutely
need to be familiar with it as a product manager.
61

62
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:38,520
But this is the standard practice, and you absolutely
need to be familiar with it as a product manager.
62

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,280
So we've got the basic foundation of a new feature,
or functionality, or set of functionalities with epics
63

64
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,130
and epic spec sheets.
64

65
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,530
Let's find out in the next lecture where we go after that.
