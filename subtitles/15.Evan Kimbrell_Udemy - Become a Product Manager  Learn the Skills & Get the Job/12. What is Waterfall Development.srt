In the Agile app example, we took those 10 features we thought we wanted and we only selected a few that
1

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,760
we thought were the most important,
2

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,830
and we took those, and we researched them, designed them, developed them, and then released them and validated
3

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,170
whether or not those were the things that users were interested in.
Waterfall looks a little bit more something like this.

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,710
We take all 10 of those features that we think we want and we develop them all at the same time.
6

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,750
So we research, design, develop, and release
every single one of them all at once.

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,330
Doing things in a Waterfall way is sometimes pretty risky because your software product might have a
8

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,980
ton of features and when you have a ton of features it's going to take a long time to develop them all at once.

10

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,830
During that time your competitors may do something or you may find something else about the user needs
11

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,160
or market that makes it much harder to adapt.
12

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,350
You also might find that after you've developed it your users wanted something else that you spent little
13

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,750
time on and you spent the most time on stuff
that they're not actually going to be using.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,700
So after all this trash talking on Waterfall development,
you might be thinking, "When is it ever useful?"

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,070
Well, there's actually a few specific use cases where Waterfall development is pretty useful, and we're
17

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,950
going to talk about those in the next lecture.
