00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,810
Alright, so in the last lecture we discussed the first four phases of the product development process.
1

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,850
That company conceives the new product, they plan it out,
2

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,860
they develop it, and then they iterate on it before you even launch it, and you do this using the early
3

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,560
test feedback, or the Alphas and the Betas, and there's a few other types of things we can do to get that feedback.
4

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,540
test feedback, or the Alphas and the Betas, and there's a few other types of things we can do to get that feedback.
5

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,370
But after that's done, we want to do three more things. We want to launch, then we want to hold it in a steady state,
6

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,400
But after that's done, we want to do three more things. We want to launch, then we want to hold it in a steady state,
7

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,900
and then after that we decide if we want to maintain it
or we kill the product.
8

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,560
So let's talk about launch.
9

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,740
* We have a lift up! * We want to work with the marketing team, and the legal team, the PR team, the sales team,
10

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,980
and we want to position this product for public launch.
11

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,400
Then we actually send it out there to the public,
12

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,080
we see what kind of reaction we get. Then the sixth major phase is called steady state or just basically
13

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,040
hold it in either a steady state or continue iterating on it.
14

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,380
During this time we're collecting metrics on how people are using it,
15

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,200
how often are people buying it,
16

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,260
we analyze the product, we optimize our metrics,
17

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,800
we try to get the maximum return for investment on it.
18

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,560
During this time we also have marketing continuing to market it and salespeople continuing to sell it.
19

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,450
We assess our continued efforts here to basically see how likely are we to continue moving forward with this.
20

21
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,020
We assess our continued efforts here to basically see how likely are we to continue moving forward with this.
21

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,350
Then we move on to the seventh and final phase of the product development process, maintain or kill. 
22

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,110
At this point we decide, using all the data we've already gathered and especially from the last phase,
23

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,480
how frequently are people purchasing this,
24

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,150
are we staying on top of the market,
25

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,230
are we competitive with this product anymore?
26

27
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,480
And we look at, more importantly, how much money are we spending to maintain it,
27

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,340
to see, is it even paying for itself?
28

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,180
How is our return on investment?
29

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,670
If it's not doing so well then maybe we decide to kill it and we decide to move on to something new.
30

31
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,140
.
31

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,450
.
32

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,300
And one thing that's important to mention here is that it may not have anything to do with the revenue
33

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,460
of that product or maybe even the usage.
34

35
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,950
It could just not fit our company vision anymore.
35

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,820
Our executives and the people that are leading the company might decide just based on market circumstance
36

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,440
that the company is now going in a different direction.
37

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,860
So we need to go ahead and cut our losses on that product or go ahead and put it to bed.
38

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:47,700
.
39

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,870
If we decide to kill a product then we do what's called sunsetting.
40

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,600
You've probably heard this before.
41

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,260
This is a slow transition to the end of life of the product. We message our user base, we tell them what's
42

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,750
going on, and we have an end of life plan for the users and the people that may rely on it.
43

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,840
So if we have a company or a product that is storing data for people, for instance, then we may allow
44

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,930
them to backup their data before we shut down the product.
45

46
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,090
Everyone has probably seen a product that they love to use, you know, be killed and it's always very sad
46

47
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,440
but unfortunately sometimes there's not much you can do about it.
47

48
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,720
But I have had a lot of good experiences with products that are dying and being killed out,
48

49
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,600
but they'll still light, or bring out your data, or something like that.
49

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,540
This is really good practice. Alright.
50

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,640
So those are the seven main phases: conceive, plan, develop, iterate, launch, steady state, and then finally we maintain it or kill it.
51

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,750
So those are the seven main phases: conceive, plan, develop, iterate, launch, steady state, and then finally we maintain it or kill it.
52

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,660
One thing to mention here is that this might sound a little bit academic to you but it is because
53

54
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,470
it is actually pretty academic.
54

55
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,810
You know, this is a process that every product goes through, but you're not going to be actually using
55

56
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,330
these terms, you know, in the office every day. It's just very important as a product manager to understand
56

57
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,540
that every type of product or company
goes through these types of phases,
57

58
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,770
and there's things to consider about each.
58

59
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,510
So without any further ado, let's go into the next section.
59

60
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,740
I will see you there.
