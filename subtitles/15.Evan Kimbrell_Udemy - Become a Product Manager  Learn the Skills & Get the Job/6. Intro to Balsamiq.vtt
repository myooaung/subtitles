00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.630
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.070
So, in the last lectures, we learned how to sketch, we learned how to think our way through basic wire frames,
2

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.700
and even learned how to use POP so that we can add
some basic interaction to the sketches we had before.
3

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.090
and even learned how to use POP so that we can add
some basic interaction to the sketches we had before.
4

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.150
Now it's time to upgrade and add a little bit of fidelity, tiny bit of fidelity, we're not going to make mockups yet, what we're
5

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.010
Now it's time to upgrade and add a little bit of fidelity, tiny bit of fidelity, we're not going to make mockups yet, what we're
6

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.800
going to do is we're going to learn how to use Balsamiq.
7

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.980
I think, as a prospective product manager, It really helps
to have one of the wireframing tools under your belt,
8

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.540
I think, as a prospective product manager, It really helps
to have one of the wireframing tools under your belt,
9

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.840
so I picked the tool that is probably the most popular
for low fidelity wireframes and also happens
10

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.260
to be probably the fastest as well.
11

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.340
That's the reason why I like it.
12

13
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.940
At the end of this lecture, you'll know
how to get into Balsamiq and be dangerous,
13

14
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.860
make pretty much whatever you want.
14

15
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.900
It's a very simple application.
15

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.150
It's not going to take us a ton of time to get up and running in it.
16

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.010
If you're the type that does not like tutorials of software
and someone showing you what you should
17

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.960
care about and think about first, skip the lecture,
see you in the next lecture. For the rest of you guys,
18

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.010
care about and think about first, skip the lecture,
see you in the next lecture. For the rest of you guys,
19

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.990
care about and think about first, skip the lecture,
see you in the next lecture. For the rest of you guys,
20

21
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.130
let's jump in.
21

22
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.340
All right. So this is what Balsamiq's website looks like.
22

23
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.920
All right. So this is what Balsamiq's website looks like.
23

24
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.440
They offer their service in two different ways.
24

25
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.350
One is a web version and one is a desktop version.
25

26
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:34.650
Now, there's pros and cons to both. The web version
is cheaper and the desktop version is more expensive,
26

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.270
but the web version is a subscription, whereas
the desktop app is one payment one time.
27

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.340
For you guys out there that don't know if you want to
buy this stuff, don't worry, they have a free trial,
28

29
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.850
and you can try either one you want. If you don't
want to save something on your computer,
29

30
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.870
go for the web app, if you're fine saving stuff
on your computer, I prefer using the desktop app,
30

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.310
it's faster, it's easier to use, in my opinion, and you
don't have to wait for your browser to constantly update.
31

32
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.270
it's faster, it's easier to use, in my opinion, and you
don't have to wait for your browser to constantly update.
32

33
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.170
All right, so take your pick.
33

34
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.450
Download whichever one you want to do.
34

35
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.820
I'll see you as soon as you get into it.
35

36
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.520
Really fast forward to the future.
36

37
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.140
Okay.
37

38
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:15.960
All right, so this is what the desktop application looks like.
It's very similar to the web application,
38

39
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.910
in fact, I'm not even sure there's anything really
that much different about it.
39

40
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.710
Now, Balsamiq is very, very simple.
40

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.600
There is just this screen.
41

42
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.210
Not only is this application fast, it is very, very simple,
42

43
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.890
another one of the good things about it. People often
fault Balsamiq for being simple, but I challenge you
43

44
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.700
to find something you can't wireframe with Balsamiq.
44

45
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.660
They are simple, but they've really thought out
pretty much everything in their app.
45

46
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.940
All right, so the way that this works is pretty much
like any editing tool that uses a canvas and then
46

47
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.340
has tools, like Photoshop, like a sketch.
47

48
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.810
If you're not familiar with those, don't worry.
Right here is the canvas, okay?
48

49
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.560
If you're not familiar with those, don't worry.
Right here is the canvas, okay?
49

50
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.620
This is where we're going to take elements and add it to
the canvas, manipulate them, and create our wireframe.
50

51
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.920
This is where we're going to take elements and add it to
the canvas, manipulate them, and create our wireframe.
51

52
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.750
Now, this canvas here is not defined
as in there are no boundaries to it.
52

53
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.070
I can scroll up and down and just go on for ever.
53

54
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.290
There's really no limit to where I can place things in this area.
Alright, so at the top you can see all of the
54

55
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.730
elements that you can use, they have them sectioned
off into little groups here, which is the way that
55

56
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.780
you find them. There is no search for some reason,
I believe they removed it from a previous version,
56

57
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.940
so you're going to have to get used to these categories.
57

58
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.960
All right, so they have categories for
pretty much everything you would want.
58

59
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.940
Now, if you want to add something to the canvas, you
can drag and drop or just double click. If you wanted
59

60
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.030
to do add an iPhone, we go over to the iOS section, which
holds a bunch of elements for mobile applications, and
60

61
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.630
I just double click an iPhone.
61

62
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.380
All right, so now that it's in the canvas, it's really easy.
I have boundary boxes up here if I wanted to shrink
62

63
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.250
it or grow it in any way, it'll tell me how many pixels it is,
if you want to get exact. Over here, what
63

64
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.210
we have is called the inspector and the inspector
allows us to add modifications to our elements.
64

65
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.670
I can manually pick the size of it or the positioning.
65

66
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.690
Notice how, as I move this, the position changes, it's an
absolute position. I can change it between things like the
66

67
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.270
iPhone 4, iPhone 5, I can make it landscape versus portrait.
67

68
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.270
I can even add in some really helpful stuff, like top bars
and lower bars, which are really helpful, because
68

69
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.910
remember the first thing we do, with iOS at least, we always
add a navigation bar, so that saves us time. It also
69

70
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.810
gives you the option to change the layering
of your canvas and your wireframing, and
70

71
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.670
let me show you what that means.
71

72
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.250
Let's say I wanted to add this iOS keyboard onto
my iPhone, let's make it line up.
72

73
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.240
Great.
73

74
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.520
Now, what you have to keep in mind is that these two elements are quite literally stacked on top of each other, it's like paper.
74

75
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.640
Now, what you have to keep in mind is that these two elements are quite literally stacked on top of each other, it's like paper.
75

76
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.080
That's the easiest way of thinking about it.
76

77
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.640
Right now, the keyboard is on top because I created it second,
but if I wanted the keyboard to be behind
77

78
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.440
the iPhone for whatever reason, I would just send it backward,
78

79
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.780
right? So when I hit "Send it backward" it goes back
one layer behind whatever is directly behind it, or
79

80
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.340
I can send it at the bottom, or I can
send it to the front with these buttons.
80

81
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.600
All right. Pretty simple, right?
81

82
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.600
All right. Pretty simple, right?
82

83
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.810
So let's start throwing some more elements on the page.
83

84
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.120
We have the option of adding things like forms,
84

85
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.060
these are incredibly helpful if you ever need to create a form.
Incredibly tedious, but with Balsamiq, you
85

86
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.250
can do it pretty easily.
86

87
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.000
Buttons are over here, very easy to change the text
just by double clicking them, so we can change it
87

88
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.750
to "Buy now" or whatever it is, you can change the color,
you can add icons, and we'll talk about icons in just a second.
88

89
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.770
to "Buy now" or whatever it is, you can change the color,
you can add icons, and we'll talk about icons in just a second.
89

90
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.940
You can create a form then by just throwing down a
bunch of stuff that you would normally see in
90

91
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:59.270
a form, and notice this one thing, as I move elements
on the canvas, it will bring up guidelines, little grids,
91

92
00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.820
a form, and notice this one thing, as I move elements
on the canvas, it will bring up guidelines, little grids,
92

93
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.930
and this is incredibly helpful for aligning things. Specifically,
93

94
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.740
if I was making a form, I would want
everything to line up on the left, right?
94

95
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.770
Well, I can do that really easily without having to zoom in
by clicking the second element, and then just
95

96
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.740
lining it up right there with the left end. I can also
line it up with the middle of the element.
96

97
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.100
It's tricky, but there it goes.
97

98
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.140
If I want to do center alignment, or with the middle
of the design, which actually happens to be right
98

99
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.290
there, because it's the middle of the canvas.
99

100
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.760
All right.
100

101
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.010
Let's see what else we can add in it.
101

102
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.680
Let's throw in some text right there, we'll call it a form.
102

103
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.090
Let's see what else we can add in.
103

104
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:45.780
Let's say we want to grab some numbers, maybe turn
something on and off right there, line them up, and
104

105
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.620
there you go, you have the most basic form ever made.
105

106
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.080
Now, I also have the option of adding icons.
106

107
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.980
Now, I said I will get back to these. What an icon is it's
just going to be a blank space whenever you add it,
107

108
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.460
Now, I said I will get back to these. What an icon is it's
just going to be a blank space whenever you add it,
108

109
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.940
but if you double click this magic thing, it gives you
an enormous option of icons you can choose from.
109

110
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.290
but if you double click this magic thing, it gives you
an enormous option of icons you can choose from.
110

111
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.460
Now, don't worry, it's not going to send these icons
into a box, it's going to take the place of the box.
111

112
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.570
Now, don't worry, it's not going to send these icons
into a box, it's going to take the place of the box.
112

113
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.460
They have hundreds and hundreds of icons here.
113

114
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.350
You can pick the size that you want and it'll give you a preview.
114

115
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.220
You can also search over here for whatever
specifically you wanted.
115

116
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.740
If I want to get really specific, I'm looking for a rupee.
116

117
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.470
There we go.
117

118
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.670
That's actually the symbol, great.
118

119
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.510
Now I can use that for whatever I was planning to use it for.
119

120
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:36.450
Similarly, I can add icons to things like buttons. So, in
the button right here, over here I can add an icon.
120

121
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.630
Similarly, I can add icons to things like buttons. So, in
the button right here, over here I can add an icon.
121

122
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.950
Okay.
122

123
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.150
So if I wanted to add a rupee to that, there you go.
123

124
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.630
So if I wanted to add a rupee to that, there you go.
124

125
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.100
Now we added a rupee, and I can also
change the size to make it fit,
125

126
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.760
so it doesn't stick out so much.
126

127
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.170
And there you go.
127

128
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:53.420
All right, so that is the basics of Balsamiq,
there's not that much left to go over.
128

129
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.850
You can add certain things like states to buttons.
129

130
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.760
So you have this button.
130

131
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.750
When I say a state, a state could be clicked or unclicked,
for instance, or greyed out. It could be the state,
131

132
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.400
When I say a state, a state could be clicked or unclicked,
for instance, or greyed out. It could be the state,
132

133
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.100
it could be selected, in focus, or disabled. Let's say
selected, see how it changes the color.
133

134
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.610
it could be selected, in focus, or disabled. Let's say
selected, see how it changes the color.
134

135
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:16.220
That's helpful if I'm putting wireframes in a row,
showing a sequence, or if I want to get really specific
135

136
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:22.620
saying "When this button is depressed, then you see
these other elements on the screen." Over here, in the
136

137
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.890
Common section, you'll see all the common things,
you would see, image boxes are right here,
137

138
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.660
Notice how before, in wireframes, typically you won't have the image or sketch out the image, you'll put a box and write "image."
138

139
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:36.330
Notice how before, in wireframes, typically you won't have the image or sketch out the image, you'll put a box and write "image."
139

140
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.940
But if you wanted to, you could put something in.
140

141
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:46.220
I like doing it like this, clicking it and hitting Enter,
and then putting "image" in the middle, so
141

142
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.930
you can see that, hey, this is an image.
142

143
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:55.190
You can also just double tap on it if you wanted to add
an image in that container, it'll insert an image
143

144
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.960
into the container and constrict it, and then
you can expand it to your heart's content.
144

145
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.300
If you ever want to duplicate something, it's relatively easy.
145

146
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:11.270
I just use copy and paste, you can do it up here,
Edit - Copy, and then, you know, Ctrl+V, and you can
146

147
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.010
copy it right there, and then you can use
grids for alignment, yada yada yada.
147

148
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.950
The last two things I want to show you are,
one, annotations, and two, then
148

149
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:26.910
how do we export? Now, annotations in Balsamiq are
controlled in really kind of a goofy way, we just
149

150
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.480
use it through stickies.
150

151
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.120
Now, go over to the Markup right here.
151

152
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:37.340
If I wanted to add something onto the page, like a comment
for someone else reading this, right here I
152

153
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:44.420
could put a sticky, and then put a description saying, you know,
"This is the screen that does this" or some
153

154
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.370
comment that you want other people to notice,
and then I can use arrows right here. If I want to change
154

155
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:57.300
the arrows, I have in the inspector ways of changing it, changing the size, the length, which way it points, in which direction,
155

156
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.770
the arrows, I have in the inspector ways of changing it, changing the size, the length, which way it points, in which direction,
156

157
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:06.540
in case I wanted to, say, point the sticky in
that direction. And there you go.
157

158
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:21.040
When you want to save your creations, you have to export them,
and you'll have to export them either as an image or a PDF,
158

159
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.810
When you want to save your creations, you have to export them,
and you'll have to export them either as an image or a PDF,
159

160
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.930
or you can share it and use a share link online.
160

161
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.410
That's great if you want to share it with other people.
161

162
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.310
Otherwise, you'll have to export it and send it to them. If you want to create multiple mockups, by the way, you just click this,
162

163
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.300
Otherwise, you'll have to export it and send it to them. If you want to create multiple mockups, by the way, you just click this,
163

164
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.610
and then you can create another mockup, and if you
click here, it'll show you all the mockups you have made.
164

165
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:41.820
and then you can create another mockup, and if you
click here, it'll show you all the mockups you have made.
165

166
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.300
When you then export, it'll put all of them together
into one long PDF, and if you have a lot of them,
166

167
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.520
they'll create a table of contents at the top.
167

168
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.230
All right guys, that is, for the most part,
168

169
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.380
all you need to know to get into Balsamiq and get dangerous.
169

170
00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.270
There's a lot of other things I obviously didn't cover,
but you'll figure them out pretty quickly.
170

171
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.520
That is 90% of it.
171

172
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.790
All right guys, in the next lecture,
we're going to practice this just a little bit.
172

173
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.870
If you don't feel like you need practice, then just skip on
to the next lecture, it won't hurt my feelings.
173

174
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.880
For the rest of you guys, I'll see you in the next lecture.
174

175
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.910
For the rest of you guys, I'll see you in the next lecture.
