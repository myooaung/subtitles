Hey Guys welcome to the first actual lecture of the course.
1

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,580
We're going to talk about Become a Product Manager, 
why we made it,
2

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:18,240
what we're going to cover, what you should expect, and give you guys some tips with how you should go forward.

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,810
what we're going to cover, what you should expect, and give you guys some tips with how you should go forward.
4

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,260
First, I thought we should just step back and answer the question "Why did we make this course?"
5

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,100
We've made this course because, as I got into my career as a product manager, there were so many people that
6

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,900
came up to me and were asking, "How do I become a product manager and what do I need to do?"
7

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,210
And, as you might know, product management is not something that you can study in school, there is no major for it.
8

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,600
And, as you might know, product management is not something that you can study in school, there is no major for it.
9

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,760
There's very few formal education programs in order to get into product management.
10

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,590
Yeah. So I wanted to make Become a Product Manager because I have 11 courses on entrepreneurship
11

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,510
Yeah. So I wanted to make Become a Product Manager because I have 11 courses on entrepreneurship
12

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,040
and I know that a lot of my students want to build a more well-rounded skill set with regards to starting
13

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,900
their own venture and product management is essential to that.
14

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,240
You need to have a basic understanding of product management if you're ever gonna be successful as an entrepreneur.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,140
You need to have a basic understanding of product management if you're ever gonna be successful as an entrepreneur.
16

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,650
You know, there's a lot of skills that go into starting a venture, but then after it actually gets some
17

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,720
customers and it's off and it's running, it's now a product and you have to manage it.
18

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,510
You have to make hard day to day decisions about what features to drop, what feedback should you filter out or take,
19

20
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,050
You have to make hard day to day decisions about what features to drop, what feedback should you filter out or take,
20

21
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,620
how do you prioritize what metrics matter, all of this stuff is just crucial to being an entrepreneur.
21

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,570
how do you prioritize what metrics matter, all of this stuff is just crucial to being an entrepreneur.
22

23
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:46,470
Well, I mean we kind of alluded to it already, it's people who want to become a product manager, or
23

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,880
entrepreneurs, or graphic designers, even if you're just someone who has programming experience and you want to learn
24

25
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,580
this discipline because product management,
25

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,100
I mean, you'll see in the course it touches everything.
26

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,890
It's kind of at the center of all of the disciplines you will run into when you're in a startup.
27

28
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,550
It's kind of at the center of all of the disciplines you will run into when you're in a startup.
28

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:12,420
It's also for people that are just now getting into product management and are wondering really how
29

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,970
to become a more advanced product manager or what are the rules and responsibilities and goals around
30

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,980
being a product manager at a company of various sizes, 
because it does change.
31

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,390
We have 16 sections, something like that, so we cover an enormous amount of information.
32

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,030
We have 16 sections, something like that, so we cover an enormous amount of information.
33

34
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:41,280
It's divided into two different large sections essentially, modules we'll call it, the first one is learning
34

35
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,910
the discipline of product management, learning all of the concepts and the skills associated with it.
35

36
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,120
the discipline of product management, learning all of the concepts and the skills associated with it.
36

37
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Then the second part is for those of you out there who want to get a job, we're going to take those skills and snowball 
37

38
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,890
them into finding a job that fits,
38

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,270
angling yourself for that job, researching the company, writing your resume, getting the interview, and then nailing the interview,
39

40
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,880
angling yourself for that job, researching the company, writing your resume, getting the interview, and then nailing the interview,
40

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,620
getting the job, and then we even have a section on beyond that. 
Yeah, we even cover some of the more of 
41

42
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,380
minutia sorts of things like technology.
42

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,730
We're actually going to find all the technology that you'll need to know in order to interact with engineers more effectively,
43

44
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,230
We're actually going to find all the technology that you'll need to know in order to interact with engineers more effectively,
44

45
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,290
and we talk about more granular things like metrics, and metrics that matter, and metrics that don't,
45

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,430
and give you practice and activities on all these lectures.
46

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,640
We also cover a lot of skills that are not absolutely necessary to being a product manager, but will make you a really good one.
47

48
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,720
We also cover a lot of skills that are not absolutely necessary to being a product manager, but will make you a really good one.
48

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,020
We have an extensive section on building MVPs, 
because that's my specialty.
49

50
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:52,050
So I'm teaching a hardcore version of how to build and test MVP experiments, we also do things like wireframing.
50

51
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,400
You might not necessarily need to know wireframing, but you're in a much better position if you know
51

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,750
how to. 
We even have a section at the end that covers once you've got a job in product management,
52

53
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,720
again, we help you with your resume, and where to look, and all that sort of thing, but once you've got the job,
53

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:06,990
again, we help you with your resume, and where to look, and all that sort of thing, but once you've got the job, how do you excel?
54

55
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,820
again, we help you with your resume, and where to look, and all that sort of thing, but once you've got the job, how do you excel?
55

56
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,170
What are the first things you should do as a product manager and then how do you sell? And this is stuff
56

57
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,610
that I've picked up over six plus years of 
being a product manager myself.
57

58
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,890
All right, guys, so I hope you're excited to take the course.
58

59
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,720
We're excited to teach it.
59

60
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,210
There's a lot, a lot of information in here.
60

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,640
If you finish this thing, you will be insanely knowledgeable.
61

62
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,330
Yeah, you'll be in a really good spot, a much better spot,
62

63
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,760
I guarantee you, than I was in when I started out my career, or any number of current product managers, because
63

64
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,040
like I said, they all got into it in a roundabout way, 
and only now are we getting to the point where
64

65
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,930
we can train people using courses online like this one.
65

66
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,460
All right, guys, see you in the next lecture.
66

67
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,960
See you in there!
67

68
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,970
See you in there!
