Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,480
Let's dive right back in and start talking
about more MVP techniques.
2

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,830
Now we're going to start talking about ones that
require more resource investment, look a little more
3

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,650
real, less scrappy, but still pretty scrappy.
4

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,370
So the next one we're going to talk about
is called the explainer MVP.
5

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,230
This is a little bit harder to do because it requires
some resources to make. Explainers, if you don't
6

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,680
know what I'm talking about, are those videos that explain what an app does, or what a new feature or feature set will do.
7

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,480
know what I'm talking about, are those videos that explain what an app does, or what a new feature or feature set will do.
8

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,470
They come in two different types: you have tutorial
style explainers and sales style explainers. In a
9

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,380
tutorial style, you'll see someone manually explaining over a screencast, much in the same way that companies
10

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,410
use tutorial screencasts to explain
how to do certain tasks in their product.
11

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,930
In this version, someone will pretend to use a new feature
or product and explain what it does and why
12

13
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,340
they made it, but they haven't actually built it yet.
13

14
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,410
It's all smoke and mirrors.
14

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:14,370
Actually, the way it looks real is in editing. In editing,
you create this illusion that you have a working
15

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:22,020
product by animating certain things and having them,
for instance, navigate from one static page to another static page.
16

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,330
product by animating certain things and having them,
for instance, navigate from one static page to another static page.
17

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,640
They're not connected, they don't work, but
you'll just cut the video so it looks like they do.
18

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,340
Sounds a little nutty?
19

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,860
Yeah, it does.
20

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,980
But this is actually a fairly common way of
pre-validating before you build. True story,
21

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,340
this is actually how Dropbox started. Dropbox, if you're not familiar,
22

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,240
this is actually how Dropbox started. Dropbox, if you're not familiar,
23

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,910
multi-billion dollar company that lets you store anything in their data servers through a desktop and browser client.
24

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,970
multi-billion dollar company that lets you store anything in their data servers through a desktop and browser client.
25

26
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,260
When the founder first started Dropbox, he wanted to test
to see if people wanted this idea, this cloud
26

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,900
storage idea where you could sink your files very seamlessly to servers somewhere else and have access
27

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,120
to your files anywhere you go.
28

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,830
So what he did is he just made a fake video of him using his product and put it on YouTube.
29

30
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,600
The response was huge,
30

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,380
so he knew it was worth building. The other
type of explainer is the sales related explainer,
31

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,870
and this is just more when you make more like a fake promo video that pitches the product or the feature using - who knows? -
32

33
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,530
and this is just more when you make more like a fake promo video that pitches the product or the feature using - who knows? -
33

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,210
and this is just more when you make more like a fake promo video that pitches the product or the feature using - who knows? -
34

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,860
it could be one of those, you know, whiteboard videos,
with the super fake looking hand that comes up in
35

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,670
the middle and writes, or you could use an animated one,
or even a talking head video like this as your promo.
36

37
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:38,790
the middle and writes, or you could use an animated one,
or even a talking head video like this as your promo.
37

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,550
A decent example that I actually saw the other day was
a company called Frame.io, that makes a collaborative
38

39
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,600
web app for video editors and producers -
we actually use it to make our courses.
39

40
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,120
They made a video pitching a new set of features that added
all sorts of crazy animations and CG,
40

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,780
but actually those features had not been added yet at all.
41

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,470
They just said it was launching very soon and to sign up for a notification. Presumably, if not enough people signed up, then
42

43
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,960
They just said it was launching very soon and to sign up for a notification. Presumably, if not enough people signed up, then
43

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,560
who knows, maybe they just wouldn't launch
the feature and maybe it'd just disappear.
44

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,790
Either way, no one is the wiser.
45

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,290
The point is that this MVP works because real products
generally will have promotion videos of some
46

47
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,560
kind, and real features will often have tutorial
videos showing how to use them.
47

48
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,230
So you just kind of slip in an explainer video, and there you go,
that's your validation. The next MVP we going to
48

49
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,660
discuss is called the fake landing page pitch experiment
49

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,200
MVP. This is when a business will create one singular page
that pitches all of the benefits of a new
50

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,550
product and then has a call to action 
51

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,550
somewhere on the page. Since you might not know
what some of these terms are that I just used,
52

53
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,760
let's break it down just a little bit.
53

54
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:02,580
Landing pages are a term used for web pages that are just
one page. They're a marketing tool so that companies
54

55
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,230
can run ads and have a very controlled experience
when people move from that ad to that site. It doesn't
55

56
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,770
generally make sense to have an ad for, let's say,
an e-commerce store that just added the new iPhone SE,
56

57
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,500
generally make sense to have an ad for, let's say,
an e-commerce store that just added the new iPhone SE,
57

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,190
and when people click on the ad that says "We have the iPhone,"
they go to the home page of your e-commerce
58

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,430
store, where nowhere on the page
are you talking about the iPhone.
59

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,150
The person generally will get confused and will probably leave.
60

61
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,150
So that's one of the primary uses of landing pages,
although they are pretty versatile.
61

62
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,520
And essentially, if you want your users to specifically
do something, like sign up, or pay, or fill out
62

63
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,280
a form, you're probably going to use a landing page.
63

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,160
Now, the other term I used was "pitch experiment."
64

65
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,100
Now, this is just a nifty little term worth knowing,
although you might not ever actually use it in conversation.
65

66
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,490
Now, this is just a nifty little term worth knowing,
although you might not ever actually use it in conversation.
66

67
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,270
It's a term from The Lean Startup framework. A pitch
experiment is basically when you have an online
67

68
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:11,670
experiment where you pitch for a new product or a new feature
to an online audience and you see what they do.
68

69
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,500
experiment where you pitch for a new product or a new feature
to an online audience and you see what they do.
69

70
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:20,790
Landing pages are a natural fit for this because they're
one completely focused page that you can deliver
70

71
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:27,480
a product or feature pitch directly to the user, whether they
like it or not, they can't ignore it. As far as MVPs go,
71

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,850
a product or feature pitch directly to the user, whether they
like it or not, they can't ignore it. As far as MVPs go,
72

73
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,620
the landing page pitch experiment is kind of the gold
standard, at least for entrepreneurial MVP tests.
73

74
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,850
Got an idea for a product? Create a fake product page
and drive traffic to it. See how they react.
74

75
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,280
Got an idea for a product? Create a fake product page
and drive traffic to it. See how they react.
75

76
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,720
Product managers with existing user bases
can also use this technique quite well.
76

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,970
Instead of getting external traffic, you're just going to
drive your internal traffic to a page through
77

78
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,980
an email, internal ads, push notifications, whatever.
78

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,100
Now, two classic examples of a landing page pitch experiment are, 1, a company called Buffer, and 2, a company called Basecamp.
79

80
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,970
Now, two classic examples of a landing page pitch experiment are, 1, a company called Buffer, and 2, a company called Basecamp.
80

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,980
Let's talk about them. Buffer. Buffer is an online service,
81

82
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,620
if you haven't actually heard of it, that helps you manage
your company's social media messaging campaigns.
82

83
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:16,870
if you haven't actually heard of it, that helps you manage
your company's social media messaging campaigns.
83

84
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,110
One of the main things it'll do is help you schedule
when your messages go out in advance, so you don't
84

85
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,850
have to have someone sitting at the computer,
writing all of your Facebook posts.
85

86
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,190
Now, Buffer started off by creating a fake page pitching what their service would do, and then just drove traffic to the page.
86

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,020
Now, Buffer started off by creating a fake page pitching what their service would do, and then just drove traffic to the page.
87

88
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:40,480
They actually set it up in a way where they put up
pieces of what they thought about adding and then
88

89
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,110
they saw what things people interacted with, they kind of
just used it as like a puzzle piece, jigsaw puzzle,
89

90
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,890
put together what their product should actually end up being.
90

91
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,450
Now, Basecamp, on the other hand, is an online project management tool, something that's often compared
91

92
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,420
to Asana, or Trello, or any other popular project management tools.
92

93
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,900
They didn't necessarily start with a landing page.
93

94
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:11,130
They actually came out of a web development studio
called 37 Signals, and it was a side project, but they
94

95
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:18,720
are very well known for using landing pages
to pre-validate any feature or new side project.
95

96
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,730
Anytime they have a new side project, they make landing pages that say "This is what it does, this is why it's awesome.
96

97
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,880
Anytime they have a new side project, they make landing pages that say "This is what it does, this is why it's awesome.
97

98
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,720
Here's some more information, some photos,
and you should buy it or sign up for it."
