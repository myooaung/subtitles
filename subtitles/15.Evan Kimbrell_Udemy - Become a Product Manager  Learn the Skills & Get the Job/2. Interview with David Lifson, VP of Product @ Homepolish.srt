00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,340
Hey, everyone.
1

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm with Dave Lifson of New York, VP of Product for  Homepolish,
2

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,900
and we're going to do a little bit of an interview here
on some product management topics.
3

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,360
And Dave has been, Dave,
4

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,670
you were at what? You were at Etsy before,
5

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,520
you were at what? You were at Etsy before,
6

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,500
like, long ago, and what, Amazon as well?
7

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,460
Yeah, so my first job out of school was at Amazon,
I was a software developer, and then realized within
8

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,910
probably 15 months that I was made to be a product manager, and so I got to switch to the recommendations
9

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,210
team at Amazon, which is, you know, because you
bought these items, we recommend these others.
10

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,550
team at Amazon, which is, you know, because you
bought these items, we recommend these others.
11

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,160
And I was at Amazon for a total of two years,
learned a ton, loved it there.
12

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,710
And I was at Amazon for a total of two years,
learned a ton, loved it there.
13

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,010
Then I had an opportunity I couldn't say no to to move to Brooklyn from Seattle and be the first Head of Product at Etsy.
14

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,050
Then I had an opportunity I couldn't say no to to move to Brooklyn from Seattle and be the first Head of Product at Etsy.
15

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,860
So that was 2008, when Etsy was 50 people
and all three founders were there.
16

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,850
And I then did my own startup for three years
with the technical founders of Etsy,
17

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,130
we sold that company,
18

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:21,570
I joined General Assembly as employee 25 and grew
that from 400 when I left, over two and a half years.
19

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,320
I joined General Assembly as employee 25 and grew
that from 400 when I left, over two and a half years.
20

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,950
I started running curriculum and then moved to
running a product design and engineering.
21

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,270
I spent a year a PopIn doing the same thing,
22

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,350
product design and engineering, and then now
I just started at Home Polish about a month ago.
23

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,530
Cool.
24

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,590
So this course has about, right now it's over 4000 students that are involved, and it's only been out for about a month,
25

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,230
So this course has about, right now it's over 4000 students that are involved, and it's only been out for about a month,
26

27
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,820
and it's focused on people that are new to product
management or people that are in the role and
27

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,610
they're trying to get better.
28

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:59,640
And one of the recurring themes, as I know you know
from teaching at General Assembly, and that's one thing,
29

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,490
it's that product management, like, learning about it is
quite popular right now, because it's becoming a more
30

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,290
popular role, people are starting to learn kind of what what product managers are doing, they want to find out more,
31

32
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,030
popular role, people are starting to learn kind of what what product managers are doing, they want to find out more,
32

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,920
but there's no good way to learn about it,
33

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,490
like, you know, in a formal way,
34

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,560
you can't get a degree,
35

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,860
you kind of, like you and I both just kind of happened
upon it, you know, I think most people end up doing that,
36

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,040
you kind of, like you and I both just kind of happened
upon it, you know, I think most people end up doing that,
37

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,800
and I think, right now, due to things like General
Assembly or like, this course, you can,
38

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,880
you can learn about it formally from an actual product manager.
39

40
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,880
So, like, the first question I wanted to ask,
40

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,320
is, it's an interesting one, no matter who I ask,
it's like, if you had to sum up the role of product
41

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,010
management in a sentence or two, what would it be?
42

43
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,220
- What does product management mean to you?
- Oh wow, yeah, that's really great.
43

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,190
So what does product management mean to me?
44

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:07,290
I think the role of the product manager is to have a deep
understanding of the customer, a deep understanding
45

46
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:16,570
of the business, and marrying those two together
to identify opportunities and problems, prioritize
46

47
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,760
those opportunities, and then devise
the right solution for the right time.
47

48
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:29,470
And so, what's so challenging, I think, about product management is that we don't fit the mold of the individual contributor.
48

49
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,020
And so, what's so challenging, I think, about product management is that we don't fit the mold of the individual contributor.
49

50
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:40,410
I think organizations historically have been structured
similar to, you know, how they were in the industrial
50

51
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:47,700
revolution, with manufacturing, where you just, you have
departments that have workers, and workers create
51

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,870
output, and coders write code, and marketers, you know,
create marketing, and designers create designs, and
52

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,410
product managers don't create anything. 
53

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,400
[...] don't do anything in circles [...] for everyone else
that we work with in the organization
54

55
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,970
so that the quality that is produced is higher, and the solution is
sort of, you know, more efficient and more effective.
55

56
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,460
so that the quality that is produced is higher, and the solution is
sort of, you know, more efficient and more effective.
56

57
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,160
Okay.
57

58
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,950
And so, what did you think about the role
before you were actually a product manager?
58

59
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,720
Did you have any preconceived notions or
did you know anything about it?
59

60
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,050
Well, my first team at Amazon, I was in the
community group, which did user generated content.
60

61
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,320
And so, my little corner of it was this thing called List Mania,
where Amazon customers could create lists
61

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,140
of their favorite products,
62

63
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,240
you know, like your top 10 things to take with you
on a camping trip, or my favorite scary movies.
63

64
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,890
And we had no product manager,
64

65
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,430
it was just a bunch of engineers, and we just built
whatever the heck we wanted to build.
65

66
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,770
And so I ended up, Jeff Bezos had this idea,
66

67
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,420
And so I ended up, Jeff Bezos had this idea,
67

68
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:08,000
this was back in 2006, where, you know, Facebook was becoming a thing, people were talking a lot about networks.
68

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,130
this was back in 2006, where, you know, Facebook was becoming a thing, people were talking a lot about networks.
69

70
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,310
And so it was like, you know, what if we created a network
of product skews? You know, if products could
70

71
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,630
have relationships to each other, what would that look like?
And somehow that ended up like, on my desk,
71

72
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,890
as a 23-year old, and so we decided to
build this "hot or not" for products.
72

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,730
as a 23-year old, and so we decided to
build this "hot or not" for products.
73

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,810
So essentially customers could vote on which of these
two shoes is more stylish, or which of these two
74

75
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,420
electrons are 
75

76
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:49,670
easier to use, and as you voted,
76

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,850
we would use your votes to generate you a recommendation.
77

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:05,830
It was very expensive, we built the whole thing, we launched it, and it was a total disaster, the conversion rate was somewhere around
78

79
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,200
like half a percent.
79

80
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,690
And, you know, it was like such a clear example of
how product management could have saved the day,
80

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,080
and we just didn't know it.
81

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,380
- Yeah, working on the right thing rather than just something.
- Yeah,
82

83
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,000
or testing any assumptions, or doing any sort of
user research, or prototyping, you know.
83

84
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:35,440
And so, when I moved into the recommendations team,
which did have, you know, a track record of having strong
84

85
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,810
product managers, I was surrounded by people who could really show me the ropes, which is sort of how I learned.
85

86
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,040
product managers, I was surrounded by people who could really show me the ropes, which is sort of how I learned.
86

87
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:50,540
So, something that we talked, because you mentioned this, like talking to users, or validating something, validating
87

88
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,590
your assumptions,
88

89
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:01,870
another thing that happens quite often to us as product managers is we talk to users, or we get feedback, and they send some sort of request,
89

90
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:10,420
or maybe for an internal product manager, you get basically what amounts to like, a feature request or a product spec request,
90

91
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,710
or maybe for an internal product manager, you get basically what amounts to like, a feature request or a product spec request,
91

92
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:18,660
and oftentimes that thing that's being requested
is not what is actually the solution.
92

93
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,680
It happens to everyone, you know,
93

94
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:28,010
If you move two levels deeper, there's actually another
problem here that maybe that solution doesn't solve, and
94

95
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,020
so when you're receiving feedback from users,
95

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:38,710
you've got to, you know, dig in deeper. Do you have any, like,
war stories of like, these requests that are just absolutely,
96

97
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,950
they're just not the, you know, solution at first, that you
can share, and maybe what the real solution was?
97

98
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,710
Well, I don't know if I can tell you the real solution, because
98

99
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,750
I don't know, but I'll tell you a story of this exact thing,
99

100
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
except it wasn't a user, it was a founder.
100

101
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,280
except it wasn't a user, it was a founder.
101

102
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,620
except it wasn't a user, it was a founder.
102

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,250
So this was the end of 2012,
103

104
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,090
and the founders of... 
- Hey, sorry about that.
104

105
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,810
So we had slight technical difficulties.
105

106
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,440
That's okay. Do want to ask question again?
106

107
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,700
That's okay. Do want to ask question again?
107

108
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,410
No, no, we can just totally edit it in.
108

109
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,010
So you said it was the end of 2012 and that's all we got.
109

110
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,990
Yeah, so it was the end of 2012 and the founders were
really worried that the business model was looking
110

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,330
a lot like University of Phoenix, in the sense
that our revenue came from
111

112
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,470
adults coming to a classroom and learning,
112

113
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,680
snd so, revenue was really constrained by, one,
113

114
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,910
our ability to purchase or rent real estate,
114

115
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,790
and then, secondly, our sales ability to fill that real estate.
115

116
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:54,020
And so, they came to me and they said "We really need something
that is a subscription and can target customers
116

117
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,370
who don't live where we have classrooms,
and you have three months. Go build it."
117

118
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,100
who don't live where we have classrooms,
and you have three months. Go build it."
118

119
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,520
And so, this is like, this was a big mistake for me because,
as a product manager, I should have recognized
119

120
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,860
immediately that there was no mention of the
customer here, or any sort of customer problem.
120

121
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:21,560
This was something that came out of a spreadsheet
and an analysis of sort of like market evaluations, and
121

122
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,170
"it would be really nice if, you know, this cell in our
Excel spreadsheet was twice as big."
122

123
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,450
And, in some cases, it is up to the
product manager to translate that into,
123

124
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,540
okay, well, then I'm going to go do some user research
and sort of discover what a customer problem is,
124

125
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,410
and then work towards product market fit.
125

126
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,370
But given the three months timeline on top of that,
we felt really pressured to just sort of look around
126

127
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,460
to see what assets we had available and what we could
package together, and so we did happen to have
127

128
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,820
a library of live streams that we had recorded
and stored away, and so we said,
128

129
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,800
"Okay, how about, for $25 a month,
129

130
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,530
you can have access to our library of videos?"
And we called that front row.
130

131
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:13,450
And so we built it, we launched it, it did okay, but no
matter how much we optimized the sign up flow,
131

132
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,170
the UX, optimized the acquisition marketing
channels, the LTV just really wasn't there.
132

133
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:27,830
I still today feel like, at its core, subscription is
just a very odd business model for education.
133

134
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,480
So yeah, that was always a tricky one.
134

135
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,290
Yeah.
135

136
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,090
Yeah.
136

137
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,220
I've got tons of stories myself.
137

138
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,300
But that's the one thing all PMs have in common,
so there's always these weird user requests.
138

139
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,290
And yeah, I think, in your early years, you're
probably just going to do those things,
139

140
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:52,050
and then you realize that a big part of your job is taking all of those, figuring out what the real underlying need here is, and
140

141
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,910
in another interview we did,
141

142
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,870
we were talking about that quote that,
142

143
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,900
I think, the Henry Ford quote, which was like,
you know, people would've asked for faster
143

144
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:07,480
horses instead of the car, back in the day,
because they just can't see past,
144

145
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,720
you know, not everyone is sitting back and thinking big all the time,
145

146
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,550
and Apple sort of takes advantage of this with their products,
by not asking users what they want, but rather seeing
146

147
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:26,140
what people want through usability testing, all that,
and then kind of giving them stuff that they didn't know
147

148
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,770
they wanted or needed.
148

149
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,240
Yeah, it's really, this is really the hardest thing, I think,
for a product manager, because when you're,
149

150
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,280
when you're starting out in your career, I think it's, like,
you want to get some traction, get some projects
150

151
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,710
under your belt, just sort of like, practice the process,
151

152
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,140
and so it's much easier to take things sort of after product
market fit, you're just, you're in optimization mode, right?
152

153
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,560
and so it's much easier to take things sort of after product
market fit, you're just, you're in optimization mode, right?
153

154
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,540
How can we take our sign up flow and
increase conversion by 10%?
154

155
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:00,910
And, in that case, you do your user testing, you, like,
suss out those steps in your funnel that are
155

156
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,980
giving you the most trouble,
156

157
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,590
and then you just tweak them, and so it's very, like,
here's my problem, here's my solution, and solve it.
157

158
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,460
and then you just tweak them, and so it's very, like,
here's my problem, here's my solution, and solve it.
158

159
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:17,590
But when it comes to like, inventing the iPhone, or,
you know, it's such a big open ended problem
159

160
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,410
that it requires I think a very different approach
where you really want to take more of that IDO
160

161
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,610
style, user centered design approach of
"Let's just like, in a very open mind,
161

162
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:34,150
just talk to people, and learn their context and their
situation, and then take these leaps of faith and
162

163
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,170
do a whole bunch of prototyping around it. Yeah, it's very difficult.
163

164
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:39,930
Okay.
164

165
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:50,530
So, just a couple more questions. One, because not only you're a teacher, you've taught product management in the past, but you also are
165

166
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,090
a hiring manager, now a VP, and before that,
166

167
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:04,440
Head of Product, if you were to look from the inside out
and say, if you were doing it all over again, and you didn't
167

168
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,650
kind of fall into the role, like you or I did, but
you were actively trying to get into the role,
168

169
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,700
let's say in a modern, like, you know, current day, how
would you recommend that someone with very little or
169

170
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,070
no experience who tries to work their way
towards getting a product role, like,
170

171
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,120
what skills maybe should they learn, or how
should they look at approaching it?
171

172
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,090
Yes.
172

173
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:35,440
So I think the way to do this is to really show
that you understand the product management
173

174
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,960
process and that you're able to apply that
process to a lot of different situations.
174

175
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,470
So, the process, in my mind is, you know, identifying
what you think the problem is, what you think the
175

176
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,960
customer is, what you think the solution is, going through
this iterative approach to getting to product market fit,
176

177
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,110
customer is, what you think the solution is, going through
this iterative approach to getting to product market fit,
177

178
00:13:53,430 --> 00:14:00,710
being able to draw upon a lot of different tools
in order to validate those assumptions,
178

179
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:00,900
being able to draw upon a lot of different tools
in order to validate those assumptions,
179

180
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,110
all of those different MVPs that you want to use.
180

181
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:10,300
And I think that there's a lot of different ways in which
you can sort of demonstrate your understanding of that.
181

182
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,150
And I think that there's a lot of different ways in which
you can sort of demonstrate your understanding of that.
182

183
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,080
You can go to a Hackathon and work with people and just
sort of, you know, in the span of two days, apply the
183

184
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,860
process, or perhaps you work in marketing, or you
work as an analyst, like, you can still get involved in
184

185
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,450
the development process, at least perhaps in the
user research part, or the opportunity analysis part.
185

186
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,600
the development process, at least perhaps in the
user research part, or the opportunity analysis part.
186

187
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:36,020
And so, you know, and that way you can then actually
structure your resume so that it highlights all of
187

188
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,180
those different steps of the process.
188

189
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,550
So as a hiring manager, I'm going to be like, "Okay, they
don't have the product manager title, but they completely
189

190
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,080
get sort of like what the five steps are, and they've
shown that they've done those steps in the past.
190

191
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,860
get sort of like what the five steps are, and they've
shown that they've done those steps in the past.
191

192
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,040
Yeah, okay, that's really good.
192

193
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:54,270
So this is some of the advice that I give
in terms of prepping for the role.
193

194
00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:00,180
First of all, look internally, it's one of the easiest ways,
obviously, but if you're not able to do that, you're trying
194

195
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,910
to apply somewhere, then you should look at things you've done in the past that have to do with product management, and since
195

196
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,420
it's such a vague and wide ranging role, everyone has done something that a product manager will do at some point,
196

197
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:19,720
you know, like cross-team collaboration, or project management,
or coming up with a few different ideas, and
197

198
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,290
finding the best one with data.
198

199
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:30,730
Even people in, you know, community operations, and customer service marketing, people do some things in these roles that are
199

200
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:39,180
kind of product management style things, and then sort
of shape your resume to explain those things, that's
200

201
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,970
kind of what I'm hearing from you.
201

202
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,840
Yeah, I mean, let's say you're an account manager,
you know, you talk to customers all day.
202

203
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,010
Yeah, I mean, let's say you're an account manager,
you know, you talk to customers all day.
203

204
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:59,330
So, put together what you think the product roadmap
should look like, and then support your proposal, like
204

205
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,270
what is the data behind your prioritization, what
is the user research behind your prioritization,
205

206
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,310
you know, what are the risks and assumptions that
you would want to validate for each of the ideas in
206

207
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:15,370
your roadmap so that, you know, you would feel confident
that executing those roadmap ideas would in fact
207

208
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,850
achieve the desired goals.
208

209
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,550
Yeah, absolutely.
209

210
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,840
Okay.
210

211
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,890
Okay.
211

212
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,520
For the last question,
212

213
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:31,900
if someone is, let's say, very familiar with the stuff, and they're looking at just, they're just looking at learning real hard skills,
213

214
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,170
if someone is, let's say, very familiar with the stuff, and they're looking at just, they're just looking at learning real hard skills,
214

215
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,400
if someone is, let's say, very familiar with the stuff, and they're looking at just, they're just looking at learning real hard skills,
215

216
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:42,540
so either technology, or UX, or something like that,
let's say they're going to take a PM course somewhere
216

217
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,290
and then they're also going go learn a skill.
217

218
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,870
What skills would you recommend that people be like,
either really familiar with, like a technology,
218

219
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:56,520
or something that really stands out to you
as being a big benefit on someone's resume?
219

220
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,710
Well, certainly they're going to need to understand
just basic Agile project management principles, and
220

221
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:10,000
so, being able to break things down to user stories,
and sprint planning, and sprint retros, and, you know,
221

222
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,440
just the mechanics of that.
222

223
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,650
I think wireframing is something that they should be able to do.
223

224
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:21,610
They don't need to learn a tool like Sketch or OmniGraffle,
I think it's fine if you just grab a marker
224

225
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,710
and paper and just can draw.
225

226
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,170
But you need to be able to communicate what you see
in your head to other people through pictures. And
226

227
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,690
then on the technology side,
227

228
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,390
I think people have the most anxiety about the technology
piece, and what I would tell you is spend some
228

229
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,970
time understanding how the internet works.
229

230
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,220
So if you type a URL into your browser and click Go,
what happens? And you should be able to go
230

231
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:52,930
really, really, really deep on what happens, you know,
10-15 different steps between when you hit Go and when
231

232
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,950
the page shows up on your site or on your browser.
And you can,
232

233
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,690
and I would not feel like you need to learn a
programming language, you don't,
233

234
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,670
I don't think you need to learn HTML and CSS, I don't
think you need to learn Ruby on Rails, as much as it
234

235
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,550
is more important to just learn internet architecture and
235

236
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,330
just how do web servers work.
236

237
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,500
Yeah, and things like, in the course I talk a lot about, you just need to understand what front-end is versus back-end, and
237

238
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:28,360
where things are being calculated, like, where the logic is living, on the server, on the front-end, or how do things get to your browser
238

239
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,480
or your device.
239

240
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:38,980
Yeah, and I think, like, if you want extra credit, you could
probably spend some time learning SQL, because a lot
240

241
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,910
of times product managers need data.
241

242
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,980
And so, sometimes they have to go get it themselves,
because there's no data department to do it for them.
242

243
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,100
And so, sometimes they have to go get it themselves,
because there's no data department to do it for them.
243

244
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,080
Right.
244

245
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,590
Awesome.
245

246
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,630
Okay, so I think we're just about out of time, because we're in different time zones, and you've got to get to work.
246

247
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,000
But thanks.
247

248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,900
Thanks a ton for this.
248

249
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:03,430
And yeah, do you have, I don't know, web sites, or Twitter handles, or anything, blogs that you want to pitch, as the last thing,
249

250
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,460
for the students that want to follow you in there?
250

251
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,710
for the students that want to follow you in there?
251

252
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,170
Follow me?
252

253
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,560
Oh, no.
253

254
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,790
I'm not much of a social media person.
254

255
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,620
I mean, no, sorry, I don't.
255

256
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,480
I mean, no, sorry, I don't.
256

257
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,580
I mean, like,
257

258
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,800
I mean, like,
258

259
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:25,270
you know, you can find me on Tumblr at caterpillarcowboy.com,
but it's just my personal blog, like
259

260
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,750
there's nothing on there that you're going to learn much from.
260

261
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,970
Yeah, that's good, that's what 
261

262
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,790
I like hearing, to be honest, because it means you're
not on Medium, posting those, you know, life help, life
262

263
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,340
advice articles that a lot of people do.
263

264
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,150
Yeah, you know, and like, I don't know,
264

265
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:47,740
Twitter just stopped being exciting for me like five
years ago and so, but here I am, I'm happy to teach,
265

266

266

267
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,160
you know, and give back.
267

268
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,740
Cool.
268

269
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:50,970
All right.
269

270
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,340
Well, thanks.
270

271
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,790
Thanks a bunch.
271

272
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,870
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah, you bet.
272

273
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,790
All right, catch you later.
