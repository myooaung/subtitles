00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,960
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,440
So let's make a real feature table.
2

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,850
Let's do it for my favorite company, GoPro.
3

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,520
Why they're my favorite? Because they're very easy to beat up on.
4

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,000
The true story, they're the most shorted company in the world.
5

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,020
If you don't know what that means, just Google "GoPro shorted company". Ok, let's see how this works in action.
6

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,970
If you don't know what that means, just Google "GoPro shorted company". Ok, let's see how this works in action.
7

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,930
Now, on the right we're going to put our actual product
8

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,290
as usual, we're going to put GoPro, and then
we're going to fill out the other competitors.
9

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,160
So, let me introduce the competitors. Now,
10

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,900
remember when we did this as an example and we wrote down some of the direct, and indirect, and substitute competitors?
11

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,380
remember when we did this as an example and we wrote down some of the direct, and indirect, and substitute competitors?
12

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,520
Well, we're just going to make a feature table for the direct competitors, and I've just picked a handful
13

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,160
that I think would be worth comparing.
14

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,670
So, let me introduce the competitors. Ok.
15

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:48,990
So, let me introduce the competitors. Ok.
16

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,040
Number one is Tom Tom Bandit.
17

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,130
This is the one that, yes, is made by that GPS company that was made obsolete the day Google Maps came out.
18

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,480
This is the one that, yes, is made by that GPS company that was made obsolete the day Google Maps came out.
19

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,560
It also looks to me like a plastic hot dog.
20

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,280
But we're going to put it up there
because it actually sells pretty well.
21

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,380
Now, the next one is Veho. Now, that's the one
that looks exactly like GoPro.
22

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,740
They copied every single detail down to, like, the tiny little corners, and even the colors. I'm amazed they didn't get sued.
23

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,490
They copied every single detail down to, like, the tiny little corners, and even the colors. I'm amazed they didn't get sued.
24

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,000
And the last one is going to be the Sony Franklin Delanor Roosevelt. They all have very strange names.
25

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,890
And the last one is going to be the Sony Franklin Delanor Roosevelt. They all have very strange names.
26

27
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,030
Ok, so stiff competition.
27

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:37,170
Now, we need to think about what are the most important factors for the people that need an extreme use action camera.
28

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,550
Now, we need to think about what are the most important factors for the people that need an extreme use action camera.
29

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,280
Now, if I were GoPro, I'd probably dip into
some of our data on customers,
30

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,690
I would research a very specific customer profile
31

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,340
I was going for, but for our purposes we'll give it our best guess.
32

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,760
I'm going to guess one of the aspects is going to be price.
33

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,200
Why?
34

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,030
Because I'm assuming a lot of our customers are broke surfers who don't want to spend too much if they don't have to.
35

36
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,080
Because I'm assuming a lot of our customers are broke surfers who don't want to spend too much if they don't have to.
36

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,150
Another one I think might be important is aesthetics.
37

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,780
Why?
38

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,410
Well, because with an action camera,
you're someone who does extreme things.
39

40
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,990
Perhaps you're a vain person - I'm making
judgments, maybe not true.
40

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,420
I think it's probably important that there's a cool factor to it.
41

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,800
You really don't want it looking like the Microsoft Zune.
42

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,130
The next one I'm going to put is weight. Kind of spitballing on this one, but I'm gonna guess since the idea is that
43

44
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,020
they're small and portable, you might wear it
on your head, or your chest, or something like that, that
44

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,180
you don't want it to infringe on your ability to
do whatever it is that you're trying to do.
45

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,560
So I'm going to guess you don't want something that has the weight of a bowling ball. I'm going to put 4K as well,
46

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,140
So I'm going to guess you don't want something that has the weight of a bowling ball. I'm going to put 4K as well,
47

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,420
that is the new kind of cutting edge way of filming.
48

49
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,460
We are not shooting in 4K right now. If we were shooting in 4K, you would be able to zoom in and get into my pores.
49

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
We are not shooting in 4K right now. If we were shooting in 4K, you would be able to zoom in and get into my pores.
50

51
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,740
But for people that are doing this I would imagine they want that. Why?
51

52
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,770
Because higher resolution makes your pictures
look better in general,
52

53
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,470
so I would imagine if you're going to do something extreme or cool, you want it to look as cool as possible.
53

54
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,660
so I would imagine if you're going to do something extreme or cool, you want it to look as cool as possible.
54

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,150
The next one I'm going to put is Max FPS,
55

56
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,710
which means frames per second in camera speak.
What I'm getting at is, can it shoot in slow motion, right?
56

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,050
which means frames per second in camera speak.
What I'm getting at is, can it shoot in slow motion, right?
57

58
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,510
So right now we are shooting in 24 frames per second.
58

59
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,330
If I shot this in 60 frames per second
I would be moving really slowly in it.
59

60
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,320
It might look like some of those sequences
you see on commercials.
60

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,840
So I want to see how slow these can go. I think that's going to be interesting, because, again, people use these for action shots.
61

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,010
So I want to see how slow these can go. I think that's going to be interesting, because, again, people use these for action shots.
62

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,800
They want to slow down and watch the coolest parts.
63

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,790
The last thing I'm going to put is accessories.
Now, accessories I think are important, right?
64

65
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,010
The last thing I'm going to put is accessories.
Now, accessories I think are important, right?
65

66
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,100
Because a small action camera, it's small, it's kind of awkward,
66

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,170
you need to have an easy way of putting it on your wrist, on your head, on your chest, and using a lot 
67

68
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,070
of tools to get what you need done.
68

69
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,060
You're not going to go grab a fork and duct tape it to it.
That's just not going to cut it.
69

70
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,320
You're not going to go grab a fork and duct tape it to it.
That's just not going to cut it.
70

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,700
Now, there are obviously some things I ignored, and these are just decisions I made. I ignored things like
71

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:10,380
battery life, I ignored things like the ability to edit on the actual camera, which is apparently a feature amongst the action cameras.
72

73
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,010
battery life, I ignored things like the ability to edit on the actual camera, which is apparently a feature amongst the action cameras.
73

74
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,710
I also decided on camera controls probably weren't that important.
74

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,410
I don't really know how important it is to be able to scrub through your filming on the little box.
75

76
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,270
It just seems like all you need to do is press record and go.
Now, I'm making these judgments because
76

77
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,180
GoPro users probably want the cutting edge.
77

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,190
They want to film really cool stuff in short periods of time.
78

79
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,930
That's why I don't think battery life is going to be tops
for them - I could totally be wrong - and I don't
79

80
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,240
think editing on the thing is going to make sense because people who use GoPros probably want to make a
80

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,070
montage or a video that looks as good as possible.
That's not something you're going to get editing on a tiny little box.
81

82
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,260
montage or a video that looks as good as possible.
That's not something you're going to get editing on a tiny little box.
82

83
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,810
Ok, I was lucky to get all this information
just from individual web sites
83

84
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,220
and a top 10 competitors comparison web site relatively easy. For you guys, it's going to be easy as well.
84

85
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,400
and a top 10 competitors comparison web site relatively easy. For you guys, it's going to be easy as well.
85

86
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,940
Just go to the actual competitors' web site,
they'll tell you everything you need to know.
86

87
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,850
Ok, in reality what I would probably do is go out, read consumer reviews, talk to customers, see what they
87

88
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,530
experienced, and most importantly,
I would play with the actual product.
88

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,320
There's no substitute for you actually using their product
and making a judgment.
89

90
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,640
All right. Let's fill it out for the GoPro. The GoPro costs close to $500, $499. Aesthetics - they're all kind of ugly.
90

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,500
All right. Let's fill it out for the GoPro. The GoPro costs close to $500, $499. Aesthetics - they're all kind of ugly.
91

92
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,830
All right. Let's fill it out for the GoPro. The GoPro costs close to $500, $499. Aesthetics - they're all kind of ugly.
92

93
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,650
I think it needs some improvement, but for the most part I think it's probably like a 7 out of 10. It's better than a lot of them.
93

94
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,180
I think it needs some improvement, but for the most part I think it's probably like a 7 out of 10. It's better than a lot of them.
94

95
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,850
Weight, 89 grams - that means nothing to me right now.
95

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,750
Weight, 89 grams - that means nothing to me right now.
96

97
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,670
Does it shoot in 4K?
97

98
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,960
Yes, it actually does shoot in 4K, and I'm going to put a secondary piece of information which is that
98

99
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,050
it can shoot up to 30 frames per second
when it's in that high resolution format.
99

100
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,860
Max FPS, I just put yes because it can go above the normal FPS,
100

101
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,150
and it can go up to 120 if you're shooting in 1080p. For those of you who don't know what that means, just don't worry about it.
101

102
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,320
and it can go up to 120 if you're shooting in 1080p. For those of you who don't know what that means, just don't worry about it.
102

103
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,630
Accessories, I've put 100+ because when you search on Amazon, there are an enormous amount of accessories for GoPros.
103

104
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,220
Accessories, I've put 100+ because when you search on Amazon, there are an enormous amount of accessories for GoPros.
104

105
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,600
Ok, cool. So now let's just start filling them out.
105

106
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,840
Ok, cool. So now let's just start filling them out.
106

107
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,770
Tom Tom Bandit - this is what I gathered from their website.
107

108
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,680
Tom Tom Bandit - this is what I gathered from their website.
108

109
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,990
They cost $349. Pretty expensive
109

110
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,080
They cost $349. Pretty expensive
110

111
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,010
but cheaper than the GoPro. Aesthetics, I would give them
a 4 out of 10. Again, I said they look like a plastic
111

112
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,780
hot dog, or a submarine with a big eyeball on the front.
112

113
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,440
I honestly don't know what they're going for.
113

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,320
Do you just run around with it like this and
you just point it at people like a laser pointer?
114

115
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,990
Weight, 190 grams.
115

116
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm not sure what that means, but in relative comparison to the GoPro that's a big honkin item. 4K, yes it does do it.
116

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,130
I'm not sure what that means, but in relative comparison to the GoPro that's a big honkin item. 4K, yes it does do it.
117

118
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,300
I'm not sure what that means, but in relative comparison to the GoPro that's a big honkin item. 4K, yes it does do it.
118

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,130
But it only shoots in 12 frames per second. That's questionable.
119

120
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,400
But it only shoots in 12 frames per second. That's questionable.
120

121
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,870
The Max FPS is 60 frames per second, versus our 120.
121

122
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,100
And does it have accessories?
Yes, but not very many, only about 10 I could find.
122

123
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,380

124

125
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,140
Moving on to the Veho. The Veho is cheap, it's $200.

126

127
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,680
The aesthetics are very similar to the GoPro, it's just a little bit worse, so I'd give it a 6 out of 10.
127

128
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,920

129

130
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,850
The weight is 84 grams. Can it shoot in 4K?
130

131
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:15,240
No, it cannot. The Max FPS is, again, like our favorite plastic hot dog, it's about 60 frames per second.
131

132
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,530
Does it have accessories? More than the hot dog,
but still not a ton. I think I found around 15-ish.

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,170

133

134
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,480
And the last one, the Sony Franklin Delanor Roosevelt,
that one is probably the closest competitor.
134

135
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,630

135

136
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,150
This one is $399. Aesthetics - I give it a 6 out of ten. It doesn't look as good as the GoPro but it's not that bad.
136

138

139

Weight, it's 114 grams.
139

140

Weight, it's 114 grams.
140

141
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,330
It can shoot in 4K and it can shoot up to 30 frames per second compared to the GoPro, they do the exact same thing.

142

143
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,150
The Max FPS is 120, and the number of accessories I could find was over the 25 range.

144

145
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:49,960
Ok. There you have it.
145

146
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,640
Ok. There you have it.
146

147
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,160
Now, what we could do is internalize this and understand,
are we beating our direct competitors?
147

148
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,060
Are we the obvious choice or
are we only appealing to one segment?
148

149
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,580
Are there areas we should focus our energy on improving?
149

150
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,220
Are there areas that we should just entirely ignore?
150

151
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,480
I would love to hear your guys thoughts on this.
151

152
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,910
Answer that question: what do you think?
152

153
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,760
What should GoPro do based off of what we just filled out?
Post it in the group discussion,
153

154
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,450
we'll talk about it.
In the next lecture,
154

155
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,410
we're going to do this again but we're going to do it
in a more granular way.
155

156
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,110
We're going to make a feature table for one specific proposed feature and we're going to use a platform
156

157
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,730
that everyone is familiar with: Udemy.
157

158
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,720
All right, see in the next lecture.
