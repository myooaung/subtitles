Hey guys, welcome back to the course.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.250
Let's talk a little bit more in depth about
that other MVP that I called the shadow button.
2

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.520
All right.
3

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.300
Now, shadow buttons are fake buttons put on an app
that just track when they're clicked and that's literally
4

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.050
it. If you're scratching your head wondering
where you've seen this before,
5

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.710
you might not remember. They're pretty subtle.
6

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.320
you might not remember. They're pretty subtle.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
Here's one I actually found the other day.
If you guys ever go to uncommongoods.com,
8

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.030
try to log in in the sales page with Facebook.
9

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.810
What you'll see is an image pop up or text pop up
and say "Thank you for voting to add Facebook login."
10

11
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.830
What you'll see is an image pop up or text pop up
and say "Thank you for voting to add Facebook login."
11

12
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.690
Great example of a shadow button.
12

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.370
Shadow buttons are good because they give you great data.
13

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.530
That's pretty much as close as you're going to get to showing that someone is in fact interested in your new feature.
14

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.520
That's pretty much as close as you're going to get to showing that someone is in fact interested in your new feature.
15

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.020
It's also pretty easy to do.
16

17
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.050
Your developer can probably do it over lunch.
17

18
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.490
The downside though is obvious.
18

19
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.290
It doesn't look good.
19

20
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.630
No one who has ever interacted with a shadow button
said "Wow, that was awesome."
20

21
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.250
No one who has ever interacted with a shadow button
said "Wow, that was awesome."
21

22
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520
They probably think "What was that? Is this broken?"
22

23
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810
They probably think "What was that? Is this broken?"
23

24
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.260
Because that's what it looks like.
24

25
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.060
It looks like your site is broken.
25

26
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.630
Now, that's okay if you're maintaining a product that has
a reputation for having bugs and has a user population
26

27
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480
that's just gotten used to it.
27

28
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.770
I'm not saying be complacent about it.
28

29
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.970
You should fix your bugs.
29

30
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.710
But let's just say, if Udemy, for example, had a new
feature, when I clicked on it it just did nothing, well,
30

31
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.200
But let's just say, if Udemy, for example, had a new
feature, when I clicked on it it just did nothing, well,
31

32
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.000
I wouldn't even notice, because, let's be honest, I probably
ran into 15 different bugs and broken things
32

33
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.130
before I even got to the shadow button.
Shadow buttons are sneaky.
33

34
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.140
Great data, but they create a universally
negative response from your users.
34

35
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.420
Great data, but they create a universally
negative response from your users.
35

36
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.890
It's just a question of whether or not the user
cares about the polish of your product.
36

37
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.710
If you do decide to go this route,
let's cover some best practices.
37

38
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.670
Number one, do it just like Uncommon Goods did it,
like you saw. Put a message just says "Thank you for
38

39
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.550
clicking" and acknowledge what it is. That softens the
blow because intentional bug is way better than
39

40
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.790
a bug that they aren't aware of and simply can't fix.
40

41
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.180
Number two is limit the amount of users
that see this as much as possible.
41

42
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.470
You can calculate what number of people
need to see it to be statistically significant.
42

43
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.590
Be as close to that line as possible.
43

44
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.160
In summary, it's easy to do, it's very valid data,
generally not a good thing for your brand,
44

45
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.440
In summary, it's easy to do, it's very valid data,
generally not a good thing for your brand,
45

46
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.510
so have a hard think about whether or not you think your users
are tolerant enough to be okay with this type of testing.
46

47
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.380
so have a hard think about whether or not you think your users
are tolerant enough to be okay with this type of testing.
