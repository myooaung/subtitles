Hello, my friends.
1

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,890
So, welcome back, and we're going to talk here about APIs.
2

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,380
So, welcome back, and we're going to talk here about APIs.
3

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,550
Look, in your work as a product manager, and in many
other roles in the technology industry, you're going
4

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,120
to hear this term API a lot.
5

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,920
Usually, you're going to hear some engineers talking
about it, and sometimes they'll be like, "Oh well, we
6

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,010
can't do that because the API doesn't allow us."
7

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,920
So let's demystify that.
8

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,590
What is an API?
API stands for application programming interface.
9

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,070
The easiest way to explain it is that it's the messenger that
takes requests and tells the system what you want to do.
10

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,410
The easiest way to explain it is that it's the messenger that
takes requests and tells the system what you want to do.
11

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,960
Then it returns what you requested, the information, back to you.
12

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,720
Let's make it even more simple.
13

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,350
Imagine you're at a restaurant and you're looking at the menu,
and the kitchen has some delicious food,
14

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,560
probably some barbecue, if it were me, and I'm like, "I want
that barbecue" but I need a way to get that food from
15

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,750
the kitchen, because they've got to make it for me,
16

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,680
and then they've got to send me the food.
17

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,460
So I've got to request it, I've got to make it, I've got to send it, and what I need in this case, like, the missing link here is a waiter.
18

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,870
So I've got to request it, I've got to make it, I've got to send it, and what I need in this case, like, the missing link here is a waiter.
19

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,880
The waiter comes to me and says "Hello, how
many pounds of barbecue would you like, Cole?"
20

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,200
The waiter comes to me and says "Hello, how
many pounds of barbecue would you like, Cole?"
21

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,190
And I'm like "10 or 15 pounds."
22

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,670
And then he goes back to the kitchen, he gets me
15 pounds of barbecue, brings it back to my fat self.
23

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,040
And then he goes back to the kitchen, he gets me
15 pounds of barbecue, brings it back to my fat self.
24

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,740
So he's done all this translating to kitchen language
and bringing me the food.
25

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:42,510
And that waiter is like an API. Also, in this case, the kitchen
was a database - a database full of delicious barbecue
26

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,320
And that waiter is like an API. Also, in this case, the kitchen
was a database - a database full of delicious barbecue
27

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,000
in our example. Okay, so there's two types of APIs.
28

29
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,430
in our example. Okay, so there's two types of APIs.
29

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,250
I know, it seems like it's getting more complex,
but I promise, it's not that hard.
30

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,830
There's a public API and a private API. Public APIs are
provided by companies to allow products or services
31

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,530
to get data from their system.
32

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,640
A great example of this would be on a travel search
website like Kayak.com, where you can search for
33

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,110
a flight across different airlines for the cheapest price.
34

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,240
Kayak takes what you type in about what dates you want
to travel, and then using the public API of every
35

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,900
single airline, or at least most of them, it returns to
you the prices and availability for all the trips.
36

37
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,970
This is because Kayak does not have the information on
all airlines, at all times, and all flights, but they contact the
37

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,390
This is because Kayak does not have the information on
all airlines, at all times, and all flights, but they contact the
38

39
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,970
airlines' databases through the API.
39

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,700
They did this because the APIs for the airlines are
public, which means that they let anyone, like a
40

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,360
developer, like Kayak, and the engineers there, just dial in
and get that data, and provide some services based on it.
41

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,320
developer, like Kayak, and the engineers there, just dial in
and get that data, and provide some services based on it.
42

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,160
Why?
43

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,060
Because now they're making more money,
44

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,250
because if Kayak does a good job marketing, people are
going to come there, and they're going to search
45

46
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,780
for flights, and they're going to buy more stuff from the airlines.
46

47
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,970
So a lot of tech companies out there have public APIs to encourage developers to build products using their information. Here,
47

48
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,430
So a lot of tech companies out there have public APIs to encourage developers to build products using their information. Here,
48

49
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,430
you can see a documentation page for Twitter's public API.
49

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,890
All right. So what's a private API?
50

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,510
All right. So what's a private API?
51

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,080
Now, these are APIs that are available only to the developers inside of a company to get information from different internal systems.
52

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,050
Now, these are APIs that are available only to the developers inside of a company to get information from different internal systems.
53

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,360
It's example time again. At Facebook,
54

55
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:34,410
there's probably a database that holds the pictures,
and another database that holds the messages, and
55

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,130
there's probably a lot of databases for
a lot of different things at Facebook.
56

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,160
So if a developer on one team, let's say this developer
doesn't work on the photos team, or the pictures
57

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,460
team, but they want to code a new feature and they need access
to the pictures database somewhere inside of Facebook servers.
58

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,970
team, but they want to code a new feature and they need access
to the pictures database somewhere inside of Facebook servers.
59

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:04:00,090
Then they will write what is called an API call in their code, and they will write this API call to what is called an API endpoint.
60

61
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,250
Then they will write what is called an API call in their code, and they will write this API call to what is called an API endpoint.
61

62
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,420
The database then sends back the pictures that they requested.
62

63
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,260
By the way, this API endpoint is just a fancy way of
saying "access window" or something like that.
63

64
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:21,630
It's an address that allows developers to get a certain type
of data, and sometimes the endpoints have limitations
64

65
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,850
to prevent problems, like, maybe they will say, "Okay, you
can only send a hundred requests per minute, because
65

66
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,950
if you go above that, it's going to overload our
systems, and things will crash, and things blow up.
66

67
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,580
Anyways, don't worry about that.
67

68
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,360
I just wanted to let you know that that exists. Alright, I told you
that was not very hard, but we're going to recap anyways.
68

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,220

70
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,490
Basically, APIs are just ways that developers can write
code to other systems and get data from them.

71
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,550

71

72
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,450
There are two major types of APIs, public APIs and
private APIs. Public ones are available to anybody,
72

73
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,570
including you, if you're a programmer, and then
private APIs are available only to people inside
73

74
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,440
of that company, which means not you, unless
you work at that company. Alright everyone,
74

75
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,190
I hope you're learning some stuff here.
75

76
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,850
I'm going to see you in the next lecture.
