Hey and welcome back. In this lecture, we're going to be talking about one more metrics framework that will
1

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,400
help you out with deciding on which metrics you should
look at tracking for a new product or business.
2

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,760
help you out with deciding on which metrics you should
look at tracking for a new product or business.
3

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,160
This framework is a little bit lighter than the last one,
a little bit lighter than the heart framework
4

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,580
we just talked about.
5

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,620
It's pretty short and sweet and it's pretty popular in Silicon Valley.
6

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,360
This framework is also really commonly used
with software as a service businesses.
7

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,880
So the framework is called AARRR, as in like
"Aarrr, I'm a pirate!" Kind of weird, right?
8

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,760
But the guy that came up with it,
9

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,160
Dave McClure, he's a venture capital guy out in Silicon Valley, actually he's a partner in 500 
10

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,730
Startups, which is a venture capital firm,
11

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,720
so he knows a little bit about what he's talking about,
and he came up with this framework himself because
12

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,620
he was investing in companies, and he said like,
"These are the metrics that I like to see,
13

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,580
these are the ones that you should focus on."
14

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,360
The reason it has that weird name is because it's AARRR,
a five-step process: acquisition, activation,
15

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,080
retention, referral, and then revenue.
16

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,870
This framework is pretty popular with entrepreneurs
or people doing much smaller businesses.
17

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,990
So the general idea here is that, for each of these five stages,
you pick a metric that you want to measure.
18

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,290
So the general idea here is that, for each of these five stages,
you pick a metric that you want to measure.
19

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,190
And again, just like the heart framework, this is a way
of getting us to think about the lifecycle of
20

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,890
our user. We'll go over each one of these really quickly
because we've talked a lot about all of this so far,
21

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,730
our user. We'll go over each one of these really quickly
because we've talked a lot about all of this so far,
22

23
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,110
just want to make sure that you're aware of this one.
23

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,770
The first one - acquisition - is just like it sounds.
24

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,840
We need a metric for us acquiring a user.
25

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,490
That means the user went to our web site or
downloaded our app, one of these. They have arrived,
26

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,500
That means the user went to our web site or
downloaded our app, one of these. They have arrived,
27

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,230
they have, they know about you, and now they are indicating
their interest to begin using you by taking that step.
28

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,950
they have, they know about you, and now they are indicating
their interest to begin using you by taking that step.
29

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,960
The second one - activation - I've talked a little bit
about it already, it just means that the customer
30

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,770
that we've acquired is now activated.
31

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:13,800
So they've signed up, or they've entered their info
on our mailing list, or they have integrated the app
32

33
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,240
with another app that you're considering to be an important step.
33

34
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,540
It just means that they are now active,
and you can define that however you want.
34

35
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,910
Some people just say "Okay, if they've
made an account, they're activated."
35

36
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,800
Other people will say "Okay, they have to make an account
and then they have to do one small thing, so that
36

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,250
we know that they are now officially active, let's say,
adding a profile picture, or connecting their phone
37

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,220
book contact list to find their friends on your app,
or something like that.
38

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,060
Pretty easy.
39

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,850
The third one is retention.
40

41
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,530
It means, just like we've talked about before,
they come back, they're repeat
41

42
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,490
users. Notice how there's not so much
emphasis on engagement here?
42

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,230
This is because the framework just assumes that
you're maximizing engagement in the first place and
43

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,330
that if you're having someone being retained, well,
they're going to be engaged, otherwise they wouldn't
44

45
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,760
have come back to be retained.
45

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,780
So an example of trying to optimize your retention
rate would be to send the user a notification to
46

47
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,880
their phone if they haven't logged in in like a week or two weeks,
or send them an email drip campaign.
47

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:18,900
their phone if they haven't logged in in like a week or two weeks,
or send them an email drip campaign.
48

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,730
You know, when you sign up for those e-mails and then
they e-mail you like once a week, and then they,
49

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,070
email you like once every two weeks, and then once a month,
that is trying to get you to come back.
50

51
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,220
email you like once every two weeks, and then once a month,
that is trying to get you to come back.
51

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,810
And the fourth one is referral, which means our users are happy enough with their app that they're going to refer it to others.
52

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,310
And the fourth one is referral, which means our users are happy enough with their app that they're going to refer it to others.
53

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,970
And this doesn't just mean user happiness.
54

55
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,430
In fact, it's focused, the way this thing is built,
or the way that it's framed from Dave McClure's mind
55

56
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,520
is that you can optimize it beyond just making the users happy enough to talk to their friends in real life about it.
56

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,470
is that you can optimize it beyond just making the users happy enough to talk to their friends in real life about it.
57

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,590
In fact, you could put a feature in where they can share it with their friends, and maybe get some credit for doing that.
58

59
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,110
In fact, you could put a feature in where they can share it with their friends, and maybe get some credit for doing that.
59

60
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,070
You might have seen this with Dropbox, where,
when you sign up and you invite a friend, you get
60

61
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,800
some free storage, this sort of thing.
61

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,570
So, referral - that's easy.
62

63
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,050
They're going to share it with others.
63

64
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,830
And the last one is revenue, that means you are making
revenue from this user and that is the further step
64

65
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,820
down the funnel.
65

66
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,460
So if you're a consumer company, that means eventually
that they may be buying a subscription, or they've
66

67
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,700
bought like a pro version, or a full fledged version
of your program or your app, or if you're a company
67

68
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,480
that's free to use, then maybe they are seeing advertisements,
and you can gauge that per user you're
68

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,170
making this much money off of them.
69

70
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,100
The goal here is just to quantify the revenue
per user that you're getting.
70

71
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,010
So that's it, just those five stages, and the way this framework is meant to be used is you just use those five stages as a guide.
71

72
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,470
So that's it, just those five stages, and the way this framework is meant to be used is you just use those five stages as a guide.
72

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,630
So, for each one of the five, those five steps down the funnel,
you just think of a metric that you can
73

74
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,570
measure that will tell you how you're doing on each one
of those steps, because each one leads to the other.
74

75
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,060
measure that will tell you how you're doing on each one
of those steps, because each one leads to the other.
75

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,680
You're not going to get revenue from someone
unless they are first activated,
76

77
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,850
so you have to get a lot of people acquired, a lot of
people activated, and then go all the way down the
77

78
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,730
funnel, and you want to get that bottom bucket revenue
as big as possible, so you optimize the metrics all the way down.
78

79
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,860
funnel, and you want to get that bottom bucket revenue
as big as possible, so you optimize the metrics all the way down.
79

80
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,090
It's just an easy way of thinking about that journey for the user.
80

81
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,460
So if you want to learn more about the AARRR metrics framework or pirate metrics framework from Dave McClure, just Google it.
81

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,650
So if you want to learn more about the AARRR metrics framework or pirate metrics framework from Dave McClure, just Google it.
82

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,400
There's a slide deck and a presentation he gave
that sort of put him on the map for this.
83

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,880
He became very popular because of this.
84

85
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:44,940
It was meant originally as his suggestion to companies
that he's investing in or people that want him
85

86
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,850
to invest in them, because he feels these are the most important
to venture capitalists and those types of people.
86

87
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,480
to invest in them, because he feels these are the most important
to venture capitalists and those types of people.
87

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,860
So if you're in Silicon Valley or making a startup, and you
want to get some investment money or something,
88

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:55,960
So if you're in Silicon Valley or making a startup, and you
want to get some investment money or something,
89

90
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:02,880
this is a great place to start, because these things
do matter a lot to venture capital investors and
90

91
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,520
other investors in general. That's it for this lecture.
91

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,860
It wasn't very difficult.
92

93
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,720
AARRR, pirate metrics, Dave McClure, good stuff to
93

94
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,400
AARRR, pirate metrics, Dave McClure, good stuff to
94

95
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,960
know. I promise you, if you know these two metrics frameworks,
and you tell people about them, or you're in
95

96
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,100
a job interview and you mention them,
or anything like that, they're going to be impressed.
96

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,980
I'll see you in the next lecture.
