00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.710
Hey everyone, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.590
So if you were left a little bit confused from the last
things we talked about, with the epics, and spec
2

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.580
sheets, user stories, and acceptance criteria, I'm going to
show you a real life example here inside a tool called Jira.
3

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.270
sheets, user stories, and acceptance criteria, I'm going to
show you a real life example here inside a tool called Jira.
4

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.630
sheets, user stories, and acceptance criteria, I'm going to
show you a real life example here inside a tool called Jira.
5

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.940
And this is not the only tool you can use.
6

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.210
In fact, I don't recommend it unless you
work at a very large company,
7

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.870
but it is very common at large companies.
8

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.500
You can also use a whole bunch of other tools we'll talk about,
9

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.590
You can also use a whole bunch of other tools we'll talk about,
10

11
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.450
but I'll show you in Jira because this is kind of an industry standard.
11

12
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.360
So let's get into it.
12

13
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590
Let's go down to my screen and I'll show you the real life example.
13

14
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.050
All right.
14

15
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.390
So what we have here is a screen that is inside of a
project I've created, and I'm going to pretend that
15

16
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.760
this project inside of Jira is basically the project that
my team owns. I'm a product manager and I
16

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.210
lead a product team, and this is the project my team owns.
And so what you can see here is, this is what is
17

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.850
called - I'll expand this so you can see this better - it's called the backlog, and the backlog is merely just a place that we
18

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.160
hold things that we plan to do later,
but we're not working on quite yet.
19

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.890
If you remember, we do sprints in the Scrum model,
20

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.460
so the stuff that we're working on right now,
it goes into the sprint and we start working on it,
21

22
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.890
and then, when the sprint is over, we see what we got
done and what we didn't, and we add more stuff from
22

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.310
the backlog to the next sprint, and that's how we work.
23

24
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.590
The backlog is just a place to hold stuff that you plan to do.
So what I've got here is an empty sprint at the top,
24

25
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.850
The backlog is just a place to hold stuff that you plan to do.
So what I've got here is an empty sprint at the top,
25

26
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090
and then here I've got my backlog.
26

27
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.410
And over here on the left side you see the epics.
27

28
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.720
So, like I said, most project management software,
like Pivotal Tracker or Jira, they're going to have
28

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.640
places for epics, and in other ones you might just
have to create some sort of structure yourself.
29

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.820
But here, you can see that I have selected all issues,
and that's basically all of the things in my backlog,
30

31
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.190
all of the user stories, basically, that I want to do,
but may or may not already be inside of an epic.
31

32
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.490
all of the user stories, basically, that I want to do,
but may or may not already be inside of an epic.
32

33
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.990
And then here we have one epic, which
we've called the "Direct Message Photos"
33

34
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.770
version 1, and then I've got another one here that's a technical epic that's not user facing, and it's "Migrate User Database."
34

35
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.370
version 1, and then I've got another one here that's a technical epic that's not user facing, and it's "Migrate User Database."
35

36
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.420
We can see here, in the backlog, we've got 4 tickets here
that are have user stories inside of them, that
36

37
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.850
belong to this epic, and I can click on this
and it will only show those.
37

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.740
And then, below those, I've got the stories and
the tickets for migrating the user database.
38

39
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.100
So let's go ahead and add a couple of these things to our sprint,
or pretend like we're going to start a sprint, basically.
39

40
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.490
So let's go ahead and add a couple of these things to our sprint,
or pretend like we're going to start a sprint, basically.
40

41
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.670
So we know that we're going to work on this epic.
41

42
00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.080
We're going to try to implement direct messaging photos,
we're going to do that, and we're going to also be able,
42

43
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.940
we also want users to be able to cancel a photo
being sent and being transferred,
43

44
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.520
and then there's some other things here.
44

45
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.940
Okay.
45

46
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.110
Users can maybe upload the photos from a URL and
they can also upload from copy and pasting, but that's
46

47
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.060
going to take some more effort,
47

48
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.640
so we're actually considering moving that to maybe
another epic where it's the "Direct Message Photos"
48

49
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.860
version 2, or it's our second phase,
49

50
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.300
but for our minimum viable product, we just want to
allow people to upload photos from their computer,
50

51
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.440
but for our minimum viable product, we just want to
allow people to upload photos from their computer,
51

52
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.710
so that's what we'll start with.
52

53
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.240
I'm also going to add maybe the first phase or the first
ticket here from our migrating the user database
53

54
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.490
epic into our sprints, because maybe we have two
engineers that are working on the photo
54

55
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.690
in direct messages, and another engineer is
working on migrating this database.
55

56
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.950
So what happens is we've got our sprint loaded up here
and we click "Start Sprint" and it says, how long
56

57
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.600
is the sprint, because not all companies use two weeks
sprints, but it does pre-fill with two weeks. You
57

58
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.280
can choose from other options here too. We'll click "Start,"
58

59
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.100
and this brings us to the "Active sprints" area,
so you can see we have items here that are "to do,"
59

60
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.820
then we have "in progress," then we have "done."
And we're going to start.
60

61
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.170
Let's pretend like we're an engineer
and we're working on stuff.
61

62
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.380
What's going to happen is they're going to say "Alright, I'm working on this, now it's in progress" and eventually move it to "done."
62

63
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.690
What's going to happen is they're going to say "Alright, I'm working on this, now it's in progress" and eventually move it to "done."
63

64
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.690
But what are they actually working on?
64

65
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.880
Let's move this back here and let's click on this first item.
65

66
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.680
You can see that it's part of an epic here, which is
the "Direct Message Photos," and I will just
66

67
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:49.270
go in... Jira is a little complex, so bear with me here,
this is why not many people like it, but we'll go into the
67

68
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.710
more details for this actual ticket.
68

69
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.470
So inside of it, we can see that this is the ticket, and
the ticket is "Send photos through direct message."
69

70
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.180
Inside, we've got a user story.
70

71
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.370
Inside, we've got a user story.
71

72
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.680
So "As a user, I want to be able to send pictures in a
direct message by clicking the photo sharing button,
72

73
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.440
so that I can share my favorite photos with friends."
And then we have those acceptance criteria we talked about.
73

74
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.760
so that I can share my favorite photos with friends."
And then we have those acceptance criteria we talked about.
74

75
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.990
So "Given I'm a user and I click the 'add picture' button
in the direct message, I'm presented with a pop
75

76
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.020
up window to choose the file I can upload, I can submit it with the upload button, and then I see a preview of the uploaded image.
76

77
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.750
up window to choose the file I can upload, I can submit it with the upload button, and then I see a preview of the uploaded image.
77

78
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.260
This is also a place you can see, or we've got
a couple, we've got a wireframe in here, right?
78

79
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.780
This is also a place you can see, or we've got
a couple, we've got a wireframe in here, right?
79

80
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:40.780
So this is where we would implement or put in the
wireframes or mocks, where it shows that a designer
80

81
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.630
has said "Okay, this thing is this many pixels
wide and this many pixels tall."
81

82
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.390
So those go into the actual user stories themselves.
82

83
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.470
But I want to show you one more thing, and that is
because this is a ticket, it has a user story in it,
83

84
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.960
it's part of an epic. So what does that epic look like?
84

85
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.870
it's part of an epic. So what does that epic look like?
85

86
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.560
Well, we can click here and go to the actual epic itself.
86

87
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.920
And this is just the inside of that epic that
we saw on the backlog screen earlier.
87

88
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.970
Basically, it has those sections that I was talking about,
so we have an introduction, and it's like, okay,
88

89
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.710
this feature is going to allow users to send photos
to each other through the direct message.
89

90
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.220
It says "Our research shows that 80% of people
would use this, and we tested it with people, and
90

91
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.840
user tests, and they really liked our designs,
91

92
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:34.570
and basically we say "Okay, ideally, in the future we
want to be able to share animated GIFs as photos as
92

93
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.420
well and maybe paste photos from the clipboard,
93

94
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.860
but for this MVP, we're only going to allow uploading
from a device." That's just to kind of get the
94

95
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.560
base level in there without doing too much work,
yet still providing some functionality for the users.
95

96
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.870
base level in there without doing too much work,
yet still providing some functionality for the users.
96

97
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.580
Notice that we also are saying "We expect this functionality
to increase the number of messages sent
97

98
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.550
per user by 15% on average,
98

99
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:04.900
and, you know, this results in a 4% time in app for each user
over the course of a week, but it increases by 4%.
99

100
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.830
and, you know, this results in a 4% time in app for each user
over the course of a week, but it increases by 4%.
100

101
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.360
This is all stuff that you, as a product manager, are
responsible for figuring out ahead of time using
101

102
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.340
data and then writing in here in the epics.
102

103
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.060
So then we've got the product requirements.
103

104
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.220
Okay, "User can initiate a photo message
from the message window."
104

105
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.230
"User can select a photo from their own device or a connected device." "User can preview an image before sending."
105

106
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.900
"User can select a photo from their own device or a connected device." "User can preview an image before sending."
106

107
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.910
We want users to be able to send very high resolution images.
107

108
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.250
This is all stuff that you're going to think, okay,
as a product manager, "According to data,
108

109
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:42.640
this is what we're going to need in terms of functionality
here for this to be successful through all
109

110
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.040
the testing, and user interviews we've done, and that sort of thing."
110

111
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.780
And then you and the designer work on the design
requirements, but a lot of it comes from the designer.
111

112
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.170
And then you and the designer work on the design
requirements, but a lot of it comes from the designer.
112

113
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.010
They're saying "We should store the photos on our servers,
so that the users can always see these pictures,
113

114
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.960
even if they go to, like, another computer.
114

115
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.990
They want to look at the old pictures they sent."
115

116
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.560
And this is something that UI designers and UX designers,
they're thinking about the user experience,
116

117
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.460
So they're going to say things like this, like, it's
important for them to see it in multiple locations
117

118
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.570
because they think that is important
as a UX designer, and that is up to them.
118

119
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.440
So then we have, okay, maximum photo size
should be 5000 by 5000 pixels,
119

120
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.010
the designer thinks that's very important.
Previews should be this size,
120

121
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.100
and then also they're thinking about the actual experience.
121

122
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.830
So once the user successfully uploads,
122

123
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.120
then we show a success indicator. And then
we have the engineering requirements.
123

124
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.060
So the engineers have looked at this with us, at the epic spec,
and we've talked to them about all this functionality.
124

125
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.720
So the engineers have looked at this with us, at the epic spec,
and we've talked to them about all this functionality.
125

126
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.020
They've read the design requirements,
and they come in and they write some additions.
126

127
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.040
They're like, "Okay, for this we're going to need a
photo database, because we don't have one yet.
127

128
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:59.950
It's going to be able to need to scale to 100 million images,
with a maximum file size of 10 MP per image."
128

129
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.140
It's going to be able to need to scale to 100 million images,
with a maximum file size of 10 MP per image."
129

130
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.980
So they're thinking ahead in terms of how much traffic
they can support and if it's scalable. "We're going
130

131
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.610
to need to pull user IDs from the user profile
table in order to associate that message,
131

132
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.140
and that photo, and that user together, and then they're going to ensure that the content delivery network is optimized for this,
132

133
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.480
and that photo, and that user together, and then they're going to ensure that the content delivery network is optimized for this,
133

134
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.660
so we can get pictures to people over in Europe really quickly.
134

135
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.760
So on and so forth. You understand just by going through this. And then, you see, we also have some wires in here.
135

136
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.440
So on and so forth. You understand just by going through this. And then, you see, we also have some wires in here.
136

137
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.630
And usually, this is, you know, some of the earlier
wires, and then, in the actual tickets themselves,
137

138
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.770
we've got the very specific wires around, okay,
the pixel widths and all that, like I mentioned before.
138

139
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:46.270
And then, Jira allows you to comment down here, and it shows you the issues - they call it issues or tickets - in the epic.
139

140
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.520
And then, Jira allows you to comment down here, and it shows you the issues - they call it issues or tickets - in the epic.
140

141
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.910
Okay, so really quick, let's recap on this.
141

142
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:56.660
I'm going to go back to the work board. This is,
we're in a sprint, and this is what's going on, but we'll
142

143
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.310
start off in the backlog.
143

144
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.940
We have added stuff to this sprint. The sprint is right here,
the backlog is right here, this is stuff we're
144

145
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.400
doing in the next sprint, or the one after, or just down the way.
145

146
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:15.460
And then, you can also re-prioritize stuff on the backlog
based on, you know, things that happen, like, is
146

147
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.160
this now more important than this? And this is something
that you as a product manager are also responsible
147

148
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.110
for, is the prioritization. We're going to talk about that later,
148

149
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.770
but you can do that in most project management software.
149

150
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:34.750
So then, once we're in the sprint, we can go to the
sprint that is currently active, and we've got "to do,"
150

151
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.590
"in progress," and "done." The engineers
come in here, they click this,
151

152
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.310
They're like, "Okay, what is this?"
152

153
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.180
Okay, here is the user story, here's the acceptance
criteria, and they're like "Alright."
153

154
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.550
And they put it "in progress," and they start
coding, and then they go to "done."
154

155
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:57.250
And, in some cases, in some companies you'll even
have a step before "done" that is called QA or testing.
155

156
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.280
And, in some cases, in some companies you'll even
have a step before "done" that is called QA or testing.
156

157
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.140
QA stands for quality assurance,
157

158
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:06.420
and this is sometimes where engineers move stuff
before it is sort of approved, and that's usually the
158

159
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:12.130
phase when product managers and designers will go
through the acceptance criteria and literally use
159

160
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:18.610
a test version on a test device or a test website and say,
"Okay, is all this stuff working like we said it would?"
160

161
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.220
a test version on a test device or a test website and say,
"Okay, is all this stuff working like we said it would?"
161

162
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.540
And then, they go "Okay, it is approved" and then they move it
to "done." And then, after the two weeks, you should
162

163
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.600
be done with all of the things that you have in your sprint.
163

164
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.360
So that is really it.
164

165
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:36.460
That's an overview of typically what an epic looks like,
it's just kind of a container, a grouping of stuff,
165

166
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:36.940
That's an overview of typically what an epic looks like,
it's just kind of a container, a grouping of stuff,
166

167
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:43.030
but you have an epic spec with it, or a requirements
document that tells everybody about why you're doing
167

168
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.710
this, what you're expecting,
168

169
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:50.920
and then you've got the requirements from the engineers
and designers, and then you've got the tickets
169

170
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.340
that contain those user stories and acceptance criteria.
170

171
00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:01.000
All this stuff combined together, it makes the actual
day to day workflow of engineering and product
171

172
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.410
management together in a product team at a tech company.
172

173
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.150
All right, everyone.
173

174
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.030
I will see you in the next lecture.
