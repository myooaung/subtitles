Hey, guys, welcome back to the course. Hey, so I wanna
make a quick pit stop to talk to you a little bit
1

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,390
about how customer development is going to defer in your career as a product manager, and this will help
2

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,910
you understand how we teach this section.
3

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,520
So one thing you need to understand about customer development is that it evolves throughout the lifecycle
4

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,890
of your product. You, as a product manager,
5

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,920
your role is going to evolve as well as your product
goes from baby to teenager to adult.
6

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,050
Now, what you need to be aware of though in customer development is that there is a very large chasm
7

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:42,020
or divide between when you are validating a very new product
and reaching out to customers, or when you're
8

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,450
trying to improve an existing product
with an existing customer base.
9

10
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,810
Those are two roles that every product manager
will actually have to tackle.
10

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,140
However, we treat them a little bit differently.
11

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,640
Now, when you don't have a product and you're trying to figure out whether or not you're going to build
12

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
a product, you're primarily going to be running your customer development and running your customer development
13

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,190
interviews with potential customers,
14

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,020
and when you have a product, you're going to be running it
with existing customers. Now, it doesn't sound like
15

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,190
there's a huge difference but it's actually an enormous difference.
16

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,450
Potential customers do not know you.
17

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,720
They probably don't know of what you're trying to do, the information you going to try to get out of them is different.
18

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,670
They probably don't know of what you're trying to do, the information you going to try to get out of them is different.
19

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,950
The way that you have to reach out to them is different,
and in the second case it's also very, very different.
20

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,980
The way that you have to reach out to them is different,
and in the second case it's also very, very different.
21

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,500
Your customers you're going to be talking to, you already know who they are, reaching out to them is generally easier.
22

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,070
Your customers you're going to be talking to, you already know who they are, reaching out to them is generally easier.
23

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,320
And when you get them on the line or in person
it's an entirely different script.
24

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,370
Now, keep this in mind as we go through this section.
25

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,610
Customer development will vary in terms of purpose,
but very rarely in terms of form.
26

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,050
We still will use the same guiding principles we'll learn in the section for either pre-product or post product interviews.
27

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,060
We still will use the same guiding principles we'll learn in the section for either pre-product or post product interviews.
28

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,780
The primary difference is the type of information
you're trying to get out of them.
29

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,860
So, as we go through this section, I'm going to be dividing
everything as pre-product, potential customer,
30

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,580
and post product, existing customer, and in a couple of cases
I'm going to explain one, next lecture explain the next one.
31

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,110
and post product, existing customer, and in a couple of cases
I'm going to explain one, next lecture explain the next one.
32

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,370
I suggest you learn both techniques.
33

34
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,720
But if you only want to learn the type of situation
you're in right now - say you're an entrepreneur and
34

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,270
you're launching a new product - then you can focus on
pre-product, potential customers, and if you're someone
35

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,350
who knows that you want to manage a product
that's already existing, you can focus on the other.
36

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,740
But again, I suggest both.
37

38
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,020
All right. See you in the next lecture.
38

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,790
All right. See you in the next lecture.
