Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, this lecture, we're going to get even deeper into the concept of an MVP.
2

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.320
We now know the academic sense of what an MVP is,
now we're going ask the question "What is an MVP to a product
3

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.970
manager? Let's first start with what we
established in the previous lecture.
4

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.850
MVPs are minimum viable products, which are basically
experiments that we're going to run to simulate
5

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.130
whether or not people are interested in a new product
or feature we're proposing to build. This primarily
6

7
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.930
is used as a way to mitigate risk and to save us from
wasting tons of resources building out the full thing.
7

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.590
is used as a way to mitigate risk and to save us from
wasting tons of resources building out the full thing.
8

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610
Risk is defined here on a number of different dimensions,
9

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.720
but the main ones are: risk of losing resources -
resources like time, resources like money, 
10

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.370
also things like opportunity cost.
11

12
00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.530
So time, money, and opportunity cost. As a product manager,
are those three things going to be your top priority?
12

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.450
So time, money, and opportunity cost. As a product manager,
are those three things going to be your top priority?
13

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.020
So this is where MVPs don't really match up perfectly
with the role of a product manager.
14

15
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.260
Now, it's easy to understand why Lean and MVPs
are so important to startups.
15

16
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.810
Startups in general don't have a lot of resources
and they don't have a huge tolerance for risk.
16

17
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.360
You might say to yourself,
"Whow, I thought startups are super risky."
17

18
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.860
Well, yeah, startups do take risks on building their products,
but what happens if that product they build
18

19
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.910
is adopted by no one - no one shows up,
no one uses it, no one buys it.
19

20
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.700
Well, in the vast majority of cases, the startup just dies.
20

21
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.170
So, as far as tolerance goes, if you launch
the wrong product, and that means that you die,
21

22
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.900
I would say that you have a pretty low tolerance for risk.
22

23
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.650
And so that's why startups hug the leanness of the MVP pillow.
23

24
00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.970
It's what protects them from the monsters at night that want to throw them into the dead pool of other
24

25
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.780
failed startups. Now, remember what we said
when we talked about what a product manager is?
25

26
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.930
Well, product managers primarily exist to manage products,
and that inherently suggests that they're part
26

27
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.460
of something that is a little bit more established.
27

28
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.680
In general, if you're a product manager at a startup,
you might have all the roles and responsibilities
28

29
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.980
of a product manager, but your title is going to be a little bit different.
29

30
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.270
It'd probably be something like co-founder. Now, the traditional product managers exist in organizations that are a little bit larger
30

31
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.270
It'd probably be something like co-founder. Now, the traditional product managers exist in organizations that are a little bit larger
31

32
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.950
and a little bit more established,
and therefore have a higher tolerance for risk.
32

33
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.000
Assuming that you already have a product, and it's validated,
and it has product market fit, it's potentially
33

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.970
making money, any experiment or MVP you run
that's tangential to that,
34

35
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.320
making money, any experiment or MVP you run
that's tangential to that,
35

36
00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.240
if it fails, it often doesn't endanger the main
product line, the main source of life blood.
36

37
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.470
That's not to say that a failed MVP experiment might
not critically endanger the company, but when you're
37

38
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.750
a product manager, you're probably already in an
organization that has at least a little bit of cushion.
38

39
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.920
a product manager, you're probably already in an
organization that has at least a little bit of cushion.
39

40
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.740
The larger the organization, the higher the cushion,
the higher the tolerance for risk, and the more likely
40

41
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.500
you are to be working on a product that's farther
and farther away from their core product.
41

42
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.540
Now, imagine you're at Google and you're a product manager - congratulations, they get paid a ton of money. Now, 
42

43
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.840
imagine you run an experiment on a product, you launch it,
and it fails miserably, and you blow a bunch of money.
43

44
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.290
imagine you run an experiment on a product, you launch it,
and it fails miserably, and you blow a bunch of money.
44

45
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.620
Do you think that's going to endanger Google?
In very few conceivable scenarios could it ever endanger
45

46
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.620
that company. As long as it doesn't have to do with that oil derrick of money coming from their search ads, they'll probably be fine.
46

47
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.790
that company. As long as it doesn't have to do with that oil derrick of money coming from their search ads, they'll probably be fine.
47

48
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.060
that company. As long as it doesn't have to do with that oil derrick of money coming from their search ads, they'll probably be fine.
48

49
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.420
So as a PM, when you run an MVP experiment,
you're going to try to do it quickly, and you're going
49

50
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.950
to try to not be wasteful, but you are probably going to
de-emphasize resources as a hard constraint.
50

51
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:05.090
to try to not be wasteful, but you are probably going to
de-emphasize resources as a hard constraint.
51

52
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.460
If I were to draw this as a graph, on the left hand side,
the Y axis, you would have risk tolerance, on
52

53
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.270
the bottom, you would have the size of the organization.
As it gets larger,
53

54
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.810
they have higher risk tolerance, and as their risk tolerance
gets higher and higher, they start replacing
54

55
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.190
the things that you're traditionally concerned with
in lean and in MVP with other metrics and aspects.
55

56
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.370
the things that you're traditionally concerned with
in lean and in MVP with other metrics and aspects.
56

57
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.520
They start caring about other things,
such as their brand or opportunity cost.
57

58
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.270
Bigger organizations care about things like brand and opportunity cost because they're a bigger deal at a big organization.
58

59
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.650
Bigger organizations care about things like brand and opportunity cost because they're a bigger deal at a big organization.
59

60
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.220
Brands for big organizations are big, there's a lot of
inherent value in the brand that they've built
60

61
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.790
up. Startups generally do not have that problem,
and opportunity cost is another thing that's big
61

62
00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.390
for a company. A company that has lots of resources,
lots of talent, has the option to pursue a lot of
62

63
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.480
different avenues. For a large organization, they're going to
care a lot less about wasted resources, and
63

64
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.840
a lot more about things that startups can't even imagine,
such as not being the first company onto a brand new platform
64

65
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.110
a lot more about things that startups can't even imagine,
such as not being the first company onto a brand new platform
65

66
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.380
or missing a big trend with one of their product lines.
66

67
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.790
That's a big deal for large organizations.
67

68
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.140
Now, the last point I'm going to make, as a product manager,
is that you don't have to think like a scrappy
68

69
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.910
two-person startup. If you make a new product or feature
and it doesn't work, you will survive to live another day.
69

70
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.190
two-person startup. If you make a new product or feature
and it doesn't work, you will survive to live another day.
70

71
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.000
And because you are still there,
71

72
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.990
also keep in mind that failed products can actually benefit you in other ways. Other parts of your organization can absorb the benefit.
72

73
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.830
also keep in mind that failed products can actually benefit you in other ways. Other parts of your organization can absorb the benefit.
73

74
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.190
So, as a class activity, I'm going to ask you a question,
post in the group discussion with what you would
74

75
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.900
do. Let's go back to the Google example,
let's talk about Google Glass.
75

76
00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.050
Remember that one? Google launched the notorious facewear called Google Glass, which either turns
76

77
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.440
you into an object of envy or a target of derision.
77

78
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.920
Now, as a product manager at Google,
would you have launched Google Glass?
78

79
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.330
Now, some food for thought. A lot of you guys would say no,
it was a big waste of money, waste of time.
79

80
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.330
There is the whole glasshole phenomenon,
people really just didn't adopt it.
80

81
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.170
But I'm going to ask you to think just a little bit about
the other benefits that could have come from Google Glass.
81

82
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.880
But I'm going to ask you to think just a little bit about
the other benefits that could have come from Google Glass.
82

83
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.810
All that money they spent, it barely even dented their
balance sheet, it made no difference to the company
83

84
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.100
as a whole, but they did get a ton of buzz,
84

85
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.110
a ton of press, and they enhanced their brand, because they were pushing the envelope, showing themselves
85

86
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.180
as innovative, and at least "Hey, they're
swinging for the fences and trying something."
86

87
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.670
So just post in the group discussion, state your case.
87

88
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.240
So just post in the group discussion, state your case.
88

89
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.110
Do you agree with me or do you agree with
the standard response, which is no?
89

90
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.700
All right guys, I'll see you in the next lecture.
