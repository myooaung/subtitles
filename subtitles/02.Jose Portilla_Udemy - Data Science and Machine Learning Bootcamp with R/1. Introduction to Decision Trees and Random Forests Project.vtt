Hello everyone and welcome to the decision trees and ran them Force project lecture in this lecture

2

00:00:05.820  -->  00:00:06.290
video.

3

00:00:06.300  -->  00:00:11.300
We're going to go ahead and go over the notebook with decision trees and in the forest projects.

4

00:00:11.310  -->  00:00:14.120
Explain where we're going to be doing and how to approach it.

5

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:16.270
Let's go ahead and jump to the note.

6

00:00:16.650  -->  00:00:20.770
All right so here we're at the tree methods project notebook.

7

00:00:20.820  -->  00:00:23.660
A quick note that it's called the tree methods project notebook.

8

00:00:23.670  -->  00:00:28.070
It's not called decision trees and we're in the force the called Tree methods projects.

9

00:00:28.080  -->  00:00:31.530
Just keep that in mind when you're looking for the project Notebook.

10

00:00:31.620  -->  00:00:36.100
We're going to be using a data set that's included in the SLR library.

11

00:00:36.100  -->  00:00:44.220
It's called the college dataset are college data frame the data frame consists about of 777 observations

12

00:00:44.670  -->  00:00:49.770
of universities or colleges with a bunch of different features and variables and we're all going to

13

00:00:49.770  -->  00:00:53.470
be trying to predict is based off of all their features and variables.

14

00:00:53.670  -->  00:00:59.640
Can we correctly predict if the university or college is private or public.

15

00:00:59.640  -->  00:01:01.210
You'll go ahead and get the data.

16

00:01:01.440  -->  00:01:07.450
Look at it and then do some exploratory data analysis such as scatter plots you'll do a histogram.

17

00:01:07.450  -->  00:01:12.330
Another histogram and then you'll also answer some questions based off of that exploratory data analysis

18

00:01:12.960  -->  00:01:16.970
then you'll use the CA tools library to do a train test split on the data.

19

00:01:17.100  -->  00:01:19.660
You'll start off by making a decision tree model.

20

00:01:20.010  -->  00:01:24.360
And then once you've done that and explore it a little bit you're going to plot out the decision tree

21

00:01:24.930  -->  00:01:29.850
and then you'll move on to the random force model and then you'll do some predictions based off of the

22

00:01:29.850  -->  00:01:31.680
random forest model.

23

00:01:31.680  -->  00:01:32.490
All right.

24

00:01:32.490  -->  00:01:36.990
Hopefully you have fun with this project go ahead and explore that data and create those tree method

25

00:01:36.990  -->  00:01:38.070
models.

26

00:01:38.070  -->  00:01:40.440
Thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture
