00:00:01.080  -->  00:00:05.550
Hello everyone and welcome to the neural networks project in this lecture I'm going to give a brief

2

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:09.270
overview of your machine learning project for the neural networks topic.

3

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:12.040
Let's go ahead and jump to the notebook for this lecture.

4

00:00:12.060  -->  00:00:14.540
All right here we are at the project Notebook.

5

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:19.750
We're going to wrap up this course by taking a quick look at the real effectiveness of neural nets.

6

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:25.230
We're going to use the bank authentication data set from the UCI repository and this data consists of

7

00:00:25.230  -->  00:00:30.990
five columns and it's a variant skewness kurtosis an entropy of images.

8

00:00:30.990  -->  00:00:34.810
So neural nets a lot of times are used for computer image recognition.

9

00:00:34.920  -->  00:00:42.060
And we're going to be doing is using wavelet transformation data to actually see if a bank note is authentic

10

00:00:42.090  -->  00:00:43.290
or fake.

11

00:00:43.410  -->  00:00:47.610
And if you're wondering what have wavelet transformation is you can go ahead and check out the Wikipedia

12

00:00:47.610  -->  00:00:50.190
article on the wavelet transform.

13

00:00:50.190  -->  00:00:55.530
But basically what you're doing is you're just taking a picture something that looks like this and you're

14

00:00:55.530  -->  00:01:00.710
doing a transformation on it so that a computer can actually understand what it's looking at.

15

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:06.270
And basically we have this sort of wavelet information for banknotes and we're going to give this wavelet

16

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:10.860
information different aspects of the wavelet information to our neural network.

17

00:01:10.880  -->  00:01:15.870
We're going to see if our neural network can then process that essentially image information and detect

18

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:19.850
whether a bank note is fraudulent or authentic.

19

00:01:19.960  -->  00:01:23.100
What are you going to do is it's a pretty simple project you'll get the data.

20

00:01:23.280  -->  00:01:25.230
You'll check the head of the data.

21

00:01:25.320  -->  00:01:30.780
You can do whatever you want I figure now that at the end of the course you can create whatever visualizations

22

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:31.830
you're interested in.

23

00:01:31.920  -->  00:01:36.810
We're going to skip this step for the solutions note books flash video because state it isn't super

24

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:41.740
interpretable because it's just essentially Siskel information about the wavelet transformation.

25

00:01:42.000  -->  00:01:47.310
But you can go ahead and plot out however you see fit then you will just do a train to split and we'll

26

00:01:47.310  -->  00:01:52.290
build a neural net and then we'll do predictions off of that neural net and we also compare it to a

27

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:54.390
random force model.

28

00:01:54.390  -->  00:01:58.800
All right I hope you have a lot of fun with this last project and this should hopefully be a stepping

29

00:01:58.800  -->  00:02:04.540
stone for you to tackle on your own data projects in your own life or own works place.

30

00:02:04.620  -->  00:02:08.110
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture when we go over the solutions for this project
