Hello everyone and welcome to the player training exercise lecture and this lecture we're going to give

2

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:11,750
a brief overview of the plier training exercise and how to approach it and what to expect.

3

00:00:11,760  -->  00:00:15,930
Let's go ahead and jump to the note book for the player training exercise.

4

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:16,290
All right.

5

00:00:16,290  -->  00:00:21,270
Here I am at the notebook or this notebook which just going to use the empty car's data frame that's

6

00:00:21,270  -->  00:00:27,020
built into our and you're going to use your library to perform a series of tests on which space is going

7

00:00:27,030  -->  00:00:28,470
to review all the operations.

8

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:34,620
We went over in the guide to using the plier lecture and at the end we'll also go over at the pipe operator

9

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:35,230
.

10

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:39,290
Keep in mind that these tasks be done without the player library.

11

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:44,130
But for the specific training exercise you should only be using the player library functions listed

12

00:00:44,130  -->  00:00:45,510
here.

13

00:00:45,510  -->  00:00:51,120
All right you should also keep in mind that this should be a relatively straightforward assignment since

14

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:57,450
the whole purpose of the player is to make your life easier by simplifying all these functions and operations

15

00:00:57,450  -->  00:00:58,200
.

16

00:00:58,200  -->  00:00:59,040
All right.

17

00:00:59,040  -->  00:01:03,840
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&A forum or just watch the next lecture where we have

18

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:06,970
a full solutions walkthrough for this training exercise.

19

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:08,910
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
