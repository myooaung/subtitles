00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:06,780
Hello everyone and welcome to the guide to our studio in this lecture which is going to be giving you

2

00:00:06,780  -->  00:00:12,150
a tour of the various functionalities that our studio will provide when you're programming in our programming

3

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:13,500
language.

4

00:00:13,500  -->  00:00:17,010
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio now.

5

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:17,520
All right.

6

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:19,400
So here we are our studio.

7

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:24,370
And you'll notice we have various panes or windows open within our studio.

8

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:30,570
We have the console here on the left and we also in an environment and a history tab.

9

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:33,920
Sometimes the environment is also known as a workspace tap.

10

00:00:34,260  -->  00:00:39,310
And here on the bottom right we have some files in this tab.

11

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:44,660
So let's go ahead and just explain these various windows and screens and show you what they do.

12

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:50,820
You may see some R code throughout this tour of our studio or if you don't fully understand it we'll

13

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:53,970
teach you all about our programming later on in the course.

14

00:00:53,970  -->  00:00:58,380
Right now we're just giving you a basic feel for how to use our studio here on the left.

15

00:00:58,380  -->  00:01:00,090
We have the cons..

16

00:01:00,180  -->  00:01:04,490
So the council is where we can type direct commands and see output.

17

00:01:04,500  -->  00:01:07,620
So we've actually already used this in the installation video.

18

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:13,530
We'll go ahead and show another example that can do something like Prince.

19

00:01:13,700  -->  00:01:18,290
And you'll noticed you'll get a lot of helpful pop ups show up in our studio.

20

00:01:18,420  -->  00:01:24,570
So as you begin to type functions that exist in our our studio that will automatically pop up suggestions

21

00:01:24,630  -->  00:01:26,590
or auto complete code for you.

22

00:01:26,610  -->  00:01:30,770
So here it pops up some information about the print function.

23

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:34,960
So go ahead and says something like print's it's arguments etc..

24

00:01:35,340  -->  00:01:40,710
So we're going to do is do an open parentheses again you'll notice our studio automatically adds closing

25

00:01:40,710  -->  00:01:43,380
parentheses in a file type in a single quote.

26

00:01:43,500  -->  00:01:51,980
It automatically adds the closing quote and we'll just go ahead and say our studio is nice.

27

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:54,920
I'll click enter and since is a con..

28

00:01:54,950  -->  00:01:58,540
I have directly typed the command and I see the output directly.

29

00:01:58,710  -->  00:02:02,060
Now let's explore this environment tab right here.

30

00:02:02,220  -->  00:02:06,510
So this is going to show all the active objects in my environment.

31

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:08,000
So what that means is I.

32

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:15,150
As I assign various variables values so I'll have a bunch of variable names and they'll have different

33

00:02:15,150  -->  00:02:18,450
associated values to them or objects or data structures.

34

00:02:18,450  -->  00:02:20,760
This tab is going to go ahead keep track of that.

35

00:02:21,000  -->  00:02:29,280
So for example let's go ahead and start of a variable called a in a sign at the number 2.

36

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:32,890
Don't worry about this syntax will go over it in much more detail later on.

37

00:02:32,940  -->  00:02:36,720
Basically here I'm just assigning to the variable a.

38

00:02:37,410  -->  00:02:42,710
I go ahead and click enter and now in my global environment I can see that I have some value.

39

00:02:42,800  -->  00:02:44,870
And it has been assigned to.

40

00:02:45,300  -->  00:02:46,050
All right.

41

00:02:46,200  -->  00:02:52,680
So here at the bottom right I have a file's tab so the spiles tab shows all the files and folders in

42

00:02:52,680  -->  00:02:57,560
your default workspace as if you're just on either a PC or Mac window.

43

00:02:57,600  -->  00:03:03,840
Also if you end up using plotting in our studio you can click here on the plot's tab and your plot's

44

00:03:03,840  -->  00:03:05,160
will show up here.

45

00:03:05,640  -->  00:03:12,840
The next tab which is the package's tab will list a series of packages or add ons needed to run a certain

46

00:03:12,840  -->  00:03:16,460
process will get into packages much later on in the course.

47

00:03:16,530  -->  00:03:19,020
So don't worry about them right now.

48

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:23,610
Here you have the help tab which is really useful if you have some sort of internet connection or a

49

00:03:23,610  -->  00:03:27,170
downloaded the are resources or manuals needed.

50

00:03:27,180  -->  00:03:32,640
You'll always find all the help you need throughout this helped including great resources for learning

51

00:03:32,640  -->  00:03:32,680
.

52

00:03:32,690  -->  00:03:35,170
Are are learning more about our studio.

53

00:03:35,630  -->  00:03:39,900
OK so let's go ahead and explore the workspace a little more.

54

00:03:40,290  -->  00:03:46,650
So again I have this environment tab which is going to store any object value or functions that I create

55

00:03:46,680  -->  00:03:48,470
during my R session.

56

00:03:48,540  -->  00:03:54,880
So in the example below I already created a variable A and assigned the number to just an integer.

57

00:03:54,940  -->  00:04:00,270
But for example if I do let's go ahead and make a vector called the.

58

00:04:00,410  -->  00:04:05,790
And don't worry about the syntax here and just showing this for example purposes I create a new object

59

00:04:05,790  -->  00:04:05,810
.

60

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:07,090
In this case it's a vector.

61

00:04:07,140  -->  00:04:13,420
And here I see more information about the different values I have existing in my environments.

62

00:04:13,440  -->  00:04:16,380
You'll notice that right next to this environment tab.

63

00:04:16,590  -->  00:04:21,550
I have a history tab and the history tab keeps a record of all your previous commands.

64

00:04:21,540  -->  00:04:25,370
And this really helps when testing or running various processes.

65

00:04:25,470  -->  00:04:30,720
Here you can either save the whole list or you can select commands you want and then send them to in

66

00:04:30,780  -->  00:04:36,390
our script to keep track of your work when you're using our studio.

67

00:04:36,420  -->  00:04:41,150
It's more likely that you're going to want to actually select a particular working that rectory here

68

00:04:41,150  -->  00:04:41,260
.

69

00:04:41,280  -->  00:04:43,670
I've already selected a working directory for this.

70

00:04:43,680  -->  00:04:48,180
Our code will let me go ahead and show you how you could change a working directory if you wanted to

71

00:04:48,180  -->  00:04:51,220
change your working directory for this particular session.

72

00:04:51,300  -->  00:04:59,430
You just go to this session and this top tab and then go to set working directory and then you can choose

73

00:04:59,430  -->  00:05:01,070
directory here.

74

00:05:01,140  -->  00:05:05,580
A window will pop up and then you can go ahead and choose the directory you want to go ahead and Slik

75

00:05:05,590  -->  00:05:06,220
cancels.

76

00:05:06,220  -->  00:05:12,320
Since I'm already at the folder I want to be in so again go into session set working directory choose

77

00:05:12,320  -->  00:05:15,300
their victory will allow you to change the working directory.

78

00:05:15,590  -->  00:05:21,230
But you can also set a default or can directory that's directory that's going to default to every time

79

00:05:21,230  -->  00:05:22,520
you open our studio.

80

00:05:22,790  -->  00:05:31,490
You can do that under the Tools tab so you can go to Tools go to Options or global options and then

81

00:05:31,490  -->  00:05:36,680
here you'll get a little options window pop up and then which you can do is go ahead and select a default

82

00:05:36,680  -->  00:05:41,100
working directory and then you can go ahead and click Browse and choose the folder.

83

00:05:41,110  -->  00:05:45,200
Make sheet click apply and then click OK.

84

00:05:45,200  -->  00:05:49,560
If you ever want to figure out what directory you're in there's two ways to do this.

85

00:05:49,580  -->  00:05:53,960
You can either just go ahead and check here under the files tab the directory or under.

86

00:05:53,960  -->  00:05:55,430
It'll show you the path.

87

00:05:55,430  -->  00:06:01,890
Or you can click here in the console and type G E T W D.

88

00:06:02,450  -->  00:06:06,100
Close parentheses and that will get the working directory which is what.

89

00:06:06,120  -->  00:06:10,790
There'll be the stands for if you click enter it'll show up as a response.

90

00:06:10,820  -->  00:06:12,660
And there's my working there victory.

91

00:06:13,610  -->  00:06:19,130
If you want to set your working directory or change or working directory directly from the console you

92

00:06:19,130  -->  00:06:28,280
can actually use set W.D. parentheses and then type in the directory of wherever you want to set.

93

00:06:28,310  -->  00:06:32,150
So you would just type in here the file path to whatever new directory you want.

94

00:06:32,240  -->  00:06:36,380
I will go ahead and run that since I'm already at the directory I want and I already did it using our

95

00:06:36,380  -->  00:06:39,440
studios graphical user interface.

96

00:06:39,470  -->  00:06:44,330
Now when you're developing in our program or in our script usually you're not going to just input a

97

00:06:44,330  -->  00:06:49,740
bunch of functions or commands directly into the console which you're going to be doing is working with

98

00:06:49,740  -->  00:06:51,200
an R script.

99

00:06:51,200  -->  00:06:55,730
So an R script is where are you going to basically keep a record of your work and be able to run multiple

100

00:06:55,730  -->  00:06:57,470
commands all at once.

101

00:06:57,480  -->  00:07:03,590
Now what you can do in order to start a new script is click here on this little icon and then go ahead

102

00:07:03,590  -->  00:07:08,880
and select our scripts later on we'll discuss things such as are marked down and shiny webapps.

103

00:07:09,030  -->  00:07:12,250
But let's keep it simple for now and go ahead and select our scripts.

104

00:07:12,460  -->  00:07:15,020
Now you can see we have four windows.

105

00:07:15,020  -->  00:07:18,840
This is what you'll almost always be using when you're dealing with our studio.

106

00:07:19,040  -->  00:07:24,650
So you have the console window the workspace or global environment that history window over here on

107

00:07:24,650  -->  00:07:25,700
the top right.

108

00:07:25,820  -->  00:07:30,230
You have the files plot's packages isn't help when though here at the bottom right.

109

00:07:30,440  -->  00:07:33,320
And here the top left you have your scripts here.

110

00:07:33,350  -->  00:07:39,050
My script is currently untitled so our script is we're going to basically keep a record of your work

111

00:07:39,050  -->  00:07:42,200
and be able to run a bunch of our commands all at once.

112

00:07:42,350  -->  00:07:46,680
So maybe if you're coming in from another language such as Python you can think of this is just a dot

113

00:07:46,780  -->  00:07:48,440
PI file.

114

00:07:48,440  -->  00:07:49,190
All right.

115

00:07:49,910  -->  00:07:54,970
Let's go ahead and see an example of using in our script to run some commands.

116

00:07:55,310  -->  00:07:58,420
So I'm going to go ahead and type out some R code.

117

00:07:58,430  -->  00:08:06,590
We'll just go ahead and use simple print statements saying the say print first line and then I'm going

118

00:08:06,590  -->  00:08:11,120
to go ahead on the second line of code here and go ahead and say print.

119

00:08:12,260  -->  00:08:13,460
Second line.

120

00:08:13,970  -->  00:08:14,810
All right.

121

00:08:14,810  -->  00:08:18,190
So here we have my our script.

122

00:08:18,200  -->  00:08:20,580
Notice right now it's untile and not saved.

123

00:08:20,770  -->  00:08:23,060
I go ahead and click this floppy disk icon.

124

00:08:23,090  -->  00:08:32,360
It will save it and it will have to name it's going to go ahead and say this is Demo click Save it automatically

125

00:08:32,600  -->  00:08:33,860
put the extension demo.

126

00:08:33,900  -->  00:08:35,150
Are here for you.

127

00:08:35,300  -->  00:08:38,390
So I have my script all ready to go.

128

00:08:38,390  -->  00:08:44,780
You'll notice here I have a run which is going to run the current line or selection and then I also

129

00:08:44,780  -->  00:08:51,290
have source which sources the contents of the active documents and in between those I have a rerun the

130

00:08:51,290  -->  00:08:53,110
previous code but.

131

00:08:53,930  -->  00:08:56,730
So let's go ahead and explore each of these buttons does.

132

00:08:56,960  -->  00:09:02,400
If I select here I can go ahead and highlight or just have my cursor on the first line.

133

00:09:02,570  -->  00:09:04,250
So print first line.

134

00:09:04,250  -->  00:09:05,900
If I go ahead and click run.

135

00:09:06,230  -->  00:09:11,430
Notice I just get here on my console which displays the output print first line.

136

00:09:11,480  -->  00:09:14,800
It didn't run everything in the script.

137

00:09:14,900  -->  00:09:22,060
And again if I have my cursor or if I highlight select the entire second line and then click run.

138

00:09:22,220  -->  00:09:26,940
It's just going to execute where the cursor was on that line.

139

00:09:26,960  -->  00:09:29,130
So it's only going to do one line at a time here.

140

00:09:29,300  -->  00:09:31,040
So that's what the run button does.

141

00:09:31,040  -->  00:09:33,860
It runs that either the entire selection you have.

142

00:09:33,860  -->  00:09:40,340
So if you highlighted a bunch stuff will run it or just the current line.

143

00:09:40,340  -->  00:09:46,550
Now if we go ahead and click here on the source you'll notice we get everything output.

144

00:09:46,550  -->  00:09:49,650
So this is basically going to run the entire source script.

145

00:09:49,670  -->  00:09:55,100
And in this case you can see here on the console we have first line second line and you'll notice here

146

00:09:55,100  -->  00:10:00,940
that the command was source and then it just relays the entire path to that dot our code.

147

00:10:01,430  -->  00:10:01,970
All right.

148

00:10:02,180  -->  00:10:11,150
So those are the basics of our studio writing our scripts and using the history in environments windows

149

00:10:11,240  -->  00:10:13,280
in our studio.

150

00:10:13,280  -->  00:10:18,950
As we begin to learn more about the our programming language we'll explore our studios other capabilities

151

00:10:18,980  -->  00:10:22,120
in more detail later on.

152

00:10:22,130  -->  00:10:28,190
The last thing I want to discuss is setting up customizing the appearance of our studio.

153

00:10:28,190  -->  00:10:30,560
So right now you'll notice the fonts pretty small.

154

00:10:30,650  -->  00:10:37,460
So when I'm teaching everyone in this course what I'm going to do is actually make the font larger and

155

00:10:37,550  -->  00:10:41,520
I'm going to go ahead and make the background dark instead of white.

156

00:10:41,540  -->  00:10:44,420
So let me go ahead and show you how to do that.

157

00:10:44,570  -->  00:10:51,650
You can just go to Tools Global Options and Global Options is the window where you're going to be able

158

00:10:51,650  -->  00:10:55,760
to change pane layouts Appearance's packages etcetera.

159

00:10:55,880  -->  00:10:57,570
So there's a lot of options here.

160

00:10:57,950  -->  00:11:04,220
And if you just click on appearance here you'll have the option to choose your editor font and your

161

00:11:04,220  -->  00:11:06,600
font size how much you want to zoom in.

162

00:11:06,650  -->  00:11:10,450
And there's some example code here and I'll show you what it looks like.

163

00:11:10,580  -->  00:11:15,300
So I'm going to go ahead and select the font to be a little bit larger.

164

00:11:15,350  -->  00:11:19,980
And if you go ahead and select Ed. themes you can change the color themes for you.

165

00:11:20,240  -->  00:11:24,090
So go in and select the theme that you like the best.

166

00:11:24,380  -->  00:11:26,720
I'm going to go ahead and select mano Kai.

167

00:11:26,810  -->  00:11:33,350
It's really similar to Sublime Text Editor if you're familiar with that text editor software and if

168

00:11:33,350  -->  00:11:36,380
you want you can also play around with the font.

169

00:11:36,530  -->  00:11:39,500
I'm going to go ahead and keep the default.

170

00:11:39,500  -->  00:11:48,500
So let's go ahead and apply that make this a little larger at 16 apply select OK and you can see I have

171

00:11:48,560  -->  00:11:54,080
changed the appearance of my scripts and my cons..

172

00:11:54,350  -->  00:11:59,120
So choose whatever is most readable for you what you like the best.

173

00:11:59,240  -->  00:12:02,000
Obviously that's personal preference.

174

00:12:02,000  -->  00:12:02,570
All right.

175

00:12:02,690  -->  00:12:04,080
That's it for this lecture.

176

00:12:04,190  -->  00:12:07,390
Hopefully that was a nice little tour an overview of what you can do.

177

00:12:07,400  -->  00:12:09,530
Our studio and how to use our studio.

178

00:12:09,660  -->  00:12:14,080
So it's going to be our main development environment where we're learning how to program with our.

179

00:12:14,150  -->  00:12:18,960
Don't worry we didn't understand all the art commands or our code that I showed in this lecture.

180

00:12:18,980  -->  00:12:22,730
We're going to be covering all of that later on when we actually learn how to program it.

181

00:12:23,330  -->  00:12:28,970
This lecture was just for showing and exploring the art studio development environments.

182

00:12:29,030  -->  00:12:31,850
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
