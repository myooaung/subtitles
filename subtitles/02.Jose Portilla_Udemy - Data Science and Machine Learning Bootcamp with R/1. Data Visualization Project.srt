00:00:01,110  -->  00:00:04,380
Hello everyone and welcome to the data visualization project.

2

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:09,870
Now that you learned but geez you put two and done some basic plot two exercises it's time to take all

3

00:00:09,870  -->  00:00:13,950
of that knowledge and use it to do a data visualization project.

4

00:00:13,950  -->  00:00:17,390
Let's go ahead and hop to data visualization project notebook.

5

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:23,930
All right here we are at the notebook and this notebook is under the training exercises folder under

6

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:25,080
capstone and data.

7

00:00:25,080  -->  00:00:26,100
This projects.

8

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:31,080
And then there's a folder called Data visualization project and this actual notebook is called assignment

9

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:33,260
for G.G. plot too.

10

00:00:33,590  -->  00:00:35,580
I want to make a little statement here.

11

00:00:35,580  -->  00:00:37,080
This is an optional assignment.

12

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:40,720
You don't have to do this data visualization project completely.

13

00:00:40,740  -->  00:00:47,250
It's a pretty complicated project because we are recreating a complex real visualization from the Economist

14

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:47,730
.

15

00:00:47,790  -->  00:00:54,110
But go ahead and go as far as you want in the plot to data visualization project and then the next lecture

16

00:00:54,110  -->  00:00:54,150
.

17

00:00:54,150  -->  00:00:57,520
I have a full solutions walkthrough for the entire project.

18

00:00:57,540  -->  00:01:01,800
Basically we're we're going to be doing is if you click on this link in the notebook it'll take you

19

00:01:01,800  -->  00:01:08,400
to a link in the Economist magazine where this visualization is I go ahead and click on that tab.

20

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:13,440
They'll take me to this article and this article just talks about the correlation between corruption

21

00:01:13,470  -->  00:01:15,260
and development in countries.

22

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:21,270
And it's from the year 2011 and it has the state of visualization in it where you have a Corruption

23

00:01:21,330  -->  00:01:27,960
Perceptions Index on the x axis and a human development index on the y axis and then notice it's basically

24

00:01:27,960  -->  00:01:31,240
a scatterplot with some sort of trend that fit line.

25

00:01:31,370  -->  00:01:33,660
If you go back to the assignment.

26

00:01:33,660  -->  00:01:39,420
Basically this assignment just takes you step by step through what she have to do on this project.

27

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:42,510
You can go ahead and access the data in this folder.

28

00:01:42,530  -->  00:01:47,610
It's the Economist underscore assignment underscored data that C S V and it's in the same folder as

29

00:01:47,760  -->  00:01:49,280
this actual notebook.

30

00:01:49,350  -->  00:01:54,840
And then you just go ahead and step by step slowly reproduce the figures shown in the notebook which

31

00:01:54,840  -->  00:02:00,380
will lead you to actually recreating something that looks really similar at the end to the economists

32

00:02:00,380  -->  00:02:00,460
.

33

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:05,400
You notice here we have some labels there's too many labels and then we reduce the amount of labels

34

00:02:05,410  -->  00:02:11,940
etc. make it a little nicer white theme at a scale to it and just continue on until we get something

35

00:02:11,940  -->  00:02:16,420
that looks more or less like the final visualization.

36

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:22,320
A quick note to keep in mind this notebook because it's an HDMI format some of the actual figures may

37

00:02:22,320  -->  00:02:27,840
be too compressed and hopefully when you actually perform these operations in our studio they'll look

38

00:02:27,840  -->  00:02:28,600
a lot better.

39

00:02:28,620  -->  00:02:29,950
Just keep that in mind.

40

00:02:30,630  -->  00:02:31,210
OK.

41

00:02:31,470  -->  00:02:32,850
Hope you have fun with this project.

42

00:02:32,850  -->  00:02:38,250
Again it's optional and you can go either as far as little as you want throughout the state of visualization

43

00:02:38,250  -->  00:02:41,750
project or if you just want to browse the solutions walk through video.

44

00:02:41,760  -->  00:02:43,030
Feel free to do so.

45

00:02:43,200  -->  00:02:44,270
I hope you enjoy it.

46

00:02:44,280  -->  00:02:46,530
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture video
