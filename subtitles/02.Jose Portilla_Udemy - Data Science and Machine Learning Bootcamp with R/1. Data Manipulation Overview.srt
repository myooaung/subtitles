Hello everyone and welcome to the data manipulation section of this course and this section of the course

2

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:11,130
we're going to be focusing on simplifying the syntax to perform data operations that we're already familiar

3

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:11,850
with.

4

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:18,120
We'll do this by learning about two packages and the pipe operator in our two packages we'll learn about

5

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:24,480
and install our the supplier package and the tidy package we'll use the deployer package for manipulating

6

00:00:24,480  -->  00:00:25,020
data.

7

00:00:25,130  -->  00:00:32,550
A clean simple syntax will ease the tidy package to clean our data well also learn how to use the pipe

8

00:00:32,550  -->  00:00:35,210
operator to further simplify our syntax.

9

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:40,130
When we're working with our with that all said let's go ahead and get started.
