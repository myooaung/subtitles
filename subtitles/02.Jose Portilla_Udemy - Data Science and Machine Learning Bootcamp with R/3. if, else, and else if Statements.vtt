00:00:01.080  -->  00:00:06.180
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on if else an ELSE IF statements.

2

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:12.660
It's finally time start learning how we can add even more logic into our programming using our in this

3

00:00:12.660  -->  00:00:17.100
video will quickly show the syntax for an IF ELSE an ELSE IF statement.

4

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:23.430
If you're already familiar with programming and if an else and LCF statements so you can just get an

5

00:00:23.430  -->  00:00:29.060
idea of what the syntax looks like for this and are after that will actually explain how to use if Elsin

6

00:00:29.080  -->  00:00:30.500
else if statements in your code.

7

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:35.240
If you're new to programming Let's go ahead and jump to our studio and see how this all works.

8

00:00:35.670  -->  00:00:37.710
OK so here we are now at our studio.

9

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:41.760
I'm going to quickly go over the syntax in case you're already familiar of programming and just want

10

00:00:41.760  -->  00:00:48.000
a brief reminder how to do this sort of thing and are in are you just going to say if in parentheses

11

00:00:48.020  -->  00:00:49.610
you're going to pass in that condition.

12

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:53.780
So for example let's say we want to check x x is equal to a certain number.

13

00:00:53.790  -->  00:00:55.630
We check for equality like that.

14

00:00:55.680  -->  00:01:00.390
Put your conditional statement inside of the parentheses and then in curly brackets you're going to

15

00:01:00.390  -->  00:01:02.510
have whatever code you want to execute.

16

00:01:02.520  -->  00:01:09.850
For example you can print the statements just a string x is equal to 10.

17

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:12.810
Let's go ahead and set this to run.

18

00:01:12.870  -->  00:01:16.250
I'll say X assign it to 10.

19

00:01:16.420  -->  00:01:18.960
Now let's just go ahead and run that source.

20

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:20.560
Notice we get the print out.

21

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:26.160
Now if you want to add if statements you can just do that on the end of these curly brackets.

22

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:28.920
Some other condition here.

23

00:01:28.960  -->  00:01:32.950
Effects let's say is equal to 12.

24

00:01:33.540  -->  00:01:39.170
We'll say prints X equal to 12.

25

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:45.810
And finally we can add L statement which will just go ahead and put in curly brackets there.

26

00:01:45.820  -->  00:01:51.870
Since we're not checking for any particular condition we're just saying else here will say prints X

27

00:01:51.870  -->  00:01:58.030
was not equal to 10 or 12.

28

00:01:58.860  -->  00:02:02.020
Let's go ahead and make X equal or assign 12 to X..

29

00:02:02.040  -->  00:02:11.370
Make sure that all works out will say it's x is equal to 12 and Al to assign it 13 x is not equal to

30

00:02:11.370  -->  00:02:12.660
10 or 12.

31

00:02:13.080  -->  00:02:16.860
OK so if you're already familiar of programming Hopefully that's enough for you to just catch up on

32

00:02:16.860  -->  00:02:17.670
the syntax.

33

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:19.500
It's pretty straightforward and simple.

34

00:02:19.500  -->  00:02:22.460
You've already seen this kind of thing before in another language.

35

00:02:22.500  -->  00:02:22.870
It's just your.

36

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:29.520
If else if and L statements your conditions inside parentheses your code to execute inside curly brackets

37

00:02:29.520  -->  00:02:29.960
.

38

00:02:29.970  -->  00:02:34.370
Now let's go ahead and backtrack a bit in case you've never seen.

39

00:02:34.400  -->  00:02:41.280
If Else elses statements why we use them and how it can use them and are in order to see a good example

40

00:02:41.280  -->  00:02:42.390
of why we can use these.

41

00:02:42.390  -->  00:02:44.700
Let's start off with creating some variables.

42

00:02:44.780  -->  00:02:51.090
I'm going to create a variable called hot and then assign at the logical false going to create another

43

00:02:51.090  -->  00:02:55.030
variable temp and assign it the number 60.

44

00:02:55.080  -->  00:03:00.020
So temperature 60 degrees in this case and I'm going to create an if statement.

45

00:03:00.040  -->  00:03:05.610
What if is going to allow us to do is say if some condition is true then execute the code inside of

46

00:03:05.610  -->  00:03:07.290
this curly brackets.

47

00:03:07.290  -->  00:03:15.970
So for example if we'll put in print CS if temp greater than 80 curly brackets.

48

00:03:16.290  -->  00:03:24.750
And this is we're going to put some code to execute if condition was true.

49

00:03:24.750  -->  00:03:29.400
So that means if the condition inside those princes is true the code inside of these curly brackets

50

00:03:29.460  -->  00:03:31.680
is going to execute in this case.

51

00:03:31.680  -->  00:03:39.320
I'll just put a simple print statement will say print temperature temp.

52

00:03:39.410  -->  00:03:45.090
All just say temp is greater than 80.

53

00:03:45.240  -->  00:03:51.660
If I run this right now no I don't get any output and that's because my temperature was equal to 60

54

00:03:51.660  -->  00:03:52.280
.

55

00:03:52.380  -->  00:03:58.950
If I make this equal to 100 and run the source then I get temp is greater than 80 so that makes sense

56

00:03:58.950  -->  00:03:59.480
.

57

00:03:59.490  -->  00:04:03.540
Now your code inside of this curly brackets isn't just limited to print statements.

58

00:04:03.570  -->  00:04:06.950
We can even do things like re-assigning or for loops.

59

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:10.940
Those kind of things all inside of your curly brackets.

60

00:04:10.950  -->  00:04:19.600
So for example I'm going to reassign hot to be true only if the temperature is greater than 80.

61

00:04:19.840  -->  00:04:26.580
So outside of this if statement I'm going to go ahead and prints pots and check if it got turned to

62

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:30.350
true since her temperature is 100 degrees.

63

00:04:30.510  -->  00:04:32.380
So in this case it is true.

64

00:04:32.680  -->  00:04:37.660
Going to go ahead and clear the console and change temperature to 10 degrees.

65

00:04:37.680  -->  00:04:39.300
Read this again.

66

00:04:39.330  -->  00:04:46.050
Notice temperature or hot is not equal to false because we assign hot hot equal to false set temperature

67

00:04:46.150  -->  00:04:46.930
to 10.

68

00:04:47.160  -->  00:04:50.790
And this is statement because the temperature was never greater than 80.

69

00:04:50.790  -->  00:04:54.990
We never actually execute the code inside of the curly brackets.

70

00:04:54.990  -->  00:04:57.240
Something to keep in mind while you're working with.

71

00:04:57.270  -->  00:05:02.520
If Elsin elses statements is that you should try to format your code so you can easily read it when

72

00:05:02.520  -->  00:05:04.740
you come back to it later on.

73

00:05:04.740  -->  00:05:10.280
The bracket notation and the Prince's notation actually allows us to write and indent this code.

74

00:05:10.290  -->  00:05:16.200
However we want so for a imagine we could have actually done something that looks like this end it will

75

00:05:16.200  -->  00:05:19.410
still run with no problems in other languages such as Python.

76

00:05:19.410  -->  00:05:24.690
Indentation is key to actually being able to execute your code here because of the curly brackets and

77

00:05:24.690  -->  00:05:25.700
the princes.

78

00:05:25.770  -->  00:05:27.900
It can be a little sloppy for code.

79

00:05:27.900  -->  00:05:32.250
Now that may lead to bad coding practices as far as formatting your code.

80

00:05:32.520  -->  00:05:38.190
So keep it in mind and try to always let our studio pick your parentheses placements or your curly bracket

81

00:05:38.220  -->  00:05:39.240
placements.

82

00:05:39.250  -->  00:05:46.440
Notice here this curly bracket the closing one lined up with the if statement which is nice.

83

00:05:46.470  -->  00:05:51.040
Now let's imagine we want to actually execute another block of code that occurs if the if statement

84

00:05:51.390  -->  00:05:57.090
isn't true meaning it's false because actually is an else statement as kind of a catchall for a bunch

85

00:05:57.090  -->  00:05:58.640
of if conditions that are true.

86

00:05:58.650  -->  00:06:03.620
We'll just put an L statement and go ahead and get rid of hot to make this a little more clear.

87

00:06:03.880  -->  00:06:06.900
We'll get rid of this last print statement and we'll get ahead.

88

00:06:07.000  -->  00:06:08.390
Get rid of hot here.

89

00:06:08.700  -->  00:06:16.260
So I'm going to go ahead is that temp equal to let's say 30 degrees and I'll say if temp is greater

90

00:06:16.260  -->  00:06:23.140
than 80 I will go ahead imprints hot outside.

91

00:06:24.330  -->  00:06:29.040
Now if I if that's not true I want to actually execute some code in this case I can use.

92

00:06:29.070  -->  00:06:34.820
Else I'll put in some curly brackets and then add another print statement.

93

00:06:35.100  -->  00:06:38.620
So I'll end up writing here is I will just say Prince

94

00:06:41.540  -->  00:06:49.120
Tim is not greater than 80.

95

00:06:49.120  -->  00:06:55.650
OK so if we go ahead and run this code we'll go in and clear the consul and run the code here.

96

00:06:55.710  -->  00:06:58.060
Note we get temp is not greater than 80.

97

00:06:58.220  -->  00:07:03.870
So because this if statement wasn't true then we had the else block of code execute and you line up

98

00:07:03.880  -->  00:07:10.950
your ELSE block with the closing bracket or curly bracket of the parents if statement that you're referring

99

00:07:10.950  -->  00:07:17.460
to when you say L's so we say if this is true execute this code block otherwise.

100

00:07:17.460  -->  00:07:21.220
Or else print this statement.

101

00:07:21.250  -->  00:07:28.350
Now the question arises What if we wanted more options to check for other than just if Or else that's

102

00:07:28.360  -->  00:07:32.130
where we can use the else if statement to add a multiple condition checks.

103

00:07:32.280  -->  00:07:35.770
And then finally we'll use else at the end to execute code.

104

00:07:35.790  -->  00:07:38.260
If none are conditions actually match up.

105

00:07:38.700  -->  00:07:41.560
Let's go ahead and see this in action.

106

00:07:41.620  -->  00:07:43.490
I'm going to go ahead and expand this.

107

00:07:43.530  -->  00:07:46.160
We're going to add some more lines of code here.

108

00:07:46.920  -->  00:07:50.840
They go in and delete line 1 get as much room we can.

109

00:07:51.120  -->  00:07:59.200
So I'll say if temp greater than 80 We're going to go ahead and say grant that it's hot outside let

110

00:07:59.190  -->  00:08:09.820
me go ahead and delete this Else line for now and I'll say ELSE IF and another condition and this condition

111

00:08:09.810  -->  00:08:23.610
I'm going to go ahead and pasan let's say temp less than 80 and Tim greater than 50 will actually go

112

00:08:23.620  -->  00:08:27.720
ahead and say equals.

113

00:08:27.780  -->  00:08:34.230
So if the temp is less than or equal to 80 or the temp and this attempt is greater than or equal to

114

00:08:34.240  -->  00:08:41.040
50 which is basically just to check if the temperature is between 80 degrees and 50 degrees inclusive

115

00:08:42.120  -->  00:08:47.300
then we have some curly brackets and I'm going to execute some code here or go ahead and just say print

116

00:08:50.520  -->  00:08:52.660
nice outside.

117

00:08:53.250  -->  00:08:56.690
We'll just have some arbitrary nice outside if it's the weather.

118

00:08:56.690  -->  00:08:58.400
2015 80 degrees.

119

00:08:58.840  -->  00:08:59.990
So now we have a check.

120

00:09:00.000  -->  00:09:03.940
If the temperature is greater than 80 degrees we're going to go ahead and say it's hot outside.

121

00:09:04.240  -->  00:09:09.970
Else if the temperatures in between 50 degrees and 80 degrees will print nice outside.

122

00:09:10.600  -->  00:09:14.930
And what I'm going to go ahead and do is just add an else statement which is going to be a catchall

123

00:09:14.970  -->  00:09:16.480
if that's not the case.

124

00:09:16.810  -->  00:09:20.570
And then I'm going to go ahead and print.

125

00:09:23.590  -->  00:09:31.620
It's less than 50 degrees outside so why am I able to print that.

126

00:09:31.840  -->  00:09:36.730
Well I know that if this statement wasn't true temperature great in the 80 degrees.

127

00:09:36.720  -->  00:09:42.750
And if these two statements weren't true equals or less than 80 greater than or equal to 50 then it's

128

00:09:42.750  -->  00:09:48.080
going to have to be less than 50 degrees outside in order for this statement to print.

129

00:09:48.180  -->  00:09:49.720
So let's go ahead and run this code

130

00:09:52.680  -->  00:09:55.020
and notice we get it's less than 50 degrees outside.

131

00:09:55.020  -->  00:10:01.620
When I set the temperature to 30 if I go ahead and set the temperature to 100 I should see hot outside

132

00:10:02.380  -->  00:10:03.150
run it.

133

00:10:03.150  -->  00:10:06.250
We do get hot outside and let's go ahead and have a nice day.

134

00:10:06.270  -->  00:10:07.730
75 degrees.

135

00:10:08.010  -->  00:10:11.110
Run the code and it's nice outside.

136

00:10:11.110  -->  00:10:11.890
Great.

137

00:10:11.910  -->  00:10:17.800
So that's how you can use an if else if an else statement in order to run your code with multiple conditional

138

00:10:17.790  -->  00:10:20.250
statements and you can actually keep tacking on.

139

00:10:20.250  -->  00:10:21.710
Else if statements.

140

00:10:22.020  -->  00:10:28.350
So for example let's say you wanted to have some sort of print statement if the temperature was exactly

141

00:10:28.920  -->  00:10:31.110
45 degrees.

142

00:10:31.120  -->  00:10:35.720
We can go ahead and add that in like this will say.

143

00:10:35.760  -->  00:10:42.420
Else if it's an equal to 45 Crantz

144

00:10:45.750  -->  00:10:56.650
exactly 45 degrees outside and then let's go ahead and put our statement back there.

145

00:10:56.640  -->  00:11:04.700
Now notice that if it's 45 degrees outside this will Prince this LCF of temp equal to 45 degrees but

146

00:11:04.700  -->  00:11:06.750
this L statement will no longer print.

147

00:11:06.780  -->  00:11:15.570
So this isn't exactly true anymore I would say it's less than 50 degrees outside and it's not exactly

148

00:11:16.750  -->  00:11:20.770
45 degrees.

149

00:11:20.760  -->  00:11:26.280
In order for that print statement to make sense let's go ahead and try running this with the sequel

150

00:11:26.280  -->  00:11:33.520
to 45 and boom we have exactly 45 degrees outside the splaying and our consul.

151

00:11:33.540  -->  00:11:34.070
OK.

152

00:11:34.230  -->  00:11:39.050
So those are the basic ways of using if else if and L statements in your code.

153

00:11:39.540  -->  00:11:45.030
Let's go ahead and just walk through one final simple example in order to fully understand how to use

154

00:11:45.030  -->  00:11:52.450
these statements and to go ahead and clear everything here and to go in and clear the consul and begin

155

00:11:52.440  -->  00:11:53.670
again.

156

00:11:53.670  -->  00:11:57.290
Let's go ahead and say imagine we're running a store and we have two items for sale.

157

00:11:57.340  -->  00:11:59.930
We have ham and cheese for sale.

158

00:11:59.970  -->  00:12:09.100
We'll go ahead and say we sold 10 items of ham and that we sold 10 packages of cheese.

159

00:12:09.450  -->  00:12:15.210
And then finally we also have a report that we're going to send to our headquarters whoever is running

160

00:12:15.220  -->  00:12:16.020
the store.

161

00:12:16.290  -->  00:12:22.440
And right now the report is blank and we're going to use conditional state or these if statements along

162

00:12:22.440  -->  00:12:36.270
with some conditions inside of them to send back a report will say if Hahm is greater than 10 and cheese

163

00:12:36.450  -->  00:12:38.070
is greater than or equal to 10

164

00:12:41.790  -->  00:12:49.900
we'll sign a report to be the strong strong sales of both ham and cheese.

165

00:12:49.920  -->  00:12:55.390
So just a silly example but briefly just reiterate you can use the if statements.

166

00:12:55.380  -->  00:13:01.300
Now if we don't have strong sales of ham and cheese we'll go ahead and put an else if.

167

00:13:02.040  -->  00:13:08.320
So I'll say Elspeth ambs equal to zero.

168

00:13:08.640  -->  00:13:13.340
And cheese is equal to zero.

169

00:13:14.790  -->  00:13:21.500
We'll assign a report to no sales today.

170

00:13:23.620  -->  00:13:29.860
And then finally going to have an L statements that just has clearly brackets here.

171

00:13:29.860  -->  00:13:35.590
Remember for those statements we don't put in the actual parentheses because else it's just a catchall

172

00:13:35.610  -->  00:13:35.930
.

173

00:13:36.000  -->  00:13:40.620
If none of these are actually true then finally we have some else block of code to execute.

174

00:13:40.750  -->  00:13:45.670
So we're not actually going to check for a condition on else which is why else goes directly to curly

175

00:13:45.660  -->  00:13:46.800
brackets.

176

00:13:46.920  -->  00:13:54.510
So USA else reports and assign it we sold something today

177

00:13:59.010  -->  00:14:02.100
because the first one checks if we had really strong sales.

178

00:14:02.110  -->  00:14:04.060
The second one checks we've had no sales.

179

00:14:04.170  -->  00:14:06.830
Otherwise we know we sold something.

180

00:14:06.850  -->  00:14:11.830
Let's go ahead and finally after all this is done print our report that we're going to send back to

181

00:14:11.820  -->  00:14:12.890
HQ.

182

00:14:13.380  -->  00:14:16.080
So we should have some sales today.

183

00:14:16.080  -->  00:14:18.330
We go ahead and run this.

184

00:14:18.330  -->  00:14:23.920
Notice that we had actually will go ahead and say strong sales both ham and cheese since we're checking

185

00:14:23.910  -->  00:14:27.670
for equality or greater than of ham and cheese 10.

186

00:14:28.080  -->  00:14:33.160
We go ahead and change these to let's say 5 and 5 and run this code.

187

00:14:33.270  -->  00:14:36.940
We sold something today if we didn't sell ham or cheese today.

188

00:14:36.930  -->  00:14:38.880
So 00 run this code.

189

00:14:38.970  -->  00:14:46.360
No sale say OK this is still a relatively simple example and it can be expanded upon right now.

190

00:14:46.380  -->  00:14:48.360
We just want to show how we can use if.

191

00:14:48.370  -->  00:14:54.210
Else in LCF along with some logical operators and slowly we're going to build up more complex tasks

192

00:14:54.390  -->  00:14:56.250
as this course progresses.

193

00:14:56.250  -->  00:14:56.830
Okay.

194

00:14:57.150  -->  00:14:59.160
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
