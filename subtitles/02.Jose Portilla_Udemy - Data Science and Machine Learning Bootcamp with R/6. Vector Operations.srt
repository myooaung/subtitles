00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:04,590
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on vector operations.

2

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:10,440
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio and learn how to work with actors and some basic operations.

3

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:15,750
OK so here we are our studio and what we're going to do is just perform some basic arithmetic with vectors

4

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:20,060
and do some other operations just to show you how they work within our.

5

00:00:20,170  -->  00:00:24,300
So are going to go ahead and start off by creating two vectors.

6

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:27,190
The first one is just going to be a numeric vector one to three.

7

00:00:27,210  -->  00:00:31,370
So use the combined function that see when to go ahead and aim at v1.

8

00:00:31,530  -->  00:00:33,570
And then I will assign the two.

9

00:00:33,640  -->  00:00:34,870
We're just going to say this once.

10

00:00:34,870  -->  00:00:36,320
Five six seven.

11

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:37,390
OK.

12

00:00:37,410  -->  00:00:38,900
So I have my two vectors.

13

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:41,310
Let's just go ahead and go over some basic arithmetic.

14

00:00:41,520  -->  00:00:46,670
So for basic arithmetic what you'll be doing is an element by element operation.

15

00:00:46,680  -->  00:00:53,190
And so what that means to say something like the one plus the two it's going to perform the operation

16

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:54,140
element by element.

17

00:00:54,150  -->  00:01:00,510
So you can see here that 6 is 5 plus 1 8 to 6 plus 2 and tennis 3 plus 7.

18

00:01:00,690  -->  00:01:02,950
And it's going to be the same for subtraction.

19

00:01:02,950  -->  00:01:05,890
So I could say something like V-1 minus 2.

20

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:13,720
Notice I just get all negative force I could do against the two might be one positive force.

21

00:01:13,800  -->  00:01:17,290
I can also multiply vectors element by element basis.

22

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:22,860
So the one times to Elby five times one six times two etc..

23

00:01:23,100  -->  00:01:27,530
You can also do subtraction which I showed earlier as well as division.

24

00:01:27,690  -->  00:01:31,390
So I could do the one divided by the two.

25

00:01:32,010  -->  00:01:34,920
And that's going to perform element by element division.

26

00:01:34,920  -->  00:01:39,690
Now let's move on to learn about some useful built in functions that are that we can use along with

27

00:01:39,690  -->  00:01:41,060
vectors.

28

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:46,610
So as we've seen before with functions you basically have the name of your function some parentheses

29

00:01:46,680  -->  00:01:48,480
and then you have some input.

30

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:54,450
So let's say you wanted to sum up all the elements in an American actor you can use the built in some

31

00:01:54,450  -->  00:01:55,860
function.

32

00:01:55,860  -->  00:01:59,810
So that will be su M and then you can just pass in your vector.

33

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:03,310
This case we have the one in all returned the sum for you.

34

00:02:03,430  -->  00:02:08,280
And if you wanted to you could actually assign the output to some sort of variable.

35

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:25,290
So we could make a variable called let's say some of the C and A that as some one looks enter.

36

00:02:25,980  -->  00:02:30,910
And now if we call some of that we get that six.

37

00:02:30,990  -->  00:02:32,840
So that's a useful builtin function.

38

00:02:32,850  -->  00:02:37,890
And now we're just going to show you a couple of more easeful built in functions for vector operations

39

00:02:37,910  -->  00:02:38,120
.

40

00:02:38,340  -->  00:02:40,830
So we've learned about some common function.

41

00:02:40,830  -->  00:02:50,910
You can also do things like check the mean of the vector loops the one they'll return the mean you can

42

00:02:50,910  -->  00:02:53,700
also do things like standard deviation.

43

00:02:53,820  -->  00:03:02,940
You can find the maximum elements in a vector as well as the minimum elements in a vector and you can

44

00:03:02,940  -->  00:03:10,320
do that or as built in operations in the last one I want to show you quickly is the ticket the product

45

00:03:10,410  -->  00:03:16,110
of all the elements in the vector which is Parodi which just returns all the product the product of

46

00:03:16,110  -->  00:03:17,940
all the elements in the vector.

47

00:03:17,940  -->  00:03:23,290
So one times two times story is short for V-2 as well to 10.

48

00:03:23,310  -->  00:03:25,550
So that's five times six steps seven.

49

00:03:25,590  -->  00:03:26,120
All right.

50

00:03:26,250  -->  00:03:30,140
So that's definitely not all the functions that are available that are built into our.

51

00:03:30,290  -->  00:03:34,110
There's just some that are going to be using over and over again don't worry too much about memorizing

52

00:03:34,110  -->  00:03:34,820
them now.

53

00:03:35,160  -->  00:03:40,890
They'll come up often throughout the course if you want a reference for all the functions that are available

54

00:03:40,890  -->  00:03:41,260
.

55

00:03:41,340  -->  00:03:51,450
You can go to the link Crann that are Dasch project or org slash doc slash contrib slash shorts ref

56

00:03:51,450  -->  00:03:52,930
card that PDA.

57

00:03:53,400  -->  00:03:58,980
This link is also available to you in the notes for this lecture or you can just google search for our

58

00:03:59,040  -->  00:04:03,120
reference card and this link should be in one of the top results.

59

00:04:03,120  -->  00:04:08,370
Again you can look up any sort of our built in functions reference and there's tons of cheat sheets

60

00:04:08,440  -->  00:04:14,430
online which are just nice reference cards for all the built in functions as we go throughout the course

61

00:04:14,460  -->  00:04:16,910
we'll be using the most common ones over and over again.

62

00:04:16,920  -->  00:04:19,890
So you probably will have to reference them too often.

63

00:04:19,890  -->  00:04:23,160
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
