00:00:01.320  -->  00:00:06.720
Hello everyone and welcome to a brief lecture on the course curriculum in this lecture I'm going to

2

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:10.700
be giving you just a bird's eye view of all the sections in this course.

3

00:00:11.100  -->  00:00:16.470
Well first start off by completing this section of the Course the course introduction section by talking

4

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:21.630
about briefly what is data science and then give me the link for the course frequently asked questions

5

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:22.330
.

6

00:00:22.440  -->  00:00:27.600
After that we'll talk about the Course best practices and learn the best way to approach this course

7

00:00:27.600  -->  00:00:27.810
.

8

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:32.740
Things such as how to get help in this course and then we'll discuss installation setup for this course

9

00:00:32.750  -->  00:00:32.930
.

10

00:00:33.240  -->  00:00:38.460
And there's different sections for Windows users Mac users or Linux users.

11

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:42.990
After that we'll finally get started if our programming by starting with the basics we'll learn about

12

00:00:42.990  -->  00:00:50.730
vectors matrices data frames and lists in our That will move on to topics such as data input and output

13

00:00:50.730  -->  00:00:56.660
in our will learn how to read a variety of file formats such as CS VI Excel sequel and even Web scraping

14

00:00:56.660  -->  00:00:58.070
of our.

15

00:00:58.830  -->  00:01:03.900
Then we'll get started by learning about actual programming with our things such as logical operators

16

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:03.990
.

17

00:01:03.990  -->  00:01:08.270
If Elsin else's statements while loops for loops and how to create functions.

18

00:01:08.520  -->  00:01:13.080
If you're already familiar with those ideas from another programming language you can just quickly reference

19

00:01:13.080  -->  00:01:15.120
the notebooks to grab the syntax.

20

00:01:15.120  -->  00:01:19.860
If you're completely new to computer programming will go over these topics step by step for you in the

21

00:01:19.860  -->  00:01:24.870
video lectures then will move on to data visualization.

22

00:01:24.930  -->  00:01:29.850
In this section of the Course learn how to create interactive visualizations and static visualizations

23

00:01:29.850  -->  00:01:34.170
when you plot to wonder what those topics will have.

24

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:40.980
Capstone projects a data visualization final project and then a capstone data project that will move

25

00:01:40.980  -->  00:01:45.930
onto the second half of the course which covers all the machine learning topics and will have an introduction

26

00:01:45.930  -->  00:01:51.500
to machine learning with our lecturer that will give an overview of that section of the course.

27

00:01:51.540  -->  00:01:52.120
All right.

28

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:54.910
That was a very brief discussion of the course curriculum.

29

00:01:54.960  -->  00:01:59.000
If you want the full curriculum you can always just check the course landing page.

30

00:01:59.010  -->  00:02:01.000
Thanks everyone and let's go ahead and get started.

31

00:02:00.990  -->  00:02:02.020
For the rest of the course
