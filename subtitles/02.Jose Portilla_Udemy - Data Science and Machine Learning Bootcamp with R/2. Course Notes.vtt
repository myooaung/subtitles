00:00:01.680  -->  00:00:06.810
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on the course notes and this lecture and discuss briefly how

2

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:13.020
to get the course notes and then give me a brief tour of the course notes themselves.

3

00:00:13.020  -->  00:00:15.950
Go ahead and check the resources section for this lecture.

4

00:00:16.020  -->  00:00:22.230
And you should be able to download a zip file the name of the zip file as our dash course that's ASTM

5

00:00:22.230  -->  00:00:24.140
l dash notes zip.

6

00:00:24.300  -->  00:00:31.490
Then go ahead and unzip or extract the files from that zip file and they should all be a group of HTL

7

00:00:31.500  -->  00:00:32.240
files.

8

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:35.160
You should see them organized by folders.

9

00:00:35.160  -->  00:00:38.250
Let me go ahead and show you what that looks like.

10

00:00:38.250  -->  00:00:42.500
All right well in the course you should see something like this that says resources available.

11

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:48.930
This will be a video but you'll click resources available and you'll see that course that Tim notes

12

00:00:48.940  -->  00:00:49.720
that it.

13

00:00:49.800  -->  00:00:52.900
Go ahead and click on it to begin downloading it.

14

00:00:53.610  -->  00:00:58.530
Once you've downloaded that file go ahead and extract the folders and files inside of it.

15

00:00:58.530  -->  00:01:01.150
I'm going to go ahead and jump to that now.

16

00:01:01.860  -->  00:01:02.130
All right.

17

00:01:02.130  -->  00:01:06.960
Here I am once you've extracted and unzipped the actual course.

18

00:01:07.140  -->  00:01:08.130
Him all notes.

19

00:01:08.130  -->  00:01:12.900
You'll get something that looks a little bit like this and you should see our for data science machine

20

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:13.670
learning.

21

00:01:13.680  -->  00:01:17.170
Go ahead and double click that folder and you'll see a variety of folders.

22

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:25.140
These folders contain the course notes and almost every single lecture in a video lecture has some notebook

23

00:01:25.320  -->  00:01:27.680
or notes associated with it.

24

00:01:27.900  -->  00:01:33.840
For instance we're going to start off with the basics of R and you'll go ahead and for the very first

25

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:41.040
section click basics of R and data types and you'll see our basics our data frames our list and our

26

00:01:41.040  -->  00:01:41.990
matrices.

27

00:01:42.090  -->  00:01:47.010
These four folders are going to cover the first sections of the course.

28

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:51.200
And that means you're going to go ahead and for the very first section click are basics.

29

00:01:51.210  -->  00:01:57.200
Now you should see a bunch of HVM files and the name of the files corresponds with the name of the lecturer

30

00:01:57.200  -->  00:01:57.750
.

31

00:01:57.810  -->  00:02:02.670
For instance if you're on the lecture called arithmetic with are the corresponding note book is also

32

00:02:02.670  -->  00:02:07.850
called arithmetic with R and if you ever have any trouble finding these you can go ahead and just post

33

00:02:07.870  -->  00:02:10.790
the Q&A forums and I'll help you find it.

34

00:02:11.430  -->  00:02:18.480
But then you can just double click on that T.M. file and you should see a pop up in your browser with

35

00:02:18.480  -->  00:02:23.700
that actual h tim l file and then you can zoom in and check out the arithmetic with R.

36

00:02:23.700  -->  00:02:28.500
This is a very basic lecture but essentially there's notes and then there's actual code and you can

37

00:02:28.500  -->  00:02:32.500
see that the code is in what is the little code cells here.

38

00:02:32.580  -->  00:02:36.300
And this is the code you can copy and paste into our studio.

39

00:02:36.300  -->  00:02:40.300
Let me go ahead and show you another example that's a little more complex.

40

00:02:40.350  -->  00:02:43.060
I'm going go ahead and jump back to the notes.

41

00:02:43.170  -->  00:02:43.400
All right.

42

00:02:43.410  -->  00:02:44.660
Here I am at the notes.

43

00:02:44.670  -->  00:02:49.680
Let's say you've continued on the course and now you're at the vector an indexing and slicing.

44

00:02:49.710  -->  00:02:55.860
Lecture again you just double click on this HVM Al file and I'll take you to the notes for that file

45

00:02:55.860  -->  00:02:56.110
.

46

00:02:56.190  -->  00:03:01.350
And you'll notice that these notes not only contain code but they also contain useful information that

47

00:03:01.350  -->  00:03:02.140
you can read.

48

00:03:02.400  -->  00:03:07.740
And it's basically explanations that supplement what I'm saying in the videos so you can always reference

49

00:03:07.740  -->  00:03:11.780
these notes in case you want more information than what's in the videos.

50

00:03:11.910  -->  00:03:16.260
And if you ever want the exact code that I put in the videos you can just copy and paste what's in the

51

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:18.250
cells into your console.

52

00:03:18.270  -->  00:03:25.740
In our studio something to note is that these cells assume that you're putting everything into the console

53

00:03:25.800  -->  00:03:27.710
not the script.

54

00:03:27.750  -->  00:03:32.850
Sometimes if you put stuff in the script you'll have to declare Prince and we'll go over that in a future

55

00:03:32.850  -->  00:03:33.610
lecture.

56

00:03:33.610  -->  00:03:40.080
But for now just keep in mind that if you paste this into your script code and run it and nothing happens

57

00:03:40.170  -->  00:03:44.120
it's probably because you don't have a print statement actually printing your results.

58

00:03:44.130  -->  00:03:47.600
For instance here I just say V-1 now will work in your console.

59

00:03:47.610  -->  00:03:53.640
But if you have it in your script you'll need to say print the one once you get to that section of the

60

00:03:53.640  -->  00:03:55.360
course you should be pretty comfortable with that.

61

00:03:55.560  -->  00:03:57.910
But go ahead and always post to the Q&A forums.

62

00:03:57.990  -->  00:03:59.970
If you have any questions on that.

63

00:04:00.480  -->  00:04:04.140
Now that we have an idea of what these notes actually look like let me go ahead and give you a brief

64

00:04:04.140  -->  00:04:06.470
tour of all the notes for the course.

65

00:04:06.510  -->  00:04:08.820
I'm going to go ahead and hop back to the notes.

66

00:04:09.330  -->  00:04:09.730
OK.

67

00:04:09.780  -->  00:04:12.510
Here's the entire repository of notes.

68

00:04:12.510  -->  00:04:16.890
You'll notice we have basics of our and data types that's going to be the very first section you encounter

69

00:04:16.890  -->  00:04:17.310
.

70

00:04:17.310  -->  00:04:21.350
So go ahead and just start off by looking at the notes here.

71

00:04:21.390  -->  00:04:26.500
You'll serve our basics and then move on to things such as our matrices and here are the lectures for

72

00:04:26.500  -->  00:04:28.140
the matrices section.

73

00:04:28.380  -->  00:04:35.100
Then you move on to the data frames and then you also move on to the lists once you finished the basics

74

00:04:35.100  -->  00:04:36.380
of r.

75

00:04:36.480  -->  00:04:40.140
You may have some training exercises that show up during that section of the course.

76

00:04:40.410  -->  00:04:45.300
All training exercises are located under the training exercises folder.

77

00:04:45.300  -->  00:04:46.850
That means no matter what section you're in.

78

00:04:46.860  -->  00:04:52.500
Even if it's machine learning or data visualization or basics of our program and our if you ever encounter

79

00:04:52.500  -->  00:04:58.770
a training exercise you can find that easily by going to your training exercises folder and then you'll

80

00:04:58.770  -->  00:05:03.210
see capstone and date of his project's exercises.

81

00:05:03.240  -->  00:05:08.150
Exercise solutions and machine learning projects for now at the beginning of the course.

82

00:05:08.160  -->  00:05:10.350
You only have training exercises.

83

00:05:10.350  -->  00:05:13.140
You'll go ahead and click on one of these exercises.

84

00:05:13.230  -->  00:05:16.890
For instance the first one you'll get is the basics exercise.

85

00:05:16.890  -->  00:05:21.190
Go ahead and click on that are basics exercise and you'll see something that looks like this.

86

00:05:21.320  -->  00:05:24.810
And essentially this exercise just has a bunch of questions for you to answer.

87

00:05:24.810  -->  00:05:29.850
And before every exercise I give you a brief introduction to what I actually expect for you to do for

88

00:05:29.850  -->  00:05:30.940
the exercise.

89

00:05:30.960  -->  00:05:34.400
You'll go ahead and answer these questions in our studio.

90

00:05:34.740  -->  00:05:40.560
Now all the exercises in this course are self-created and that means there are solutions for the exercise

91

00:05:40.560  -->  00:05:40.830
.

92

00:05:41.070  -->  00:05:45.960
Going back to the actual notes you were back at the exercise notes.

93

00:05:46.020  -->  00:05:51.870
If you want the solutions you just go back one click exercises that solutions and you'll see solutions

94

00:05:51.900  -->  00:05:57.840
for all the training exercises and that covers the exercises for basically the first half of the course

95

00:05:57.840  -->  00:05:59.820
.

96

00:06:00.870  -->  00:06:05.160
Going back to training exercise once you finished the first half of the Course will start approaching

97

00:06:05.460  -->  00:06:11.190
the capstone project and the data visualization project that's located under the capstone and date of

98

00:06:11.190  -->  00:06:12.990
his projects folder.

99

00:06:12.990  -->  00:06:14.380
Go ahead and click on it.

100

00:06:14.490  -->  00:06:20.820
You can click on the capstone project and see Moneyball project that will be working with the folder

101

00:06:20.910  -->  00:06:22.210
or the html file right.

102

00:06:22.230  -->  00:06:25.440
Therefore as well as the data that's relevant to that.

103

00:06:25.440  -->  00:06:30.000
Again we always show an introduction to the projects and that means if you ever confused on anything

104

00:06:30.030  -->  00:06:37.140
and just reference the intro to the cap some project lecture and then for the data visualization project

105

00:06:37.230  -->  00:06:40.190
again you can reference that here.

106

00:06:40.860  -->  00:06:43.490
Living along you'll also machine learning projects.

107

00:06:43.500  -->  00:06:46.600
I'll review all this information when you actually get to the machine learning section.

108

00:06:46.800  -->  00:06:51.360
But if you're looking for the M-L or a machine learning projects you'll just click under training exercises

109

00:06:51.840  -->  00:06:57.300
machine learning projects and then there's project assignments and solutions as well as the V files

110

00:06:57.300  -->  00:06:59.570
for the data for those machine learning projects.

111

00:06:59.580  -->  00:07:05.340
I'll go over all this information again when we actually get to that second half of the course but for

112

00:07:05.340  -->  00:07:10.980
now which you should just be worried about is being able to find that zip file unzip it and accessing

113

00:07:10.980  -->  00:07:16.230
the basics of our and data types and then go into the relevant section for you.

114

00:07:16.500  -->  00:07:19.680
Then you'll keep moving on to things such as data input and output.

115

00:07:19.680  -->  00:07:22.650
There are some example files for here you as well.

116

00:07:22.650  -->  00:07:27.760
Then there's programming are things such as for loops functions etc..

117

00:07:27.780  -->  00:07:29.500
Advanced Programming.

118

00:07:30.000  -->  00:07:35.460
Then there's also data manipulation which is that the guide to the plier tidy or pipe operation data

119

00:07:35.460  -->  00:07:38.860
visualization has all these plots for you as well as a cheat sheet.

120

00:07:38.920  -->  00:07:40.370
You can check out later.

121

00:07:40.740  -->  00:07:46.950
And then there's interactive data visualisation and program with are all right if you're ever confused

122

00:07:46.950  -->  00:07:49.560
on any of this or you're having trouble unzipping the file.

123

00:07:49.560  -->  00:07:54.480
Go ahead and just post the Kunin forms and the other students and I are happy to help out for any questions

124

00:07:54.480  -->  00:07:56.040
you may have.

125

00:07:56.040  -->  00:07:58.320
All right thanks everyone.

126

00:07:58.320  -->  00:07:59.950
And one more notes.

127

00:07:59.970  -->  00:08:04.910
A lot of people wonder why do we choose h t m l files instead of PDA files.

128

00:08:05.220  -->  00:08:10.860
Well the reason for that is that pedia files will sometimes tend to cut off code if the code is too

129

00:08:10.860  -->  00:08:17.460
long and with HCM l files you can see the entire cell of code no matter how long that particular line

130

00:08:17.460  -->  00:08:21.600
of code was and that's why we chose HVM l files for this course.

131

00:08:21.840  -->  00:08:27.930
If you prefer PDA files you can just google search HVM else to PTF converters and convert all these

132

00:08:27.930  -->  00:08:31.480
ASTM el files to Piaf's if that's easier for you to print out.

133

00:08:31.530  -->  00:08:36.750
Although if you just open this in your browser such as while loops you should be able to just right

134

00:08:36.750  -->  00:08:40.260
click and then select print and print out this file.

135

00:08:40.260  -->  00:08:45.360
But again the reason I chose html files is that a PDA files is that if this particular line of code

136

00:08:45.390  -->  00:08:51.390
is very long the PDA will have a cut off that's smaller than the HTL file and the H-2A metafile will

137

00:08:51.390  -->  00:08:54.490
be able to display everything OK.

138

00:08:54.840  -->  00:08:57.850
Again post the Q&A If you're confused on any of that.

139

00:08:57.930  -->  00:09:00.460
But thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
