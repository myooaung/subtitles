1

00:00:00,750  -->  00:00:03,670
This video it's continued from part one.

2

00:00:03,810  -->  00:00:04,450
Right.

3

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:07,360
So moving on it's starting to look pretty similar.

4

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:09,690
But there's a couple of things we're still missing.

5

00:00:09,690  -->  00:00:15,210
First off we need to add labels and we've actually never shown how to add labels before.

6

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:19,130
So the instructions say we can use GMAT score text.

7

00:00:19,170  -->  00:00:29,280
Let's go ahead and just try that going to go ahead and say peel three is peel two plus underscore text

8

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:31,820
and then for text.

9

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:33,870
If I go ahead and pass it it helps.

10

00:00:33,870  -->  00:00:38,370
Hopefully you are able to do this by checking out help.

11

00:00:38,520  -->  00:00:42,360
You can say GMAT score text will search for that.

12

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:45,420
And notice we get some textual annotations.

13

00:00:45,420  -->  00:00:48,860
So basically what this does is adds text directly to the plot.

14

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:54,690
And part of the project is free to figure out how to do these additional things because there's tons

15

00:00:54,690  -->  00:00:58,740
of plots tight plot types and we're not built to go over all of them in this course.

16

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:04,110
But what I want you to have is the skills to look these kind of functions up either in the documentation

17

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:08,400
or what's really helpful is that cheat sheet we showed earlier and figure out how to do this by just

18

00:01:08,400  -->  00:01:14,400
reading the documentation because that's a key skill to using our for programming is being able to search

19

00:01:14,460  -->  00:01:19,110
either Google or stack overflow or the documentation to figure out how to do something that you haven't

20

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:21,080
actually seen before.

21

00:01:21,270  -->  00:01:26,940
This case we're going to use GM underscore text and what we need to do is add a label to this.

22

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:32,310
So after reading documentation scrolling down and just seeing these examples hopefully we can begin

23

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:38,220
to tell that you need to just add some sort of label to this so if we just run this by itself no what

24

00:01:38,220  -->  00:01:42,570
will happen if we just say print all three and we run this.

25

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:46,740
You'll see that we require the following aesthetics that are missing label.

26

00:01:46,770  -->  00:01:49,410
So we actually say what's the actual label which makes sense.

27

00:01:49,410  -->  00:01:51,720
Otherwise we don't know what we should be plotting.

28

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:55,380
So I'll say yes label equals.

29

00:01:55,380  -->  00:02:00,720
And in this case if we take a look at our data frame head of the if we have a couple of labels we can

30

00:02:00,720  -->  00:02:06,710
either label things by the country or HDI rank HDI CPI region and the actual text.

31

00:02:06,720  -->  00:02:11,330
I want looking back that economists plot it was the name of the country.

32

00:02:11,400  -->  00:02:14,900
So let's go ahead and put in country as a label.

33

00:02:15,180  -->  00:02:21,660
So this actual argument should feel really similar to when we added things like color by region and

34

00:02:21,660  -->  00:02:24,340
another geometry late layer.

35

00:02:24,420  -->  00:02:30,000
This case we're just assigning the static of the data we're going is this case it's a label for geometers

36

00:02:30,000  -->  00:02:31,920
cortex as the country.

37

00:02:32,070  -->  00:02:36,420
And now if I run this I should get a bunch of country labels.

38

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:36,910
All right.

39

00:02:37,140  -->  00:02:42,960
So that's good except there are way too many labels and it shows in the instructions that there should

40

00:02:42,960  -->  00:02:50,110
be way too many labels in order to minimize or get rid of some of these labels that we don't need.

41

00:02:50,340  -->  00:02:53,470
We want to select a subset.

42

00:02:54,240  -->  00:02:58,860
I'm going to go ahead and jump quickly to the notebook for this so I can show you on I'm referencing

43

00:02:59,580  -->  00:03:05,100
but if we take a look at the notebook going to bring in screen now notice you actually given the code

44

00:03:05,100  -->  00:03:08,600
in order to grab this subset it's going to go in and copy this.

45

00:03:08,610  -->  00:03:11,380
But I want just to show you what it's actually doing.

46

00:03:11,390  -->  00:03:16,110
This case we created vector of the points to label and this is what would take a long time actually

47

00:03:16,170  -->  00:03:17,750
making this vector name.

48

00:03:17,760  -->  00:03:21,990
So it's already done for you you don't need to waste your time on that and essentially just add them

49

00:03:21,990  -->  00:03:25,470
in as additional arguments to this GM underscore text.

50

00:03:25,500  -->  00:03:29,160
So I set some color this case I said kind of a darker gray.

51

00:03:29,220  -->  00:03:34,530
You can just set it as black if you want and we say data equals and we're using that subset command

52

00:03:34,550  -->  00:03:34,760
.

53

00:03:34,980  -->  00:03:42,630
So we say subset past year data and we're going to use this in operator and the operator looks similar

54

00:03:42,660  -->  00:03:43,880
to a pipe operator.

55

00:03:43,890  -->  00:03:49,580
But what it does is it just checks if a certain value is in a vector.

56

00:03:49,590  -->  00:03:51,740
So in this case I'm going to say this.

57

00:03:51,750  -->  00:03:54,810
I mean go ahead and zoom in so I can fully explain this.

58

00:03:55,030  -->  00:03:58,530
I say GM underscore text where my label is equal to my country.

59

00:03:58,530  -->  00:03:59,970
We've done that so far.

60

00:03:59,970  -->  00:04:08,190
I set the color to just some dark gray and then I say data of this actual labeling is equal to the subset

61

00:04:08,370  -->  00:04:15,000
of my data frame where the country is in these points to label here.

62

00:04:15,030  -->  00:04:20,700
So just checking if it's in there and there's additional argument check underscore overlap because true

63

00:04:20,920  -->  00:04:26,010
will try to automatically make sure that these text points don't overlap with each other.

64

00:04:26,010  -->  00:04:31,180
So I want to go ahead and copy this and then put it into my code.

65

00:04:31,560  -->  00:04:36,180
So the reason that's there in the notebook for you is because it's a lot of typing and it's stuff that

66

00:04:36,240  -->  00:04:40,870
you would just kind of have to take a lot of time to look up which is why I labeled it for you.

67

00:04:40,870  -->  00:04:45,450
So let me go and paste that in.

68

00:04:45,870  -->  00:04:48,430
All right so we have this big ugly vector.

69

00:04:48,430  -->  00:04:49,720
Let me go ahead and expand this.

70

00:04:49,720  -->  00:04:52,420
We can work with this and then will shrink it down again.

71

00:04:53,100  -->  00:04:53,530
All right.

72

00:04:53,650  -->  00:04:57,460
So how many points to label vector which is kind of this large ugly vector.

73

00:04:57,730  -->  00:05:03,790
I'm going to go ahead and cut this and just put it here at the top so we don't really have to worry

74

00:05:03,790  -->  00:05:05,040
about it that much.

75

00:05:05,560  -->  00:05:11,260
And we really want to do is worry about this geom underscored text which is again just adding in that

76

00:05:11,250  -->  00:05:16,920
label because one country and then taking the subset where the country name is in these points to label

77

00:05:17,070  -->  00:05:18,970
.

78

00:05:19,490  -->  00:05:19,940
Right.

79

00:05:20,140  -->  00:05:24,090
And I know we didn't specifically cover this in our previous lectures.

80

00:05:24,100  -->  00:05:29,230
Reason being just kind of this very specific action we have to take to try to make our plot look as

81

00:05:29,230  -->  00:05:31,570
close as we can to The Economist.

82

00:05:32,050  -->  00:05:36,880
So let me go ahead and say print t l 3.

83

00:05:37,210  -->  00:05:37,680
Let me run.

84

00:05:37,690  -->  00:05:39,550
That's an resizes windows.

85

00:05:39,580  -->  00:05:41,390
We can actually see the output of the plot.

86

00:05:41,750  -->  00:05:50,020
So order to resize that make or cancel small so we're not really using it and then control shift as

87

00:05:50,050  -->  00:05:50,890
to run this.

88

00:05:50,920  -->  00:05:57,900
And it looks like we have our plots or plot is starting to look more and more like the actual plot from

89

00:05:57,910  -->  00:05:59,520
the Economist.

90

00:05:59,530  -->  00:05:59,880
OK.

91

00:05:59,920  -->  00:06:02,650
We'll go ahead and continue moving on.

92

00:06:02,650  -->  00:06:08,230
So now that we have that it's still not exactly like the economists plot is almost good enough for the

93

00:06:08,240  -->  00:06:09,080
assignment really.

94

00:06:09,100  -->  00:06:12,010
But what we want to do is just add in some themes.

95

00:06:12,040  -->  00:06:17,110
So in this case I'm going to take advantage of the Gee-Gee themes library we've played with a little

96

00:06:17,110  -->  00:06:18,140
bit earlier.

97

00:06:18,610  -->  00:06:24,940
So G-G themes in I'm going to just run that line so that I can grab the themes later and I'm going to

98

00:06:24,940  -->  00:06:32,590
add a layer to this on a theme underscore and there's actually a white economist theme so that makes

99

00:06:32,590  -->  00:06:33,960
her job a lot easier.

100

00:06:34,120  -->  00:06:38,500
But you can actually just play around with the themes decide what looks best for you but really at this

101

00:06:38,500  -->  00:06:43,120
point it's just playing around this trying to make it look nice you can add a title master of the X

102

00:06:43,330  -->  00:06:45,200
or Y labels et cetera.

103

00:06:45,460  -->  00:06:52,710
But if we just run this line we go something that looks pretty similar to the Economist plot.

104

00:06:53,650  -->  00:06:59,770
So we have a plot that looks very similar to the Economist's plot in what I'm going to do is add one

105

00:06:59,760  -->  00:07:03,590
more argument to change this x axis.

106

00:07:03,940  -->  00:07:08,020
And again you don't have to do this you can pretty much go either as far as little as you want.

107

00:07:08,010  -->  00:07:12,510
In this plotting exercise usually not going to be trying to copy a plot from the Internet.

108

00:07:12,510  -->  00:07:16,250
Hopefully you're going to be making your own original plots.

109

00:07:16,330  -->  00:07:23,370
Let's go ahead and explore how we would just fix the x axis in order to make it go from zero to 10.

110

00:07:23,370  -->  00:07:30,040
Like it did it that economists plot to go ahead and expand this and I'm going to go ahead and say peel

111

00:07:31,750  -->  00:07:35,410
four and assign it to all three.

112

00:07:35,880  -->  00:07:39,950
And I'm going to go ahead and add a co-ordinates lair or some sort of scale layer.

113

00:07:40,060  -->  00:07:48,040
And the argument for this is scale underscore X underscore continuous and these sort of arguments for

114

00:07:48,040  -->  00:07:51,200
additional coordinates are Fassett values etc..

115

00:07:51,430  -->  00:07:56,140
You're pretty much going to have to be looking these up as you go along or referencing that cheat sheet

116

00:07:56,130  -->  00:07:57,300
that we showed earlier.

117

00:07:57,490  -->  00:08:03,730
A lot of the process of using G-G plot beyond just the basics that we've covered as far as that data

118

00:08:03,730  -->  00:08:09,780
layer aesthetics layer geometry layer is just looking things up or looking up examples and maybe some

119

00:08:09,790  -->  00:08:13,130
sort of cookbook which are available on the Internet as well.

120

00:08:13,240  -->  00:08:18,610
And then just seeing what formulas you have to follow this case I looked it up in the documentation

121

00:08:18,610  -->  00:08:18,640
.

122

00:08:18,630  -->  00:08:21,830
And how do you scale underscore X underscore continuous.

123

00:08:21,880  -->  00:08:25,880
This is the sort of thing that I wouldn't expect you to know right off the top of your head unless you

124

00:08:25,900  -->  00:08:28,360
using GZA plot a lot.

125

00:08:28,360  -->  00:08:34,870
So let's go ahead and set our limits equal to in this case.

126

00:08:34,870  -->  00:08:38,080
I want to go from point nine to ten point five.

127

00:08:38,160  -->  00:08:41,920
So a little less than 1 and a little more than ten.

128

00:08:42,220  -->  00:08:48,500
And in that case I can add breaks which just sets the actual breaks.

129

00:08:48,610  -->  00:08:51,300
So where that the dashes actually belong.

130

00:08:51,310  -->  00:08:55,030
So my dash set one two three four five six seven eight nine ten.

131

00:08:55,240  -->  00:08:59,850
And that's the reason why I had to set the limits a little less than one and a little more than 10.

132

00:08:59,880  -->  00:09:06,850
Let me go ahead and then say Prince P.L. for run this zoom on this.

133

00:09:06,850  -->  00:09:13,470
And now we get something that has the same x axis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

134

00:09:13,510  -->  00:09:14,350
OK.

135

00:09:14,560  -->  00:09:25,290
And again I can add a theme to this so I can just say Crantz four plus theme underscore economists why

136

00:09:25,380  -->  00:09:30,640
to try to make it look even more like that economists plot.

137

00:09:30,660  -->  00:09:31,060
All right.

138

00:09:31,060  -->  00:09:34,030
So again just go ahead and play of the solutions.

139

00:09:34,030  -->  00:09:39,460
You can go as like as mentioned before either as little or as far as you want with this sort of plotting

140

00:09:39,460  -->  00:09:39,670
.

141

00:09:39,730  -->  00:09:47,070
The main idea is just to get you used to adding a data unaesthetic Slayer and geometry layers.

142

00:09:47,080  -->  00:09:52,390
Well I would expect you to have been able to do by yourself without really referencing anything.

143

00:09:52,380  -->  00:09:58,700
Is this data layer and knowing geometry underscore or geometer score point layer then I would expect

144

00:09:58,710  -->  00:10:05,080
to you have been able to call GM underscore smooth but maybe not have figured out how to do this method

145

00:10:05,080  -->  00:10:05,940
of formula.

146

00:10:06,120  -->  00:10:11,760
E color this stuff is more related to linear regression in general not the actual plotting the vice

147

00:10:11,760  -->  00:10:12,210
.

148

00:10:12,220  -->  00:10:18,540
So as long as you are able to figure out hey I can make a data and layer I can add my points and I can

149

00:10:18,550  -->  00:10:20,080
add a smooth fit curve.

150

00:10:20,230  -->  00:10:24,860
Then you should have been more than enough good as far as this project is concerned.

151

00:10:24,970  -->  00:10:30,890
The rest of this is just icing to make it look as similar as possible to that economists plot.

152

00:10:31,270  -->  00:10:31,810
All right.

153

00:10:32,050  -->  00:10:36,790
Hopefully that was interesting for everyone being able to recreate a plot you see on the Internet just

154

00:10:36,790  -->  00:10:38,040
using G-G plot.

155

00:10:38,230  -->  00:10:44,170
And the main idea of this project is to reiterate just how powerful G-G plot is and its customization

156

00:10:44,160  -->  00:10:45,280
abilities.

157

00:10:45,280  -->  00:10:48,130
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
