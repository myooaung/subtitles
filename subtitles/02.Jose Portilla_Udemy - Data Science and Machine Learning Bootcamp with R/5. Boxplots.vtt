00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:05.720
Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on box blocks in this lecture room to learn how to use our G.G.

2

00:00:05.880  -->  00:00:09.770
plot to in order to GraphicLy the picked a box plot.

3

00:00:10.020  -->  00:00:12.720
Let's go out and jump to our studio and see how it all works.

4

00:00:12.970  -->  00:00:15.080
OK so here we are in our studio.

5

00:00:15.080  -->  00:00:19.300
We're going to go ahead and start my script by saying library of G-G plot two.

6

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:25.410
And then I will assign the empty cars data set to a variable d f.

7

00:00:25.920  -->  00:00:29.100
Let's go ahead and check the head of empty cars.

8

00:00:29.100  -->  00:00:34.530
We can get a reminder what it looks like but hopefully you've worked that enough by now that you kind

9

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:38.790
of have a sense and idea that it's just a bunch of cars and some data about those cars.

10

00:00:39.090  -->  00:00:44.760
So let's go ahead and use G-G plot to create a box plot of the information here.

11

00:00:44.760  -->  00:00:50.610
So the box plot essentially just a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data

12

00:00:50.910  -->  00:00:53.120
through their core tile information.

13

00:00:53.220  -->  00:00:58.410
So Box plots Mail have lines extending vertically from those boxes which are usually called the whiskers

14

00:00:58.800  -->  00:01:03.810
which indicate the variability outside the upper and lower court tiles.

15

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:08.860
And that's where the term box in a whisker plot's or box whisker diagram comes from.

16

00:01:09.060  -->  00:01:13.200
And outliers may be plotted as individual points.

17

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:15.980
So let's go ahead and start a fire data layer.

18

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:22.550
So we'll go ahead and say geez you plot pass in our data which is DMF.

19

00:01:23.070  -->  00:01:29.250
And then what we want to do is pass in our æsthetics information.

20

00:01:29.520  -->  00:01:35.220
And so for this particular box plot what I'm going to go ahead and say is æsthetics and then pass in

21

00:01:35.250  -->  00:01:37.530
are x and y information.

22

00:01:37.770  -->  00:01:43.530
I'm first going to show you an example of a typical mistake when dealing with box plots and how we can

23

00:01:43.530  -->  00:01:44.520
correct it.

24

00:01:45.000  -->  00:01:50.160
So you may just say X is cylinder's and Y is mpg for a box plot.

25

00:01:50.160  -->  00:01:57.230
We'll go ahead and sign that to people and then we'll go in and say Prince P.L. plus air geometry for

26

00:01:57.280  -->  00:02:01.540
box plot as you may have guessed is just Jiya underscore box plot.

27

00:02:01.890  -->  00:02:05.490
Let's go ahead and see what happens when we print this out.

28

00:02:05.490  -->  00:02:08.900
We'll get a mistake and I'll explain it once we see it.

29

00:02:09.700  -->  00:02:10.450
OK.

30

00:02:10.620  -->  00:02:15.430
So if we just go in and zoom in on this box plot we can already see what the air looks like.

31

00:02:15.630  -->  00:02:20.670
We've created one box plot for what should have been several categories.

32

00:02:20.670  -->  00:02:22.960
And these are lined up just on six cylinder.

33

00:02:23.190  -->  00:02:25.150
And you'll notice we get a warning message.

34

00:02:25.170  -->  00:02:30.990
It says continuous X aesthetic and then it tells you that you forget to group them somehow or Factor

35

00:02:30.990  -->  00:02:33.030
them etc..

36

00:02:33.030  -->  00:02:39.690
So the reason this showing up is because box plots on the x axis need to have a categorical variable

37

00:02:39.960  -->  00:02:42.570
meaning it shouldn't be some continuous value.

38

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:51.870
So we'll have to do here as we've done before in other instances is factor the cylinder column value

39

00:02:51.870  -->  00:02:52.380
.

40

00:02:52.380  -->  00:02:57.270
And then if we go ahead and run the source we get the box plot we were expecting which looks something

41

00:02:57.270  -->  00:02:59.270
like this.

42

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:01.500
So what does this box plot actually represent.

43

00:03:01.500  -->  00:03:07.080
You may be wondering Well box and whisker plots are sometimes called are uniform in their use of the

44

00:03:07.080  -->  00:03:07.990
box.

45

00:03:08.010  -->  00:03:14.130
So the bottom and the top of the box are always the first and third quart tiles and the band inside

46

00:03:14.130  -->  00:03:14.790
the box.

47

00:03:14.790  -->  00:03:21.150
Always that second quart tile which is essentially the median of that data the ends of the whiskers

48

00:03:21.150  -->  00:03:26.640
However sometimes represent different possible alternative values sometimes represent standard deviation

49

00:03:26.970  -->  00:03:28.980
or the minimum maximum of all the data.

50

00:03:29.160  -->  00:03:36.180
In this case they represent 1.5 times the inter quarter mile range of the lower and upper core tiles

51

00:03:36.180  -->  00:03:38.250
depending on what side of the box they're on.

52

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:44.010
If you're not familiar of these concepts of the box plot they're commonly used for stock information

53

00:03:44.040  -->  00:03:45.420
as far as stock pricing.

54

00:03:45.690  -->  00:03:51.240
But I recommend you go ahead and check out the Wikipedia page of box plots to find out more about box

55

00:03:51.240  -->  00:03:54.010
plots how to read them and how to use them effectively.

56

00:03:54.210  -->  00:03:58.960
In this case for this lecture we're just going to show you how to actually create box plots.

57

00:03:58.960  -->  00:04:02.850
And then finally you can see all the way on Factor cylinder 8.

58

00:04:02.880  -->  00:04:05.000
So the cars of eight cylinders.

59

00:04:05.040  -->  00:04:07.560
Those two points those are outlier points.

60

00:04:07.560  -->  00:04:09.300
So Box plots are nice.

61

00:04:09.330  -->  00:04:15.080
The tect how many outliers you have in your data quickly and effectively through a visualization.

62

00:04:15.600  -->  00:04:21.960
Since box plots already have so much statistical information inside of them just based off the way the

63

00:04:21.960  -->  00:04:23.940
visualization is constructed.

64

00:04:23.940  -->  00:04:29.640
I would recommend that you don't add too many more layers besides a theme or messing around the coordinates

65

00:04:29.640  -->  00:04:35.710
of your box plot or otherwise you may oversaturate your visualization with too much information.

66

00:04:35.710  -->  00:04:41.230
Or go ahead and show you some common use cases with other layers of box plots.

67

00:04:41.250  -->  00:04:47.220
Sometimes you want to flip the coordinates of your box plots to have them be horizontal instead of vertical

68

00:04:47.690  -->  00:04:50.490
and you can do that by just adding in another layer.

69

00:04:50.490  -->  00:04:57.670
In this case is a coordinate layer and you'll say Kord underscore Phlip close Prince.

70

00:04:57.690  -->  00:05:01.140
And this will essentially as you might expect flip the coordinates.

71

00:05:01.140  -->  00:05:09.650
So if we see this plot we see that the coordinates have been flipped in other common use case for an

72

00:05:09.660  -->  00:05:10.560
additional layer.

73

00:05:10.590  -->  00:05:16.590
Arguments is in the geometry layer of geometer square box plots sometimes you want to color these box

74

00:05:16.590  -->  00:05:25.170
plus box plots based off a factor of the actual x or y axis you're plotting on.

75

00:05:25.170  -->  00:05:31.560
So in order to do that we can go ahead and do for a normal color we would say something like Phil blue

76

00:05:31.580  -->  00:05:31.810
.

77

00:05:31.980  -->  00:05:37.380
So if I run this the box plots will be filled blue but usually you probably want to actually fill based

78

00:05:37.380  -->  00:05:38.540
off another column.

79

00:05:38.820  -->  00:05:45.420
So remember if we're trying to make a fill shape or size or one of those geometry features based off

80

00:05:45.420  -->  00:05:52.200
another column of our data or data frame we have to pass it into the ABS argument function inside of

81

00:05:52.380  -->  00:05:54.070
the geometry layer.

82

00:05:54.330  -->  00:06:01.630
So here we're going to say abs where fill is equal to factor and in this case we'll just go ahead and

83

00:06:01.630  -->  00:06:02.470
say cylinder.

84

00:06:02.490  -->  00:06:05.520
So we'll get one separate color for each cylinder.

85

00:06:05.520  -->  00:06:07.830
Let me go out to make sure that currencies are balanced.

86

00:06:07.830  -->  00:06:09.390
Looks like they are going to run this.

87

00:06:09.390  -->  00:06:10.740
Make sure it works.

88

00:06:10.800  -->  00:06:12.320
And there we have it.

89

00:06:12.390  -->  00:06:17.940
So we have a separate color for each cylinder and a nice little legend that automatically pops up here

90

00:06:18.640  -->  00:06:24.030
and again as always you can just go ahead and add a theme layer if you want it to.

91

00:06:24.030  -->  00:06:29.260
So for instance I could say theme and we have some themes to choose from here.

92

00:06:29.280  -->  00:06:31.110
We'll go on as you say dark.

93

00:06:31.170  -->  00:06:36.210
It's going to run that and I have a dark background and you can go to mess around and play with these

94

00:06:36.210  -->  00:06:36.740
themes.

95

00:06:36.750  -->  00:06:42.210
And later on I'll have a lecture on how to actually download more things as far as box plots though

96

00:06:42.220  -->  00:06:42.260
.

97

00:06:42.300  -->  00:06:44.630
That's really all there is to it.

98

00:06:44.700  -->  00:06:48.290
The lecture assumes you already know what box plots are and how to use them.

99

00:06:48.340  -->  00:06:53.190
Vido I'd definitely recommend checking out the Wikipedia page for box plots to get some more background

100

00:06:53.190  -->  00:06:57.030
information how to read them and how to accurately use them.

101

00:06:57.030  -->  00:06:58.890
All right that's it for this lecture.

102

00:06:58.890  -->  00:06:59.960
Hope you enjoyed it.

103

00:06:59.970  -->  00:07:00.460
Thanks.

104

00:07:00.490  -->  00:07:01.670
And I'll see the next one.
