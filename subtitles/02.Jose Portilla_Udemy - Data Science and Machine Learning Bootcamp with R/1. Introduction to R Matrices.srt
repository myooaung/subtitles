Hello everyone and welcome to the our major c section of this course.

2

00:00:09,870  -->  00:00:14,850
Now that you've learned about the basic data types and R and vector basics and then your first basic

3

00:00:14,850  -->  00:00:19,710
training exercise you're ready to expand the level up your knowledge and are and start learning about

4

00:00:19,710  -->  00:00:25,470
are matrices aren't matrices are going to allow us to store data to that mentioned really and they will

5

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:28,470
be the stepping stone to learning about our data frames.

6

00:00:28,770  -->  00:00:33,390
In this section of course we'll learn how to create a matrix perform operations and arithmetic using

7

00:00:33,390  -->  00:00:39,360
matrices then we'll learn how to select an index data from the Matrix we'll learn how to make matrices

8

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:44,400
into categorical matrices through the factor function and then finally we'll have a matrix training

9

00:00:44,490  -->  00:00:45,600
exercise.

10

00:00:45,600  -->  00:00:46,960
Let's go ahead and get started.

11

00:00:46,980  -->  00:00:48,070
I'll see at the next lecture
