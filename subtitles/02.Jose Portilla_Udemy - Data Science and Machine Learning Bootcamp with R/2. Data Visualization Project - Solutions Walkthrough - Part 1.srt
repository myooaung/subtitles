00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:11,670
Hello everyone and welcome to the data visualization Project Walk through in the state of visualization

2

00:00:11,670  -->  00:00:16,860
project you wanted to recreate a plot from The Economist publication.

3

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:20,400
Let's go ahead and check out the plot and then we'll discuss what we're going to do for this actual

4

00:00:20,400  -->  00:00:21,870
lecture video.

5

00:00:21,870  -->  00:00:26,850
All right so here we are at The Economist Web site and this is the plot we're trying to recreate which

6

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:33,910
is basically a human development index value plotted against a Corruption Perceptions Index value.

7

00:00:33,960  -->  00:00:39,000
So you're essentially trying to see corruption versus human development or human development risk corruption

8

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:39,640
.

9

00:00:39,660  -->  00:00:45,600
So 10 is the least corrupt countries you can see stuff like Norway New Zealand Singapore and then one

10

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:47,160
of the most corrupt countries.

11

00:00:47,160  -->  00:00:48,940
Things like Afghanistan and Congo.

12

00:00:49,170  -->  00:00:51,430
This data is from 2011s.

13

00:00:51,450  -->  00:00:52,620
Keep that in mind.

14

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:59,120
So hopefully we can try to use our new plot to our knowledge in order to recreate this plot.

15

00:00:59,130  -->  00:01:04,070
You can check out the notes or the previous lecture as far as links to the data used for this plot.

16

00:01:04,110  -->  00:01:09,330
But I'm going to go ahead and just walk through the different steps in that project notebook and see

17

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:13,910
if we can try to get a nice recreation of this plot early relatively close to it.

18

00:01:13,950  -->  00:01:18,270
I'm going to go ahead and jump to our studio now and walk through the solutions to this project.

19

00:01:18,270  -->  00:01:23,340
All right so here in our studio one quick note you'll need to download the Economist's assignment data

20

00:01:23,350  -->  00:01:27,720
CXXVI file in order to actually have the data available for this.

21

00:01:27,720  -->  00:01:34,850
So the first instruction step was to import the Gigia plot to library and also to import the data that

22

00:01:34,860  -->  00:01:38,730
table library you may need to install this library if you haven't installed it yet.

23

00:01:38,810  -->  00:01:44,310
You can do that just by saying install up packages and an in quotes but in data table you don't have

24

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:45,420
to use data at that table.

25

00:01:45,420  -->  00:01:52,940
It just makes the reading process a little faster using the read command that comes of data table.

26

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:59,400
So in this case I get a pass in the Economist I'm using tabs autocomplete that and what's nice about

27

00:01:59,400  -->  00:02:05,610
this Elfriede method is I can say drop equals 1 and it will drop the first column which was just a repeat

28

00:02:05,670  -->  00:02:06,840
of the index.

29

00:02:06,840  -->  00:02:11,850
You can also read that C is free to read in the the C as we file as a data frame.

30

00:02:11,850  -->  00:02:12,920
It's really up to you.

31

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:17,410
I just do this because it's a little more convenient to drop because one but not a whole lot.

32

00:02:17,610  -->  00:02:22,520
Let's go ahead and check the head of that data frame and run the source.

33

00:02:22,530  -->  00:02:28,650
Let's go ahead and say print head of data frame order to see this just to see the data that we're working

34

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:30,000
with.

35

00:02:30,540  -->  00:02:30,960
Right.

36

00:02:30,960  -->  00:02:38,880
So expanding our consul output looks like we have a country a human development index rank an HDI value

37

00:02:38,970  -->  00:02:43,100
some sort of corruption index and then the actual region.

38

00:02:43,110  -->  00:02:48,230
So this is the data that was used to recreate the Economist plot that we just saw earlier.

39

00:02:48,270  -->  00:02:53,250
Let's go ahead and just start with the basics and see if we can slowly build up step by step the actual

40

00:02:53,250  -->  00:02:53,920
plot.

41

00:02:53,920  -->  00:02:57,990
I'm going to go ahead and show you one more time what we're actually plotting out so we can keep that

42

00:02:57,990  -->  00:02:58,910
in mind.

43

00:02:59,310  -->  00:03:01,770
Now go ahead and jump to it now.

44

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:05,810
What we're trying to do is recreate this corruption human development so we can already tell.

45

00:03:05,880  -->  00:03:11,670
We should be thinking about some sort of scatterplot So GM point to put on these points maybe using

46

00:03:11,670  -->  00:03:18,480
a title notice that we have different colors by their region such as Asia Central Europe Middle East

47

00:03:18,480  -->  00:03:19,280
et cetera.

48

00:03:19,380  -->  00:03:23,670
So we should already be thinking in our minds how can we color by groupings we should be thinking about

49

00:03:23,670  -->  00:03:25,870
factors of regions that sort of thing.

50

00:03:26,100  -->  00:03:30,170
And then notice we have a nice red line some smooth here.

51

00:03:30,310  -->  00:03:34,550
So we should also be thinking of things like geometer score smoothing as another geometry layer.

52

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:38,450
And you can also check take a look at this white background.

53

00:03:38,880  -->  00:03:39,550
OK.

54

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:45,980
Let's go ahead and then get started and go out and minimize this and come back to our studio plot.

55

00:03:46,350  -->  00:03:47,850
So I have my data.

56

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:52,230
Let's go ahead and start using cheesy plot just to get a very simple scatterplot.

57

00:03:52,680  -->  00:03:59,630
So I'm going to read that as ADF and then I'm going to call G-G plot pass in my data.

58

00:04:00,000  -->  00:04:02,820
And then I need to pass in my æsthetics layer.

59

00:04:02,820  -->  00:04:13,770
So what I'm actually plotting here in this case I'm going to plot CPI for X and then HDI for Y and I

60

00:04:13,770  -->  00:04:16,080
want to set my color as a region

61

00:04:20,610  -->  00:04:28,150
and then let me go ahead and pasand geom underscore points.

62

00:04:29,820  -->  00:04:34,770
Well go ahead and save that as P.L. and then we'll say print P.L.

63

00:04:38,400  -->  00:04:41,010
and then we have to go and click zoom here.

64

00:04:41,010  -->  00:04:42,850
Here we start to begin to see the plot.

65

00:04:42,900  -->  00:04:47,550
And it looks like it has the same trend so looks like we're on the same level as we should have been

66

00:04:47,970  -->  00:04:55,210
as far as that economists plot something you may be wondering is why we said color equals to region

67

00:04:55,210  -->  00:05:01,820
here and that's because we wanted to set the color defined by a certain column or feature in our day

68

00:05:01,820  -->  00:05:03,080
to frame a lot of times.

69

00:05:03,070  -->  00:05:05,640
We've also been doing that in the geometry layer.

70

00:05:05,710  -->  00:05:11,410
So instead of saying color equals region here well we could have also said it's in the geometer score

71

00:05:11,410  -->  00:05:17,010
point layer number we could call this mix called Color equals.

72

00:05:17,020  -->  00:05:22,520
And in this case we want to say factor of region and that's a really similar example to what we've been

73

00:05:22,510  -->  00:05:23,800
doing in the past.

74

00:05:23,930  -->  00:05:28,840
Mageddon is called that a little over its head right so we can see this better called Zoom in the plots

75

00:05:28,880  -->  00:05:30,230
as we call them over.

76

00:05:30,340  -->  00:05:32,540
But this was another way of doing that exact same plot.

77

00:05:32,540  -->  00:05:36,800
So if I run the source click zoom I get the same thing.

78

00:05:36,910  -->  00:05:39,280
Use whatever you feel most comfortable with.

79

00:05:39,280  -->  00:05:41,290
I personally like them both ways.

80

00:05:41,320  -->  00:05:46,450
To me they make sense either way because calling aesthetics on them I remember the aesthetics basically

81

00:05:46,450  -->  00:05:50,070
just determines what I'm actually plotting out of from my data.

82

00:05:50,440  -->  00:05:51,100
OK.

83

00:05:51,340  -->  00:05:56,510
So right now we have an issue as far as trying to get the circles or points to look like the Economist

84

00:05:56,500  -->  00:06:03,240
data member the Economist data had hollow circles so let's go ahead and try to do that.

85

00:06:03,280  -->  00:06:11,680
I want to go ahead and put the color equals region back into the actual G.G. plot come in just because

86

00:06:11,690  -->  00:06:12,660
it'll be a little cleaner.

87

00:06:12,680  -->  00:06:18,430
So say color equals region because I don't need to call us that X again in the geometry layer and now

88

00:06:18,440  -->  00:06:23,530
we want to do is mess around with our geometer score point layer to set the size and shape of these

89

00:06:23,530  -->  00:06:24,450
dots.

90

00:06:24,500  -->  00:06:30,750
So I'm going to wait and say size equals four and shape equals 1.

91

00:06:30,790  -->  00:06:34,940
And so what this allows us to do is you can pass in different number values for the shape and it'll

92

00:06:34,960  -->  00:06:37,120
change the shape of the points that we're going to run.

93

00:06:37,150  -->  00:06:38,880
So we can see what it looks like now.

94

00:06:39,140  -->  00:06:43,280
And now if I click zoom I see a half empty circles.

95

00:06:43,390  -->  00:06:46,720
Now let's go ahead and mess around that shape so we can get a better idea of how it works.

96

00:06:46,730  -->  00:06:54,290
If I Pessin shape because three is the same thing then I get crosshairs as in shape for the same thing

97

00:06:54,280  -->  00:06:54,610
.

98

00:06:54,680  -->  00:07:00,640
Then you get X points or X marks so you can go ahead and just play around with this whatever you prefer

99

00:07:01,200  -->  00:07:01,830
.

100

00:07:01,850  -->  00:07:05,710
But hopefully you get the idea of just different numbers relate to different shapes and you would just

101

00:07:05,720  -->  00:07:10,080
have to check the documentation to see what was the correct shape that you were looking for.

102

00:07:10,100  -->  00:07:14,530
This case will kind of use these empty star looking circles so shape because one.

103

00:07:14,800  -->  00:07:15,420
Right.

104

00:07:15,500  -->  00:07:21,620
So now that we have that set what we need to do is add a trend line so we can do that by adding the

105

00:07:21,620  -->  00:07:24,090
GM underscore smooth to this.

106

00:07:24,130  -->  00:07:37,220
So what I'm going to go ahead and do is say P.L. 2 and assign it plus GM underscores smooth.

107

00:07:37,610  -->  00:07:39,390
So let's go ahead and do that.

108

00:07:40,120  -->  00:07:45,490
But before we actually run this what we will need to do is decide what do we actually want to pasan

109

00:07:45,620  -->  00:07:47,510
as the trend line.

110

00:07:47,500  -->  00:07:47,980
So what are we at.

111

00:07:47,990  -->  00:07:52,260
What data are you looking at in order to make some sort of smooth curve fit.

112

00:07:52,270  -->  00:07:53,860
So there's a couple options here.

113

00:07:53,890  -->  00:08:02,410
As far as figuring out how to do this you could just go to help and put in geometer score smooth.

114

00:08:02,410  -->  00:08:04,510
Check that out.

115

00:08:05,120  -->  00:08:09,310
And if you're kind of just exploring this documentation you'll notice you have a lot of other arguments

116

00:08:09,310  -->  00:08:13,680
you can pasan things such as mapping data position a formula.

117

00:08:13,730  -->  00:08:16,150
Remove any values etc..

118

00:08:16,570  -->  00:08:21,070
So we're going to go ahead and do is in the actual assignment you're kind of given a lot of what you

119

00:08:21,070  -->  00:08:25,900
should put in here and that's because later on when we actually learn about linear regression we'll

120

00:08:25,900  -->  00:08:27,830
learn what these arguments actually mean.

121

00:08:27,860  -->  00:08:35,520
But in this case I'll start off by just saying in the æsthetics we want group to be equal to 1.

122

00:08:35,620  -->  00:08:38,490
I'm going to go ahead and run the source.

123

00:08:38,620  -->  00:08:44,190
Check out my plots again and I need to say Prince Piel too.

124

00:08:44,200  -->  00:08:46,090
So we actually get the output here.

125

00:08:46,390  -->  00:08:46,870
All right.

126

00:08:46,880  -->  00:08:47,990
And if I click zoom.

127

00:08:48,130  -->  00:08:53,380
This is like the most basic version of what the sexual trend line would look like.

128

00:08:54,130  -->  00:08:56,000
So there's a little line a smooth fit.

129

00:08:56,020  -->  00:09:02,050
And if we notice we had a pasand group equals one space is just assigning it what you're actually plotting

130

00:09:02,050  -->  00:09:04,620
this best fit trend line for.

131

00:09:05,120  -->  00:09:06,660
So don't worry too much about that.

132

00:09:06,760  -->  00:09:11,980
We're going to learn about the sort of adding a smooth trend line a lot more when we talk about linear

133

00:09:11,990  -->  00:09:16,000
regression because that's really what we're doing here we're just adding some sort of linear progression

134

00:09:16,000  -->  00:09:17,290
to this.

135

00:09:17,300  -->  00:09:21,440
So just like the instructions said in the project we're going to add a bunch of more arguments to this

136

00:09:21,460  -->  00:09:31,060
GMAT score smooth sangoma say method equals L.M. which stands for linear model and later on again we're

137

00:09:31,070  -->  00:09:32,610
talking about linear models in general.

138

00:09:32,610  -->  00:09:34,620
We're learn how to actually do this.

139

00:09:35,370  -->  00:09:39,450
But for now just go ahead and put in these same arguments that the instructions told us to.

140

00:09:39,710  -->  00:09:45,240
So add in formula as a log X..

141

00:09:45,250  -->  00:09:49,570
So hopefully you can kind of tell that we're essentially adding a log trend line and that's just so

142

00:09:49,580  -->  00:09:56,180
it looks more like the plot from the Economist Let's say as the argument goes false.

143

00:09:56,200  -->  00:09:58,680
And then I'll make the color red.

144

00:10:00,500  -->  00:10:03,820
And again if you want to learn more about these arguments right now how they work and everything you

145

00:10:03,830  -->  00:10:09,340
can check out the help for GMAT score smooth and then explore what these arguments actually mean.

146

00:10:09,350  -->  00:10:12,920
So for instance the s equals false.

147

00:10:12,940  -->  00:10:19,160
That removes that sort of smooth confidence interval so if we look at the old plot we had some great

148

00:10:19,150  -->  00:10:20,770
out area.

149

00:10:20,920  -->  00:10:26,630
So you have this kind of greyed out smoothing as sequel's false remove that color will make it red.

150

00:10:26,650  -->  00:10:32,230
This formula will set it to be a log and then looks like we're using a linear model method.

151

00:10:32,240  -->  00:10:36,230
Again we'll learn much more about this when we talk about linear regression.

152

00:10:36,350  -->  00:10:41,020
So let's go ahead and Prince peel to now and see if all those changes took effect.

153

00:10:41,020  -->  00:10:42,330
Go ahead and zoom.

154

00:10:42,500  -->  00:10:47,750
And now we're seeing something that looks a lot more like that plot we just saw in the Economist some

155

00:10:47,750  -->  00:10:53,290
sort of logarithmic fit to this scatter point data in order to fit time limits.

156

00:10:53,300  -->  00:10:54,820
We'll continue this in part to
