00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:05.130
Hello everyone and welcome to the Moneyball Project Walk through in this lecture video I'm going to

2

00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:08.790
be walking through the solution to the Moneyball project in order to follow along.

3

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:13.720
Make sure you have the batting see as we file as well as the read me 2013 text file.

4

00:00:14.040  -->  00:00:15.760
Hopefully you had a go at it on your own.

5

00:00:15.870  -->  00:00:20.010
Here I'll be explaining all the steps you needed to follow to solve the project.

6

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:22.150
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio and get started.

7

00:00:22.310  -->  00:00:22.610
OK.

8

00:00:22.620  -->  00:00:24.360
So here we are at our studio.

9

00:00:24.420  -->  00:00:26.100
Let's go ahead and get started.

10

00:00:26.520  -->  00:00:31.660
I've already downloaded the salaries that C S V and betting but c c that we're going to need.

11

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:38.370
Let's go ahead and start off by reading the batting that see every file and saving it to a variable

12

00:00:38.370  -->  00:00:39.600
batting.

13

00:00:39.930  -->  00:00:49.170
Well go read that c v and pass and batting and then I'll go ahead and check the head of the batting

14

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:51.360
data frame.

15

00:00:51.360  -->  00:00:57.210
So really that source is going to expand this window when you wouldn't push this to the right so you

16

00:00:57.210  -->  00:00:58.700
get a little more room here.

17

00:00:59.070  -->  00:01:02.770
So we've got some player IDs Stintz team IDs et cetera.

18

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:08.100
Let's go ahead and use as TR to check the structure so I can actually just do that in the console right

19

00:01:08.100  -->  00:01:09.840
now.

20

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:15.450
So when you check the structure of batting OK looks like we have quite a few rows.

21

00:01:15.450  -->  00:01:19.550
Almost 100000 observations and 24 variables.

22

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:25.580
So something to know that the notebook said was if a column name started with a number.

23

00:01:25.620  -->  00:01:31.470
Since you can't actually do that as far as reading out a number because our will get confused thinking

24

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:34.070
you're asking for an index not a column name.

25

00:01:34.260  -->  00:01:36.650
It goes ahead and puts an X for you there.

26

00:01:36.660  -->  00:01:41.700
So just keep that in mind or we're going to be referring to those columns that type in that X as well

27

00:01:41.700  -->  00:01:42.960
.

28

00:01:42.960  -->  00:01:52.280
So we want to do is go ahead and call ahead of the first five rows at bats which is a B.

29

00:01:52.310  -->  00:01:59.580
Remember you can always reference that read me textfile 2013 in order to get actual definitions of all

30

00:01:59.580  -->  00:02:01.070
the acronyms here.

31

00:02:01.230  -->  00:02:04.440
I'll go ahead and just tell you what they are as we go along here.

32

00:02:04.440  -->  00:02:15.300
So at AB is at that's going to go ahead and check batting dollar sign a b and looks like we get 0 2

33

00:02:15.300  -->  00:02:18.990
0 1 0 0 for a matching with the notebook.

34

00:02:18.990  -->  00:02:20.600
So looks like we're good there.

35

00:02:20.910  -->  00:02:25.470
We can go ahead and call the head of the doubles column.

36

00:02:25.470  -->  00:02:33.880
So betting dollar sign X to B and we get all zeros which makes sense.

37

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:34.530
OK.

38

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:40.350
So continuing on we want to continue with the next step which in the note book was described as feature

39

00:02:40.350  -->  00:02:41.040
engineering.

40

00:02:41.040  -->  00:02:47.130
So we add three more statistics that were used in Moneyball and those were the batting average the on

41

00:02:47.130  -->  00:02:50.680
base percentage and the slugging percentage.

42

00:02:50.820  -->  00:02:55.240
I'm going to go ahead and start with just the batting average and just like the notebook said.

43

00:02:55.440  -->  00:02:59.010
All you do is click on the Wikipedia link and search the page for the formula.

44

00:02:59.010  -->  00:03:04.780
This formula is actually in the notebook and it shifts the number of hits H.

45

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:07.940
Divided by the at bats number a B.

46

00:03:07.950  -->  00:03:16.050
So let's go ahead and create that I work a little bit in the console just to create that will say be

47

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:22.100
a for batting average and we'll go ahead and call it batting.

48

00:03:22.230  -->  00:03:27.320
It's divided by batting Whoops.

49

00:03:28.740  -->  00:03:32.860
Dollar Sign a B.

50

00:03:33.120  -->  00:03:38.960
All right we can go ahead and check the tail of batting dollar sign.

51

00:03:39.000  -->  00:03:46.230
B A which says for the first five or last five rows excuse me and looks like we're matching up with

52

00:03:46.230  -->  00:03:46.880
solutions.

53

00:03:46.890  -->  00:03:48.270
So that's all you had to do for that.

54

00:03:48.270  -->  00:03:51.090
And that's those steps are actually outlined in the notebooks.

55

00:03:51.210  -->  00:03:57.450
Now you had to do was the same process for two more columns on base percentage and slugging percentage

56

00:03:57.450  -->  00:03:57.990
.

57

00:03:57.990  -->  00:04:01.670
Again you don't really need to worry too much about what these terms actually mean.

58

00:04:01.710  -->  00:04:07.380
You can read the description in the wikipedia links the oil to really do is find the actual formulas

59

00:04:07.440  -->  00:04:09.320
and then just plug them in.

60

00:04:09.430  -->  00:04:14.760
I'll go ahead and just copy and paste formulas from the solution notebooks but all you had to do was

61

00:04:14.820  -->  00:04:17.430
go to the Wikipedia page and find them.

62

00:04:17.430  -->  00:04:24.960
So for example I'll go ahead and bring up the Wikipedia page for on base percentage which is right here

63

00:04:24.960  -->  00:04:25.380
.

64

00:04:25.380  -->  00:04:26.970
If you went ahead and went to this link.

65

00:04:26.970  -->  00:04:33.540
Scroll down a bit had an overview you would have gotten the formula here o b p equals h plus B B plus

66

00:04:33.540  -->  00:04:35.010
HPB etc..

67

00:04:35.230  -->  00:04:38.450
And here it actually tells you what these acronyms stand for.

68

00:04:38.460  -->  00:04:42.740
Again you can always check the read me that text file in case you want to add more information on that

69

00:04:42.750  -->  00:04:43.290
.

70

00:04:43.380  -->  00:04:52.350
So I'm going to go ahead and put this formula into are based on the column names we have so that formula

71

00:04:52.380  -->  00:04:54.060
copying and pasting it from the solution.

72

00:04:54.060  -->  00:04:56.610
So I just don't waste a bunch of time typing here.

73

00:04:56.620  -->  00:04:57.420
Looks like this.

74

00:04:57.450  -->  00:05:04.340
Since we're just calling off batting dollar sign h batting dollar signs B B etc..

75

00:05:04.360  -->  00:05:12.670
Just those column names so you assign a new column O B P and it looks like that the next one we had

76

00:05:12.670  -->  00:05:19.710
to solve was the slugging percentage and this one was a little tricky because you had to actually calculate

77

00:05:19.750  -->  00:05:22.770
singles which wasn't in our data front to begin with.

78

00:05:22.810  -->  00:05:28.270
However we could calculate singles by subtracting doubles triples and home runs from the total hits

79

00:05:28.300  -->  00:05:29.880
which was the age column.

80

00:05:29.980  -->  00:05:34.600
So calculating singles looked like this line.

81

00:05:34.600  -->  00:05:37.920
We took the a new column singles.

82

00:05:37.940  -->  00:05:43.000
In this case I'm calling it x 1 B because we don't want to start a number as far as the column name

83

00:05:43.440  -->  00:05:48.980
and I'm taking my total hits H and subtracting the doubles X to be the triples.

84

00:05:49.020  -->  00:05:56.190
X 3 B and the home runs are and again this formula is provided for you in the notebook for the instructions

85

00:05:56.190  -->  00:05:56.850
.

86

00:05:56.860  -->  00:06:02.820
Once you have that formula you can go ahead and just open up the Wikipedia link in the notebook and

87

00:06:02.820  -->  00:06:06.360
you would have gotten the formula here SLG for slugging percentage.

88

00:06:06.510  -->  00:06:13.680
And then there's a formula of 1 B plus two times to B plus 3 times 3 B etc. divided by total at bats

89

00:06:13.690  -->  00:06:14.490
.

90

00:06:14.520  -->  00:06:20.550
I'm going to go ahead and just copy that formula from the solutions but hopefully you can figure out

91

00:06:20.560  -->  00:06:22.450
how to actually just type this in yourself.

92

00:06:22.500  -->  00:06:28.860
So essentially just writing in the formula with the column names in place.

93

00:06:28.870  -->  00:06:37.020
All right so let's go ahead and check the structure of our batting frame now make sure everything worked

94

00:06:37.010  -->  00:06:37.390
.

95

00:06:37.410  -->  00:06:42.670
So looks like we have 28 variables which is correct so we were able to add those extra columns successfully

96

00:06:42.660  -->  00:06:43.440
.

97

00:06:43.440  -->  00:06:48.190
Now we want to do is merge salary data with batting data.

98

00:06:48.190  -->  00:06:53.890
We know we don't just want the best players who want the most undervalued players meaning we also need

99

00:06:53.880  -->  00:07:00.370
to know that salary information linked to their statistical information of their performance.

100

00:07:00.450  -->  00:07:08.400
So I'm going to go ahead and load the salaries file into a data frame so I'll say s a l read that C

101

00:07:08.400  -->  00:07:14.020
S V salary is that CAC.

102

00:07:14.380  -->  00:07:27.390
And notice if I go ahead and check the summary of batting and if I take a look at your ID this batting

103

00:07:28.200  -->  00:07:29.300
data is actually super.

104

00:07:29.310  -->  00:07:33.130
All that goes all the way back to 1871 which is kind of crazy.

105

00:07:33.250  -->  00:07:36.490
So we have data all the way from 1871 to 2013.

106

00:07:36.610  -->  00:07:37.590
That's way too much data.

107

00:07:37.600  -->  00:07:38.790
It's not going to be useful to us.

108

00:07:39.000  -->  00:07:44.950
So we're going to go ahead and use subset to just grab data from 1985 onwards in order to do the merging

109

00:07:44.940  -->  00:07:47.510
between the salaries data and the batting data.

110

00:07:47.980  -->  00:07:49.910
So I want to go in and do that now.

111

00:07:50.380  -->  00:08:06.540
Let me go ahead and say batting say subsets pass in batting year Id greater than or equal to 1985.

112

00:08:07.480  -->  00:08:08.250
And there we have it.

113

00:08:08.280  -->  00:08:15.310
So now if I say summary again on my new batting data frame that I just reassigned I scroll up to year

114

00:08:16.320  -->  00:08:16.760
notice.

115

00:08:16.810  -->  00:08:19.020
Now my minimum value is 1985.

116

00:08:19.020  -->  00:08:23.060
Which is exactly what we want because that lines up for salary information.

117

00:08:23.350  -->  00:08:27.780
So let's go ahead and start merging these two data frames together.

118

00:08:27.940  -->  00:08:32.500
I want to merge S-A l data frame and batting data frame to do that.

119

00:08:32.500  -->  00:08:38.850
I use the merge function so I don't know what to say combo as my new data frame so the combination of

120

00:08:38.860  -->  00:08:45.750
the two and I'm going to go ahead and call merge pass in my first data frame with my second data frame

121

00:08:45.750  -->  00:08:51.540
that I want to merge and then we use the by argument to say what we actually want to join these by and

122

00:08:51.540  -->  00:08:55.170
we want to join these by not just a player id.

123

00:08:55.170  -->  00:09:01.370
We want to join them by player id for your ID so I pass any vector of what I want to join by.

124

00:09:01.680  -->  00:09:17.060
When I say player id comma year Id And now if I check the summary of that combo data frame.

125

00:09:17.350  -->  00:09:20.540
Notice I have information here on salary at the end.

126

00:09:20.830  -->  00:09:23.910
So minimum salary looks like a zero maximum salary.

127

00:09:23.910  -->  00:09:25.560
Quite a good chunk of change there.

128

00:09:25.710  -->  00:09:28.580
So let's go ahead and continue on.

129

00:09:28.600  -->  00:09:33.640
Next step we want to do as far as this whole process was analyzing the last players.

130

00:09:33.660  -->  00:09:37.790
So again as mentioned in the assignment notebook Hopefully your read through it.

131

00:09:37.810  -->  00:09:43.690
The Oakland A's lost three key players during the off season and what you want to do is get their stats

132

00:09:43.680  -->  00:09:46.070
to see what we have to replace.

133

00:09:46.230  -->  00:09:54.340
So the players last were the first baseman Jason Giambi the York Yankees took them and we also had another

134

00:09:54.340  -->  00:09:56.490
outfielder and an infielder.

135

00:09:56.590  -->  00:10:01.720
So I'm going to go and do is use the subset function to get a data free and called last players

136

00:10:05.760  -->  00:10:18.790
call subset combo and I'm going to go ahead and use the special in command to avoid a bunch of or statements

137

00:10:18.790  -->  00:10:20.050
I'm going to say.

138

00:10:20.940  -->  00:10:29.290
In this case I'm actually going to go ahead and copy their player ID's so I don't have to type them

139

00:10:29.290  -->  00:10:32.830
all up and there they are.

140

00:10:32.830  -->  00:10:35.390
So it's GNB they mean.

141

00:10:35.590  -->  00:10:39.470
And then this re infielder guy.

142

00:10:40.030  -->  00:10:43.070
So let's go ahead and create that different.

143

00:10:43.080  -->  00:10:50.350
So now if I look at last players Here's my data frame for the information of the players that we lost

144

00:10:50.620  -->  00:10:55.140
and notice it's going to be a player 80 in the multiple years that they were playing.

145

00:10:55.180  -->  00:11:01.570
So they were always on the Oakland A's but we can see here that in 2001 they were on the Oakland A's

146

00:11:02.020  -->  00:11:04.450
notice immediately after that they get traded.

147

00:11:04.510  -->  00:11:08.640
So we have information of the future if you will.

148

00:11:09.790  -->  00:11:14.200
So continuing on that we have all this information where we want to do is just grab information on the

149

00:11:14.200  -->  00:11:19.620
year 2001 because that's the you are concerned about as far as the story is concerned.

150

00:11:19.690  -->  00:11:29.980
So I'm going to go ahead and clear this and say last players and I'm going to take a subsets was Players

151

00:11:30.430  -->  00:11:35.720
year Id equals equals 2001.

152

00:11:35.980  -->  00:11:40.720
You could have also played around at the plier library with something like filter if you wanted to to

153

00:11:40.900  -->  00:11:46.200
do the same sort of subsect commands totally up to you on just using the most basic commands where you

154

00:11:46.210  -->  00:11:48.930
are how to download any extra libraries.

155

00:11:48.940  -->  00:11:49.300
All right.

156

00:11:49.300  -->  00:11:56.500
The next step we wanted to reduce the lost players data frame to the player id the column the hits doubles

157

00:11:56.500  -->  00:12:01.870
triples home runs and then those extra columns that we actually calculated are going to go ahead and

158

00:12:01.870  -->  00:12:02.980
copy this line.

159

00:12:03.190  -->  00:12:05.880
So I don't waste that much time typing it out.

160

00:12:05.970  -->  00:12:06.730
All right.

161

00:12:06.920  -->  00:12:12.940
So all I'm saying is lost players and I'm using index notation with these brackets to just grab these

162

00:12:12.940  -->  00:12:14.290
particular columns.

163

00:12:14.320  -->  00:12:16.480
So we had a bunch of information about these last players.

164

00:12:16.480  -->  00:12:19.420
I'm just concerned with these columns right now.

165

00:12:19.420  -->  00:12:19.920
All right.

166

00:12:20.230  -->  00:12:24.570
So let's go ahead and check the head of last players.

167

00:12:24.610  -->  00:12:25.560
Perfect.

168

00:12:25.570  -->  00:12:30.400
So hopefully after all the steps your data matched up to look like this.

169

00:12:30.400  -->  00:12:30.870
OK.

170

00:12:30.880  -->  00:12:37.630
Moving on now that we have our last players and their data it's time to find replacement players using

171

00:12:37.630  -->  00:12:42.690
our statistical skills with our programming to try to find undervalued players.

172

00:12:43.060  -->  00:12:45.220
However we have three constraints.

173

00:12:45.220  -->  00:12:49.720
We want their total combined salary to not exceed 15 million dollars.

174

00:12:49.720  -->  00:12:54.490
We want the combined number of at bats to be equal to or greater than the last players.

175

00:12:54.550  -->  00:12:59.610
In this case if we add these at bats it's going to be 1469.

176

00:12:59.710  -->  00:13:06.280
And finally the mean oh BP or on base percentage of a replacement players has to be equal to or greater

177

00:13:06.340  -->  00:13:10.080
than the mean on base percentage of the last players.

178

00:13:10.150  -->  00:13:14.780
So we have the combo data Frane as the source of new players.

179

00:13:14.950  -->  00:13:29.290
What we want to do is set that to be the subset for the year equal to 2001 and now using we check out

180

00:13:29.380  -->  00:13:31.930
the structure of combo.

181

00:13:31.930  -->  00:13:39.040
We have 915 observations and nine or 15 players we want to grab the three undervalued ones that can

182

00:13:39.220  -->  00:13:42.510
have these stats for our replacement.

183

00:13:42.580  -->  00:13:44.520
Now how do we actually do that.

184

00:13:44.560  -->  00:13:52.570
There are tons of ways you can actually filter out play out as data plot it etc. to find those replacement

185

00:13:52.570  -->  00:13:53.200
players.

186

00:13:53.200  -->  00:13:58.450
That's really the fun part of this exercise is exploring the best way to find these replacement players

187

00:13:58.450  -->  00:13:58.840
.

188

00:13:58.840  -->  00:14:02.780
So I purposefully won't go too deep into lots of many methods.

189

00:14:02.850  -->  00:14:05.740
This all just show you a very simple method.

190

00:14:06.190  -->  00:14:09.100
Then there's multiple answers to this question.

191

00:14:09.100  -->  00:14:15.040
So it's actually quite easy to fill up 15 million dollars with these two stats.

192

00:14:15.040  -->  00:14:19.310
So I'm going to go ahead and show you a very simple way of solving this problem.

193

00:14:19.470  -->  00:14:19.890
Go ahead.

194

00:14:19.900  -->  00:14:22.840
Just say clear this con..

195

00:14:23.290  -->  00:14:27.910
I'm going to go ahead and just plot some of this data out.

196

00:14:28.000  -->  00:14:31.160
Gwatney is a great way to solve these sort of issues.

197

00:14:31.300  -->  00:14:38.170
So I'll say cheesy plot passenger data in this case it's combo.

198

00:14:40.480  -->  00:14:50.720
And I'm going to go ahead and plot the on base percentage versus the salary information and I'm going

199

00:14:50.730  -->  00:15:00.350
to make a scatterplot of this GM underscore points it let's go ahead and make the size too.

200

00:15:00.380  -->  00:15:03.790
Just so it's easy to see.

201

00:15:03.790  -->  00:15:04.150
All right.

202

00:15:04.150  -->  00:15:05.680
So here is my plot.

203

00:15:06.230  -->  00:15:07.840
But go ahead and click zoom.

204

00:15:07.930  -->  00:15:12.250
I have a nice plot showing salary information versus on base percentage.

205

00:15:12.250  -->  00:15:14.180
A couple of things stand out to me.

206

00:15:14.470  -->  00:15:20.030
I notice that there's kind of these stacked lines at 0 0 BP.

207

00:15:20.100  -->  00:15:22.120
There's a little one to 25 OVP.

208

00:15:22.210  -->  00:15:26.130
And there's also kind of another suspicious one at one BP.

209

00:15:26.470  -->  00:15:27.650
What does that actually mean.

210

00:15:27.760  -->  00:15:32.520
Well remember on base percentage just means the percent of the time they got on base.

211

00:15:32.530  -->  00:15:37.720
So after watching that video on YouTube about baseball in case you weren't familiar with baseball you'll

212

00:15:37.720  -->  00:15:43.330
know that it's probably unlikely that someone 100 percent of the time gets on base.

213

00:15:43.330  -->  00:15:48.670
It's also kind of strange that there's a lot of people on this straight 0.5 mark and it's really strange

214

00:15:48.670  -->  00:15:54.640
that there's a ton of people at 0 percent unless you start thinking logically about this you'll realize

215

00:15:54.700  -->  00:16:00.740
that it actually makes sense for a bunch people to have 0 percent on base because it means they probably

216

00:16:00.730  -->  00:16:02.710
just went back a few times.

217

00:16:02.730  -->  00:16:05.430
Or just one time and didn't get on base.

218

00:16:05.470  -->  00:16:11.830
Or they maybe not have gone back at all yet in our data so we can basically throw out all these people

219

00:16:11.870  -->  00:16:13.240
at zero.

220

00:16:13.370  -->  00:16:15.700
We'll go ahead and set the limit at 0.5.

221

00:16:15.700  -->  00:16:20.650
Thinking about it and it makes sense that there's a few people at 100 percent on base percentage because

222

00:16:20.650  -->  00:16:27.970
it probably just went to bat once more maybe twice and hit on base both times and 0.5 makes sense because

223

00:16:27.970  -->  00:16:29.570
they probably just went twice.

224

00:16:29.720  -->  00:16:32.940
They didn't get on base one time got on base another time.

225

00:16:32.950  -->  00:16:38.730
What's really useful about this plot is the salary information here we can really clearly see that there's

226

00:16:38.740  -->  00:16:42.780
no real reason to be paying someone more than $10 million dollars.

227

00:16:43.000  -->  00:16:45.600
Because remember we're looking for somewhere around.

228

00:16:45.620  -->  00:16:51.390
If we look at this average again point 3:6 on base percentage now we can see we have a lot of points

229

00:16:51.390  -->  00:16:51.730
here.

230

00:16:51.760  -->  00:16:56.040
Options below even I would say the $8 billion mark.

231

00:16:56.410  -->  00:17:03.770
As far as their salaries Let's go ahead and just cut off salaries $8 million then and cut on base percentage

232

00:17:03.760  -->  00:17:07.680
has to be greater than zero.

233

00:17:07.820  -->  00:17:09.430
So I'm going to go in and do that.

234

00:17:09.430  -->  00:17:30.380
I'll say combo subsets combo salary has to be less than $8 million and on base percentage is greater

235

00:17:30.380  -->  00:17:32.230
than zero.

236

00:17:32.650  -->  00:17:36.580
And now we have our new combo Let's go and call structure on it.

237

00:17:36.880  -->  00:17:38.940
Scroll up a bit.

238

00:17:39.010  -->  00:17:44.960
Looks like you got rid about 300 players so we have 600 players now we can keep messing around with

239

00:17:44.950  -->  00:17:50.680
this play around the base at bats excuse me guessing on our at bats.

240

00:17:50.680  -->  00:17:58.520
They should all have probably greater than 4 fiftyish because this is about 5300.

241

00:17:58.700  -->  00:18:01.660
So we want them to all have around the same number of at bats.

242

00:18:01.900  -->  00:18:06.860
Let's go ahead and say 1 4 6 9 divided by 3.

243

00:18:07.210  -->  00:18:09.040
That's around the four eighty nine range.

244

00:18:09.050  -->  00:18:10.200
So let's go ahead.

245

00:18:10.370  -->  00:18:14.010
Go a little below that because we may have some people have a lot more at bats.

246

00:18:14.020  -->  00:18:16.720
We'll go ahead and cut off at bats for 50.

247

00:18:16.720  -->  00:18:22.990
Again there's lots of correct answers to this so you don't have to do it this way or go ahead it's a

248

00:18:22.990  -->  00:18:38.860
combo the one more subset combo a b greater than or equal to 450 in outs go ahead and trick the structure

249

00:18:38.870  -->  00:18:42.290
of a combo scrolling up.

250

00:18:42.280  -->  00:18:44.900
Looks like we have 122 players to choose from.

251

00:18:44.890  -->  00:18:48.990
So you're really narrowed it down with the at bats which is good.

252

00:18:49.030  -->  00:18:53.850
Moving along we can start to actually take a look at these players and maybe just pick something up

253

00:18:54.590  -->  00:18:58.870
let's go ahead and try using that the player library

254

00:19:03.050  -->  00:19:07.220
to quickly arrange what's left of combo.

255

00:19:07.610  -->  00:19:12.270
So it is a combo and let's arrange it by on base percentage.

256

00:19:13.300  -->  00:19:19.160
So notice we actually did on base percentage in wups ascending order.

257

00:19:19.180  -->  00:19:20.820
Are these.

258

00:19:21.380  -->  00:19:25.470
Well we want to do is have it in descending order so let's grab the first top and I'm going to call

259

00:19:25.470  -->  00:19:26.740
head on this.

260

00:19:26.740  -->  00:19:28.740
So let's try that again I'm going to clear the con..

261

00:19:28.750  -->  00:19:32.890
So it was a little messier output scroll this the right.

262

00:19:33.430  -->  00:19:34.750
I'll go ahead and say

263

00:19:37.640  -->  00:19:42.700
head let's grab just some 20 players to mess around with.

264

00:19:42.700  -->  00:19:48.250
Actually it was kind of a lot let's say 10 players or called the ascending order or on base percentage

265

00:19:48.250  -->  00:19:51.780
.

266

00:19:51.800  -->  00:19:53.360
All right.

267

00:19:53.730  -->  00:19:56.360
Actually I just want to grab the columns.

268

00:19:56.380  -->  00:20:00.880
So let's call this options

269

00:20:05.120  -->  00:20:07.430
and grab some columns off of the options.

270

00:20:07.430  -->  00:20:12.310
I'm going to store that data Frank called Options and then off of options.

271

00:20:12.320  -->  00:20:15.380
I just want a few columns off of this.

272

00:20:15.760  -->  00:20:25.520
I want the columns at bats salary.

273

00:20:28.220  -->  00:20:34.330
And then they're on base percentage and they also want their player the player they should probably

274

00:20:34.340  -->  00:20:37.390
come first.

275

00:20:37.390  -->  00:20:43.830
Could have actually done this using filter or the player.

276

00:20:45.260  -->  00:20:45.610
All right.

277

00:20:45.620  -->  00:20:47.810
So looks like we have a couple of options here.

278

00:20:48.070  -->  00:20:50.810
Let's go ahead and make sure their salaries make sense.

279

00:20:50.840  -->  00:20:57.490
We can't choose GRB but it looks like these next bottom three we can actually choose.

280

00:20:57.550  -->  00:21:03.730
And here we got in on base percentage that really beats this on base percentage.

281

00:21:03.730  -->  00:21:07.570
So we got an average of about points for three point forty.

282

00:21:07.850  -->  00:21:13.330
Salary information looks OK this looks like it's going to be around $13 million ish.

283

00:21:13.340  -->  00:21:23.290
Let's say we got to add these together plus this guy's salary.

284

00:21:24.700  -->  00:21:30.040
And this guy's salary.

285

00:21:30.070  -->  00:21:35.140
And if we add this together it looks like we're at the 10 million mark so it looks like I've got my

286

00:21:35.140  -->  00:21:41.470
three players so this player id this player 80 and this period the THEIR at bats looked like it's more

287

00:21:41.470  -->  00:21:42.010
than enough.

288

00:21:42.010  -->  00:21:43.180
They're all above 500.

289

00:21:43.180  -->  00:21:47.580
So that works out and that's how we could find our three replacement players.

290

00:21:47.600  -->  00:21:48.320
OK.

291

00:21:48.640  -->  00:21:52.640
Hopefully you had a lot of fun with that last part of finding the replacement players.

292

00:21:52.780  -->  00:21:56.100
That's where you can really get creative and have a lot of fun with this exercise.

293

00:21:56.300  -->  00:21:57.340
OK.

294

00:21:57.350  -->  00:21:59.270
Thanks everyone and I'll say at the next lecture
