00:00:01.290  -->  00:00:07.440
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on themes themes is our final layer in the grammar of graphics

2

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:12.330
and it's going to allow us to quickly and easily create beautiful data visualizations.

3

00:00:12.360  -->  00:00:15.010
There's already a lot of built in themes and GZA plot.

4

00:00:15.030  -->  00:00:20.370
You'll also learn how to install a great library called G-G themes which adds even more built in themes

5

00:00:20.370  -->  00:00:21.460
for G.G. plot.

6

00:00:21.750  -->  00:00:24.530
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio and see how this all works.

7

00:00:24.690  -->  00:00:27.270
All right so here we are at our studio.

8

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:32.640
Let's go ahead and get started by doing a very simple plot and then building off of it with some names

9

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:33.210
.

10

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:37.090
I'm going to go ahead and call library G-G plot 2.

11

00:00:37.590  -->  00:00:42.040
And then I will use the empty car's data set that we're pretty familiar with.

12

00:00:42.240  -->  00:00:44.670
To go ahead and make a very simple scatterplot.

13

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:48.490
So go ahead and pass on our first argument which is our data.

14

00:00:49.320  -->  00:00:51.940
Empty cars.

15

00:00:52.530  -->  00:00:54.620
And then we'll pass in our aesthetics later.

16

00:00:54.630  -->  00:01:02.430
So we'll say x is equal to the weight of the car why is equal to the mpg of the car.

17

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:10.200
Now we'll go ahead and say GM underscore points since were working for scatterplot will sign that TPL

18

00:01:10.380  -->  00:01:14.150
and we'll go ahead and say Prince P.L..

19

00:01:14.340  -->  00:01:16.650
All right let's go ahead and run this.

20

00:01:18.000  -->  00:01:23.260
And once it shows up over here in the plot's which takes a little bit but here it is.

21

00:01:23.280  -->  00:01:26.040
We can see we have our nice basic plot.

22

00:01:26.130  -->  00:01:26.460
All right.

23

00:01:26.460  -->  00:01:33.960
Now let's learn how we can apply a theme layer to this plot if we want to apply a theme or set a theme

24

00:01:33.960  -->  00:01:37.850
for all the plots that we're going to be plotting in the scripts.

25

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:43.950
We can say theme underscore sets and then you can pasan a theme.

26

00:01:43.950  -->  00:01:52.250
So notice as I begin to type theme underscore you'll see a bunch of themes show up.

27

00:01:52.260  -->  00:01:55.510
So for instance let's go ahead and choose theme.

28

00:01:55.600  -->  00:01:56.970
Minimal.

29

00:01:57.470  -->  00:02:01.970
Now if I run source we get a minimal theme.

30

00:02:02.010  -->  00:02:07.200
So notice a difference between this last one the default versus the minimal.

31

00:02:07.260  -->  00:02:15.970
You can see the minimal has a white background and less information of it as far as color goes.

32

00:02:16.020  -->  00:02:21.390
So that's one way you can set the theme or go ahead a hash tag that out that will set the theme for

33

00:02:21.450  -->  00:02:26.610
all your plots and your script if you want to manually add a specific theme for each plot.

34

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:31.090
You can then just add it saying plus theme.

35

00:02:31.200  -->  00:02:35.370
Let's go ahead and say theme dark in this case.

36

00:02:35.370  -->  00:02:37.980
So you go and just add themes like that.

37

00:02:37.980  -->  00:02:42.710
Go ahead and run that code and I can see the darker theme showed up here.

38

00:02:42.750  -->  00:02:44.010
So there's two ways of doing it.

39

00:02:44.010  -->  00:02:45.990
One is to set the theme for all your plots.

40

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:50.140
The other one is just to add that theme to each individual plot.

41

00:02:50.160  -->  00:02:50.760
All right.

42

00:02:50.850  -->  00:02:55.000
So that's how we can set themes that are already built into the plot too.

43

00:02:55.230  -->  00:03:03.060
But we can actually call a library called G-G themes in order to get even more theme options before

44

00:03:03.060  -->  00:03:03.540
we call it.

45

00:03:03.540  -->  00:03:05.430
Though we have to actually install it.

46

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:12.450
So in your console we're good and clear that you need to say installed up packages and in quotes pass in

47

00:03:12.480  -->  00:03:16.470
G-G themes enter.

48

00:03:16.830  -->  00:03:22.500
Go ahead and let it install the package and download it onto your computer.

49

00:03:22.620  -->  00:03:32.610
Once that's done and downloaded what we can do now is if we Cecco library will be able to say G-G themes

50

00:03:32.610  -->  00:03:33.000
.

51

00:03:33.270  -->  00:03:37.740
Go ahead and click run just to run that current line selection.

52

00:03:37.950  -->  00:03:41.990
So select that library the themes line click run.

53

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:49.830
So now we have Jesus themes loaded and if we go back to theme underscore and click tab you'll start

54

00:03:49.830  -->  00:03:53.510
to notice that you have a lot more options due to G-G themes.

55

00:03:53.720  -->  00:04:01.390
See our theme underscore calque theme economist theme 5:38 theme GI docs foundation.

56

00:04:01.470  -->  00:04:02.270
Cetera.

57

00:04:02.340  -->  00:04:05.440
So a lot of these themes are actually based off of real publications.

58

00:04:05.640  -->  00:04:08.670
For example you have the Economist which is a magazine.

59

00:04:08.880  -->  00:04:13.190
You can try to emulate their style.

60

00:04:13.260  -->  00:04:19.050
So if we go ahead and run this you get this kind of blue background which is use in a few of their data

61

00:04:19.050  -->  00:04:21.400
visualizations for the Economist.

62

00:04:21.420  -->  00:04:28.350
Another thing you can do is try to imitate the style of the 538 blog which has a blog on statistics

63

00:04:28.350  -->  00:04:32.900
run by Nate Silver which is also kind of famous for its data visualizations.

64

00:04:33.090  -->  00:04:37.720
So you can run that all began to try to develop the same style.

65

00:04:38.520  -->  00:04:46.470
And you'll notice as you click theme underscore tab you have tons of options to choose from including

66

00:04:46.470  -->  00:04:49.560
things like The Wall Street Journal theme when going to run that.

67

00:04:49.650  -->  00:04:51.060
See what that looks like.

68

00:04:51.060  -->  00:04:52.200
And there you have it.

69

00:04:52.710  -->  00:04:53.550
OK.

70

00:04:53.550  -->  00:04:54.840
So that's really all there is.

71

00:04:54.840  -->  00:04:56.300
Discuss about themes.

72

00:04:56.310  -->  00:04:58.090
Again there's two ways to set them.

73

00:04:58.290  -->  00:05:03.730
You can set a theme for all your plots or you can add the themes individually to each plot.

74

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:08.880
You can actually create your own themes However however this is outside of the scope of this course

75

00:05:09.450  -->  00:05:14.610
but you can check out the notes for a link to the documentation which has a full written guide on how

76

00:05:14.610  -->  00:05:19.070
to describe and set your own themes for your own publications.

77

00:05:19.080  -->  00:05:19.730
OK.

78

00:05:20.100  -->  00:05:21.500
Hope you enjoyed this lecture.

79

00:05:21.660  -->  00:05:22.530
I'll see you at the next one
