Hello and welcome to the science machine learning boot camp with our course.

2

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:10,260
My name is Jose Protea and I teach thousands of students on to me about programming in science and I'm

3

00:00:10,260  -->  00:00:17,310
super excited to teach you all you need to know about data science machine learning with our data scientist

4

00:00:17,310  -->  00:00:23,040
who's been recently ranked as the number one job by Glassdoor that due to not only the incredible salaries

5

00:00:23,040  -->  00:00:27,900
for data science positions but also the chance to solve some of the world's most interesting problems

6

00:00:27,910  -->  00:00:28,280
.

7

00:00:28,650  -->  00:00:33,300
This course is uniquely designed to be suitable for both experienced developers seeking to make that

8

00:00:33,300  -->  00:00:39,510
jump to data scientists or complete beginners don't understand data science and machine learning from

9

00:00:39,510  -->  00:00:46,450
the ground up in this course we cover our programming data visualization and machine learning.

10

00:00:47,040  -->  00:00:52,440
Let's go ahead and take a quick look at just a few of the things you'll be learning in this course once

11

00:00:52,440  -->  00:00:54,770
we're guiding you through the environment set up.

12

00:00:54,810  -->  00:01:00,090
You'll start off by learning the basics of programming including working on vectors matrices and data

13

00:01:00,090  -->  00:01:01,420
frames.

14

00:01:01,590  -->  00:01:06,690
Then we'll learn how to create amazing data visualizations with our Which will lead to a data capstone

15

00:01:06,690  -->  00:01:07,260
project

16

00:01:10,360  -->  00:01:15,360
that will move onto machine learning where through the course of over a dozen machine learning porfolio

17

00:01:15,360  -->  00:01:20,580
projects he will teach you a variety of machine learning algorithms including topics such as linear

18

00:01:20,580  -->  00:01:26,160
regression logistic regression in the more advanced topics such as decision trees in random force and

19

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:31,950
support vector machines will also include a variety of advanced machine learning topics such as data

20

00:01:31,950  -->  00:01:38,280
mining Twitter for trending topics and create in a word cloud from those topics leave and cover reinforcement

21

00:01:38,280  -->  00:01:43,850
learning such as neural nets all in our all along the way will test your knowledge.

22

00:01:43,890  -->  00:01:49,770
There are programming exercises capstone projects and over a dozen machine learning portfolio projects

23

00:01:49,770  -->  00:01:50,520
.

24

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:56,370
This course includes over 100 comprehensive video lectures with an explanatory code notebook for every

25

00:01:56,370  -->  00:02:00,290
single lecture we can learn in whatever way works best for you.

26

00:02:00,990  -->  00:02:05,700
You'll also get access to our community forums with thousands of friendly students and I are happy to

27

00:02:05,700  -->  00:02:08,470
help answer any questions you post.

28

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:14,850
This course also comes of a certificate of completion which you can post on your LinkedIn profile.

29

00:02:14,940  -->  00:02:19,350
