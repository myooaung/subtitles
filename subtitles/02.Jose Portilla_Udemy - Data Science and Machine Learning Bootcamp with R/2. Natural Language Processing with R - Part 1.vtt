00:00:01.980  -->  00:00:07.350
Well everyone and welcome to the natural language processing with our lecturer in this lecture video

2

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:13.170
we're going to be data mining Twitter and creating word clouds of topics to see what's trending on Twitter

3

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:17.890
or what the Twitter ecosystem thinks about the topics we feed into our model.

4

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:24.390
A couple of quick notes before starting this you should have the notebook with all the notes and code

5

00:00:24.390  -->  00:00:25.720
we use in this lecture.

6

00:00:25.830  -->  00:00:28.770
It's under the machine learning with our folder.

7

00:00:28.770  -->  00:00:30.930
It's not under the training exercise folder.

8

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:36.830
It's under the machine learning with our folder with the rest of the machine learning lecture notebooks

9

00:00:36.830  -->  00:00:37.500
.

10

00:00:37.800  -->  00:00:41.760
Also you're going to install all the packages it says to install the notebook.

11

00:00:41.760  -->  00:00:44.630
We're going to go ahead and do that right after this slide.

12

00:00:45.060  -->  00:00:49.920
And you also have to make sure to have a Twitter account in order to actually access the Twitter data

13

00:00:49.920  -->  00:00:50.430
.

14

00:00:50.430  -->  00:00:54.300
Let's go code and jump to our studio and get started by installing all those packages we're going to

15

00:00:54.300  -->  00:00:54.920
need.

16

00:00:55.230  -->  00:00:57.100
Ok so here we are our studio.

17

00:00:57.150  -->  00:01:01.650
I went ahead and just copying and pasted the code from the notebook indicating all the packages we're

18

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:02.510
going to need.

19

00:01:02.550  -->  00:01:08.790
We're going to the T.M. package the twit's our package the word Clodd package our color package and

20

00:01:08.790  -->  00:01:11.870
then the e ones 0 1 7 and the class packages.

21

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:17.730
If you've been following this series of lectures as far as machine learning section of this course sequentially

22

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:22.950
you should probably already have 1 0 1 7 from support vector machines and the class package from the

23

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:24.510
nearest neighbors lectures.

24

00:01:24.630  -->  00:01:30.480
When to go ahead and comment those out and I'm going to run the source here and install all those packages

25

00:01:30.480  -->  00:01:31.000
.

26

00:01:31.170  -->  00:01:36.120
I'm going to go ahead and fast for the video to jump to the sectional we're done installing all these

27

00:01:36.120  -->  00:01:38.130
packages.

28

00:01:38.190  -->  00:01:40.350
OK looks like everything's installed.

29

00:01:40.350  -->  00:01:46.140
Step number two is to go ahead and go to Twitter that COM and if you don't already have a Sign-Up e-mail

30

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:50.880
address or an account on Twitter go ahead and register an account on Twitter.

31

00:01:50.970  -->  00:01:56.100
You can do that just by going to Twitter that com show with the Web site looks like over here and then

32

00:01:56.100  -->  00:01:59.760
you're just going to go to sign up and create a new account.

33

00:01:59.820  -->  00:02:12.270
Once you've done that you're going to go to the Web site HCC P.S. Kolins slash slash a PBS or APs Twitter

34

00:02:12.570  -->  00:02:13.770
dot com.

35

00:02:14.040  -->  00:02:19.120
But this is the Web site you should be going to start Twitter dot com and then you'll notice.

36

00:02:19.140  -->  00:02:22.310
Ill ask you to sign in with your Twitter account.

37

00:02:22.350  -->  00:02:27.670
Go ahead and click sign in and then input your e-mail and your password.

38

00:02:28.380  -->  00:02:33.860
Once you've logged in you'll see a sign at look or a page that looks like this saying Twitter apps.

39

00:02:33.990  -->  00:02:38.800
You probably won't have any current taller apps unless you views Twitter applications for the go ahead

40

00:02:38.800  -->  00:02:45.240
and click Create a new app will take you this page and you'll go ahead and input a name for application

41

00:02:45.240  -->  00:02:45.740
.

42

00:02:45.960  -->  00:02:52.520
We'll go in and just say an old P example app I'll put it to since I just ran through this.

43

00:02:52.530  -->  00:02:57.930
Go ahead and put a description for your app as my An LP app.

44

00:02:58.650  -->  00:03:00.110
You can put on the Web site here.

45

00:03:00.180  -->  00:03:04.500
If you're ever going to deploy this application this is going to be your applications publicly accessible

46

00:03:04.500  -->  00:03:05.580
home page.

47

00:03:05.670  -->  00:03:12.120
If you just want a placeholder you can go ahead and put in something like HTP US coal and backflush

48

00:03:12.120  -->  00:03:19.110
blacks for Slash for Slash without Google dot com is just a placeholder then go ahead and scroll down

49

00:03:19.200  -->  00:03:20.730
and agree to the Twitter development

50

00:03:23.760  -->  00:03:27.900
click Create your Twitter application and it will take you to this page.

51

00:03:27.900  -->  00:03:30.940
Here you can see all the information about trap location.

52

00:03:31.140  -->  00:03:38.070
Well we're going to need to do is click on keys and access tokens.

53

00:03:38.070  -->  00:03:43.680
Once you're at this page you're going to go ahead and make note of your consumer key API key and your

54

00:03:43.680  -->  00:03:44.640
consumer secret.

55

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:49.920
The API secret this is going to be a series of letters and numbers that you're going to need to reference

56

00:03:50.250  -->  00:03:54.050
in order to actually have your our application connect to Twitter.

57

00:03:54.090  -->  00:03:58.100
The next thing you're in need is to create an access token for your application.

58

00:03:58.140  -->  00:04:03.210
You can go all the way down here to the bottom and click on Create my access token and that will create

59

00:04:03.390  -->  00:04:09.600
two action or to access tokens for you will create an access token an access token secret.

60

00:04:09.600  -->  00:04:15.150
By the end of this you're going to have four series of strings and numbers you'll need to know for later

61

00:04:15.150  -->  00:04:16.240
on in your application.

62

00:04:16.290  -->  00:04:22.380
You'll need to know the consumer key the API key the consumer secret the API secret key the access token

63

00:04:22.470  -->  00:04:28.620
and then the access tokens secret and that's all you need to know once you have those four lines of

64

00:04:28.620  -->  00:04:33.360
code then you're ready to go ahead and go back to our studio copy and paste those somewhere because

65

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:38.740
we're going to be putting them in to a Twitter authorization function we'll be using on later in our

66

00:04:38.750  -->  00:04:39.540
.

67

00:04:39.600  -->  00:04:40.160
All right.

68

00:04:40.290  -->  00:04:45.360
That's the end of Part One of the natural language processing which is essentially just getting everything

69

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:48.490
set up so you can have your code connect to Twitter.

70

00:04:48.780  -->  00:04:49.460
Thanks everyone.

71

00:04:49.460  -->  00:04:50.540
And I'll see you at the next lecture
