Hello everyone and welcome to the conditional statements training exercise.

2

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:08,900
We've already learned about logical operators and if else and elses statements.

3

00:00:09,010  -->  00:00:13,680
This conditional statements training exercise is here to test your knowledge of the previous lecture

4

00:00:13,690  -->  00:00:13,910
.

5

00:00:14,100  -->  00:00:18,520
Let's go ahead and jump to notebook and get a brief overview of the training exercise.

6

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:23,100
All right here I am at the conditional statements exercises notebook book this note book is Under the

7

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:28,830
training exercises folder and it's called conditional statements exercises for these exercises you're

8

00:00:28,830  -->  00:00:29,990
going to use what you just learned.

9

00:00:30,010  -->  00:00:33,510
But if else if else statements to answer the questions.

10

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:36,510
This first exercise is an example that's done for you.

11

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:42,030
In order for you to understand the format So for example if the question is write a script that prints

12

00:00:42,030  -->  00:00:44,650
hello it's a variable x is equal to 1.

13

00:00:44,820  -->  00:00:51,540
What you'll go ahead and do is set some variable and assign one to it and then for example using an

14

00:00:51,630  -->  00:00:52,170
if statement.

15

00:00:52,170  -->  00:00:57,140
We can check if X has equality with one equals equal sign.

16

00:00:57,150  -->  00:01:03,220
We'll go ahead and say prints hello and then hello is printed because we set one to X..

17

00:01:03,390  -->  00:01:08,550
You can go ahead and check make sure this actually works by setting X equal to 2 and then if you run

18

00:01:08,550  -->  00:01:11,480
this statement you shouldn't actually see any printed.

19

00:01:11,560  -->  00:01:13,180
Hello output.

20

00:01:13,470  -->  00:01:13,830
All right.

21

00:01:13,830  -->  00:01:15,350
This is a relatively short assignment.

22

00:01:15,360  -->  00:01:20,010
There's only 4 exercise problems but hopefully it's pretty straightforward given what you just learned

23

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:20,390
.

24

00:01:20,550  -->  00:01:24,780
The next lecture has a solutions walkthrough for these four exercises.

25

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:26,650
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
