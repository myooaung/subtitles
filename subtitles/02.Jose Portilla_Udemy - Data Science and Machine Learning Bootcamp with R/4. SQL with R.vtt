00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:04.300
Hello everyone and welcome to the school with our lecturer.

2

00:00:04.590  -->  00:00:09.450
If you're familiar with databases then you're probably familiar sequel which is a structured query language

3

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:09.820
.

4

00:00:09.840  -->  00:00:14.910
But we're going to do is show you different strategies for figuring out how to connect in our session

5

00:00:14.910  -->  00:00:16.980
with a sequel database.

6

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:20.550
Now there's lots of different engines and lots of different flavors of sequel.

7

00:00:20.610  -->  00:00:25.290
So it doesn't make sense to do an exhaustive list of every single type of sequel engine.

8

00:00:25.350  -->  00:00:27.570
Otherwise this would take forever to show.

9

00:00:27.570  -->  00:00:32.820
Instead we're going to do a show a general strategy for how to figure out how to connect your our session

10

00:00:32.820  -->  00:00:35.760
with sequel where we're going to do is go ahead and jumped.

11

00:00:35.770  -->  00:00:38.610
There's no book for this lecture.

12

00:00:38.610  -->  00:00:40.600
All right here I am at the notebook.

13

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:45.420
Again this is going to be a little bit of a brief lecture because connecting art to a sequel database

14

00:00:45.810  -->  00:00:51.720
is really completely dependent on the type of database you're using such as My sequel Oracle M-S access

15

00:00:51.720  -->  00:00:57.960
postgresql sequel etc. and it's also dependent on whether you have admin rights or permissions to even

16

00:00:57.960  -->  00:01:00.470
connect and read from that database.

17

00:01:00.570  -->  00:01:05.760
If you're trying to work for database with are at your place of work I would highly recommend that you

18

00:01:05.760  -->  00:01:12.210
talk to whoever's in charge of admin or administrating that database in order to get the best way of

19

00:01:12.210  -->  00:01:17.820
connecting to that database with our against instead of trying to cover all of these various flavors

20

00:01:17.880  -->  00:01:20.730
of sequels as the all required different packages.

21

00:01:20.820  -->  00:01:25.170
Well we're going to do and this lecture is point you in the right direction for various database types

22

00:01:25.170  -->  00:01:25.620
.

23

00:01:25.620  -->  00:01:29.760
Once you've downloaded the correct library actually connecting is usually quite simple.

24

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:36.090
It's just a matter then of passing and sequel queries such as selects Asterix from table through our

25

00:01:36.650  -->  00:01:40.350
let's go ahead and show a general version using the DBI package.

26

00:01:40.350  -->  00:01:44.280
Now we're going to point to more specific resources.

27

00:01:44.280  -->  00:01:51.960
The general way to connect to a sequel database is using this our ODBC library and regardless of what

28

00:01:51.960  -->  00:01:57.520
you decide to use I highly recommend the Google search consisting of whatever your database of choices

29

00:01:57.560  -->  00:01:59.140
have or flavor a sequel.

30

00:01:59.190  -->  00:02:05.930
Plus are usually there's a bunch of specialized package for for creature specific type of sequel.

31

00:02:06.090  -->  00:02:09.180
A lot of those packages are usually built on top of this package.

32

00:02:09.230  -->  00:02:11.210
Are the B C.

33

00:02:11.220  -->  00:02:17.400
Usually what you'll do is call the library do some sort of connection that involves passing in your

34

00:02:17.400  -->  00:02:24.990
database name your user ID and then your password for that database then usually have some sort of connection

35

00:02:24.990  -->  00:02:31.590
fetch meaning you connect to your database and then you connect to a table in that database and then

36

00:02:31.590  -->  00:02:35.310
you ask for a sequel query from that table connection.

37

00:02:35.340  -->  00:02:41.520
You pasand some sort of query like select Asterix from table and if you're not familiar of sequel go

38

00:02:41.520  -->  00:02:44.270
ahead and check out my other course complete sequel boot camp.

39

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:47.550
For more information and context of what this actually all means.

40

00:02:47.700  -->  00:02:52.020
If you're completely unfamiliar of sequel you should probably just skip the rest of this lecture.

41

00:02:52.020  -->  00:02:53.150
Well let's go ahead and continue.

42

00:02:53.180  -->  00:02:55.870
For people that are familiar sequel.

43

00:02:55.920  -->  00:03:00.090
Once you've done that sequel Kuri you're going to get this query data and that's usually going to be

44

00:03:00.090  -->  00:03:04.170
just the data frame that you're going to close connection and you're going to be able to work with the

45

00:03:04.170  -->  00:03:09.570
state of frame and it has all the data that you have in your database and then if you have the right

46

00:03:09.900  -->  00:03:15.600
admin permissions you're going to be able to use these packages or libraries to write whatever you just

47

00:03:15.600  -->  00:03:16.170
worked with.

48

00:03:16.200  -->  00:03:19.340
In our back to your database.

49

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:20.340
All right.

50

00:03:20.340  -->  00:03:24.950
Here are some basic packages for different flavors of sequel.

51

00:03:24.990  -->  00:03:29.590
They are my sequel packages provides a nice interface for my sequel databases.

52

00:03:29.610  -->  00:03:35.910
There's an R Oracle package that provides an interface for Oracle and then the Arjay DBC package provides

53

00:03:35.970  -->  00:03:37.350
access to databases.

54

00:03:37.490  -->  00:03:39.650
The Rajai DBC interface.

55

00:03:39.670  -->  00:03:42.630
Again Google is really the best way to go about it.

56

00:03:42.660  -->  00:03:47.550
For your personal situation since databases and your permissions can differ a lot then I really can't

57

00:03:47.550  -->  00:03:52.290
stress that enough for this sort of thing you're probably going to have to do a lot of independent research

58

00:03:52.800  -->  00:03:55.530
to figure out how to actually make the connection.

59

00:03:55.530  -->  00:03:59.520
Now we're going to show you an example of how you would actually approach that sort of independent research

60

00:03:59.520  -->  00:03:59.920
.

61

00:03:59.940  -->  00:04:03.070
What you would do is go to google first.

62

00:04:03.090  -->  00:04:05.920
So let me go ahead and jump to Google dot com.

63

00:04:06.060  -->  00:04:11.460
And then what you would do is you would just say our plus and then whatever flavor of sequel you're

64

00:04:11.460  -->  00:04:18.180
looking for in this case let's say we're looking for postgresql sequel and you'll get some results back

65

00:04:18.180  -->  00:04:18.540
.

66

00:04:18.540  -->  00:04:23.970
Usually within the top results you'll have Crann packages and that's exactly what we're looking for

67

00:04:23.970  -->  00:04:24.380
.

68

00:04:24.390  -->  00:04:27.720
Basically the Krant package is what you're going to be installing.

69

00:04:27.720  -->  00:04:32.040
You go ahead and click that link and you should see a page that looks like this is exactly what you're

70

00:04:32.040  -->  00:04:33.230
looking for.

71

00:04:33.240  -->  00:04:39.020
This is the package name our PostScript sequel and then what you can do is scroll down and so you see

72

00:04:39.090  -->  00:04:40.420
reference manual.

73

00:04:40.420  -->  00:04:42.180
And this will usually be a PDA file.

74

00:04:42.210  -->  00:04:47.970
You just click and this PDA file is going to look a little bit ugly and a little bit intimidating but

75

00:04:47.970  -->  00:04:53.130
it's basically just a documentation of all the methods in this actual library.

76

00:04:53.130  -->  00:04:55.390
Once you figured out that this is the package you want.

77

00:04:55.400  -->  00:05:01.310
By reading the description here database interface and postgresql driver for our That means for using

78

00:05:01.310  -->  00:05:04.100
post-career sequel This is exactly what you want.

79

00:05:04.220  -->  00:05:10.380
Well go ahead and do is jump to our studio and install our postscripts sequel which would look something

80

00:05:10.380  -->  00:05:10.980
like this.

81

00:05:10.980  -->  00:05:15.510
Why don't we go out and jump to our studio now here in our studio.

82

00:05:15.510  -->  00:05:20.850
You would say install packages and then put in the package that you just discovered.

83

00:05:20.850  -->  00:05:29.250
In this case it was our postscripts sequel and make sure my capitalization is right that last else should

84

00:05:29.250  -->  00:05:30.920
be a capital L.

85

00:05:31.050  -->  00:05:33.570
Then you just go ahead and install that package

86

00:05:36.150  -->  00:05:38.060
once that package is done installing.

87

00:05:38.070  -->  00:05:46.270
You can go ahead and do is say library and call our postscripts sequel.

88

00:05:46.410  -->  00:05:51.760
Once you've loaded up that package by calling library you can then ask help for that package.

89

00:05:51.810  -->  00:05:58.860
Now something to know is if I were to just say help our postscripts sequel I may not get any results

90

00:05:59.310  -->  00:06:04.350
I may get something that says no documentation for that library but then it suggests try question mark

91

00:06:04.340  -->  00:06:05.010
question mark.

92

00:06:05.010  -->  00:06:09.700
Are post-career sequel which is basically going to search the available documentation.

93

00:06:09.720  -->  00:06:16.170
That's a good second step here and then what you'll see is you get some search results in the documentation

94

00:06:16.170  -->  00:06:21.060
over here for connections to put our postscripts sequel.

95

00:06:21.060  -->  00:06:25.140
You can see here that the player library actually has a way to connect to post-career sequel on its

96

00:06:25.170  -->  00:06:32.700
own but you'll also see our PostScript sequel such as class host sequel connection driver object etc.

97

00:06:32.710  -->  00:06:32.860
.

98

00:06:33.000  -->  00:06:39.030
Now what you can do is click on one of these such as class post sequel connection and then read up on

99

00:06:39.030  -->  00:06:44.070
the documentation and it usually if you scroll all the way down will be some simple examples.

100

00:06:44.430  -->  00:06:49.710
What's probably more useful to you instead of just searching through the documentation for some specific

101

00:06:49.710  -->  00:06:50.560
knowledge.

102

00:06:50.580  -->  00:06:54.360
It's usually easier to actually just do a google search for examples.

103

00:06:54.360  -->  00:06:57.180
Let's go ahead and hop back to the browser with Google.

104

00:06:57.720  -->  00:06:59.770
All right here I am back at Google.

105

00:06:59.850  -->  00:07:05.400
Now that we've installed the our PostScript sequel library package and we've been able to actually search

106

00:07:05.400  -->  00:07:07.300
documentation within our studio.

107

00:07:07.330  -->  00:07:12.360
Well we probably want is not just specific documentation but a little tutorial where we can go ahead

108

00:07:12.360  -->  00:07:21.630
and do that through Google just say our postscripts sequel and then usually in the top hits you'll find

109

00:07:21.630  -->  00:07:28.080
something from our bloggers and our bloggers is a great Web site with hints tips and different little

110

00:07:28.080  -->  00:07:31.460
mini tutorials on getting started with different packages and are.

111

00:07:31.580  -->  00:07:33.660
And in this case this looks like exactly what we want.

112

00:07:33.660  -->  00:07:35.910
Getting started with post gresse sequel in our.

113

00:07:35.910  -->  00:07:37.850
You'll go ahead and click that link.

114

00:07:38.190  -->  00:07:40.280
It'll take you to our bloggers page.

115

00:07:40.290  -->  00:07:42.570
I highly recommend you check out our bloggers.

116

00:07:42.670  -->  00:07:47.080
Well by now if you'd done some Googling around you've found out about our bloggers.

117

00:07:47.110  -->  00:07:49.680
There's even a list here with our jobs.

118

00:07:49.680  -->  00:07:54.270
In case you're looking for a job as a data scientist if all the knowledge you've just gained from this

119

00:07:54.270  -->  00:07:54.870
course.

120

00:07:55.050  -->  00:08:01.320
Well let's go ahead and hop back from that aside and check out this tutorial.

121

00:08:01.320  -->  00:08:06.840
You'll notice here this is a full fledged tutorial on how to install software start up a new server

122

00:08:06.840  -->  00:08:09.960
set up new users in PGE Advento fear.

123

00:08:10.050  -->  00:08:13.120
If you're familiar post-career sequel that makes sense to you.

124

00:08:13.140  -->  00:08:18.240
PGE admin is the most common interface with postscripts sequel but what we're really looking for.

125

00:08:18.440  -->  00:08:24.840
If we go ahead and zoom in here is the connection with R and basically you can just copy and paste this

126

00:08:25.050  -->  00:08:29.010
and figure out how to connect with are using the R postgresql package.

127

00:08:29.130  -->  00:08:34.110
And here we can see all you have to do is call the our postscripts sequel package which either require

128

00:08:34.140  -->  00:08:35.600
or library.

129

00:08:35.730  -->  00:08:37.790
Then we create a connection.

130

00:08:37.820  -->  00:08:39.480
You have your password here.

131

00:08:39.660  -->  00:08:45.870
You say DBI driver called postscripts sequel and then you're going to say D-B connect your database

132

00:08:45.870  -->  00:08:50.850
name your host your ports your user and your password.

133

00:08:50.850  -->  00:08:56.820
If you don't know this particular information like your port number the D-B name your host or user then

134

00:08:56.820  -->  00:09:02.670
I would highly suggest you start talking to whoever's in charge of administrating or maintaining your

135

00:09:02.670  -->  00:09:03.510
database.

136

00:09:03.540  -->  00:09:09.000
They should know this sort of information here in order to help you get connected to that database.

137

00:09:09.120  -->  00:09:13.470
And then there's more to Toro's and how to write a load of our postgresql sequel and after checking

138

00:09:13.470  -->  00:09:18.050
out this data you should begin to have a good understanding of how to actually use this.

139

00:09:18.060  -->  00:09:23.280
Our postgresql library and basically this entire approach of Google searching.

140

00:09:23.280  -->  00:09:28.590
Getting the package checking out the documentation and then looking around for some tutorials is really

141

00:09:28.590  -->  00:09:29.400
the best way.

142

00:09:29.400  -->  00:09:35.310
When you're dealing with sequel with are there just so many different types of sequel engines that it's

143

00:09:35.310  -->  00:09:41.910
kind of unreasonable to go to one source as your only source for learning how to connect with R and

144

00:09:41.910  -->  00:09:42.850
sequel.

145

00:09:42.870  -->  00:09:46.420
Most likely what you're going to do is a little bit of independent research.

146

00:09:46.560  -->  00:09:51.570
If you ever have any questions on this feel free to post the Q8 forums and me and the other students

147

00:09:51.570  -->  00:09:53.460
are going to be happy to help you out.

148

00:09:53.460  -->  00:09:56.070
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
