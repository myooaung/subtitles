00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:05.630
Hello everyone and welcome to the K means clustering project solutions lecture in this lecture video

2

00:00:05.640  -->  00:00:09.870
we're going to go ahead and start working through the solutions for the Kamins clustering project.

3

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:12.360
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio to get started.

4

00:00:12.360  -->  00:00:14.040
All right here we are our studio.

5

00:00:14.040  -->  00:00:17.870
Remember that before we begin this project you need to have the C S V files.

6

00:00:17.880  -->  00:00:23.030
You can either download them using the link in the notebook or you can just download the CATV files

7

00:00:23.050  -->  00:00:25.630
are included in the notes download.

8

00:00:25.680  -->  00:00:30.370
Let's go ahead and continue by reading the CXXVI for this data.

9

00:00:30.390  -->  00:00:31.880
I'm going to make two data frames.

10

00:00:31.980  -->  00:00:40.890
If one reads CSFB and I want one quality read it for the first one and something else to know is that

11

00:00:40.890  -->  00:00:44.920
the separator for this is a semi-colon.

12

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:51.010
And then for DFI to I'm going to go ahead and say read C S V y quality.

13

00:00:51.040  -->  00:00:58.290
This is going to be the white wine and the separator here is going to be equal to the semi colon as

14

00:00:58.290  -->  00:00:59.680
well.

15

00:00:59.950  -->  00:01:05.610
Once we have those data frames Let's go ahead and just run the source here and print out the head of

16

00:01:05.610  -->  00:01:14.510
one of those data frames just call ahead if one if you look at the state of frame you'll notice you

17

00:01:14.510  -->  00:01:21.090
get a quality column alcohol sulfates chlorides etc. but we don't have as an actual label and that's

18

00:01:21.090  -->  00:01:26.340
because it assumes that you already know all the label for the y data.

19

00:01:26.340  -->  00:01:29.280
Here is Redwine versus the two.

20

00:01:29.280  -->  00:01:33.420
They're all white wine because we don't have a red or white wine label.

21

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:37.230
We're gonna go ahead and do is apply a label to these data frames.

22

00:01:37.720  -->  00:01:39.490
We're going to show you how to do that.

23

00:01:39.540  -->  00:01:49.740
You can say if one had a label call and then just say supply the IF one and you can go ahead of any

24

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:50.720
column in here.

25

00:01:50.730  -->  00:01:52.200
Ph is fine.

26

00:01:52.500  -->  00:02:00.350
And we can just as a simple anonymous function say X and then pass in the if one is red.

27

00:02:00.360  -->  00:02:02.290
So I'm just going to go ahead and return red.

28

00:02:02.550  -->  00:02:08.940
And basically what this is doing is it just says for every single row in the PH column return red and

29

00:02:08.940  -->  00:02:16.230
assigned that to the label column which makes sense because now if I print the head of the one all the

30

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:21.120
labels for this entire data frame are red which makes sense because everyone in here is red.

31

00:02:21.210  -->  00:02:25.330
We're going to do the exact same thing for DNA too.

32

00:02:25.800  -->  00:02:32.880
Except I'm going to change it to white and I'm going to make sure to say too.

33

00:02:33.150  -->  00:02:33.570
All right.

34

00:02:33.620  -->  00:02:34.710
No that's fixed.

35

00:02:34.710  -->  00:02:40.520
Let's go ahead and combine the if one of these two into a single data frame called wine.

36

00:02:40.680  -->  00:02:48.380
And I can do that when we go in and clear the consul with the R bind function that's going to say our

37

00:02:48.390  -->  00:02:53.490
bind for row binds and I'm going to pass and the one and the two.

38

00:02:54.510  -->  00:03:00.000
And now we have the wine which is we can see if in a global environment the addition of DFA one of the

39

00:03:00.120  -->  00:03:00.740
two.

40

00:03:00.930  -->  00:03:05.670
And luckily it also has labels now that we have all our data set up.

41

00:03:05.670  -->  00:03:09.270
Let's go ahead and move on to exploratory data analysis.

42

00:03:09.320  -->  00:03:13.590
In this phase we're just going to draw a couple of histograms and scatter plots to get a better idea

43

00:03:13.590  -->  00:03:16.290
of what our data actually looks like.

44

00:03:16.330  -->  00:03:23.520
Now go ahead and start by calling the G-G plot library and then the first thing we asked you to do is

45

00:03:23.520  -->  00:03:27.290
to create a histogram of residual sugar from the wind data.

46

00:03:27.520  -->  00:03:30.870
And I wanted to color bright red and white wines.

47

00:03:31.450  -->  00:03:38.490
I don't know you wouldn't say P.L. pasand G-G plot that's in the newly created wine which has all my

48

00:03:38.490  -->  00:03:45.360
wines both red and white and I want a histogram which means I only need the next and I want to do the

49

00:03:45.360  -->  00:03:46.440
residual column

50

00:03:49.480  -->  00:03:56.570
all the residual sugar feature and I want this to be a histogram.

51

00:03:56.570  -->  00:04:02.340
So going to say GM histogram and going to add some additional arguments here because I want the actual

52

00:04:02.340  -->  00:04:08.070
fill color to be by my label column that I just made.

53

00:04:08.070  -->  00:04:14.390
And then as you probably know by now I always like having the calorie black for the outline.

54

00:04:14.470  -->  00:04:20.010
Now let's go ahead and indicate we want 50 bins that are P.L..

55

00:04:20.180  -->  00:04:24.530
What I'm going to go ahead and do is add a little bit to the people.

56

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:33.510
This was optional you actually have to do this but I wanted to change the colors by using a scale fill

57

00:04:33.510  -->  00:04:34.020
manual.

58

00:04:34.020  -->  00:04:39.660
And the reason I wanted to change the colors was because I want to colors that just reflects the red

59

00:04:39.660  -->  00:04:41.340
and white wine colors.

60

00:04:41.340  -->  00:04:49.110
So I decided to go to the Hexe picker com Web site where you could pick out hecks colors and then I

61

00:04:49.110  -->  00:04:53.270
chose one cream and one red for the red and white values.

62

00:04:53.520  -->  00:04:57.660
Then I'm going to go ahead and say plus theme.

63

00:04:57.660  -->  00:05:05.690
BW Let's go ahead and answer that and then we see here we click zoom the actual histogram and notice

64

00:05:05.700  -->  00:05:12.360
now the labels are very nicely visualized because the red corresponds to red wine and the white correspond

65

00:05:12.420  -->  00:05:13.320
the white wine.

66

00:05:13.360  -->  00:05:18.130
That's also why it's nice to have the actual black outline.

67

00:05:18.170  -->  00:05:20.300
All right so it can we actually tell here.

68

00:05:20.520  -->  00:05:27.620
Well it looks to me that the Red Wine tends to be have I have a lower residual sugar count.

69

00:05:29.030  -->  00:05:34.310
And after a certain point there are basically no red wines that have anything higher than like 10 or

70

00:05:34.310  -->  00:05:37.910
whatever that residual sugar metric is.

71

00:05:38.430  -->  00:05:42.990
Now you should also keep in mind that this may also be occurring because there's a lot less samples

72

00:05:42.990  -->  00:05:45.060
of red wine than white wine.

73

00:05:45.060  -->  00:05:52.110
Notice we only have about 6500 red wine samples and almost 5000 white wine samples.

74

00:05:52.170  -->  00:05:56.460
So that may skew our data a little bit and most likely what's going to happen is it's going to be hard

75

00:05:56.460  -->  00:06:02.400
to detect red wines if there's not any particular feature that makes them very separable.

76

00:06:03.060  -->  00:06:11.190
Let's go ahead and do another histogram by the citric acid column or feature in a go ahead and clear

77

00:06:11.190  -->  00:06:17.400
the console up on my arrow key to see the last P.L. command but in this case I'm just going to change

78

00:06:17.400  -->  00:06:25.380
residual sugar to citric acid.

79

00:06:27.330  -->  00:06:30.090
That's all going to stay the same.

80

00:06:30.540  -->  00:06:35.970
And then I'm going to call the same command here and that will get him a histogram out.

81

00:06:36.240  -->  00:06:39.400
Again you can always reference the notes in case you need any of this code.

82

00:06:39.990  -->  00:06:43.550
All right looking at this histogram it doesn't tell us too much.

83

00:06:43.560  -->  00:06:50.870
Maybe that there's a higher concentration in the 0.2 5 range for citric acid of white wine but this

84

00:06:50.870  -->  00:06:56.430
is probably just due to the fact that there's more white wine counts than red wine counts.

85

00:06:56.430  -->  00:07:02.240
Other than that it looks like the peak is a little hard to tell whether or not that's actually a strong

86

00:07:02.250  -->  00:07:05.110
feature of white versus red wine.

87

00:07:06.120  -->  00:07:12.460
Let's continue with one last histogram of the alcohol.

88

00:07:12.500  -->  00:07:15.180
This is going to be the actual alcohol level.

89

00:07:16.080  -->  00:07:18.840
I'm going to again just press up on my arrow keys.

90

00:07:18.840  -->  00:07:23.450
This is basically the exact same plot and just changing the x axis.

91

00:07:23.880  -->  00:07:33.830
I'm going to make my history and by alcohol and then call with my custom colors in my custom theme.

92

00:07:33.840  -->  00:07:34.550
All right it's good.

93

00:07:34.620  -->  00:07:37.890
Click zoom here and here again.

94

00:07:37.880  -->  00:07:45.210
Now we have alcohol versus counts the percent of the alcohol and there's really nothing that we can

95

00:07:45.300  -->  00:07:51.280
truly tell here as far as distinguishing between red and white wine.

96

00:07:51.380  -->  00:07:53.820
Somebody that's really interesting to know is that this Instagram.

97

00:07:53.850  -->  00:07:58.580
It almost seems like it goes up and then down up down up down up down.

98

00:07:58.830  -->  00:08:05.280
And that's probably because as far as labeling percentages on wine it's usually some sort of whole number

99

00:08:05.340  -->  00:08:07.080
or a point five number.

100

00:08:07.080  -->  00:08:13.170
And that means values in-between such as point seven five point two five are probably not there because

101

00:08:13.170  -->  00:08:17.340
usually when you read a bottle of wine or any bottle of alcohol the percentage of the alcohol is going

102

00:08:17.340  -->  00:08:21.090
to be in point five units or just in a whole number of units.

103

00:08:21.180  -->  00:08:25.250
That's where you might see this up down in the histogram.

104

00:08:25.290  -->  00:08:28.550
Now let's go ahead and move on to a scatterplot.

105

00:08:28.620  -->  00:08:36.620
I'm going to go ahead and clear the cons. And I'm going to start by calling Gigi plots on my wind data

106

00:08:36.620  -->  00:08:39.830
set in the aesthetic glare.

107

00:08:39.840  -->  00:08:49.040
I'm going to say X is citric acid and we want to do Sitrick sugur residual sugar versus citric acid

108

00:08:49.130  -->  00:08:49.770
.

109

00:08:49.960  -->  00:08:52.280
That means y is going to be the residual sugar

110

00:08:57.650  -->  00:09:04.610
then I'm going to go ahead and say plus geometer score points and I want to go ahead and color this

111

00:09:07.400  -->  00:09:10.350
by the label column.

112

00:09:10.390  -->  00:09:16.390
I'll go ahead and also say that equals zero point two.

113

00:09:16.560  -->  00:09:26.730
And then finally after that I'm going to go ahead and say P.L. Plus the scale color manual pass in those

114

00:09:26.730  -->  00:09:34.570
custom values again looks go ahead to make that a vector by using the combined function.

115

00:09:35.580  -->  00:09:40.470
And then I'm going to call a theme but in this case I'm actually going to call a theme dark because

116

00:09:40.830  -->  00:09:46.700
I notice these cream or white points were a little hard to tell against a completely white or gray background

117

00:09:46.730  -->  00:09:46.940
.

118

00:09:47.120  -->  00:09:49.430
That's why I chose a dark theme for this.

119

00:09:50.070  -->  00:09:50.380
All right.

120

00:09:50.420  -->  00:09:52.690
Let's take a look at this plot.

121

00:09:52.740  -->  00:09:54.060
This is our scatterplot.

122

00:09:54.120  -->  00:10:00.300
It looks like we just have one outlier over near like the 60 level of residual sugar.

123

00:10:00.330  -->  00:10:06.890
You may want to drop that out or relabel your axes on the Y scale to actually just go to a forty's so

124

00:10:06.890  -->  00:10:09.710
that we can see the data a little better.

125

00:10:10.190  -->  00:10:15.960
As far as what we can tell here this is going to be pretty hard to distinguish based off of just citric

126

00:10:15.960  -->  00:10:20.210
acid level the red or white wine label.

127

00:10:20.280  -->  00:10:25.140
And that basically means our clustering algorithm is probably going to have a hard time clustering wines

128

00:10:25.350  -->  00:10:30.920
around here just because there's so much overlap and so much noise.

129

00:10:30.960  -->  00:10:36.570
Let's go ahead and get another picture by creating a scatterplot of the acidity versus the residual

130

00:10:36.570  -->  00:10:38.060
sugar.

131

00:10:38.120  -->  00:10:40.400
To go ahead and clear this.

132

00:10:40.980  -->  00:10:52.260
It's called G-G plots in English going to change my X to be the volatile acidity

133

00:10:54.890  -->  00:11:03.170
versus residual sugar we'll leave everything else the same and I'm going to go ahead and call the scale

134

00:11:03.170  -->  00:11:10.240
Klare manual and then theme dark Let's go ahead and plot that out and zoom in on it.

135

00:11:10.250  -->  00:11:14.790
All right looking at this we may have a distinguishing feature here.

136

00:11:14.840  -->  00:11:20.950
It looks like there's not too many white wines that have in a city the level of above zero point four

137

00:11:21.290  -->  00:11:26.900
that might help or clustering Alvah algorithm cluster red wines and separate them from white wines.

138

00:11:26.960  -->  00:11:28.580
It looks like there is some noise here.

139

00:11:28.580  -->  00:11:34.490
However Billos are 0.4 again is probably going to be hard to distinguish between the red and white for

140

00:11:34.520  -->  00:11:41.300
classing algorithm that also maybe just because there's wine such as rosé or some sort of mix between

141

00:11:41.380  -->  00:11:46.910
a red and white color and the clustering algorithm based off the features will have a hard time telling

142

00:11:46.910  -->  00:11:51.500
it because they kind of belong to both classes.

143

00:11:51.530  -->  00:11:57.800
Now if you were in the wine business or had domain knowledge on wine that means you would probably choose

144

00:11:57.800  -->  00:12:03.650
k equal to three maybe red white and rosé that might be interesting to explore as we continue on the

145

00:12:03.650  -->  00:12:04.830
project.

146

00:12:05.300  -->  00:12:11.000
Let's go ahead and continue this Baxi beginning to build everything we need for the model.

147

00:12:11.000  -->  00:12:13.720
We're going to push this over to the right.

148

00:12:13.730  -->  00:12:20.750
Remember that k means algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm meaning it doesn't take in any labels it

149

00:12:20.750  -->  00:12:26.600
tries to discover the labels for you in a sense which means the cluster data that we're going to feed

150

00:12:26.750  -->  00:12:32.360
the Kamins algorithm is just going to be columns 1 through 12 there's 13 columns if we have that label

151

00:12:32.360  -->  00:12:36.510
column I'm going to just pass columns 1 through 12 the actual features.

152

00:12:36.770  -->  00:12:42.300
Let's go ahead and make sure that this was correct.

153

00:12:42.680  -->  00:12:43.460
It looks like we're good.

154

00:12:43.460  -->  00:12:47.840
We cut it off at the quality There's no label column here that all works out.

155

00:12:47.840  -->  00:12:54.620
Now we're going to go ahead and do is build the clusters going to make an object called Wine cluster

156

00:12:56.460  -->  00:12:58.040
called the Kamins function

157

00:13:01.160  -->  00:13:04.090
and then just pass in the features.

158

00:13:04.520  -->  00:13:09.390
And in this case I can just pass in that clus data object we just made.

159

00:13:09.710  -->  00:13:14.190
So we'd have to actually call wine there and just say clus data.

160

00:13:14.650  -->  00:13:19.630
That's all the features and I'm going to set the center's argument which is the K argument.

161

00:13:19.630  -->  00:13:23.870
How many actual groupings we want to be too.

162

00:13:25.460  -->  00:13:32.030
And then I can go ahead and just say print's wine cluster and you notice there's a lot of stuff we can

163

00:13:32.030  -->  00:13:42.410
call off of this but I'm just going to call the cluster centers and this will show us the center values

164

00:13:42.470  -->  00:13:44.850
for each feature for each cluster.

165

00:13:44.870  -->  00:13:49.030
This is a little hard to interpret directly because as multi-dimensional data.

166

00:13:49.430  -->  00:13:56.030
But essentially you can think if you are plotting fixed assiduity versus volatile acidity this would

167

00:13:56.030  -->  00:14:00.070
be the center coordinate for the group 1.

168

00:14:00.290  -->  00:14:03.020
And this would be the center coordinate for group 2.

169

00:14:03.770  -->  00:14:08.780
But you should know since we're dealing with multidimensional data it's going to be pretty hard to make

170

00:14:08.780  -->  00:14:13.280
some sort of visualization that shows 12 degrees of data.

171

00:14:13.280  -->  00:14:18.510
Let's go ahead and attempt to evaluate how well our model actually performs.

172

00:14:18.530  -->  00:14:23.270
Again I can't stress this enough that with unsupervised learning you're probably not going to have the

173

00:14:23.270  -->  00:14:26.930
luxury of knowing the label of your data beforehand.

174

00:14:27.080  -->  00:14:30.500
Otherwise what would be the point of using an unsupervised learning algorithm.

175

00:14:30.620  -->  00:14:34.910
But in this case we're doing this that where we can get a little more learning and squeeze a little

176

00:14:34.910  -->  00:14:37.830
more learning out of this Kamins algorithm lecture.

177

00:14:38.000  -->  00:14:49.550
We'll use the table command to actually say wine label and then call wine cluster and then call the

178

00:14:49.550  -->  00:14:56.630
cluster object out of that wine cluster list and see the clusters themselves looking at this table we

179

00:14:56.620  -->  00:14:58.690
can almost treat it like a confusion matrix.

180

00:14:58.710  -->  00:15:03.260
Others just keep in mind we weren't doing classification we were just doing an unsupervised clustering

181

00:15:03.320  -->  00:15:04.300
algorithm.

182

00:15:04.400  -->  00:15:04.820
All right.

183

00:15:04.820  -->  00:15:10.910
And looking at these results that we are lucky to have the labels for we can see that red is seems to

184

00:15:10.900  -->  00:15:15.870
be easier to cluster together due to its features which makes a little sense given our previous visual

185

00:15:15.870  -->  00:15:16.510
ization.

186

00:15:16.520  -->  00:15:23.360
There were definitely some features where Red was kind of it pushed aside from white either in the histograms

187

00:15:23.360  -->  00:15:25.300
or in the actual scatter plots.

188

00:15:25.340  -->  00:15:27.780
There seems to be a lot of noise with white wines.

189

00:15:27.830  -->  00:15:33.110
And like I mentioned before this could possibly do to rosé wines being categorized as white wine or

190

00:15:33.110  -->  00:15:38.090
really not sure because we didn't have those labels or any pictures of the wine to begin with and these

191

00:15:38.090  -->  00:15:45.080
rosé wines may still have the qualities of a red wine and maybe accidentally label do some noise between

192

00:15:45.080  -->  00:15:46.350
the features.

193

00:15:46.370  -->  00:15:51.280
Overall this makes sense since wine is essentially just fermented great juice and we're just using chemical

194

00:15:51.290  -->  00:15:57.130
measurements and that may not actually provide any good correlations between whether the wine is fully

195

00:15:57.130  -->  00:15:58.670
red or fully white.

196

00:15:59.090  -->  00:16:04.310
And it's important to note here that came in Tammy's algorithm can only give you the clusters it cannot

197

00:16:04.310  -->  00:16:08.790
directly tell you what the labels should be or even how many clusters you should have.

198

00:16:08.840  -->  00:16:14.020
We're just lucky because we know that we expect two types of wine in this particular case.

199

00:16:14.090  -->  00:16:17.000
However this is where a domain knowledge would really come into play.

200

00:16:17.000  -->  00:16:21.680
That means if you're a wine expert or you knew where the data came from and you could talk to people

201

00:16:21.880  -->  00:16:27.580
ask them questions such as Do you expect just red and white wine or does BET expect red white and rosé

202

00:16:27.590  -->  00:16:33.310
etc. then you could actually begin to interpret the clusters in a much better fashion.

203

00:16:33.830  -->  00:16:38.330
And then you'd be able to actually use the information such as the centers of the clusters to perform

204

00:16:38.540  -->  00:16:41.890
some sort of business decisions as far as classifying right and why.

205

00:16:41.890  -->  00:16:45.750
Maybe what customers like and acidity levels et cetera.

206

00:16:46.280  -->  00:16:46.850
OK.

207

00:16:47.090  -->  00:16:50.860
I hope you enjoyed this project should have been pretty straightforward.

208

00:16:51.080  -->  00:16:56.150
The only thing that I really want to make sure you understand is how to called Kamins function in order

209

00:16:56.140  -->  00:17:01.940
to create clusters and then also understand this is an unsupervised learning algorithm meaning you feed

210

00:17:01.940  -->  00:17:08.360
it unlabeled data and it attempts to group that and data into similar groups.

211

00:17:08.360  -->  00:17:11.540
All right thanks so much everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
