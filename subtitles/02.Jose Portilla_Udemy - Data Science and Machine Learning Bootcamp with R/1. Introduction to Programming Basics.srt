Hello everyone and welcome to the programming basics section of this course in this section of the course

2

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:10,690
.

3

00:00:10,710  -->  00:00:16,010
We're going to start understanding how to program with our using things such as logical operators if

4

00:00:16,020  -->  00:00:21,000
else else's statements conditional statements while loops for loops and how to create functions and

5

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:21,640
are.

6

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:26,430
If you're already familiar programming in another language what's probably the best course of action

7

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:31,620
for you is to actually visit the notebooks first for each lecture and then see if you actually need

8

00:00:31,620  -->  00:00:36,620
to review any of the material or if you just need it to quickly learn the syntax from the note.

9

00:00:36,780  -->  00:00:41,640
In a lot of the lectures and the section of the course I will take the beginning of the lecture to quickly

10

00:00:41,640  -->  00:00:47,370
explain the syntax for experienced programmers and then I will slowly go step by step through the actual

11

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:52,890
concept for people that are never programmed before you have two training exercises in the section of

12

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:53,590
the course.

13

00:00:53,730  -->  00:00:55,640
So best of luck with them.

14

00:00:55,650  -->  00:00:57,970
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
