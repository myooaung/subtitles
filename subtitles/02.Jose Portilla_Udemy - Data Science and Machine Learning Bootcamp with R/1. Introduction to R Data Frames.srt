Hello everyone and welcome to the art data frames section of this course and this section of the Course

2

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:17,010
will start off by learning the basics of the data frame how to index and select data from a data frame

Well after we learn how to work with data frames we'll have a data frame training exercise to test your
