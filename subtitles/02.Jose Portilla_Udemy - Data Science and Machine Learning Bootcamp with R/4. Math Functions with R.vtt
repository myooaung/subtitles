00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:06.180
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on math functions with our We've talked a bit about some built

2

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:07.420
in features in our.

3

00:00:07.620  -->  00:00:11.670
Now we're going to talk about a few math functions with tar that you may find useful.

4

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:14.160
Let's go ahead and jump to our studio.

5

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:18.640
All right so here our studio this is just a few math functions.

6

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:23.190
And then at the end of this I'll show you a great resource you can get a full list of all the math functions

7

00:00:23.250  -->  00:00:26.580
available in our person we're going to discuss.

8

00:00:26.640  -->  00:00:29.870
ABS which computes the absolute value.

9

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:38.880
So for instance if I go ahead and say abs of two I get two back and if I get abs of negative two I get

10

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:45.510
again positive two is the absolute value since the distance from zero I can also pass this to an entire

11

00:00:45.540  -->  00:00:46.340
vector.

12

00:00:46.590  -->  00:00:57.060
So for instance negative to negative 3 0 4 and I pass ABS of V I will get the absolute value and it

13

00:00:57.060  -->  00:01:02.430
will go ahead and broadcast that operation to every element in that vector.

14

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:06.310
Next I want to show some We've actually seen some earlier.

15

00:01:06.660  -->  00:01:12.580
You can go ahead and just say some of the vector and or return the son of some of the vector.

16

00:01:12.630  -->  00:01:17.040
You can also do mean of a vector they'll compute the arithmetic mean.

17

00:01:17.040  -->  00:01:19.810
And we can also use round to round values.

18

00:01:20.160  -->  00:01:27.980
So imagine I have a value for instance 2.3 for whatever I have all these other floating point numbers

19

00:01:27.990  -->  00:01:30.700
pass the decimal point that maybe I don't want to show.

20

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:34.880
So I can actually use round to do that to prevent from showing it.

21

00:01:34.880  -->  00:01:42.400
That is the way this works is you end up putting the number you want around and then a second argument

22

00:01:42.400  -->  00:01:42.420
.

23

00:01:42.420  -->  00:01:46.020
Digits and how many digits you want passed.

24

00:01:46.020  -->  00:01:46.850
Decimal points.

25

00:01:46.860  -->  00:01:52.440
So if I want to just pass a decimal point I just put it to you actually have to specify digits.

26

00:01:52.470  -->  00:01:56.940
If you just leave it as the second argument for instance 3.

27

00:01:57.600  -->  00:02:03.000
Let's go ahead and put in a number above five so we can see how it rounds.

28

00:02:03.300  -->  00:02:09.150
I notice this gets around the two two point three seven eight with three digits pass the decimal place

29

00:02:09.150  -->  00:02:10.320
.

30

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:11.180
OK.

31

00:02:11.370  -->  00:02:16.620
Now what I want to show you quickly is how you can Google search for a great cheat sheet that has a

32

00:02:16.620  -->  00:02:20.980
list of all the math functions and various other functions with are.

33

00:02:21.570  -->  00:02:26.270
So let's go ahead and jump to a browser on a good and open up Chrome browser.

34

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:29.100
OK so here I am at Google Chrome.

35

00:02:29.100  -->  00:02:34.550
All you have typed in is our reference card search for that.

36

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:40.380
And your first pop up or your first entry in the search results should be this our reference card Crann

37

00:02:40.880  -->  00:02:47.280
code and click on that and you'll get a PTF of the short reference card with a bunch of useful references

38

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:51.810
and built in features and functions in our including file input output.

39

00:02:51.840  -->  00:02:55.590
Getting help data creation slicing extracting data.

40

00:02:55.700  -->  00:02:57.670
It is election manipulation.

41

00:02:57.900  -->  00:03:02.160
And like I mentioned all the various math functions you can use with are.

42

00:03:02.220  -->  00:03:07.320
This is a great reference card to have as you're learning how to program with are and need a reference

43

00:03:07.370  -->  00:03:10.630
either a quick shortcuts or how to get help with are.

44

00:03:10.830  -->  00:03:11.510
OK.

45

00:03:11.760  -->  00:03:13.030
That's it for this lecture.

46

00:03:13.050  -->  00:03:14.730
Go ahead and make sure you download this.

47

00:03:14.770  -->  00:03:19.410
Our reference card is going to be really useful throughout your learning process.

48

00:03:19.410  -->  00:03:21.400
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
