00:00:01,950  -->  00:00:06,630
Welcome to the Windows installation procedure to lecture in this lecture we're going to be going over

2

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:11,940
how to install our in our studio which is the main development environment we're going to be using for

3

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:13,150
this course.

4

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:17,490
So let's go ahead and get started by opening up your browser.

5

00:00:18,290  -->  00:00:18,680
OK.

6

00:00:18,690  -->  00:00:20,700
So here I am at a web browser.

7

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:26,010
Go ahead and go to Google or your favorite search engine and what you going to do is search for our

8

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:31,580
studio and it should take you to w w w r studio dot com.

9

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:37,320
So our studio is development environment and user interface for our that we're going to be using.

10

00:00:37,320  -->  00:00:41,360
So we're going to do is go ahead and download our and our studio.

11

00:00:41,530  -->  00:00:45,870
There's a free open source version of our studio in an enterprise version.

12

00:00:45,900  -->  00:00:48,070
We're just going to go ahead and use the free open source.

13

00:00:48,070  -->  00:00:50,780
It's one of the most popular ideas for our.

14

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:56,160
So you're going to go ahead and do is on the very first page you should see some of that says like download

15

00:00:56,160  -->  00:00:57,340
our studio.

16

00:00:57,510  -->  00:00:59,330
Go ahead and click on that.

17

00:00:59,460  -->  00:01:00,890
We'll take you to this page.

18

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:05,280
And if you just go ahead and scroll down what we're looking for is the open source EDITION.

19

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:08,730
We're not going to download the commercial license because that when you have to pay for it.

20

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:10,890
So we're looking for this free version.

21

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:17,610
And when you click download our studio desktop right there they'll take you to this new page and this

22

00:01:17,610  -->  00:01:22,720
page is just the download page for our studio so you can go ahead and check with the link here.

23

00:01:22,740  -->  00:01:27,120
It's our studio dot com slash product slash our studio slash download.

24

00:01:27,420  -->  00:01:32,050
And if you'll notice here they'll say our studio requires some sort of version of our.

25

00:01:32,370  -->  00:01:38,010
And what you're going to do since we don't have are yet installed as you can say click here.

26

00:01:38,050  -->  00:01:40,080
So you'll notice at the link you can download it here.

27

00:01:40,080  -->  00:01:43,770
Go ahead and click on that and it should take you to this page.

28

00:01:43,770  -->  00:01:49,830
Now this is the Crann our studio dot com and you'll see here it says download and install our.

29

00:01:49,860  -->  00:01:54,410
Since we're on the Windows installation we'll go ahead and click download are for Windows.

30

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:59,670
Click on that and then what you're going to do is go ahead and choose the correct subdirectory.

31

00:01:59,720  -->  00:02:02,190
So this is our first time installing our.

32

00:02:02,220  -->  00:02:07,120
We're going to go ahead and do is select the winery's for the base distribution.

33

00:02:07,170  -->  00:02:12,070
And again this is what you want to do to install our For the first time.

34

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:16,210
So let's go ahead and click on that.

35

00:02:16,350  -->  00:02:19,710
Once you've clicked on that it should take you to a link that looks like this.

36

00:02:19,740  -->  00:02:23,320
And we're just going to go ahead and download our.

37

00:02:23,320  -->  00:02:24,020
OK.

38

00:02:24,330  -->  00:02:29,300
Now I'm going to go ahead and fast forward for the download to finish.

39

00:02:29,460  -->  00:02:31,170
OK so my download is complete.

40

00:02:31,260  -->  00:02:35,810
I'm just going to go ahead and click on the executable file.

41

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:39,780
You may need to allow it to change things on your PC.

42

00:02:39,780  -->  00:02:41,530
Go ahead and click yes.

43

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:47,220
Select the language for installation and then basically just follow the setup wizard should be pretty

44

00:02:47,230  -->  00:02:48,250
straightforward.

45

00:02:48,600  -->  00:02:51,240
You can just essentially select all the default.

46

00:02:51,260  -->  00:02:52,430
This should work for you.

47

00:02:52,800  -->  00:02:55,240
And just go ahead and select everything here.

48

00:02:55,320  -->  00:03:01,560
The 32 bit and 64 bit files doesn't really matter it's gonna install both even if you have just a 64

49

00:03:01,570  -->  00:03:02,630
or 32.

50

00:03:02,630  -->  00:03:04,740
Do you want to save a couple of megabytes of space.

51

00:03:04,740  -->  00:03:08,370
You can just choose either 64 or just the 32.

52

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:09,870
Going to go and do that.

53

00:03:09,900  -->  00:03:16,140
Go ahead and just select the defaults unless you want to customize startup select next go ahead and

54

00:03:16,140  -->  00:03:19,530
just click continue here and select next.

55

00:03:19,570  -->  00:03:24,060
There is some additional tax I'm just going to go ahead and create a desktop icon so I can easily launch

56

00:03:24,060  -->  00:03:24,570
it.

57

00:03:24,720  -->  00:03:30,510
And I'm also going to associate our data of our data files so we'll go ahead and select next.

58

00:03:30,900  -->  00:03:33,480
And that's all there is to it it's pretty quick.

59

00:03:33,480  -->  00:03:37,380
So you can just go ahead and extract the files and wait for it to install.

60

00:03:37,410  -->  00:03:43,500
Go ahead and fast forward through this install process.

61

00:03:43,590  -->  00:03:44,020
OK.

62

00:03:44,040  -->  00:03:48,470
So are is all done stalling going to go ahead and select finish.

63

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:53,940
So now that we have our Fool installed we can go back and finish installing our studio.

64

00:03:53,940  -->  00:03:57,020
So our is that language that we're going to be developing in.

65

00:03:57,230  -->  00:04:00,150
And the actual environment is our studio.

66

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:02,910
So let's go ahead and download our studio desktop.

67

00:04:03,240  -->  00:04:07,670
So you'll see here there's a bunch of installers ready for you to use.

68

00:04:07,740  -->  00:04:11,110
I'm just going to go ahead and select the Windows Vista 7 8 or 10.

69

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:14,850
I'm on Windows 10 right now so I'll go in and click that installer.

70

00:04:14,850  -->  00:04:21,000
And again you should see our studio the executable file being installed.

71

00:04:21,000  -->  00:04:25,710
Go ahead and fast forward for that install or that download to finish excuse me.

72

00:04:26,580  -->  00:04:27,020
All right.

73

00:04:27,030  -->  00:04:28,470
Now that that's finished downloading.

74

00:04:28,500  -->  00:04:30,320
Let's go ahead and click it again.

75

00:04:30,370  -->  00:04:33,730
Go ahead don't allow our studio to make changes on your PC.

76

00:04:33,780  -->  00:04:35,300
It's a relatively simple wizard.

77

00:04:35,310  -->  00:04:40,070
Just go through the defaults install and that's all there is to it.

78

00:04:40,080  -->  00:04:43,190
Let's go ahead and jump to this installation of finishing

79

00:04:46,350  -->  00:04:49,440
and the our studio setup wizard has been finished.

80

00:04:49,470  -->  00:04:51,220
So you can go ahead and click Finish there.

81

00:04:51,480  -->  00:04:57,990
And now you can go ahead and do is search for our studio and make sure that it installed correctly in

82

00:04:57,990  -->  00:05:04,050
order to check the our studio installed correctly you can just simply search for it or ask Cortana depending

83

00:05:04,050  -->  00:05:05,830
on what version of Windows are you using.

84

00:05:06,210  -->  00:05:09,660
And just go ahead and type our studio.

85

00:05:09,780  -->  00:05:11,160
It's so one word.

86

00:05:11,160  -->  00:05:13,720
So our studio there's no space between our studio.

87

00:05:13,890  -->  00:05:19,090
You should see the desktop app pop up go to and click on it it will load.

88

00:05:19,350  -->  00:05:21,780
And this is what our studio looks like.

89

00:05:21,780  -->  00:05:26,760
So just to make sure everything's working correctly and that you installed ours as well you should see

90

00:05:26,820  -->  00:05:33,690
the console for our pop up here later on then couple of next lectures we'll discuss our studio how to

91

00:05:33,690  -->  00:05:34,240
use it.

92

00:05:34,260  -->  00:05:35,600
Give you a little tour about it.

93

00:05:35,910  -->  00:05:43,770
But just to check that everything's working we can do is type print open parentheses and you'll see

94

00:05:43,770  -->  00:05:51,660
an automatic closing print sees also form for you single or double quote and you can say Hello World

95

00:05:51,670  -->  00:05:52,420
.

96

00:05:53,520  -->  00:05:59,310
Go ahead and click enter and then you should see the output print hello world and you've already written

97

00:05:59,310  -->  00:06:01,160
your first line of our code.

98

00:06:01,500  -->  00:06:02,360
OK.

99

00:06:02,500  -->  00:06:08,570
So go ahead and follow those directions to install our in our studio onto your Windows machine.

100

00:06:08,760  -->  00:06:10,540
Should be relatively straightforward.

101

00:06:10,560  -->  00:06:15,810
You can always check out the resources on our studios download page in case you have any questions.

102

00:06:15,810  -->  00:06:19,060
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
