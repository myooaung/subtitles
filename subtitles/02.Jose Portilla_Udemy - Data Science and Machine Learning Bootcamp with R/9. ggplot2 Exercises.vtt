00:00:00.960  -->  00:00:06.990
Well everyone now welcome to the Gigia to training exercise lecture and this lecture will go over the

2

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:09.870
Gigia plot to training exercise problems.

3

00:00:09.930  -->  00:00:13.640
Keep in mind that this is separate from the data visualization project.

4

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:18.450
These are just a few plots I want you to recreate in GZ plot to to get you to feel comfortable if she's

5

00:00:18.450  -->  00:00:21.160
your plot too and the grammar of graphics framework.

6

00:00:21.270  -->  00:00:26.310
Let's go ahead and jump to the notebook which is under the training exercises folder and it's called

7

00:00:26.310  -->  00:00:30.180
Gigia plus two exercises and the go to that note book now.

8

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:30.480
All right.

9

00:00:30.480  -->  00:00:35.910
Here I am at the notebook GZA plot to exercises and where you're going to do it just recreate the falling

10

00:00:35.910  -->  00:00:37.760
plots shown below.

11

00:00:37.770  -->  00:00:42.900
Don't worry if your plots don't match exactly what is shown below as far as theme or colors as long

12

00:00:42.900  -->  00:00:44.210
as you have a general understanding.

13

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:46.170
Geez you put two in the grammar of graphics.

14

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:47.610
You should be fine.

15

00:00:47.610  -->  00:00:52.980
In other important know that due to the HMO format some of these images may be distorted from the conversion

16

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:57.510
to a web format and most likely you're going to have a much nicer looking image when you produce these

17

00:00:57.510  -->  00:01:00.200
in our studio for the first few plots.

18

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:03.260
I want you to use the MPG data set.

19

00:01:03.360  -->  00:01:05.550
There's a histogram of highway mpg values.

20

00:01:05.580  -->  00:01:11.250
I want you to recreate and then I also want you to create a bar plot of car counts per manufacturer

21

00:01:11.250  -->  00:01:11.300
.

22

00:01:11.340  -->  00:01:16.130
What's the color film defined by the cylinder count so that it looks like this.

23

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:18.570
Here we have the count in the bar plot.

24

00:01:18.570  -->  00:01:24.150
And also you can see here that the factor of the cell there is necessary in order to color that cylinder

25

00:01:24.150  -->  00:01:24.930
count.

26

00:01:24.930  -->  00:01:29.960
Hopefully you can figure that out then you're going to switch the T-Rex housing data set that comes

27

00:01:29.960  -->  00:01:34.800
a cheesy plot to meaning you'll have to call the library G-G plot 2 first before we can actually see

28

00:01:34.800  -->  00:01:37.220
this T-Rex housing data set.

29

00:01:37.610  -->  00:01:42.090
Then what are you going to do is create a scatterplot of volume versus sales that will look something

30

00:01:42.090  -->  00:01:43.190
like this.

31

00:01:43.260  -->  00:01:47.250
And what I want you to do is afterwards play around with Alpha and color arguments to try to clarify

32

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:48.540
the information.

33

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:52.710
Now there's a little bit of alpha here and some transparency to these points.

34

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:58.500
Once you're done with that just at a smooth fit line to the scatterplot from above and you may need

35

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:02.070
to look up GM underscore smooth in order to fully understand this.

36

00:02:02.160  -->  00:02:07.140
And it should look something like this and this sort of plot will come in handy for the data visualization

37

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:08.700
project.

38

00:02:08.700  -->  00:02:09.200
All right.

39

00:02:09.330  -->  00:02:11.700
That's all you have to do in the next lecture.

40

00:02:11.700  -->  00:02:16.270
We'll do a Gigia plot to exercise solutions walkthrough for these basic plots.

41

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:21.240
And after that you'll have the data visualization project in a data visualization project.

42

00:02:21.300  -->  00:02:23.740
We're going to be recreating a real visualization.

43

00:02:23.750  -->  00:02:24.360
Use that.

44

00:02:24.510  -->  00:02:26.210
The Economist magazine.

45

00:02:26.310  -->  00:02:26.790
All right.

46

00:02:27.120  -->  00:02:28.990
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
