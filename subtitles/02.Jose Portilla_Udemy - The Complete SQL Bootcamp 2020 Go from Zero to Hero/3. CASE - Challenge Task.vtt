Welcome everyone to your challenge task for case so for this challenge task we want to know and compare

2
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.450
the various amounts of films we have per moving rating.

3
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.770
So we want you to use case and the DVD rental database to recreate the following table.

4
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.370
So this is showing me a count of the different ratings I have particularly for just three rating types

5
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.270
that has an R rating a P G rating and a PG 13 rating.

6
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.050
So go ahead and use the case syntax in order to recreate this table.

7
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:49.130
So coming up are some hints so the hint is to just really review our case expression example that used

8
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.090
some in the previous lecture because is quite similar to that it's just doing it for this table right

9
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.630
here.

10
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.110
OK.

11
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.480
So now let's go ahead and jump the P.G. admin to walk through the solution.

12
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.800
All right.

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.490
Here I am in P.G. admin what I'm going to do is just to show what we actually have to work with here.

14
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.670
If we select everything from the film table the column that I'm interested in is the rating column and

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:26.690
so I'm just actually it's an RPG 13 and P.G. so we can say select and let's start setting up or first

16
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.360
some.

17
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.960
So the first sum is going to be the case and there's different ways you can do this.

18
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.530
We'll go ahead and do a case expression since we're just comparing the rating column to a bunch of separate

19
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.250
values.

20
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.730
So we'll say.

21
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.850
Case rating.

22
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:53.440
When are then 1 else 0 end.

23
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.940
OK.

24
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.310
So we're going to take the sum of that and we're going to select this as Let's go ahead and just like

25
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.050
this as the R column.

26
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.330
Now let's run this and make sure this works so far for the R rating.

27
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.600
OK.

28
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.860
So it looks like that counted one hundred ninety five instances of an R rating because I'm putting a

29
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.260
one whenever there's an R.

30
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.210
Now what I can do is simply copy and paste this two more times.

31
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.010
So put a comma here to insert what is essentially in your column and this one is that of R is going

32
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.500
to say P G and let's have that as P G and I will only run this notice I've added and P G it's put a

33
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.900
comma here paste this in one more time and then we'll do it for P G thirteen and we'll label that as

34
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.950
the column PG 13.

35
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.160
So when I finally run this I get to see R P G M Ps you 13 so again all I'm doing here is I'm saying

36
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.780
case reading when it happens to be equal to the string then a one else zero.

37
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.800
And then I sum the results of that column.

38
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.330
So a bunch of ones and zeros to get the final count of P G thirteen.

39
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.390
All right.

40
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.100
Thanks and we'll see you at the next lecture.
