00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.670
Welcome everyone to this section on conditional expressions and operators in this section of the course.

2
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.750
We're going to be focusing on being able to conduct logical operations and functionality within our

3
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.000
secret code.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.610
We'll be learning about keywords such as Case coalesce no if and cast.

5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.840
Then we'll also learn about some additional functionality which allows us to expand on the usefulness

6
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.170
of PGI admin things such as creating views as well as import and export functionality.

7
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.260
So as I mentioned we're gonna be able to add logic to our commands and workflows in sequel.

8
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.230
Let's get started.

9
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.280
I'll see you at the next lecture.
