<v Instructor>Hello everyone and welcome to the</v>
2

2

00:00:02,402  -->  00:00:04,985
overview of challenges lecture.
3

3

00:00:05,924  -->  00:00:07,124
Throughout this course,
4

4

00:00:07,124  -->  00:00:09,098
you're going to be receiving challenges.
5

5

00:00:09,098  -->  00:00:10,500
These challenges are gonna allow you
6

6

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:13,191
to test your understanding of Postgres
7

7

00:00:13,191  -->  00:00:16,024
and basic and more advanced SQL commands
8

8

00:00:16,024  -->  00:00:18,039
as you go throughout the course.
9

9

00:00:18,039  -->  00:00:20,062
The basis of these challenge scenarios will be
10

10

00:00:20,062  -->  00:00:22,716
that you've just been hired as a SQL consultant
11

11

00:00:22,716  -->  00:00:24,618
for a DVD rental store.
12

12

00:00:24,618  -->  00:00:26,295
That's gonna be the basic background
13

13

00:00:26,295  -->  00:00:30,662
as we give you challenges throughout the course.
14

14

00:00:30,662  -->  00:00:32,536
As far as solutions to the challenges,
15

15

00:00:32,536  -->  00:00:34,689
challenges are gonna start off very simple
16

16

00:00:34,689  -->  00:00:37,012
and basically be asking you to repeat what you just saw
17

17

00:00:37,012  -->  00:00:39,467
in the previous lecture, so don't worry
18

18

00:00:39,467  -->  00:00:41,879
if you are finding challenges to be very, very basic
19

19

00:00:41,879  -->  00:00:44,480
at the beginning, because that's how they are.
20

20

00:00:44,480  -->  00:00:46,474
Later on, you're gonna be provided with solutions,
21

21

00:00:46,474  -->  00:00:49,971
or walkthrough video solutions, for the tougher challenges.
22

22

00:00:49,971  -->  00:00:52,648
So at first, the challenges are gonna start off simple
23

23

00:00:52,648  -->  00:00:54,441
and ask you just to repeat what you just saw
24

24

00:00:54,441  -->  00:00:56,768
in the previous lecture, and there's not gonna be
25

25

00:00:56,768  -->  00:00:58,878
a specific solution to that challenge,
26

26

00:00:58,878  -->  00:01:01,521
because you can just reference the previous lecture.
27

27

00:01:01,521  -->  00:01:03,918
Later on though as the challenges get harder,
28

28

00:01:03,918  -->  00:01:06,195
you'll be able to be provided with the solutions
29

29

00:01:06,195  -->  00:01:08,551
the next lecture after the challenge lecture,
30

30

00:01:08,551  -->  00:01:10,582
or we'll have a whole walkthrough video
31

31

00:01:10,582  -->  00:01:12,879
in case it's a very difficult challenge.
32

32

00:01:12,879  -->  00:01:15,673
Keep in mind that challenges may show up unannounced,
33

33

00:01:15,673  -->  00:01:18,006
so always be ready for them.
34

34

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:22,000
With all that being said, I hope you enjoy these challenges,
35

35

00:01:22,000  -->  00:01:23,300
and I really hope you do them.
36

36

00:01:23,300  -->  00:01:25,317
They're gonna be a great way for you to get a chance
37

37

00:01:25,317  -->  00:01:28,702
to test your understanding and test out your SQL knowledge
38

38

00:01:28,702  -->  00:01:32,174
on the example database as we go along through the course.
39

39

00:01:32,174  -->  00:01:34,208
Okay with that all being said,
40

40

00:01:34,208  -->  00:01:35,619
I will see you at the next lecture.
41

41

00:01:35,619  -->  00:01:36,452
Thanks everyone.
