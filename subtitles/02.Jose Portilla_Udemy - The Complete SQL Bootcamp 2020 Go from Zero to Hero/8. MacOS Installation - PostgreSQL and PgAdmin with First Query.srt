1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:11,870
Hello everyone and welcome to the installation and set up lecture for Mac OS users so it's time to get

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,300
set up for the course in this lecture video.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,460
We're going to be installing two main things.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,130
One is Postgres sequel which is the actual sequel engine that stores the data has the database reads

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,610
in queries and returns back information from that database.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,530
The second thing we're going to be installing and setting up is P.G. admin P.G. Ataman is the graphical

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,850
user interface that we will use in order to connect with the back end of post Cress equal.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,050
Now there's a couple of things to note here.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,830
First thing to note is please make sure to follow each step in order very carefully.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,270
If you do these steps out of order or mess a certain part of each step up then you may have to go back

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,120
and restart from the very beginning.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,200
There's two really common confusion points.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,630
One is later on we're going to download a file called DVD rental that TAR file do not open that TAR

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,380
file directly.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,300
We'll show you how to deal with it later on and also later on we're going to setup a password for both

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,210
progress equal FPGA admin.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,360
Make sure you do not forget that password and sure you write it down somewhere.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,750
OK so help avoid any missteps.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,060
We've gone ahead and numbered the major steps and we'll present them right now in the correct order.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,720
So let's get started with step number one which is to download and install post press equal for step

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,280
number one.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm going to head over to the Google Chrome browser and then go to Google dot com okay.

23
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,830
Here I am at Google dot com.

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,360
Go ahead and search for post crest sequel in Google just hit Google search.

25
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,770
And the first thing you should see after advertisements is the official Web site which is post gross

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,140
equal dot org.

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,290
And then click on this official site for post Postgres sequel.

28
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,770
And it should look something like this.

29
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,690
Keep in mind this page does get updated from time to time but this is we're going to be downloading

30
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,930
post Cress sequel and somewhere on this page you should see a download button.

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,710
Either just be really obvious here and download or appear at the top.

32
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:04,560
So go ahead and click download that will take it to the court distribution page and you'll see the different

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,650
packages.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,990
There's the linux packages the windows packages et cetera.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,950
But right now we're focusing on Mac OS since I'm on a Mac right now.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,570
I'll click on Mac OS and then you'll see here there's different options for the Mac OS packages.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,930
And then there's also different versions for platform support.

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
So depending on what version of the 64 bit Mac OS Platform you have you may actually need to download

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,890
a lower version of post sequel.

40
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,890
So make sure that you actually check that your Mac OS Platform is going to correspond to whatever version

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,240
of Postgres sequel you have.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,860
So again older Max will need to go with older postgrad sequels.

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,440
OK.

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,530
So in general I'm just going to use the latest one since I'm on MAKO as Catalina and I'm going to click

45
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,840
right here where it says interactive installer enterprise D.B..

46
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:59,660
I'll click on download the installer and this will take me to the enterprise Debbie download page.

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,860
And here we can see for Mac OS.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,700
Go ahead and choose the corresponding post grad sequel version.

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,070
You can check on the last page to see what version of Mac OS corresponds to which version of postcard

50
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,330
sequel supports.

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm on the latest version of Mac OS.

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,800
So right now the latest version of Post classical supports that.

53
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,580
I'll go ahead and click download here under Mac OS 10 and then go ahead and let it download.

54
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,760
It should download this zip file somewhere onto your computer and then I'll go ahead and save it underneath

55
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,950
my downloads folder.

56
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,350
So go ahead and click save and then it's going to download that zip file for us.

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,260
OK I'm going to fast forward in time until this is done downloading.

58
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,910
OK.

59
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,630
This has now finished installing.

60
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,830
So what I'm going to do here is fish see it and finder.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,850
We have this zip file.

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,660
I'm going to go ahead and just open it with the default archive utility that will unzip this right here

63
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,520
underneath downloads and you'll see here that I now have this postcard sequel OSX.

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,700
Go ahead and double click on that and then you may get this notification saying it's an app downloaded

65
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,360
from the Internet.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,750
Are you sure you want to open it.

67
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,470
Go ahead and click open for some people.

68
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,690
They have their Mac OS settings that says it doesn't allow them to open.

69
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,470
UNIDENTIFIED developers or unidentified applications.

70
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,480
You'll have to go to your settings and change that.

71
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,410
And if you just google search the actual terms that Mac OS returns to you about opening stuff.

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,370
UNIDENTIFIED developers we'll show you how to open that very easily through a Google search.

73
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:40,310
But in my case it's just asking me if I want to open it Go ahead and select open it may ask you for

74
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,880
your password.

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,720
Go ahead and provide it.

76
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,570
And the installer should be in.

77
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,730
So here's the setup wizard.

78
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,180
I'm just gonna hit next here.

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,250
Go ahead and choose the default directory and you'll notice there's some components here that it's going

80
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,790
to install.

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,410
Go ahead and just select them all have all the default selected hit next.

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,220
Go ahead and select the default for the data directory of where it's going to save our data.

83
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,980
And this is the extremely important part.

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,530
There is a password here that you need to provide.

85
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,690
And if you ever forget this password you'll need to essentially uninstall everything and reinstall from

86
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,610
the beginning.

87
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,860
So I highly recommend that you put in a password here that you're no You're going to remember.

88
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,200
So what I like to do is I just like to just type in password and all lowercase.

89
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,080
So we'll say password since this is on our own computer we don't need to worry about any sort of security

90
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,700
issue if this.

91
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,740
So I'm just typing password and all lowercase again you must remember this password.

92
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,300
If you decide to do something more complicated make sure you write down this password somewhere else

93
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,990
because if you forget this password there's really nothing I can do for me for you on my end.

94
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,590
You'll need to uninstall and reinstall everything.

95
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,890
So this is a very important step but you must remember this password.

96
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,570
OK I'm going to go ahead and hit next.

97
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,590
All right the next thing you're going to do is select a port number the server should be listening on

98
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,350
depending if you've already installed post crest sequel before or not you may see a different port number

99
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,190
here than what I have currently I have five four three three.

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,650
It's really common that it shows up as five four three two.

101
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,080
But whatever the default value is here.

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,040
Go ahead and just leave it be.

103
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,260
So my default right now is on five four three three which essentially means that port is open and the

104
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,320
server can listen on it.

105
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,220
It's essentially going to be the connection of where Postgres sequel is going to live.

106
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,750
And keep in mind that if you have a corporate firewall you want to make sure it's not blocking this

107
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,460
sort of port.

108
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,900
So later on when you're running PGI admin if you see that their firewall is blocking that port go ahead

109
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,360
and allow your firewall to connect with Postgres sequel.

110
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,220
And this particular port number.

111
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,850
So it provided me a 5 4 3 3 4 provide you with a higher number or a lower number that's totally ok just

112
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:01,690
select the default hit next and then select the default location for the new database cluster hit next.

113
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,770
And then we'll say pre installation summary that's OK to hit next setup is now ready to begin hit next.

114
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,820
And let it install onto your computer.

115
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm going to fast forward until this is done installing.

116
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,740
OK.

117
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,060
That has finished installing for me.

118
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,920
Keep in mind if you're running an older version of Mac OS or you have a much older mac book that you

119
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,830
updated to the latest version of Mac OS you sometimes get an error that says something like database

120
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,980
cluster initial initialization couldn't be done or could not be found etc. If you get an error at that

121
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:41,100
particular step between hitting install and then actually finishing the wizard it most likely means

122
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,440
they need to downgrade to alert lower version of Postgres sequel.

123
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,280
So if you get an error saying something about the database cluster initialization not being setup correctly.

124
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,130
Go ahead and try a much lower version of progress equal like nine point seven or something like 10.

125
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,970
So don't go for the latest one.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,520
OK.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,820
In my case it looks like everything went well.

128
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,010
It's an ask if you want to launch stack builder exit.

129
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,820
We don't need to do that.

130
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,630
So go ahead and unclip that and then just hit finish.

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,000
OK.

132
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,460
And now we've taken care of Step 1 which was installing post Cress sequel.

133
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,200
It's time to move on to Step Two.

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:19,080
Step two is the download and install P.G. admin P.G. Adam is the graphical user interface that we'll

135
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,270
be using to connect with post press equal.

136
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,500
And what's really interesting about the latest version of P.G. Ataman is that it actually opens up in

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
your browser.

138
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
Let's go ahead and show you how to download it.

139
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,070
To do this we'll go to our browser.

140
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,310
OK.

141
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,420
Here I am at the browser.

142
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,720
We're going to go ahead and do is just input PGI admin.

143
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,350
Go ahead and google search.

144
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,090
And after the advertisements the first thing you should see is WW that P.G. Adam and dot org.

145
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,750
So that's the official Web site for PGI admin.

146
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,700
Go ahead and click on it.

147
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,100
And this is an open source free.

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,470
And it's the most popular way to work with post press equal.

149
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,010
And what we're going to do here is somewhere here you should be able to see that there's a download

150
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,730
button.

151
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,390
There's also an interesting online demo if you want to check it out so you can kind of quickly see what's

152
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,930
going on online without downloading anything but go ahead and go to download.

153
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,840
We'll go to PGA admin and the latest version is PGA admin for if you're running a really old version

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,480
of MapQuest.

155
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,810
You may need to run PGA admin three it will warn you that it's actually no longer supported but that

156
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,940
basically means that they're not supporting PGA admin with the latest versions of post press equal.

157
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,130
That's OK if you're running a older version of Mac OS you can go ahead and just click on MacOS under

158
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,400
PGA item three.

159
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm really the latest version of Mac OS so I will go ahead and select Mac OS under PGA admin for they

160
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,060
will take me to the downloads here you can see that there's various versions of peace on and for they

161
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,090
keep updating it with more features or better workings under the hood.

162
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,120
I'll go ahead and just select the newest version which in my case was four point one eight.

163
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,410
You'll see here that I'll take you to kind of this interesting file browser directory.

164
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,620
There's no files here.

165
00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:00,050
Really what we're looking for is just the start DMV file which is the typical installer for any application

166
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,640
on a Mac OS.

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,720
You'll notice that it's by far the largest file so that's actually the only one we need here is the

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,980
largest file which is the dot the empty file.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Go ahead and click on it and upon clicking on it we're gonna do is we're gonna save this to our downloads

170
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,630
folder.

171
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,700
So I will save that to downloads and that's going to download that dot TMG file.

172
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,840
Going to fast forward in time until this is done downloading it and then we'll walk through the installation.

173
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,140
OK.

174
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,610
This DMV file has finished downloading it.

175
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,230
I'll go ahead and open it.

176
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:39,920
So this is essentially running the installer and we'll go ahead and agree to the terms and then it's

177
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,060
going to open the doors the AMG file it'll verify this may take a couple of seconds and then you should

178
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,860
see a little window that looks something like this.

179
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,010
PGI admin for and right now what this has done is it has PGI admin for ready to go.

180
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,880
But we need to do is to make sure that the saves on our computer and we don't accidentally start reinstalling

181
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,380
it every time to open it.

182
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,990
We need to save this and move this to our applications.

183
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,280
So we need to do is in your finder window.

184
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,710
Go ahead and look for your applications folder.

185
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,180
You can come here to applications click on that.

186
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,360
So here we have our applications folder that should actually be under favorites by default essentially

187
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,030
where all your applications live.

188
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,380
And if you notice here you start scrolling down to P. You have post Chris equal available for you but

189
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,330
you don't yet have PGI admin for.

190
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,850
So what we need to do is simply grab PGI admin for and drag it and move it to applications.

191
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,550
Okay.

192
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,780
And what that is going to do is that will finish the entire installation process.

193
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,510
Otherwise you would actually be reinstalling PGI admin each time you actually wanted to open it.

194
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,170
Okay.

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:55,070
So that's it for installing PJM and for is following through that that DMV procedure and then making

196
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,430
sure that you actually copy the PJM and 4 and move it over to your applications.

197
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,390
All right.

198
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,520
So once that has moved over to the applications you can go ahead and close this initial window.

199
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:12,080
It's quite a large file so keep that in mind going to fast for a timeout until this is done copying

200
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,780
over okay.

201
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,500
Now that has finished being transferred over to other applications.

202
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,640
If you don't see it under applications after you transfer over to it you may need to click on desktop

203
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,190
and then come back to applications in order to see the actual change occur inside of your a little finder

204
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,090
window.

205
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,210
So right here we see PGI admin for and if you go back to your desktop you now no longer have to worry

206
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,520
about this little temporary drive that's open.

207
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,600
You'll notice there's PGI admin for here on your desktop.

208
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,630
Go ahead and you can just check that and they'll remove from your computer.

209
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,570
However it's safe to say that it still exists on your computer now under applications.

210
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,780
All right.

211
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,570
And that concludes step number two.

212
00:12:52,390 --> 00:13:00,220
Step three is to download but not directly open the DVD rental that TAR file as a resource in this installation

213
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,880
lecture you should see a DVD rental tar file as a resource to download or we're going to do is download

214
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,940
this file but do not attempt to unzip the file double click on the file or open the file or interact

215
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,770
with the file in any manner.

216
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,230
It's only meant to be interacted with directly through P.G. admin so please do not directly open or

217
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,580
interact with the file.

218
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,060
Sometimes computers think it's a PDA file or it's a zip file that needs to be unzip.

219
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,020
Do you do not need worry about any of that.

220
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,010
All we're doing for this step is downloading it.

221
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,050
So let's show you how to do that.

222
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,510
If you take a quick look at you to me support page on course taking there is an entire article lecture

223
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,420
devoted to downloading supplemental resources.

224
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,860
Keep in mind this may change in future versions of you to me but right now the current way you download

225
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:51,220
them is there's a little icon underneath the lecture called resources that you just click on and then

226
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,470
it'll have a drop down menu of the different resources to download.

227
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,230
So what's going to happen is as you're watching the actual installation lecture you'll be a complete

228
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,380
sequel bootcamp.

229
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,720
You'll come over here and then over here somewhere on the right of this particular lecture you'll hit

230
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,880
resources and then you'll see this DVD read told not tar file you'll go ahead and click on that and

231
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,320
you'll save it and make sure to save it underneath your downloads.

232
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:20,320
You must remember where this is saved so go ahead and save that to your downloads and that's all we're

233
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,490
gonna do for this step.

234
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,410
Do not attempt to double click on this file or open this file or unzip this file that will cause an

235
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,870
error for the rest of the installation process.

236
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,590
So once you download it that's it.

237
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,020
And that's all you need to do for that.

238
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,010
OK let's move on to the next step.

239
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,590
All right.

240
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,470
Step number four is to restart your computer in order to make sure your computer has attributed all

241
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,060
the changes necessary for Postgres sequel and P.G. admin.

242
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,280
It's common that we need to restart your computer.

243
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,450
So go ahead and just restart your computer and we'll move on to the next step.

244
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,180
All right.

245
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,840
Step number five is essentially the last step or we're going to be restoring that database.

246
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,950
Keep in mind there may be a failed exit code that appears and you can safely ignore it in some particular

247
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,660
versions of Postgres sequel along with some particular versions of Mac OS.

248
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,260
You get a failed exit code that pops up because the database attempts to restore itself twice.

249
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,650
Now what happens is it works fine on the first time and then it gets an error the second time because

250
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,590
it works successfully the first time.

251
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,620
So if you get the failed exit code it's totally safe to ignore it.

252
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,550
So we'll go ahead and try our best to show you how to ignore the exit code.

253
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,320
But again if you get a failed exit code one you can safely ignore that exit code in order to restore

254
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,070
the database.

255
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,950
We'll need to start startup P.G. admin.

256
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,700
So let's do that.

257
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,750
You started PGI admin.

258
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,130
All you need to do is search for PGE admin and it should autocomplete with PGI admin for underneath

259
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,370
your applications.

260
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,230
Go ahead and open that so we'll double click on that.

261
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,550
And what's going to happen is it's going to start up PGI admin for us.

262
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,930
They'll verify it.

263
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,750
You may get this warning saying it's downloaded from the Internet.

264
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,300
Are you sure you want to open it Go ahead and stay open.

265
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,040
If it does not allow you to open it from the internet go ahead and just change your settings to allow

266
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,530
you to open things from unidentified developers.

267
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,930
If you're not sure how to do that you can just google search the actual message that pops up and there's

268
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,050
pretty much tons of tutorials online that teach you how to just go to your settings and edit it so you

269
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,380
can open that up.

270
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,970
OK so I'll go ahead and open it you'll see this little icon up here PJM and management tools and this

271
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,140
may take a few minutes especially the first time it's ever opening it though it's going to happen is

272
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,460
eventually it's going to open up in your browser.

273
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,430
We'll go ahead and allow notifications from PGI admin.

274
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,140
So I'm going to forward in time until this is done up.

275
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,020
There we go.

276
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,600
So it's already running and it's going to open up in your browser and what it's going to ask you is

277
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,390
to set the master password for PGE admin.

278
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,580
Keep in mind this is technically a different password than the Postgres sequel user password.

279
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,370
This is just for PGI admin.

280
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,290
However I would highly recommend that you set this to something either the same as Post Chris or just

281
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,330
something you can really remember in my case.

282
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,480
I'll keep it simple and just set this as password and be careful when you're spelling this because there

283
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,630
is no confirmed password which is kind of a design flaw here.

284
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,120
But just go ahead and I'll going to choose lowercase password makes you write this down somewhere here.

285
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,420
OK.

286
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,990
And then you should see something that looks like this.

287
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,930
So we have PGI admin for it's running in our browser.

288
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,790
You can always copy and paste this your URL.

289
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,790
You want to use a different Internet browser.

290
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,060
It'll open up in your default one underneath servers if you expand on this.

291
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,950
Well you should see is post graphs equal to 12.

292
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,700
Now if you've already installed older older versions of Postgres sequel on your computer you may actually

293
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,810
see those pop up in my case I actually installed nine point five earlier.

294
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,350
So I see that pop up but you should see post Chris equal to 12 here.

295
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,080
If you don't see it make sure you've already restarted your computer and then expand this again.

296
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,630
And when you try to expand it it's going to ask you to enter the password for post Cress.

297
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:04,460
That's the same password that was set up during the first initial installation of post Cress equal.

298
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,490
That's why it's so important that you remember what that password is.

299
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,020
In my case I just kept it all lowercase password.

300
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,320
So that should be good to go.

301
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,690
Go ahead and select safe password again if you do not remember the postcard password.

302
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,460
There's really nothing I can do for you here.

303
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,080
You'll need to start over since the very beginning.

304
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,810
OK then.

305
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,300
OK.

306
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,400
That should work since that was the correct password.

307
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,530
And now we can see a bunch of information about the dashboard etc. What we're going to do here is just

308
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,060
restore our database.

309
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,000
So to do this I'm going to first create underneath databases a new database.

310
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,360
I can see there is one that already exists called Post press.

311
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm going to right click here and hit create and then database.

312
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:52,160
Now we're going to call this database DVD rental so called the database DVD rental and then go ahead

313
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,060
and hit save.

314
00:18:53,060 --> 00:19:00,740
The owner should be by default post Chris hit save and you'll see how this new DVD rental database that

315
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,270
we're not yet connected to.

316
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,570
If you click on it you should see it get colored in and now we're connected to it.

317
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,210
And now it's time to actually put the information into this database by restoring from that DVD rental

318
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,440
that TAR file.

319
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,270
So I'm going to right click here and I'm going to go down to where it says restore.

320
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,820
Click on restore.

321
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:25,370
So what we need to do is we need to tell PGI admin where our DVD rental that our file is actually located.

322
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,320
So we need to find the file name.

323
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,960
So most people are going to be able to click on these three points here and then actually search their

324
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,690
computer for it.

325
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,800
However for some users especially on MAKO as Catalina there's been some issues lately of just stuff

326
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,660
being locked or not being able to actually find the file itself.

327
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,140
So here maybe you can search on other applications.

328
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,230
A double click on that.

329
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,690
And then keep going forward.

330
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,790
But what I want to do is show you the failed Perth pathway which is just to manually provide the file

331
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,120
name.

332
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,500
And I prefer this way anyways.

333
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:01,400
So what we're going to do is we're gonna remember that we saved that DVD rental that TAR file underneath

334
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,820
downloads so open up your Downloads folder and you should see DVD rental that time.

335
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,950
So we know it's located under downloads.

336
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,890
All I want to do is grab the complete file path so I'll right click on DVD rental Avatar again.

337
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,380
That's a right click and then select get info and here I can see where it's going to tell me it's in

338
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,120
their Macintosh HD Users and in my particular user name is Marcy here and then downloads.

339
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,990
So what I'll do is I'll highlight that entirety of where right click hit copy then come back here to

340
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,680
restore and then select paste.

341
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,310
So notice now it gives me the file path users Marci downloads.

342
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,200
Then we'll complete this by saying forward slash DVD rental dot tar.

343
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,370
And that's gonna be the complete file path telling PGI admin go look at this location and look at this

344
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,200
file.

345
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:03,500
The next we need to do before we hit restore is go to restore options and select pre data data and post

346
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,770
data and then come back to general and then we're ready to go hit restore and it will attempt to restore

347
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,260
this.

348
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,470
They'll ask you Would you like to access your Downloads folder.

349
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,120
Go ahead and allow it to.

350
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,680
Once you hit ok here.

351
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,900
And that should actually complete the restoration process.

352
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,140
Keep in mind that you may actually see this failed exit code.

353
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,320
One pop up.

354
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,620
It's totally ok if you see that you can go ahead and ignore that.

355
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,590
It just means that it attempted to restore it twice which is totally ok.

356
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:41,750
So go ahead and exit this and then we're going to do here is we're going to say on TV the rental right

357
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:47,030
click and refresh in order to have those changes take place.

358
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,260
And now let's attempt our first query on this DVD rental database.

359
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:58,760
We're going to right click and select query tool and query tool is essentially where we spend the rest

360
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,600
of the course.

361
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,180
This is where we actually learn and type out sequel.

362
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:14,120
So I'm gonna type out select space Asterix space from space film semicolon and then we'll go ahead and

363
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,780
run this

364
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,550
and upon running that you should see here under a data output just some film.

365
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:28,520
These titles descriptions etc. And now you successfully restored the database and you queried it for

366
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,930
more information and we'll talk about what this actually means.

367
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,390
Later on in the course but this is just the general query Ed..

368
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,950
OK if you get some sort of error saying film not recognized or not found.

369
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,350
Make sure that you follow the steps.

370
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,050
Exactly.

371
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,860
So you may not have to go back and restart your computer or you could also do is try using a lower version

372
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,150
of Postgres sequel.

373
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,440
If that error keeps coming back because most likely what's happening is that your particular version

374
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,100
of Mac OS wasn't suitable for the most recent version of post sequel.

375
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,680
OK.

376
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,030
If you're able to run this query and see the results then you're ready to go.

377
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,180
I'll see you in the next lecture.
