Welcome back everyone to this section on joins so in this section of the course we're going to discuss

2
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.880
the various types of joints that are available to us with post sequel and really a join at the heart

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.410
of it just allows us to combine information from multiple tables.

4
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.130
And let's take a quick peek at what we're going to learn in this section.

5
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.720
We're going to start off this section by quickly discussing the as clause which is a really useful clause

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.990
for creating an alias that is to say it just allows you to rename a column whatever you want.

7
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.700
Once you understand that we'll move on to joins.

8
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.730
So we're gonna discuss different kinds of join such as inner joins outer joins full joins full auto

9
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.560
joins unions and more so those things also like left joins and right outer joins et etc..

10
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.300
So lots of stuff to discuss here.

11
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.610
We're gonna start off with the simpler joint types and then move on to the harder to understand or more

12
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.050
complex joint types.

13
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.510
But overall once you understand one type of join the mental leaps required to understand the other types

14
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.340
of joints isn't too bad.

15
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.030
Okay.

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.690
And then we'll end this with some challenge tasks.

17
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.100
All right.

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.530
So now they understand we're going to learn this section.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280
Let's move on to the next lecture.

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.890
I'll see you there.
