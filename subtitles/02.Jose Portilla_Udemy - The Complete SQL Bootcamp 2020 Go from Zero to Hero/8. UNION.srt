Welcome back everyone to this lecture on unions.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,760
The union operator is used to combine the results set of two or more select statements.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,610
The way I like to think about a union versus the joint we've already learned is that it basically just

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:28,150
serves to directly concatenate two results together essentially just pasting the results of two select

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:34,760
statements right on top of each other the syntax is simply the following You have your first select

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,580
statement and then you have a union with another SELECT statement something to keep in mind is that

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,740
these should be logical and they should match up in a way that you can stack the results right on top

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,900
of another.

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:53,420
Let's go through a simple example so let's imagine we have these two example tables and what we're doing

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,330
is we're organizing the sales per year per quarter.

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:03,290
So I have one table with my first quarter sales for the year 2021 where David sold one hundred amount

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,150
and Claire sold fifty then I have another table storing my results from the second quarter.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,670
Again David now has sold two hundred and Claire has now sold one hundred if I actually want to put together

14
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:24,140
the information from these two tables in order to get kind of total results or see every single time

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,390
a amount was sold for the first half of the year.

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,310
I can't really use the typical joins now we're already familiar with.

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,730
Instead what I should be doing is just pasting one of these on top of the other.

18
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:44,460
And this is perfect for a union so all we need to do is say select everything from the first sales quarter

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,610
union with select everything from the second sales quarter and what it's gonna do is just grab the results

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,110
from the first query and then paste them right on top of the second query.

21
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,180
And as you can imagine if you wanted to you could have multiple union calls just pasting together these

22
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,820
different results and you can also do is for example if you wanted to be ordered or sorted by the name

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,660
you can just add an order by call after this to order it by the name.

24
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,880
OK.

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,870
So as far as the DVD rental database goes there is not really a good use case for the Union call.

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,360
So instead we'll explore union calls later on in the course with another database.

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,040
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
