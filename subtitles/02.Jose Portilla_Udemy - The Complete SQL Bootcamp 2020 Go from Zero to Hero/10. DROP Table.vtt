Welcome back everyone to this lecture on the drop keyword drop allows us to completely remove a column

2
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.820
from a table in progress equal.

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.090
This also automatically removes all of its indexes and constraints involving the column so ill remove

4
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.190
things like check constraints not null constraints unique strengths everything that's associated with

5
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.760
that column.

6
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.940
However what it does not do is it does not remove columns used on other things that are dependent on

7
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.130
it such as views triggers or stored procedures.

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.980
If you do want to remove a column that has those dependencies for views triggers and sort of procedures

9
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.040
which are going to talk about in more detail later on you can add in an additional cascade clause in

10
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.330
order to just remove that column and those associated dependencies the general syntax for a dropped

11
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:03.610
call for dropping a column would be ALTER TABLE table name drop column and then the column name to remove

12
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.940
all those dependencies I previously mentioned.

13
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.770
You can say ALTER TABLE table name drop column provide the column name and add in the keyword cascade

14
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.400
essentially cascading that removal to all those dependencies.

15
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.290
Now if you try to drop a column that does not exist you'll get an error in post gross cycle.

16
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.300
So it's really common to add in and if exists keyword clause before the column name in order to avoid

17
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.710
the error.

18
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.670
So that way it only drops column if that column name exists in that table if you want to drop multiple

19
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.450
columns.

20
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.170
It's almost like adding in multiple column values you simply say drop column Column One name comma column

21
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.130
to name comma etc..

22
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.520
Okay let's go ahead and see a quick example this in P.G. Adelman.

23
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.070
All right.

24
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.190
Here I am in P.G. Ataman recall that we have this new info table that we created when playing around

25
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.850
with the alter commands.

26
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.770
Let's go ahead and drop the people column so we'll do the following.

27
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:16.330
We're going to say alter table new info we're going to say drop column and then say people we run that.

28
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.610
It worked out correctly which means if I now select everything from new info again run it I don't have

29
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.740
that people column anymore.

30
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.060
Let's see what happens if I were to.

31
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.020
We look at our query history try to run that drop again.

32
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.570
You're going to copy this to my query editor does the same thing we did last time.

33
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.860
ALTER TABLE new info drop column people.

34
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.290
Go ahead and try running this again.

35
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.080
You'll notice you get an error it says column people of relation you info does not exist.

36
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:55.410
But if I add in if exists right before people what it's going to do it's going to attempt to drop the

37
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.710
column only if it exists and instead of getting an error you'll get back a notice saying column people

38
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.170
of relation new info does not exist.

39
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.830
Skipping alter table and then I'll say query returns successfully.

40
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.590
So instead of an error it just gives you this message.

41
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.290
All right.

42
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.860
And that's basically all there is to dropping columns.

43
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.870
Pretty straightforward exercise.

44
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.490
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
