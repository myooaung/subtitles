00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.700
Welcome back everyone to this quick lecture on the delete clause as you may have expected.

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.820
We can use the delete clause to remove rows from a table.

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.640
For example we could say something like delete from.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.440
Then choose the table name where and then some sort of condition such as column row idea.

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.500
Equal to one.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.080
And this would remove the rows to have a row idea of one we can delete rows based on their presence

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.570
in other tables.

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.180
For example we could say delete from table A using table B or table a that I.D. is equal to Table B

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.000
the idea essentially where there happens to be a match in between these two tables will go ahead and

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.300
delete those rows from table A.

11
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.720
You can almost think about this in the same way that we had an update join.

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.140
This would be kind of like a delete.

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.640
Join and then we can delete all rows from a table by simply saying delete from table similar to the

14
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.620
update command.

15
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.360
You can also add in a returning call at the very end to return rows that were removed to see what was

16
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.800
removed from the table.

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.780
Let's go ahead and just quickly explore this with P.G. Ataman okay.

18
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.760
Here I am in P.G. admin what I'm going to do is just explore the job table so say select from job and

19
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.050
right now we have two jobs astronaut and president.

20
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.240
Let's go ahead and add in a new job and then we'll go ahead and remove it.

21
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.680
So to add a new job we already know that we just say insert into the job table.

22
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.210
We only need specify the job name column since.

23
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.620
Job I.D. is a serial key and they'll be automatically filled in for us.

24
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.680
So we simply say job job.

25
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.480
Name values and we can choose some values here.

26
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.450
So I can say something like let's go ahead and say cowboy as our job we run this.

27
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.770
And that worked out for us.

28
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.010
So I say select from job we see now cowboy is the third job.

29
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.690
Let's go ahead now delete that.

30
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.870
So we'll say delete from.

31
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.540
And then we say the table name and if I just ran this this would delete all the jobs.

32
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.390
So I want to specify a condition.

33
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.880
And there's lots of options here but I could say something like where a job name is equal to Cowboy

34
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.930
and then I can also add in a returning call to actually see the columns that were removed.

35
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.250
So I'll add that in as well.

36
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.400
So what they're saying is delete from the job table where the job name column is equal to Cowboy and

37
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.900
then return the rows that were deleted.

38
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.550
Job I.D. and job name.

39
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.610
So I run this and now it returns back the rows that were deleted.

40
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.840
Keep in mind if I were to try to run this a second time I don't get anything back because it was already

41
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.680
deleted the first time which means there was nothing to delete the second time around.

42
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.860
So if I now say select everything from the job table I see only astronaut and president.

43
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.150
OK so pretty straightforward.

44
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.460
That's the syntax for the delete statement.

45
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.940
Thanks and we'll see you at the next lecture.
