00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,010
Welcome back everyone to this quick lecture on mathematical functions.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,580
We're gonna quickly explore some mathematical operations that we can perform with sequel.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,320
And this is actually all just best shown through some examples and also by showing you where you can

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,040
find all the examples of mathematical functions in the documentation.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,190
So to do this I'm gonna jump straight to PGA admin and my browser.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,040
OK.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,980
Here I am inside of P Jenman if my query Ed ready to go.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,100
I first want to quickly show you the documentation for mathematical functions.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,160
And if you come to the P.G. sequel documentation and then just go to functions dash math or just search

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,990
for mathematical functions and operators and Google along with G sequel it should bring you to this

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,500
page.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,650
You can also check out the URL here at the top post for sequel talk slash Doc slash current slash functions

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,480
dash math that each team L and there's lots of different operations and functions but we're really going

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,220
to focus on throughout this course are mathematical operators because that's more common to use for

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,860
business SQL queries and the way this works is as you may expect it's just things like addition subtraction

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,770
and multiplication done between columns so you can add one column to another or subtract one column

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,220
from another etc. So it also gives you examples.

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,200
And then the expected results.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,030
So pretty much any mathematical operator you can think of is available to you in post press equal.

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,730
So this is operator you type in its description and examples.

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,120
Now you can shift into doing more complex mathematical or there's also mathematical functions we're

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,280
already familiar with one of these which was round.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,050
Remember that rounded off a number to a certain number of decimal points but there's things like absolute

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:46,470
value cube root exponential even logarithms are available to and lots of different options here.

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,260
So for our particular databases we don't need to be taking anything raised to some sort of power or

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,240
be converting degrees to radians but I want to let you know that this stuff is available to you in case

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,850
you need it.

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,610
And there's even trigonometric functions so there's random functions here and then there's trigonometric

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,680
functions as well as hyperbolic functions so lots and lots of different options.

30
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,120
So in case you find yourself needing to do some sort of complex mathematics within your circle query

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,780
go ahead and check out this documentation page and see if the function is already available for you.

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,520
Now I want to show you just a couple examples how you may actually use some of those mathematical operators

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,010
and functions from within PGE adamant in your queries.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,680
First let's go in and select everything from the film table.

35
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,780
Go ahead and run that.

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,870
And I want to zoom out just a little bit so we can see the results here in a little more detail.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,240
Looks like we have a film idea as we know title et cetera and we're going to focus on are things comparing

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,220
the rental rate versus the replacement cost.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,470
Let's imagine I wanted to know the percentage that a rental rate versus a replacement cost happens to

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,740
be.

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,700
So what percentage of the replacement cost is a rental rate so the way I can do that is the following

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:15,180
I simply need to calculate rental rates divided by the replacement cost.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,880
So if I run them notice we get back.

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,150
This results here.

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,820
And if you get it back like this kind of squeezed down a lot of numbers just remember you can always

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,080
expand this back out because it's keeping a lot of decimal places.

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,600
So I also wanted this in terms of percent which the first thing going to do is I'll go ahead and round

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,590
this off to just be two decimals.

49
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:44,600
So we'll say round this result to be two points past the decimal so far around that.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Now I get to see point three three point five etc..

51
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,120
And then what I can do is if I wanted to get it in terms of percent just times by a hundred so now I

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,240
can see 33 percent twenty five percent etc. and if I want more detail there I could say Q4 from the

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,270
original run that and I get to see thirty three point two nine percent twenty four point nine six percent

54
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,480
et cetera.

55
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:14,460
And you can only say an alias here as something like percent cost or whatever you happen to name this

56
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,320
column.

57
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,540
You can see here it's percent cost.

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,310
Okay.

59
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,380
So this is kind of typically what you would do.

60
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,820
Let's imagine for some reason you wanted to just put small deposits down of 10 percent of the replacement

61
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,510
cost.

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,320
You could easily calculate that you would just say something like zero point one times the replacement

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,380
cost.

64
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:44,430
And then you can name it something like as deposit from film run that and we can see here we have 10

65
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,340
percent other replacement costs for some sort of deposit program.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,010
All right.

67
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,870
So really it's all pretty self-explanatory here.

68
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,610
You can always jump to the documentation and explore any mathematical operators that you see fit to

69
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,590
use.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,140
Okay.

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,640
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
