00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,080
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on the altar cloth.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,920
The altar clause allows for changes to an existing table structure.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,730
It has lots of use cases such as adding dropping or renaming columns changing columns data type setting

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,740
default values for a column adding check constraints and even renaming a table.

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:31,130
Let's look at just a few examples for the general syntax for these cases the general syntax is altar

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,300
table table name and then some sort of action call.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,250
For example if you wanted to add columns to a table you would say altar table table name.

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:47,360
Add a column the new column name and then specify a data type you can remove columns by saying altar

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,470
table table name drop column and then the column name you want to drop you can alter the constraints

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,800
of an existing column by again using altar table table name altar column the column name and then you

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:07,950
can do things like set a default value you can drop the default value you can remove or add in a not

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,060
null constraint such as setting I'm not more constrained to add one end you can drop and not no constraint

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,640
you can add just a general constraint by saying add a constraint and then the definition of the constraint

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,200
name like a check constraint etc. So let's cut and explore some examples since there is lots of things

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,700
we can do with this altar table command okay.

16
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,090
Here I am in I admin since we're going to be doing so much altering and editing to a table.

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,280
Let's go ahead and create a new table first we'll say create table and we'll have just this table be

18
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:48,450
called general information and let's go ahead and have just a couple of columns here we'll say an info

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,520
I.D. column which is going to be serial and based as a primary key let's have something else called

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,600
title.

21
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,540
This will just be like the title of some information say five hundred characters max and let's say for

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,230
now it cannot be no and we'll add in one more column.

23
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,430
Let's go ahead and have this be some person the information is related to again variable character.

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,690
We'll say 50 let's have it be not null as well as unique.

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:20,880
All right.

26
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,230
So a very basic table here we'll go ahead and run this okay.

27
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,190
So the tables created let's select everything from that table just we can see the columns so select

28
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,500
everything from the information table we have invitee title and person.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,070
Let's do a couple of things first.

30
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,970
Let's go in and rename this table.

31
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,520
So the way we do this is by saying alter table we choose the current name which is information and then

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,790
we say rename to and this will change the table name to something else.

33
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,350
Let's go ahead and call this table new info.

34
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:01,100
We run this and we successfully alter the table which means if I were to try to select from the information

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,320
table I get information does not exist which means I need to use the new name which is new info.

36
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,490
And again we get back this empty table.

37
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,420
So that's how I can rename the table if I want to rename just a column.

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,260
I can do this.

39
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:23,720
I can say altar table new info renamed column.

40
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,950
Let's go ahead and rename the column.

41
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:32,130
So the way this works is we say rename column person to the new name.

42
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:41,620
Let's go in and say people run that and if we select everything from new info I see now.

43
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,330
Person is people.

44
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,270
So obviously a lot of things you can do here with this alter table command.

45
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,270
The next thing I want to do is show you how you can use the alter command in order to alter constraints

46
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,210
that already exist on certain columns.

47
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,120
But to do this first I want to show you how we could try to insert data into this table so I'm going

48
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:13,030
to say insert into new info and I want to insert let's say just a title recall that people was also

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,930
not know.

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,960
So I'm actually not going to provide people on purpose here.

51
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,530
We're going to say values and let's just have title be some new title.

52
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,100
And if I were to run this I get back an error saying no value in column people violates not no constraint.

53
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,550
OK so we have two options Either I can add in people and then add a value for it or I can try to remove

54
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,130
this not null constraint using altered table.

55
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,400
Obviously that affects it permanently for the table on a table level.

56
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,700
But this is just to show you the alter command.

57
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:58,980
So I'm going to say alter table new info alter column people and then we're going to drop the not null

58
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,910
constraint.

59
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,380
If I wanted to set a constraint then I would use set and that adds a constraint.

60
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,690
If you want to remove a constraint use drop and recall this not null can be anything could be dropping

61
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,520
the unique call that not no call any sort of constraint here.

62
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,890
OK so let's go ahead and run this.

63
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,770
OK so I successfully alter that table.

64
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,960
Now what I'm going to do is if I take a look at my query history I can actually grab that old query

65
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,670
of insert info.

66
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,970
So let's go ahead and copy this.

67
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,870
You can also I'm pretty zoomed in here.

68
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,000
I might look at make it look a little strange but in your eyes you should see insert into.

69
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,540
Go ahead and copy this.

70
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,790
You can even copy it directly into the query editor.

71
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,400
So I'll just click that.

72
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,660
So we're trying to now insert into new info title values some new title.

73
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,710
Go ahead and run this.

74
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,200
See if it works this time.

75
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,260
And notice that it was able to work because I had removed that not no constraint.

76
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:03,680
So if I select everything from new info run this we're able to add in some new title and keep people

77
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,890
as something no if you ever get confused or stuck or have trouble remembering what the actual calls

78
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,960
are for the altar table command.

79
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,600
You can always go to the documentation and look up altar table and it has a whole synopsis of the different

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,390
variants you can use such as rename to the table etc. We can also show you different actions that are

81
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,440
available dropping columns adding columns altering columns.

82
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,190
So lots and lots of different options here and examples.

83
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,940
And if you start scrolling down has even more detail on each of these commands such as ultra constraint

84
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,820
there's also things like dropping constraints et cetera.

85
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,450
So lots of different options here.

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,390
It's all for you.

87
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,790
It's all here for you in the documentation.

88
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,120
OK thanks.

89
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,220
And I'll see you at the next lecture.
