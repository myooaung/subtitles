00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.730
Welcome back everyone to this lecture for your challenge.

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.310
Tasks for the group by section of the course as always will have the challenge presented than the expected

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.130
result.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.680
We'll give you hints if you need them and then we'll go over the solution your first challenge task

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.970
goes as follows.

6
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.680
We have two staff members with staff ideas 1 and 2.

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.630
We want to give a bonus to the staff member that handled the most payments most in terms of number of

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.080
payments processed not total dollar amount.

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.760
So how many payments that each staff member handle and who gets the bonus here's the expected result

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.570
so the expected result is that staff member number two handled seven thousand three hundred and four

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.120
payments which was more than staff idea number one.

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.860
So staff I.D. number two should get the bonus.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.910
Here's some hints so the hints are to use the payment table and to make sure understand difference between

14
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.680
count and sum since only one of them shouldn't be working here.

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.980
All right.

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.360
And here's the solution.

17
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.430
The solution is to select staff idea column comma and then count the amount.

18
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.430
Column or really any column and then we'll say from the payment table grouped by staff I.D. And as I

19
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.450
mentioned you can technically pass an asterisk there.

20
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.250
Since you're really just counting the rows per staff member since each row in the payment table represents

21
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.710
a payment and we're assigning the bonus based off the total number of payments we just count the total

22
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.390
number of rows associated per staff I.D..

23
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.190
All right so let's move on to the next challenge corporate headquarters is conducting a study on the

24
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.440
relationship between replacement cost and the movies.

25
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.300
MP A rating that is to say its rating of G P G R etc..

26
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.450
What is the average replacement cost per employee.

27
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.860
A rating note you may need to expand the average column to view the correct results.

28
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.390
Okay here comes the expect the result so the expected result should look something like this.

29
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.780
We have a rating and then its associated average replacement cost per rating.

30
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.100
Here comes some hints the hint is to use the film table and to also recall that average returns back

31
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.730
many significant digits.

32
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.860
So can either stretch out the column as you just saw or you can use the round function to fix this issue.

33
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.730
And here comes a solution so the solution is to select the rating column and then apply the average

34
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.310
function on the replacement cost column from the film table and then group by rating.

35
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.320
As we've previously mentioned the just average function produces many significant digits past the decimal

36
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.020
point.

37
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.060
So if you wanted to you could pass this into round and then only select two places pass the decimal.

38
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.830
And here's our last challenge.

39
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.570
We're running a promotion to reward our top five customers with coupons.

40
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.280
What are the customer I.D. of the top five customers based off total expenditure or total spend.

41
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.480
That is the actual dollar amount.

42
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.850
All right here's the expected result so the expected results are these five customer I.D..

43
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.880
And here are their total amount expenditures.

44
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.840
They should feel pretty familiar we did something very similar to this during the actual lectures.

45
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.200
Here are some hints in case you need them so the hints are to use the payment table and use order by

46
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.840
and recall you can order by the results of an aggregate function and you may want to use limit to view

47
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.970
just the top five results.

48
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.870
Here comes a solution.

49
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.400
So the solution is to select the customer idea column and then take the sum of the amount column from

50
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.070
the payment table grouped by the customer I.D. and then order by some amount.

51
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.150
In descending order and in this case we just wanted the top five.

52
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.350
So we also added limit 5.

53
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.670
All right.

54
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.080
That's it for your challenge tasks.

55
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.450
Hopefully you weren't too bad.

56
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.420
Coming up next we're going to discuss the having class.

57
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.030
I'll see you there.
