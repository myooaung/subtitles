1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,640
Welcome everyone to this lecture on an overview of the graphical user interface we use for this course

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,460
which is P.G. Adelman version for so by now you should have gone through the installation lecture have

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,880
P.G. Ataman and post Chris equal installed and setup.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,370
It should have been able to perform your first sequel query in the query editor or query tool.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,440
What I want to do now is just quickly go over some of P.G. Adam features.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,030
Keep in mind this is kind of an optional lecture.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,960
We're going to be going over things like how to change font size how to choose a dark theme how to get

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,180
shortcuts from with NPC admin.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,190
If that sort of stuff doesn't really interest you or if you're fine if the defaults or if you feel comfortable

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,700
enough they you can quickly just google search how to change these sort of things.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,380
Feel free to continue on with the rest of the course since this particular lecture technically isn't

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,340
about sequel it's just a quick overview of the graphical interface.

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,860
If you are interested in those things go ahead and continue along by opening up P.G. Adumim.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,760
So let's head over to PJ Adelman now.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,590
OK here I am inside of P.G. admin when you open up P.G. atom and you'll see the servers here.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,460
You'll see a dashboard as well.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,880
And what's nice is it has some useful links such as adding a new server if that's necessary to go to

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,830
the documentation.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,850
The PGA admin official Web site etc..

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,810
So if you expand on servers you should then see the Postgres sequel version you install and then if

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,810
you expand on that you'll see databases and you'll see your DVD rental database.

22
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,590
Note here I have a couple more databases later on in the course will actually be creating some of these

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,200
databases so don't worry about that yet but you should see the DVD rental database that you created

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,050
in the installation lecture.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,530
So let's go ahead and show you a couple of useful things for PGE Adelman.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,350
First I want to start off by how to edit your preferences visual preferences for PGE Ataman if you come

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,610
to file select preferences you'll see a wide variety of preferences.

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,680
A lot of these are geared towards advance users so you have things like what to display on the dashboard

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,890
what graphs to show in the refresh rate for them.

30
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,760
But probably the ones you guys are most interested in is if you come to miscellaneous and select themes.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,370
There is currently a standard theme but the latest version of PGA admin for released right now as I'm

32
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,550
filming this has a beta dark version.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,050
Now since this is technically in beta I didn't want my PGA admin to crash as I was filming.

34
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,790
So this course is filmed in the standard theme but if you were working on sequel in a dark room or it's

35
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,470
nighttime and you want to rest your eyes a bit you can always select the dark theme for your own P.G.

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,440
admin.

37
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,830
The other thing I want to point out is the query tool is really where we spend most of the time in this

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,310
course and the query Ed specifically is really what we're working with.

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,430
And if you ever want to change the font size for the query editor you can come here under query tool

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,600
editor go to font size and then you can change the font size here something to note is that the font

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,720
size is actually not something like twelve point font like you would have in a normal word processor.

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,390
It's actually a relative font size.

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:24,650
So if you want to double the current font size you would type in a two because it's a two to one ratio.

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,340
If you want to increase the font size by 20 percent you would type in one point too.

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,160
So up to a maximum of 10 so that's 10 x.

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,410
The default font size which is probably way too large but this is something you can play around.

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,220
You can see here I have one point four so we'll go ahead and just not have any changes set that cancel

48
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,430
and those are the main preferences for visual things you can edit.

49
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,730
The other thing I want to point out here is if I go ahead and click on DVD rental and select that object

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,240
I see this dashboard start to show up as give me information of things things like how many transactions

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,840
am I performing on this particular database per second.

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,160
You can see here that essentially I'm not really doing anything right now with it.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,520
So it's kind of a flat line and you can always edit what's shown on the dashboard.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,640
Again by going to your preferences dashboards display graphs and you can refresh this faster choose

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,080
things not the display etc..

56
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,730
Let's go ahead and cancel that.

57
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,390
And then the real thing that's pretty important to understand here is if you have your database selected

58
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,850
there's a variety of tabs here on properties sequel statistics dependencies dependents cetera.

59
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,610
And we're going to be understanding these particularly what this actually means here with sequel.

60
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,290
Later on in this course.

61
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,140
But really where we spend most of the time here is if you right click you see the query tool option.

62
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,890
That's where we spend most of the time.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,120
And if you have an object selected you can also then go to object appear in the top toolbar and it will

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,360
give you the same abilities either on their object or under tools such as query tool and you can easily

65
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,410
get those again by right clicking on a database.

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,950
So essentially you can either get them here from the top toolbar or by right clicking and select the

67
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,460
toolbar here.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
So let's go ahead and right click on this.

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,490
Open up an example query Ed..

70
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,340
So here I have my query Ed..

71
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,600
Something to note about the query Ed is you have this nice query history option.

72
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:30,990
So if we perform the same query we did at the beginning select from film and then I can either run this

73
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,540
with play or by refreshing with a five you'll see some results here and obviously we don't know sequel

74
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,420
quite yet to understand everything here but we see a data output which is the rows and then the columns

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,870
we see explain.

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,690
Sometimes you will have something to explain especially for inserting stuff into a table.

77
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,230
Right now we are not doing anything advanced enough to see an explanation.

78
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,890
There's messages you should always pretty much see a message indicating whether or not your query actually

79
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,390
worked.

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,560
Also how fast it was which is kind of nice if you want to compare queries and then any notifications

81
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,880
if necessary.

82
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,710
In this case this is simple enough that there are no notifications so beyond this data output what's

83
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,260
nice.

84
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,850
Also here available to us in the query editor is you can go to your query history.

85
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,480
So here I can see a variety of query histories.

86
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm going to have a lot more history than you.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,420
Because this is from filming other things for the course that you've seen here.

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,650
But what's nice about this is let's say I take a look at some historical query I can either just copy

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,700
that query or I can copy to query editor select that and it will automatically copy and paste something

90
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,180
from history directly to the query editor.

91
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,960
So I can run that as well and do worry about understanding this sequel could we actually cover this

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,900
later on in the course.

93
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,670
Another thing I want to show you is if you're actually selecting something from the data output and

94
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,130
you decided hey I want to share this with somebody else as a CSP file you can come over here to this

95
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:02,910
little download icon and it will download the current results as a CSP which is a comma separated variable

96
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,990
file and that's the kind of file that you can open easily with Excel or a wide variety of programs.

97
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,150
So that might be helpful to you if you're trying to build a report for someone else or just share with

98
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,740
them the results.

99
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,450
Now the other thing I want to point out here is because this is in the browser sometimes you'll accidently

100
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,960
quick on click on this query tool and drag it out and then you get this kind of weird separate window.

101
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,470
If that ever happens to you if anything you can always just grab it again and then snap it back as if

102
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,230
it was a tab.

103
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,330
So I'm going to grab this and note here it's kind of going to highlight that I'm putting it back in

104
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,160
there and I will snap it back to the main tab.

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,750
And the last thing I want to show you is how to quickly access online help.

106
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,350
So if you come over here to help there's both help on P.G. admin which is a graphical user interface

107
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,830
and help on post Cress equal.

108
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,020
So if you click on pediatric Web site it takes us to that official Web site.

109
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,530
It can click here on documentation.

110
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,440
Introduction four point one nine which is the latest version I installed and it has pretty much the

111
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,530
entire description of everything you see with Adelman.

112
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,670
So if for some reason you're super interested in the toolbar for instance click on toolbar here and

113
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,170
I will describe everything available to inside the toolbar.

114
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,410
So that is available to under help PGA and Web site.

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,560
And then underneath the PGA admin Web site you simply come to documentation and select the version that's

116
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,900
appropriate for you OK the other thing I want to show you is the postgrad sicko website is also available

117
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,730
to you underneath directly PGI admin.

118
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,490
So you got a post where a dot org.

119
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:42,670
Go to documentation choose the version we're using which is twelve and then you'll see the documentation

120
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,060
here.

121
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,700
So maybe your issue that in queries which is what we're going to cover click on that and I'll give you

122
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,060
an overview of table expressions such as the from clause.

123
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,880
Now the whole point of this course is for you not having to read through documentation for more advanced

124
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,520
equal commands.

125
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,440
We will reference the documentation for things like useful lookup tables or useful functions.

126
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,750
For example later on we'll cover mathematical functions and instead of listing them all in the video

127
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,210
we'll just reference that documentation fee to visit.

128
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,600
So you can always quite easily visit documentation by simply coming to help post go website and then

129
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,780
selecting documentation along with an online manual for your current release.

130
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,610
Okay.

131
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,260
So that it's pretty much all you need to know for now.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,930
We'll cover some other useful features of PGA admin that are more specific to things like create table

133
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,840
commands much later on in the course.

134
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,130
All you really need to know for now is how to access that query tool which is the same thing we did

135
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,010
in the installation lecture.

136
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,690
Thanks.

137
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,270
And I will see you at the next lecture.
