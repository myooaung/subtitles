<v Instructor>Hello everyone,</v>
2

2

00:00:01,951  -->  00:00:04,628
welcome to your first assessment test.
3

3

00:00:04,628  -->  00:00:06,751
You've actually had a lot of challenges along the way
4

4

00:00:06,751  -->  00:00:09,874
so this isn't gonna be a very long assessment test.
5

5

00:00:09,874  -->  00:00:12,484
It's actually just gonna be three quick questions
6

6

00:00:12,484  -->  00:00:14,826
and it's also gonna be in article lecture format,
7

7

00:00:14,826  -->  00:00:15,785
so you won't see any videos,
8

8

00:00:15,785  -->  00:00:18,492
you'll just get the actual text of the question.
9

9

00:00:18,492  -->  00:00:21,222
You're gonna be provided with the answers to test against.
10

10

00:00:21,222  -->  00:00:24,775
So for instance, if the question is something like,
11

11

00:00:24,775  -->  00:00:28,332
tell me how many customers do X, Y, and Z,
12

12

00:00:28,332  -->  00:00:30,129
you'll also be provided with the answer,
13

13

00:00:30,129  -->  00:00:32,841
and it'll say something like, the answer should be 20.
14

14

00:00:32,841  -->  00:00:35,853
You won't actually be provided with the full SQL solution
15

15

00:00:35,853  -->  00:00:39,042
until the lecture after the test lecture.
16

16

00:00:39,042  -->  00:00:41,567
Again, so the next lecture you're gonna have questions,
17

17

00:00:41,567  -->  00:00:44,150
and then some answers to check your work against,
18

18

00:00:44,150  -->  00:00:45,834
and then once you've actually matched up
19

19

00:00:45,834  -->  00:00:47,279
or you still haven't been able to match up
20

20

00:00:47,279  -->  00:00:48,684
to the exact answer,
21

21

00:00:48,684  -->  00:00:50,655
you can go to the lecture after that
22

22

00:00:50,655  -->  00:00:53,219
to get the full SQL query solution.
23

23

00:00:53,219  -->  00:00:55,451
Keep in mind you may have done SQL queries
24

24

00:00:55,451  -->  00:00:56,880
that are slightly different,
25

25

00:00:56,880  -->  00:00:57,853
there's a couple different ways
26

26

00:00:57,853  -->  00:00:59,634
to solve each of the questions,
27

27

00:00:59,634  -->  00:01:01,670
so as long as you actually get the right answer,
28

28

00:01:01,670  -->  00:01:03,223
you should be good to go.
29

29

00:01:03,223  -->  00:01:04,783
Okay, thanks everyone,
30

30

00:01:04,783  -->  00:01:07,868
and best of luck on the assessment test.
