00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.740
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on importing and exporting data in this lecture.

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.390
We're going to be exploring the import export functionality of P.G. admin which allows us to import

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.220
data from a C as we file or text file to an already existing table.

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.690
There are some really important notes to keep in mind however when you're using the import export functionality

5
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.120
the first important note is to realize that not every outside data file will work variations and things

6
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.660
like formatting macros embedded in the file data types.

7
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.810
Data mis alignment et cetera may prevent the import command from reading the file if the file is just

8
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.470
not compatible to be worked with inside of sequel.

9
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.050
You're just going to have to either edit your file or change your existing table to make sure it aligns

10
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.890
correctly with your existing data file if you want more details about compatible file types and examples

11
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.140
online they're available to you in the online documentation which can reach up post Chris equal to org

12
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320
slash docs slash twelve slash sequel Dash.

13
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.670
Copy the copy command is what import uses internally when it's actually running the secret code to import

14
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.570
things through the P.G. adamant graphical user interface the next important note is that you must provide

15
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.530
the one hundred percent correct file path to your outside file.

16
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.430
Otherwise the import command will fail to find the file.

17
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.910
This is really similar to when we're restoring files based off the DOT tar file.

18
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.320
If you do not provide the correct location PGI admin will fail to find the file.

19
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.320
So I always ask you to confirm the file location underneath the files properties tab and we'll show

20
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.010
you how to do that.

21
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.160
In this lecture and the most important note the import command does not create a table for you.

22
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.890
This is probably the biggest misconception among beginners with Postgres sequel and trying to create

23
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.270
a table from a CSP file or from Excel file it is actually not possible to use basic Postgres sequel

24
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.820
commands in order to immediately create a table from a dot CSC file or excel file the copy command for

25
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.430
Postgres sequel and the import functionality for PGI admin work under the assumption that the table

26
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.910
is already created.

27
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.930
There is currently no automated way within standard P.G. admin or standard Postgres sequel to create

28
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.630
a table directly from a thought CSB file.

29
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.600
Now if that being said I have posted a couple of external links to this lecture that may help you explore

30
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.960
different methods of trying to create a function that will automatically create a table based off the

31
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600
header names of a dot CSC file.

32
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.710
So you're essentially splitting up now into two parts.

33
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.160
In this lecture we're going to create the table manually but as you can imagine there's a couple of

34
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.550
tools that people have built to try to automate that process.

35
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.010
However these tools are not part of standard PGI admin or standard postgrad sequel.

36
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.820
So instead we've posted them as external links since as PGI admin changes and as Postgres sequel goes

37
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.600
through various versions they may break their functionality a certain point.

38
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.490
So we're going to show you stuff here that we know will always work regardless of what version of sequel

39
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.850
or P.G. atom and you're using OK so now let's go ahead and work through an example through PGE Ataman

40
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.820
OK.

41
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.570
Here I am in my browser.

42
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.580
I am right now in tight P.G. admin but what I'm also going to do is I'm going to go to Google Drive

43
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.150
and I'm going to create a very simple CSP file underneath this spreadsheet application.

44
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.360
You can really use any spreadsheet application here that can export to a dot CSP.

45
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.480
So what I'm going to do is just call this simple underscore table and what this is going to do is I'm

46
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.520
going to have two columns in a column and a B column.

47
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.340
It's going to give you three.

48
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.320
Why not ABC.

49
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.850
And then let's put in some values here.

50
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.050
So one two three say four five six and then seven eight nine.

51
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.090
Okay super simple table then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say this onto my computer.

52
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.090
So I'm going to doubtless download this excuse me as a dot CSP file so a comma separated values.

53
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.490
If you have an excel file open we can do is you can save it as a dot CSC file.

54
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.960
OK so I'm going to download this as a dot c as we file and now it's going to be available for me underneath

55
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.790
my downloads folder.

56
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.100
So what I'm going to do is just to make sure and confirm I know exactly where this is.

57
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:47.460
Let's show it inside the downloads folder and if I bring in my downloads folder.

58
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.550
So right now I have downloads my downloads simple table what I'm going to do is just rename this so

59
00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:00.910
that it doesn't have any spacing and I'm just going to rename this let's say simple table the CSP.

60
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.930
So there's no spacing within that that CSC file.

61
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.090
And what I also want to do is I want to confirm its actual location.

62
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.510
Keep in mind I won't be able to know where your dot CSP file is on your computer.

63
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.420
So what I'm going to do is I can confirm this by checking out the properties of this file and I can

64
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.780
see here the full file location.

65
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.410
So this is extremely similar to what we did in the dot tar file.

66
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.090
And you can always just do a simple google search for how to get the full file path.

67
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.290
If you're on a Mac OS computer or on a Linux computer or whatever your operating system is.

68
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.680
So right now I'm on windows so I can just look up the properties to get the full location.

69
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.790
So this is the information I'm going to be providing to postgrad sequel later on along with the name

70
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.320
of my file so to OK here and I renamed my file.

71
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.520
I know its location.

72
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.210
Those steps are done.

73
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.780
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to come over here to PGE admin they close a little tab here.

74
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.120
All right.

75
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.300
So in P.G. admin what I'm going to do is I have my test database that we've used in a couple of the

76
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.420
lectures in this section of the course I'm going to open up my query tool and it's time for me to create

77
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.190
a table.

78
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.850
Now the table has to match up with the format of my dot CSP file.

79
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.750
Exactly.

80
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.160
So I have three columns a b and c..

81
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.250
So let's go ahead and create these.

82
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:34.190
So I will say create table simple and there'll be three columns here a b and c and then let's have it

83
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.970
be all integer data type so Integer Integer and integer.

84
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.240
OK.

85
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.110
There's no constraints.

86
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.850
Very simple table as you can imagine if you had a more complex CSC file you could expand on this adding

87
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.580
constraints and so on.

88
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.670
So next one I'm going to do is I'm going to run this and now that created my table.

89
00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:03.190
So it's time to actually copy the information that is within that CSP file and put it into this table.

90
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.540
So how do we actually do this.

91
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.080
Well I'm going to show you that the table exists.

92
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.220
So you should be able to now say select everything from simple run that and have a b and c empty there's

93
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.300
no rows yet.

94
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.960
Now the next step is to use P.G. admins import export functionality to actually grab the information

95
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.780
from that external dot CSP file.

96
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.630
So what I'm going to do here is the first thing.

97
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.390
Let's just quickly refresh our database to make sure that we have those changes within the simple table

98
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.390
ready to go.

99
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.320
And it should pretty much be confirmed because we were able to actually query that simple table Expand

100
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.710
the.

101
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:49.270
Test me database and then go ahead and expand schemas and then expand the public schema.

102
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.100
And later on you should see tables and then the simple table we created along with the corresponding

103
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.280
columns A B and C.

104
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:02.980
And so you can actually export the contents of any table as a dot CSP file or as a dot text file and

105
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.850
then likewise you can import information externally.

106
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:12.550
So we right click on the table itself right click on that simple table and you should see something

107
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.680
called import export.

108
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.100
Go ahead and click on that.

109
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.090
And this is the import export tool.

110
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:26.050
So this allows us to actually either export information as a dot see as we file or that text file or

111
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.540
if I hit this little switch.

112
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:34.090
Now I can import information notice when I hit import suddenly P.J. Edmonds ask me for a file name which

113
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.860
makes sense because I need to somehow provide the information on where to import from.

114
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.740
So let me zoom out just a little bit so we can see everything that's happening here.

115
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.640
Expand this again right here.

116
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.060
OK.

117
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.400
So it's time to get the file name and the way I'm going to do that is we have two options just like

118
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.570
for the DB the rental lot tar file in the exercise up tar file restore.

119
00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:02.320
You can either manually type in the file or you can hit these three dots and begin exploring your computer

120
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.970
for the actual files are.

121
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:10.900
So if I hit here under my downloads I have simple table dot CSP and then I can select.

122
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.420
You may need to show hidden files and folders and you may need to play around with this format to show

123
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:22.480
0 for all files or CSP files or text files if you have it as just CSB then it should show you that that

124
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.310
CSC file we created earlier.

125
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.690
So I'm going to select this.

126
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.260
Now if for some reason you hit those three dots and regardless of what options you're choosing you still

127
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.390
don't see your file.

128
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.650
That's totally okay.

129
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.600
You just provide the full file path manually so you can always type in manually here.

130
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:46.740
What the Fool file path is so that way regardless of where the file is on your computer you just pass

131
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.440
in the full file path.

132
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.240
OK want to make sure our format matches up so that CSP.

133
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.980
So that's also correct and now we have to go through a couple of options here.

134
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.690
The first one is if we see the columns tab it's going to report you the columns to import.

135
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.010
And what's nice is you can remove these columns if they don't happen to be present in your table.

136
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.740
So if for some reason you had an extra D column in your CSP file you could just close that off or exit

137
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.340
it and remove it and then you wouldn't be copying that information into your table.

138
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.640
Now if we come back to options what I'm going to do is I have to declare whether or not there is a header

139
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:28.240
within the file the header is just the first row that contains the column names A B and C that is present

140
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.150
in our CSP file and I don't want to duplicate information by having insertion inserting the information

141
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.220
of ABC.

142
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.840
So I just say yes there's a header and that lets postcard sequel No.

143
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.260
OK.

144
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.060
I will ignore that first row so I won't copy that over.

145
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.230
Next we have to choose the delimiter so we can select from a list.

146
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.050
So here I'm going to select comma since it's a comma separated file.

147
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.690
Then you can also specify the quoting character being used so default is double quote but if you have

148
00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.070
strings and your that CSP file that are using single quotes you can just go ahead and select single

149
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:06.040
quote In our case it does really matter since there were all integers and then here we have escape which

150
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:11.530
if there is an escape value essentially ignoring a particular character call you can specify that through

151
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.660
escape for our very simple file to worry about either of those we'll go ahead and now hit.

152
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:25.310
OK they'll say import export job created and you should see now successfully completed if you get some

153
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.990
sort of error here it's extremely likely that you provided the wrong file path.

154
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.050
So triple check that you're providing the correct file path.

155
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:40.040
OK so now that the copying of table data is done well we're gonna go ahead and do is rerun our select

156
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.270
everything from simple.

157
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:51.650
So now when I rerun this notice I have successfully imported the data from that CSP file into my table

158
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.970
here inside of P.G. at and to conclude this lecture.

159
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.530
Let's go ahead and show you how you can also run the export functionality which is almost the exact

160
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:07.370
same process what you do is you decide on whatever table you want to export to adopt CSP file.

161
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:13.800
Go ahead and right click on that then select import export and then we already by default have it on

162
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.810
export.

163
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.480
You can decide what columns you want to actually copy over export.

164
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:23.580
Maybe you don't want all the columns exported and then what you need to do is just basically where you

165
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.350
actually want to save the file you can provide a file name.

166
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:33.390
So if I want it underneath my downloads what I can do is I can copy this and go ahead and click cancel

167
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.030
there.

168
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.840
I'm going to copy that in there and then let's call this my new DOT CSP.

169
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.960
Essentially I'm just gonna provide the full file path of where I actually want to save this file and

170
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.250
its name.

171
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.700
And then after that you can choose the delimiter you want to export with.

172
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.970
So I'll export with a comma and then if there's any string characters that you want to use quotes around

173
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.230
you can decide if you want double quotes or single quotes.

174
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.540
Essentially the exact same things as we did before for importing.

175
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.890
You can also choose encoding if you need to.

176
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.720
Then you'll just hit.

177
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:13.010
OK and then that will export the file which you should now see if I bring over my downloads folder I

178
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:18.470
can see my new CSC has now been created along with the original simple table that CSC.

179
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.120
OK.

180
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.730
So that's pretty much it for exporting.

181
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.490
Exactly.

182
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.770
Very similar to the import process.

183
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.310
Do you just select export instead.

184
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.750
Thanks.

185
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:28.910
And I'll see you at the next lecture.
