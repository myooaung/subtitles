1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,900
Hello everyone and welcome to the installation and setup lecture.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,680
It's time to get set up for the course in this lecture.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,030
We're mainly going to be installing two things.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:21,200
One is post crest sequel which is a sequel engine that stores data and then reads in our query and returns

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,590
back information from the database.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,520
The second thing you're going to install is P.G. ataman.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,360
This is a graphical user interface that lies on top of post sequel that just makes it easier for us

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,620
to have a graphical interface in which to type our queries so it'll directly connect with post graphs

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,180
equal and just make things like restoring a database a lot easier.

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,520
Please know that we want to make sure you follow each step in order carefully.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,430
There's two really common confusion points during the installation process.

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,220
One is we have a database file called DVD rental that TAR file as a resource.

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,670
In this lecture Do not open that file directly.

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,560
Often students get confused because it looks like a PDA or the computer recognizes it as a different

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,570
type of file.

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,880
You don't need to worry about any of that later on we'll just download it but do not open it directly.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,160
The second really common confusion point is forgetting the password you set up for post stress sequel.

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,190
It's really important that you write down and remember that password.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,290
When that step comes.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,130
All right.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,320
So to help avoid any missed steps we've gone ahead and numbered the steps so as we go through this you

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,470
should be able to follow along.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,710
You'll see step one step two step three etc. So we'll present them in the correct order for you.

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,020
Let's go ahead and get started.

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,710
Step number one is to download and install post crest sequel.

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,250
Let's head over to an Internet browser.

27
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:50,060
All right go ahead in your browser go to Google dot com and then search for post gross sequel.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,220
Hit enter and the very first link that isn't an advertisement should be WW that post gross equal dot

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,990
org.

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,470
So we'll go ahead and click on that.

31
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:06,450
This is the official site for post crest sequel and then this takes us to the official site and essentially

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,050
somewhere on this page you should see a download button.

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,980
Go ahead and either click up here or it says download or click the download button here.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,450
The site page just changed from time to time so you may have to look around to see where the download

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,230
button is.

36
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,020
But overall we want to click to download and it's typically at post sequel to org slash download and

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,420
then as we come down here we'll see something called different binary packages for Linux.

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,140
Then there's Mac OS Solaris windows etc..

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,670
There's also the source code.

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,090
Right now I'm on a Windows computer so I will go ahead and click windows for the correct download and

41
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,880
then you'll notice that it says interactive installer but enterprise DP.

42
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,780
There's also different information on platform support you may have to choose a different version depending

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,120
on what version of Windows you're running.

44
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,980
If you're running an older version of Windows especially a 32 bit version of Windows you may need to

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,230
download a lower version of post egress equal so quickly make sure that the version of Windows you're

46
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,650
running is compatible with whatever Postgres sequel version you install.

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,250
OK come back up here and then hit download the installer.

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,280
Keep in mind this does change from time to time as far as the description it may say graphical installer

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,990
enterprise DP but overall we're getting the installer from Enterprise VB go ahead and click on that.

50
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:29,240
It will take you to enterprise D.B. dot com download etc and you're going to click the correct download

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,750
version for you.

52
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,840
So right now I'm running on a Windows computer.

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,270
I'll go ahead and just select the most recent version.

54
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,560
If you're running on an older Windows computer you may have to downgrade to a lower version.

55
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:45,790
So we're gonna go ahead and look at the windows column and then hit download OK so you download should

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,180
begin automatically.

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,090
Here you can see among Google Chrome.

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,330
And over here on the bottom left it's downloading that post equal executable file.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,470
I'm going to fast forward in time until this is done downloading.

60
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,740
All right that's done downloading for me so I will go ahead and open up the executable file.

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,650
Upon launching the executable file you should see the setup wizard.

62
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,710
Pop up if for some reason you don't see the setup wizard.

63
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,550
Pop up.

64
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,480
Make sure that you don't have a firewall blocking this installer from opening.

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,440
Especially if you're on a work computer business internet connection.

66
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,640
OK.

67
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,510
So here we have set a postcard sequel.

68
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,850
We'll go ahead and click next.

69
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,460
Go ahead and please specify the directory I recommend just choosing the default installation directory.

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,900
Go ahead and click next and then it's gonna ask you to select what components you want to install.

71
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,900
Go ahead and just leave everything selected as is.

72
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,320
Notice that it's selected P.G. admin for for us anyways we'll go ahead and just leave everything as

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,230
a default click next and then go ahead and select the data directory of where to store the data.

74
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,570
Make sure you choose the default.

75
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,630
And this is the extremely important part.

76
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,720
It's asking us to please provide a password for the database super user.

77
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,040
So you have to absolutely make sure that you remember this password.

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,160
I highly recommend that you make it something extremely simple just like password and all lowercase.

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,490
This isn't really a security issue since since it's just a learning exercise will be will be just running

80
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,250
this locally on our computer.

81
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:25,630
So I'm not too concerned about someone hacking into my computer so I'll just say password and then password.

82
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,100
There's no way I can really help you if you forget what this password is.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,630
So if you forget with this password is you're essentially going to have to uninstall everything and

84
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,310
reinstall all over again.

85
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,990
So please if you name your password something else that's difficult to remember.

86
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,230
Write it down somewhere.

87
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,180
I cannot help you if you forget this password.

88
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,920
OK so I set up my password is just lowercase password.

89
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,940
We will be asked for this later on.

90
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,210
Next is going to ask you to please select the port number the server should be listening on.

91
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,150
By default it should say the port number is 5 4 3 2.

92
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,010
If you get another number like 5 4 3 3 or 5 4 3 4 etc. that's OK too.

93
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,900
We can later on show you how to make sure you're connecting to the correct port number.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,330
When we install PGE admin most likely by default you have 5 4 3 2 unless for some reason you may have

95
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,070
maybe an older version of Postgres sequel on your computer already existing and listening on a specific

96
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,390
port.

97
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,790
So we have it right now as default as 5 4 3 2.

98
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,300
So we'll keep it that way.

99
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,300
We'll go ahead and click next it's going to ask you to select the location to be used by the new database

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,030
cluster.

101
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,780
Go ahead and just leave it as the default location hit next.

102
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,390
And then it's going to tell you all the settings you just chose.

103
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:42,740
That's OK to hit next setup is ready to install hit next and let's go ahead and let it install.

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,460
And this essentially concludes.

105
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,530
Step number one on the fast forward in time until this is done installing.

106
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,240
All right.

107
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,940
This is done installing you'll notice at the very end asks you if you want to launch stack builder.

108
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,420
You don't need to launch that so I'm going to um click the launching of that and then just hit finish.

109
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,620
That's the end of Step 1.

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,630
It's time to move on the step number two is download and install PDC admin to start off.

111
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,980
Go ahead and go to your browser and then go to Google dot com and search for PGE admin.

112
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,970
I'm going to do that now.

113
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,330
OK here I am at Google dot com.

114
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,890
I search for PGI admin and the first thing that should pop up that is an advertisement is peachy Ataman

115
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,930
dot org.

116
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,910
Go ahead and select that link it'll take you to this Web site P.G. admin PGI admin is the graphical

117
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,260
user interface that we're going to be using tax you perform queries and connect to post graphs equal

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,410
during the course.

119
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,120
And what's interesting about PGI admin it actually uses your browser as the graphical user interface.

120
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,290
So after we install it we'll be able to open it up within our browser.

121
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,290
So somewhere along this page you should see a download button.

122
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:53,980
So it's either gonna be up here and download or there's quick links here for both an online demo if

123
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,830
you want to check it out.

124
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,790
You can open this up and try it out here in your browser start a situation and it set something up for

125
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,660
you and it has a little bit of a sandbox here you can check out.

126
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,120
They'll kind of play around officer and thing ask you for email address etc. But in our case we're going

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,080
to go to lead this and just click on Download since we're gonna be installing it anyways.

128
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,160
There's two versions of PGI admin PJ admin for and then PGE admin 3.

129
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,870
Keep in mind if you're running an older version of Windows you may need to use PD admin 3 instead of

130
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,610
PGI admin for.

131
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,920
And even though it says PJ admin 3 is no longer supported that just means that they're not updating

132
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,210
it anymore which makes sense if you're running an older version of Windows so if you're an older version

133
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,790
of Windows like Windows 7 or something you may need to actually use PGI admin 3 but if you're on the

134
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,380
latest version of any of these operating systems Mac OS Windows.

135
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,780
Some Linux distribution you should be good for.

136
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,640
PGI admin for I'm going to go ahead and click on Windows since I'm on a Windows computer.

137
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,950
You realize there's multiple versions of PGI admin for they keep releasing updates to it and I'm going

138
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,240
to hit on PJ admin for version 4 point 1 8 The latest version released so I'll click on that and it's

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,610
going to take me to something that looks like this and it's a little confusing at first but essentially

140
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:20,320
all we need to download is the actual executable file that's within this and if you take a look it should

141
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,110
be the largest file we're actually downloading.

142
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,750
So go ahead and download this executable file for PGE admin and you can see down here it's downloading.

143
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,750
It'll be done in a few seconds.

144
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,520
Once you've gone ahead and download the executable file go ahead and open it up and run it.

145
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,140
Keep in mind you may need to run it as an administrator so make sure you have admin permissions on your

146
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,930
computer and you can right click and run this as an admin so I'll click on that and now we have the

147
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,250
setup wizard for P.G. admin.

148
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,950
Most of this work is going to choose a default so we'll go ahead and click Next accept the agreement

149
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,720
hit next.

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,150
Select the default location that's going to be OK hit next.

151
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,330
It's going to ask you what you want to call the start menu option that's go ahead and click next and

152
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,200
then just hit install.

153
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,490
OK.

154
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,990
That's pretty much it for installing PGI I'm going to fast forward until this is done installing and

155
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,610
now it's finished installing.

156
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,250
We are not actually going to launch PGI item and yet we have step number 3 to move on here so you can

157
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,370
go ahead and unclip the launch PG&amp;E in 4 and then just hit finish.

158
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:28,660
It's now time for step 3 of our process where we're going to download but remember do not directly open

159
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,500
the DVD rental that TAR file the DVD rental dock tar file is a compressed version of the database we're

160
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,530
going to be using for this course.

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,990
You can download it as a resource in this lecture.

162
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,920
Keep in mind that we're only downloading it.

163
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,740
Do not attempt to unzip it or try to open it of any other program.

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,650
It may say that the file is damaged and the windows can't find a program to open it with.

165
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,820
That's okay.

166
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,110
This file is not meant to be opened by anything other than Keiji admin.

167
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,270
So please do not double click on this file after downloading it.

168
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,970
The only thing you're going to do is download the file.

169
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,380
Let's see how to do that.

170
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,770
If you check out the Udemy support page on downloading supplemental resources as you're watching this

171
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,200
particular video over on the right hand side you should see a little resources button pop up and then

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,080
you'll see the DVD rental that TAR file.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,660
So what that's actually going to look like is you'll be watching the complete cycle bootcamp and then

174
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,690
over here on the actual lecture you'll hit resources and then select DVD rental that tar.

175
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,340
Go ahead and click on it and it should download and I'm going to open the file location recall.

176
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,860
Do not double click or open does not tar filed directly.

177
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,600
You can see here that I now have it underneath my downloads and DVD rental.

178
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,670
Dot tar things that are important to keep in mind is to not directly double click or open on this file

179
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,160
and the second thing to keep in mind is you must know the exact location of this file so I know that

180
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,290
it's underneath my downloads folder.

181
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,850
If you have any questions of where this file is actually located you can always right click and then

182
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,520
select properties and you'll see the full location right here of wherever it happens to be on your computer.

183
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,730
We're gonna need that when we actually restore the file.

184
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,120
Okay so that's all you need to do is download it as a resource from this lecture.

185
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,370
Do not open it and do not double click it.

186
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:20,920
All right.

187
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,310
Step number 4 is to go ahead and restart your computer to make sure all the actual changes due to Postgres

188
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,370
sequence PGI admin have taken place.

189
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,050
We need to restart the computer.

190
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,890
I'm going to go ahead and restart my computer and then move on to Step Number Five step number five

191
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,810
is to restore the database.

192
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,390
A quick note on this step is you can ignore the failed exit code that may appear during the restoration

193
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,930
depending on your exact version of your operating system and the exact version of the Postgres sequel

194
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,860
you installed.

195
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,760
There is sometimes a failed exit code that appears that basically indicates that the restoration accidentally

196
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,180
happened twice.

197
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,130
That's totally ok because what happens is it works the first time and then it doesn't do it a second

198
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,050
time because the first time worked.

199
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,730
So you'll be able to safely ignore that failed exit code.

200
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,330
If it does appear so let's go ahead and open P.G. admin to get started.

201
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:20,290
So on your computer go ahead and search for P.G. admin mix you're actually opening P.G. admin the application

202
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,040
and not the executable file.

203
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,800
Otherwise you'll just end up reinstalling it so don't click on this executable file but instead click

204
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,490
on the actual PGE adamant program this application so I'm going to open that up and what's going to

205
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,340
happen is you should see it eventually open up in the browser

206
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,290
OK and here it is in the browser.

207
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,340
Notice that right now it's running in the browser.

208
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,340
This doesn't actually mean it requires an Internet connection to run.

209
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,290
It's just using the actual browser as a graphical interface.

210
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,160
Then it asks you to set a master password.

211
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,060
I would highly recommend that you set this to something very simple and easy to remember since you're

212
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:08,080
going to need this later on I'm going to just set the password to password in all lowercase which actually

213
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,250
matches that Postgres SQL password setup earlier.

214
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,880
Then we'll go ahead and click OK.

215
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,750
And now it's time to restore the database.

216
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:23,680
If you click here on servers you may actually see various versions of Postgres sequel depending on which

217
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,990
one you've installed.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,240
If you follow along with me most likely you'll just see post quests equal twelve.

219
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,490
I've actually installed different version the post crisis equal on this computer so I see all the options.

220
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,220
But in your case you're most likely just going to see Postgres sequel twelve we'll go ahead and click

221
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,100
on Postgres sequel twelve and you can double click on this and then it's going to ask you to enter the

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,310
password for the user post grass.

223
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,740
This is the exact same password we initially set up during the installation of post crest sequel so

224
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,460
I will say lowercase password and go ahead and save the password that we don't need to enter every time.

225
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,840
So again only that it was a double clicked on post stress equal to 12.

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,160
It's gonna connect to the server using a password that I set up earlier.

227
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,660
OK.

228
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,200
And now you should see it connected with this little elephant symbol.

229
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,470
So I've connected to my server and everything's good to go.

230
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,670
If you get an error there on the post yes you can try leaving the password blank but really most likely

231
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,970
you enter the password wrong and you may need to go back and look down to where you wrote that password.

232
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,980
Now it's time to actually restore the database so if connected to a server you'll notice that there

233
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,570
is that default post crest database or next you're going to right click on post critical 12.

234
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:47,960
After connecting to it and then we're going to say create a database and then the database we're going

235
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,410
to create is called DVD

236
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:00,430
rental and then we'll say save and then that creates what is essentially this little empty database

237
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,060
here.

238
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,840
So you can go ahead and click on it and we can see that that database is created.

239
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,870
But right now there's no tables or information in this database.

240
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:15,160
So we're going to restore the database and we do that by right clicking now on that database and going

241
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,790
down here and we're going to say restore click on restore and make sure that underneath format it says

242
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,390
custom or tar file and then we're going to do is we're going to grab that DVD rental that TAR file location

243
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,060
and pass it here as file name.

244
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,530
Now there's two ways of doing this.

245
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:40,620
One is to click on these three little dots and then search around for wherever you happen to save that

246
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,390
file.

247
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:48,000
And keep in mind you may need to show hidden files and folders and have all files as the format and

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,720
you can see here.

249
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,330
I have found DVD rental that tar and then I can select it.

250
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,010
And here now I have the full file path.

251
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,620
Now what sometimes occurs is when you click these three points you actually are in a weird location

252
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,260
on your computer and you can't actually find it.

253
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,660
You can try navigating uses using this home or using backup and sometimes you're in this kind of weird

254
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,370
location and you don't really know how to actually find that DVD rental that TAR file.

255
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,820
That's totally ok.

256
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,360
All you need to do is just manually type in the file name so how can we do that.

257
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:28,770
Well I can come back to where I actually saved that DVD rental that TAR file recall I can click on properties

258
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,410
here and then all I need to do is just copy and paste this location so I'll go ahead and copy that and

259
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,410
then I could manually paste it in here.

260
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,190
That's now the location and then just add in DVD rental dot tar file.

261
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,670
So you have two options.

262
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,730
One is to try to locate the file isn't it a little graphical user interface.

263
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,680
If you're doing that make sure you're showing hidden files and folders as well as showing all files

264
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,340
and you can navigate by going back home here or going back etc. Or you can just manually type out the

265
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,110
file name.

266
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,530
So if the street version doesn't work for you just go ahead and manually type it out then we're gonna

267
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:13,830
come to restore options and we're gonna make sure that we select pre data as yes data as yes and then

268
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,720
post data as yes.

269
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,940
OK those are actually the only sections that we need to worry about as far as these restore options

270
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,780
are concerned.

271
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:28,200
You can leave everything else as the default will come back to general and then we'll go ahead and select

272
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,000
restore click on restore.

273
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,230
They'll say restore job created.

274
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:39,770
Now depending on your actual version of post sequel you may see this little field executed pop up and

275
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,390
I'll say failed execute one you can go ahead and click on more details and if you read these details

276
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,750
it's essentially just saying hey it failed to create it twice.

277
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,800
So sometimes on certain systems it actually creates it twice.

278
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,250
That's totally ok.

279
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,560
We can safely ignore that.

280
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,330
So what we're gonna do here is our DVD rental that TAR file has been successfully restored.

281
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,130
You only thing we need to do now is refresh in order to actually see those changes.

282
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,910
So we're going to right click on DVD rental.

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,700
You'll notice it has this refresh.

284
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,650
Go ahead and refresh.

285
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:20,370
And now what's gonna happen is underneath the actual DVD rental database we should be able to perform

286
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,540
a sample query to make sure everything's running.

287
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,970
So I'm going to right click and then I'm going to select query tool query tool is essentially what we're

288
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,900
gonna be using for the rest of the course.

289
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,790
And this allows us to actually perform a query and then ask for information back.

290
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:46,680
So we're going to say select and then an asterix from film semicolon and then to run this you can go

291
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,260
ahead and click this little play button.

292
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,360
So it's the execute refresh.

293
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,020
Go ahead and run that and you should see now under data output some actual information here.

294
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,380
Okay.

295
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,410
And if you see this information then everything was successful.

296
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,390

297
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,750
Make sure you restart your computer if it still doesn't say that film does not exist.

298
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,150
Go ahead and try a lower voter version of post quest sequel because most likely what's happening is

299

your specific OS doesn't work with that specific version of progress equal.

300
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:28,230
So you can just repeat the steps for any previous version of Postgres sequel but we can see here that

301
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,960
everything is working and this is what we're gonna be using for the rest of the course.

302

So we can check out this query Ed anytime by clicking underneath the version of Postgres sequel underneath

304
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,280

305
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,460

306
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,270

307

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,510
yourself some time.
