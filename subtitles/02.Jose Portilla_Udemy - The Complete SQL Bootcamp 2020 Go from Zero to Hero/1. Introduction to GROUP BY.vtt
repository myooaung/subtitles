Welcome everyone to this section on group by in this section.

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.400
We're going to be discussing group by an aggregate functions group by is a sequel statement that will

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.040
allow us to aggregate data and apply functions to better understand how data is distributed per category

4
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.620
and the section refers going to begin by discussing aggregate functions without any group by applications.

5
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.290
Then we'll learn about group by with Part 1 we'll just discuss the theory behind it and then in part

6
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.840
two will actually show you some implementation of group by statements and PGI admin with PGE sequel.

7
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.940
Then we'll have some challenge tasks for you to solve with group by then we'll discuss the having call

8
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.830
which is going to allow for filtering in conjunction with a group by statement and then we'll have some

9
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.960
challenge tasks to make sure you understood the having statement.

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.890
Let's get started.

11
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.850
I'll see you at the next lecture.
