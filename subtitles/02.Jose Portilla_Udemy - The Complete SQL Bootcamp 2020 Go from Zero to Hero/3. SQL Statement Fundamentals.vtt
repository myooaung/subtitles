<v Instructor>Hello everyone and welcome</v>

2

00:00:02.360  -->  00:00:06.590
to the SQL Statement Fundamentals section of the course.
3

3

00:00:06.590  -->  00:00:09.560
This section is gonna focus on SQL syntax
4

4

00:00:09.560  -->  00:00:10.393
and what's really important
5

5

00:00:10.393  -->  00:00:11.971
about what you're gonna learn here
6

6

00:00:11.971  -->  00:00:14.246
is that the syntax in this section can be applied
7

7

00:00:14.246  -->  00:00:16.903
to any major type of SQL database.
8

8

00:00:16.903  -->  00:00:19.566
So if you move on to work on like a MySQL database
9

9

00:00:19.566  -->  00:00:21.131
or an Oracle database,
10

10

00:00:21.131  -->  00:00:22.499
the SQL syntax you learn
11

11

00:00:22.499  -->  00:00:24.038
throughout this section of the course
12

12

00:00:24.038  -->  00:00:25.154
and anytime we're gonna be learning
13

13

00:00:25.154  -->  00:00:28.782
specific SQL syntax statements and queries,
14

14

00:00:28.782  -->  00:00:30.390
you're gonna be able to apply that knowledge
15

15

00:00:30.390  -->  00:00:33.453
to basically any major type of SQL database.
16

16

00:00:33.453  -->  00:00:35.443
So we're gonna start with the basics and have challenges
17

17

00:00:35.443  -->  00:00:38.788
along the way to test your understanding.
18

18

00:00:38.788  -->  00:00:42.256
With all that being said, let's go ahead and get started.
