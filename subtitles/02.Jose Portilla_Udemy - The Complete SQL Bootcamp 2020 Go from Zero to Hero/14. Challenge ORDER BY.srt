00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:12,180
Welcome back everyone to your set of challenge tasks regarding order by as well as the limit statement

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,320
so I'll start off by Give me the challenge task or business situation.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,150
Then we'll go on to the expected result.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,770
The hints and then a solution so your first challenge task.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,080
We want to reward our first ten paying customers.

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:33,570
So the question is what are the customer I.D. of the first 10 customers who ever created a payment.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,170
Up next is the expected result so they expect the result.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,170
Are these 10 customer I.D..

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,390
Here come some hints.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,170
So the hints is to use the payment table and you will need to use both order by and limit.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,010
And remember you may need to specify ascending or descending on the actual payment dates column.

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,020
Here comes a solution.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,930
So the solution is to select the customer I.D. column from the payment table and then you're gonna order

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,720
by payment date in ascending order.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,790
And if you want you can just leave the ascending out of it because that is by default and then the limit

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,410
is 10.

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:18,410
All right let's move on to your second challenge so the next challenge task is a customer wants to quickly

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,830
rent a video to watch over their short lunch break.

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,870
What are the titles of the five shortest that is in length of runtime.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,140
Movies OK.

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,450
Here comes the expected result so they expect the result.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,780
Are these five movies and if you want you can see the actual length of those movies is 46 minutes each.

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,180
So you should get these five titles.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,000
Here come some hints so the hint is to use the film table and then take a look at the length column

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,950
and you can use order by and limit.

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,000
And then remember you can use ascending or descending to get desired results.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,110
Here comes the solution.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,820
The solution is to select title and length or just the title since the question can really ask for the

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,060
length of the films from film and then order by length ascending.

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,220
Limit 5.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:13,520
Now I want to quickly jump the PGA admin to show you something regarding this query so something I want

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,430
to point out here is if we actually run this query of selecting title length from film order by length

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,240
ascending limit 5 there's two things to notice here.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,180
One is that length is also highlighted basically telling you later on we're going to discover that length

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,610
itself is actually a sequel keyword.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,080
So you want to be careful on the way we use it.

37
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,480
In this case it'll work fine if we run this because it is a column name inside of this table but something

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,660
to keep in mind is you should try your best to avoid column names that match up with sequel keywords

39
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,740
and PJM and alert you to this with this highlighting.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,580
Now one way to just make it clear whether or not you're using a column name or a keyword is the capitalization.

41
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,550
So from the capitalization it's quite clear that length here is a column name and not a sequel come

42
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,340
in.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,690
The other thing to note here is I actually don't know for sure if there's more movies that have a longer

44
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,620
or the same runtime.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,420
So notice here are the five movies that postcard sequel Return that are ordered by length in ascending

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,660
order.

47
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,540
So here are the five shortest movies Forty six minutes each.

48
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,100
But there actually could be a six seven eight nine et cetera.

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,420
More movies that also have 46 minutes in length.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,020
So we don't actually know for sure if these are just the five shortest movies we could have more and

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,010
what we could do is keep expanding on this limit and then eventually we would see that the next limit

52
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,320
in length has been reached forty seven minutes.

53
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,910
So it's by coincidence that there's only five movies with the shortest runtime of 46 minutes.

54
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:56,780
But just saying limit by five doesn't actually guarantee you that there's only five movies here if the

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,820
shortest run time.

56
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,500
So keep in mind of that sort of issue that may arise when you're trying to solve a question like this.

57
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,240
OK.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,920
And finally let's give you a quick Bonus Question So here's a quick bonus question no hints or anything

59
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,460
for this one.

60
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,850
Just quickly if that previous customer can watch any movie that is 50 minutes or less in runtime how

61
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,660
many options does she or he have.

62
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,000
Keep in mind you may actually not even need order by for this.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,880
So again we're just asking how many movies can that customer watch that are 50 minutes or less in runtime

64
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,340
the expected result is thirty seven movies and hopefully you can recall back to your select and worse

65
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,760
statement.

66
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,720
So here's the solution so all we need to do is select and then we can count the title from film where

67
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,050
length is less than or equal to 50.

68
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,250
And keep in mind I don't necessarily need to count the title column.

69
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,000
I could be counting anything there.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
So that could have an asterisk as well.

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,590
All right.

72
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,860
So coming up next we're going to keep talking about different sequel comments starting with the between

73
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,660
command.

74
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,280
I'll see you there.
