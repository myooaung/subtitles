Welcome back everyone to this section on advanced cycle topics.

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.370
Basically this section consists of a variety of topics that didn't really fit in well the flow from

3
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.890
the previous sections because they don't actually need to be learned in any particular order.

4
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.580

extract function just a variety of functions and tools available dealing with things like dates and

6
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.510
times and then we'll talk about various math functions and then we'll talk about some string functions.

7
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.870
After that we'll learn about two separate topics.

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.220
One will be the sub query basically a query within a query and then we'll also talk about a self join.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.690
Let's go ahead and get started.
