00:00:01.309  -->  00:00:02.449
<v Instructor>Hello everyone and welcome</v>
2

2

00:00:02.449  -->  00:00:05.643
to the database overview lecture.
3

3

00:00:05.643  -->  00:00:08.146
In this lecture you're gonna learn what are databases
4

4

00:00:08.146  -->  00:00:10.374
and why use databases.
5

5

00:00:10.374  -->  00:00:12.466
And after we answer those two fundamental questions,
6

6

00:00:12.466  -->  00:00:14.430
we'll get a sense of where this course fits
7

7

00:00:14.430  -->  00:00:16.347
in the realm of things.
8

8

00:00:17.520  -->  00:00:19.874
So let's start off with a basic definition.
9

9

00:00:19.874  -->  00:00:21.620
Databases are systems that allow users
10

10

00:00:21.620  -->  00:00:23.806
to store and organise data.
11

11

00:00:23.806  -->  00:00:28.067
And they're useful when dealing with large amounts of data.
12

12

00:00:28.067  -->  00:00:29.839
So you might be wondering what do the typical users
13

13

00:00:29.839  -->  00:00:32.525
look like who deal with databases.
14

14

00:00:32.525  -->  00:00:35.517
Well databases actually have a wide variety of users.
15

15

00:00:35.517  -->  00:00:38.076
These can include analysts such as a marketing analyst,
16

16

00:00:38.076  -->  00:00:41.866
a business analyst or a sales or sales operation analyst;
17

17

00:00:41.866  -->  00:00:43.998
or more technical people like data scientists,
18

18

00:00:43.998  -->  00:00:46.592
software engineers, or web developers.
19

19

00:00:46.592  -->  00:00:48.310
Basically anyone needing to deal with data
20

20

00:00:48.310  -->  00:00:52.060
has a great use case to work with a database.
21

21

00:00:53.455  -->  00:00:56.064
So since most users have some familiarity
22

22

00:00:56.064  -->  00:00:58.745
with a spreadsheet software, either Google Spreadsheets
23

23

00:00:58.745  -->  00:01:03.025
or Microsoft Excel, what we're gonna do is discuss
24

24

00:01:03.025  -->  00:01:06.621
the transition from going from spreadsheets to databases.
25

25

00:01:06.621  -->  00:01:08.529
So let's go ahead and discuss some use cases
26

26

00:01:08.529  -->  00:01:11.674
for spreadsheets versus use cases for databases.
27

27

00:01:11.674  -->  00:01:12.885
And then leverage that knowledge
28

28

00:01:12.885  -->  00:01:15.468
to better understand databases.
29

29

00:01:16.770  -->  00:01:19.713
So spreadsheets are really good for a one-time analysis
30

30

00:01:19.713  -->  00:01:22.114
or to quickly need to chart something out,
31

31

00:01:22.114  -->  00:01:23.581
such as an Excel.
32

32

00:01:23.581  -->  00:01:26.108
And they work with reasonable data set sizes,
33

33

00:01:26.108  -->  00:01:28.865
something that Excel and Google Spreadsheet
34

34

00:01:28.865  -->  00:01:30.755
can open up really easily.
35

35

00:01:30.755  -->  00:01:32.947
And what's really nice about spreadsheets is they
36

36

00:01:32.947  -->  00:01:36.098
allow the ability for untrained people to work with data.
37

37

00:01:36.098  -->  00:01:38.029
So anyone can just double click an Excel file,
38

38

00:01:38.029  -->  00:01:40.150
and open it and work with it.
39

39

00:01:40.150  -->  00:01:41.680
However, they do have downsides
40

40

00:01:41.680  -->  00:01:44.838
where databases really shine.
41

41

00:01:44.838  -->  00:01:47.274
Databases are really great for data integrity
42

42

00:01:47.274  -->  00:01:49.539
meaning you don't want to have someone
43

43

00:01:49.539  -->  00:01:52.611
be able to just click on a cell and change the data.
44

44

00:01:52.611  -->  00:01:54.663
Databases don't really allow for that.
45

45

00:01:54.663  -->  00:01:57.417
And they can also handle massive amounts of data.
46

46

00:01:57.417  -->  00:01:59.613
Data sizes that would just basically make Excel
47

47

00:01:59.613  -->  00:02:01.971
or Google Spreadsheets crash.
48

48

00:02:01.971  -->  00:02:04.167
And they can also quickly combine different datasets
49

49

00:02:04.167  -->  00:02:08.011
something that might be difficult to do for larger datasets
50

50

00:02:08.011  -->  00:02:09.374
in a spreadsheet.
51

51

00:02:09.374  -->  00:02:12.230
They also are perfect for automating steps for re-use
52

52

00:02:12.230  -->  00:02:16.034
due to the sequel syntax, which we'll learn about later.
53

53

00:02:16.034  -->  00:02:19.065
They can also support data for websites and applications.
54

54

00:02:19.065  -->  00:02:21.334
So most websites and web applications,
55

55

00:02:21.334  -->  00:02:24.855
or mobile applications, are linked to some sort of database
56

56

00:02:24.855  -->  00:02:28.522
to store their data and retrieve their data.
57

57

00:02:29.629  -->  00:02:31.608
So let's go ahead and leverage that knowledge
58

58

00:02:31.608  -->  00:02:33.908
from spreadsheets to understand databases
59

59

00:02:33.908  -->  00:02:37.522
and see the similarities between them.
60

60

00:02:37.522  -->  00:02:39.299
So here we have a picture of a
61

61

00:02:39.299  -->  00:02:41.078
looks like a normal spreadsheet.
62

62

00:02:41.078  -->  00:02:42.579
Here we have the columns.
63

63

00:02:42.579  -->  00:02:45.811
It's just a basic glucose-tracking spreadsheet.
64

64

00:02:45.811  -->  00:02:48.467
And we have columns such as time, some measurements
65

65

00:02:48.467  -->  00:02:51.537
et cetera, and various rows with different data points.
66

66

00:02:51.537  -->  00:02:53.949
And then at the bottom here we have tabs
67

67

00:02:53.949  -->  00:02:56.661
which are referencing various sheets
68

68

00:02:56.661  -->  00:02:58.168
in the spreadsheet software.
69

69

00:02:58.168  -->  00:03:00.578
Here we're using Excel.
70

70

00:03:00.578  -->  00:03:02.335
So when we're transitioning from a spreadsheet
71

71

00:03:02.335  -->  00:03:05.110
to a database, we can think of a database's tables
72

72

00:03:05.110  -->  00:03:07.629
as the tabs of a spreadsheet.
73

73

00:03:07.629  -->  00:03:11.554
So those tabs of a spreadsheet handles various types of data
74

74

00:03:11.554  -->  00:03:14.756
or different rows in different columns.
75

75

00:03:14.756  -->  00:03:19.354
Those tabs will translate to tables in a database.
76

76

00:03:19.354  -->  00:03:23.673
So that a database is made up of many tables.
77

77

00:03:23.673  -->  00:03:28.311
And then those tables are made up of rows and columns.
78

78

00:03:28.311  -->  00:03:31.599
So the columns in the table of a database
79

79

00:03:31.599  -->  00:03:33.638
is basically exactly what you would think
80

80

00:03:33.638  -->  00:03:36.528
as a column in a spreadsheet.
81

81

00:03:36.528  -->  00:03:38.478
It's just a vertical column that denotes
82

82

00:03:38.478  -->  00:03:40.586
a certain data type.
83

83

00:03:40.586  -->  00:03:43.525
So for instance the first one here we have time.
84

84

00:03:43.525  -->  00:03:44.622
Second one we have measurements.
85

85

00:03:44.622  -->  00:03:46.377
So columns in spreadsheets are basically the same
86

86

00:03:46.377  -->  00:03:49.684
as columns in the table of a database.
87

87

00:03:49.684  -->  00:03:51.999
And then the other feature we have from a spreadsheet
88

88

00:03:51.999  -->  00:03:54.981
to a database is going to be rows.
89

89

00:03:54.981  -->  00:03:57.559
And rows again behave exactly like you would expect them to
90

90

00:03:57.559  -->  00:03:59.172
in a database table.
91

91

00:03:59.172  -->  00:04:01.293
They're just the actual row of all that data
92

92

00:04:01.293  -->  00:04:03.332
for a certain data point.
93

93

00:04:03.332  -->  00:04:04.830
So in this case we're highlighting
94

94

00:04:04.830  -->  00:04:06.883
the data points seven eight and nine,
95

95

00:04:06.883  -->  00:04:09.269
and then all the measurements for those columns.
96

96

00:04:09.269  -->  00:04:11.190
So again databases instead of tabs
97

97

00:04:11.190  -->  00:04:12.863
they're gonna have tables, and those tables
98

98

00:04:12.863  -->  00:04:15.465
are also gonna have rows and columns.
99

99

00:04:15.465  -->  00:04:17.696
And you can basically just imagine them as spreadsheets,
100

100

00:04:17.696  -->  00:04:22.372
just much larger that you can't individually click on.
101

101

00:04:22.372  -->  00:04:25.106
Okay, so again we have columns, rows,
102

102

00:04:25.106  -->  00:04:27.866
and instead of tabs we're gonna have tables.
103

103

00:04:27.866  -->  00:04:31.378
So what are our database platform options?
104

104

00:04:31.378  -->  00:04:34.204
Well, there's actually lots of database platform options.
105

105

00:04:34.204  -->  00:04:35.719
A lot more than what I've put here,
106

106

00:04:35.719  -->  00:04:37.152
but here are some of the main ones.
107

107

00:04:37.152  -->  00:04:38.586
You have PostgreSQL.
108

108

00:04:38.586  -->  00:04:42.799
You have things such as MySQL, and MS SQL Server Express,
109

109

00:04:42.799  -->  00:04:45.253
Microsoft Access, and then SQLite.
110

110

00:04:45.253  -->  00:04:47.007
Each of these has their pros and cons.
111

111

00:04:47.007  -->  00:04:50.165
But were gonna be focusing on PostgreSQL.
112

112

00:04:50.165  -->  00:04:53.141
The reason for this is because PostgreSQL is free,
113

113

00:04:53.141  -->  00:04:55.646
it's open source, it's widely used on the internet,
114

114

00:04:55.646  -->  00:04:58.104
it's multi platform so meaning if you have
115

115

00:04:58.104  -->  00:05:01.433
various operating systems, like Windows or Mac users,
116

116

00:05:01.433  -->  00:05:03.569
you can all use PostgreSQL.
117

117

00:05:03.569  -->  00:05:05.557
And one of my main reasons for choosing it
118

118

00:05:05.557  -->  00:05:07.066
is that it's super easy to instal
119

119

00:05:07.066  -->  00:05:09.733
and just hit the ground running.
120

120

00:05:11.034  -->  00:05:13.031
So PostgreSQL is a great database choice
121

121

00:05:13.031  -->  00:05:15.077
for learning how to use SQL.
122

122

00:05:15.077  -->  00:05:17.082
And SQL is a Structured Query Language,
123

123

00:05:17.082  -->  00:05:18.472
which is what it stands for.
124

124

00:05:18.472  -->  00:05:20.519
And it's what we're gonna learn in this course.
125

125

00:05:20.519  -->  00:05:23.002
SQL is gonna be the way we communicate with our database.
126

126

00:05:23.002  -->  00:05:25.122
It's the way we're gonna be able to communicate
127

127

00:05:25.122  -->  00:05:27.030
with a database to get data out of it
128

128

00:05:27.030  -->  00:05:29.127
or put data into it.
129

129

00:05:29.127  -->  00:05:31.360
And the SQL learned in this course can be applied
130

130

00:05:31.360  -->  00:05:34.994
to a variety of databases or SQL based software.
131

131

00:05:34.994  -->  00:05:38.295
So we're not gonna pigeonhole ourselves to just PostgreSQL.
132

132

00:05:38.295  -->  00:05:40.257
What you learn in this course, you're gonna be able
133

133

00:05:40.257  -->  00:05:42.263
to apply it to a variety of databases
134

134

00:05:42.263  -->  00:05:44.430
or software that uses SQL.
135

135

00:05:45.702  -->  00:05:49.239
So for example of what a general SQL syntax would look like.
136

136

00:05:49.239  -->  00:05:51.092
It would look something like this.
137

137

00:05:51.092  -->  00:05:54.498
Select some column names from a table
138

138

00:05:54.498  -->  00:05:56.933
and then you have some functions or clauses.
139

139

00:05:56.933  -->  00:05:58.855
Here I'm ordering by the first name.
140

140

00:05:58.855  -->  00:06:01.506
So we're gonna learn how to write and use SQL syntax
141

141

00:06:01.506  -->  00:06:03.589
like this in this course.
142

142

00:06:04.586  -->  00:06:07.636
So SQL is actually useful for a lot of things.
143

143

00:06:07.636  -->  00:06:09.991
Everything I've listed here runs on some sort
144

144

00:06:09.991  -->  00:06:11.513
of syntax of SQL.
145

145

00:06:11.513  -->  00:06:14.960
So you have PostgreSQL or MySQL or Oracle Databases,
146

146

00:06:14.960  -->  00:06:17.865
Microsoft Access, et cetera, the basic databases
147

147

00:06:17.865  -->  00:06:19.798
you would think of that can use SQL.
148

148

00:06:19.798  -->  00:06:22.546
But there's also a lot of software out there that uses SQL
149

149

00:06:22.546  -->  00:06:25.736
as a way of interacting with their data, such as Looker,
150

150

00:06:25.736  -->  00:06:27.104
or Periscope Data.
151

151

00:06:27.104  -->  00:06:30.356
And there's also some abstractions that run on top
152

152

00:06:30.356  -->  00:06:33.356
of big data systems, such as Hadoop.
153

153

00:06:34.444  -->  00:06:37.439
You can use SQL with Hive or Google's BigQuery
154

154

00:06:37.439  -->  00:06:40.315
or Facebook's Presto which is basically using SQL
155

155

00:06:40.315  -->  00:06:43.705
to run on top of very large data systems
156

156

00:06:43.705  -->  00:06:45.781
that use distributed data.
157

157

00:06:45.781  -->  00:06:48.219
So SQL's gonna be incredibly useful
158

158

00:06:48.219  -->  00:06:52.302
to operate a variety of tools and databases with.
159

159

00:06:54.223  -->  00:06:56.560
So you're also gonna be notified if any of the SQL commands
160

160

00:06:56.560  -->  00:06:58.333
we learned in this course are specific
161

161

00:06:58.333  -->  00:07:01.026
to the PostgreSQL environment.
162

162

00:07:01.026  -->  00:07:03.380
Most of the commands we learn are actually just gonna be
163

163

00:07:03.380  -->  00:07:05.314
general SQL, so you won't get too many
164

164

00:07:05.314  -->  00:07:07.070
of these notifications.
165

165

00:07:07.070  -->  00:07:08.684
Basically everything you learn here, you're gonna
166

166

00:07:08.684  -->  00:07:13.460
be able to apply directly to any conventional SQL database.
167

167

00:07:13.460  -->  00:07:16.620
Okay, let's go ahead and review what we learned.
168

168

00:07:16.620  -->  00:07:18.181
We learned what a database is,
169

169

00:07:18.181  -->  00:07:20.243
why we should use a database.
170

170

00:07:20.243  -->  00:07:22.382
We learned about the various SQL options.
171

171

00:07:22.382  -->  00:07:25.033
And we also learned how to use SQL skills in this course
172

172

00:07:25.033  -->  00:07:26.949
and how we're gonna be able to apply them
173

173

00:07:26.949  -->  00:07:29.811
to many other software programmes.
174

174

00:07:29.811  -->  00:07:32.072
Okay, with that being said, lets go ahead
175

175

00:07:32.072  -->  00:07:34.437
and continue and learn some more.
176

176

00:07:34.437  -->  00:07:37.266
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
