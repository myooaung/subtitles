1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,760
We didn't have to create an engine of any sort when we were using JSP Pages,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,390
so this is a little bit unique to Thymeleaf.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,360
We have to create a Spring templateEngine that will process

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,110
the pages and substitute in the model values from Spring

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,440
into our pages to be displayed.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,260
Notice that this code makes a call to that templateResolver method

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,010
that we just created in the previous example.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,390
Let's go ahead and add this into our ConferenceConfig file.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,220
Now the templateEngine is just another bean and can actually go right

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,400
below the templateResolver that we just created.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,940
I'm going to paste this code in here and import it as well,

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,650
and it stands alone on its own.

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,380
It doesn't have a bunch of other references other than

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,580
that call to the templateResolver.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,210
So on line 72 you can see where it's calling the

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,340
templateResolver that we just created on line 61.

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,970
We have this templateEngine that is configured just for Spring,

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,320
and it also has enabled the Spring Expression Language compiler,

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,290
the EL compiler,

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,770
and that just makes it so we can use the shorthand syntax of

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,570
accessing Spring variables and passing them in.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,010
That's it.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,310
That's all we have to add for the templateResolver.

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,000
Now we can add the actual ViewResolver for those templates that the controller can navigate things to.
