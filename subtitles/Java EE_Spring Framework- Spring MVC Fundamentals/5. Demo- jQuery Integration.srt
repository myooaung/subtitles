1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,000
As we mentioned before,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,590
JQuery has stayed pretty tried and true for accessing data,

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,990
especially for some RESTful services.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,670
You can see in this example here we're going against a URL.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,700
It's the URL we actually just created for localhost:8080/conference/user.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,340
And then we can grab the body, the data,

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,620
and grab the first name out of that and append that into our document last

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,450
name and age and manipulate the data in our DOM with that.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,300
Let's go ahead and add some JQuery into our project now.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,290
It's pretty simple.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,910
We're going to add a little JQuery snippet and then add a user.html page that

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,270
just uses JavaScript to interact with our RESTful service.

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,640
To start let's add that user.js file inside of our static directory.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,010
So I'm going to right‑click on src, main,

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,190
resources, static here and say New, File,

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,100
and I'll just do user.js and hit Enter.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,720
Then I'm going to right‑click on static again and create another file,

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,040
user.html.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,610
And these two files are just going to have some simple

20
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,640
HTML and some simple JavaScript.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,310
In fact, it was the exact JavaScript we just showed on the previous slide,

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,970
to access our URL.

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,690
I'm going to paste in this JavaScript.

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,340
I'll make it full screen so that you can see it.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,830
It's a little bit of coding.

26
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,410
If you want,

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,850
you can grab these out of the examples and just paste it in yourself.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,390
It's underneath the course, main directory,

29
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,060
and there's an exercise files link in there that you can

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,030
grab that information and just paste it in.

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,940
And I'm going to do the same thing for the HTML.

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,560
And there are a couple things to note in here.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,760
The script is using a CDN, or a Content Delivery Network,

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,450
to pull in our JavaScript on line 5.

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,550
And then we're referencing that script that we just created on line 6.

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,750
And we have a couple of elements down here,

37
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,010
firstname, lastname, and age,

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,930
that are being referenced in our JavaScript file over here.

39
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,280
So when we grab that data,

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,960
we go ahead and manipulate those elements with that data from firstname,

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,590
lastname, age on this request.

42
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,540
So when the page loads, it calls this AJAX function when the page is ready,

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,510
and then it takes the results of that and appends them

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,890
into those elements in our HTML page.

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,790
Let's start our server up.

46
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,040
And we haven't created our helpful little link in here.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,600
We should,

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:54,270
but all we have to do is go up to our URL and type in user.html and hit Enter.

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,540
And you'll notice it pulled back Bryan, Hansen, and age 43.

50
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,760
So it went out, did our request from a REST controller,

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,060
and pulled that information back in.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,470
Really easy to do.

53
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,440
You can see how valuable these RESTful services are,

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,970
and we're not using anything like JSP pages in this example or Thymeleaf.

55
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,630
We're just going out and pulling these RESTful services

56
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,370
into our app using simple JavaScript, just JQuery.

57
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,060
I don't even have to have anything as advanced as Angular or React or Vue.

58
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,630
It's a simple AJAX call.

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:36,000
Very powerful and a great way to access data and have this inside of your just basic HTML.
