00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.460
Validation in our project requires us using the

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.940
@Valid annotation before our model,

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.830
essentially saying that we want this model object to

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.540
be valid upon entering this method.

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.850
In the method signature, you can see where we have annotated this using @Valid.

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.430
The other thing to note though is the reference passed in of the BindingResult.

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.350
It contains any errors and a flag to notify you that there was a

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.740
verification error so we can direct that to the correct view.

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.600
From here, we can direct back to the appropriate page,

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.730
in this case the form which it would have been submitted from.

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.180
Inside our form element,

12
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.670
we can add a form:errors tag that will only show when an error is present.

13
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.380
So we're going to change the controller signature in our controller,

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.650
and we can add an errors element inside of our JSP page,

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.840
all by adding specific attributes on our model object.

16
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.540
Let's implement this in our current project and see how this works out for us.

17
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.060
To begin adding validation,

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.790
we first want to start off with which object we want validate.

19
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.940
I'm going to open up our model, Registration class,

20
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.840
and let's make it to where we don't enter in a name that's just empty.

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.140
So I want to go above that member variable and say @NotEmpty.

22
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.640
And this will guarantee that when we ask for validation on it,

23
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.650
it doesn't allow an empty or blank or spaces.

24
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.950
There's a lot of characteristics around it that you can look up,

25
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.510
and there's different options we could use,

26
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.570
but we'll just signify @NotEmpty for now.

27
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.540
The next thing we want to do is open up our RegistrationController,

28
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.080
and there's a couple of changes we need to make inside of here,

29
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.100
but they're still quite minor.

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.410
As we mentioned on the previous slide,

31
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.460
we want to add Valid to that method signature,

32
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.600
saying that this model attribute we want to be valid.

33
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.260
And since it is a registration object,

34
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.930
that NotEmpty that we put in there automatically signifies that we want

35
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.380
it to be a valid registration object when validated.

36
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.400
The next thing we want to do is add a binding result to this. So we're

37
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:35.140
going to say BindingResult and give that a name of result.

38
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.850
And you can see in here that it just goes through the method

39
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.210
signature passed by reference to grab any errors that we have

40
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.270
in here and display them for us.

41
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.710
Now if we have an error,

42
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.350
we can easily check for it and change our navigation based off of it by

43
00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.050
saying if result.hasErrors, go here instead. So we can return back to

44
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.240
the registration form without doing the post redirect get that we had

45
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.710
set up down below. And just to show you this is working the way that we

46
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.790
think it should, let's add a system.out.println in here just to show

47
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.640
you that there are some errors that we're going to return from this.

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.680
There were errors. And we'll save this. And this is

49
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.970
actually all we have to do for our code.

50
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.790
Now to display those errors,

51
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.440
we want to add some functionality to our JSP page,

52
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.300
but this will validate our object, and we can handle it from there.

53
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.750
We've got all that functionality built into it now. Let's

54
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.030
open up our JSP page and customize that page to show

55
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.140
those errors back to the user.

56
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.550
I want to start off by adding in a little bit of CSS. And yes,

57
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.870
in your project, you'll probably have a CSS file that contains all this.

58
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.330
But just for the sake of this example,

59
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.570
we're going to add it at the top of this page.

60
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.050
I want to go below title,

61
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.330
but still within the head tag. I'm going to add this style element and

62
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.220
inside of there two classes, an error and an errorblock. And then I want to

63
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.580
go below the form tag that we created earlier,

64
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.450
and we're going to do another form tag,

65
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:34.080
but this time going to do form:errors, and the path on this and the

66
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:44.280
CSS class is errorblock, and the element is div.

67
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.410
We can close that off and save it.

68
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.890
So we've added our error code, what it's going to look like, and

69
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.140
then the block to actually display that to the page. Let's exit

70
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.680
full screen now and start our server up,

71
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.180
and now we can go to our registration link.

72
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.080
When I click on it, it'll pull the page up.

73
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.900
If I enter a name in here, it would go through cleanly. But without it,

74
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.110
let's just see what we get.

75
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.110
We get our error message back saying it must not be empty.

76
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.050
Notice that this is the default message.

77
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.780
It's all lowercase.

78
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.240
It is my simple HTML just displaying this red error block.

79
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.170
But we can customize this message.

80
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.640
Let's make sure it still works if we enter in a name though. I'll add in

81
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.240
Bryan in here and hit Add Registration, and it works.

82
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.510
We've got our post redirect get still working, and we have

83
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.800
our error message still working, so great.

84
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.000
Let's customize that a little bit so that we've got a little bit more user friendly error message in there.
