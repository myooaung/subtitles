00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,960
Here is a standard MVC or model view controller design pattern

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,030
that you may or may not have seen before.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,600
It's a pretty common pattern.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,140
In fact,

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,530
I would say that most developers have at least seen it or at least heard of it.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,370
A request comes through the view based off of some user

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,270
event and then is interpreted by the controller. The

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,740
controller can change the model or not.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,110
And then it will select the view based off of our action.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,650
From here,

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,140
the model can update the view with the database off of the user's actions.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,200
This graphic is sometimes confusing though because it's stemmed

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,490
from rich client applications that were more event based or using

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,790
a design pattern called observer observable or a subscriber

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,720
listener type design pattern.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,840
Not really applicable to a lot of the software development we do with the web.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,720
This pattern in concept is still very sound, but we

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,870
usually don't have our model updating our view because

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,980
it's gone to a page at that point, and it's disconnected from our back end.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,400
This graphic though is a more accurate description of the kind of life

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,940
cycle that we may be faced with in web development.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,850
The graphic is realistically more like the life cycle

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,040
that we see in our web application.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,740
Our view can access our model, but it's usually done so through a controller.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,330
We'll look more at lightweight approaches in the Ajax module later

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,560
in this course. The summary is we usually make a request, even if

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,260
it's a lightweight request, through our controller to access our

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:41,000
model. We don't have our view typically going directly against our database or model.
