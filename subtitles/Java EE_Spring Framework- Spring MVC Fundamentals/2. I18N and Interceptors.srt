1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,140
If you weren't aware, I18N stands for internationalization.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,440
It literally means there's 18 characters before the beginning I

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,290
and the trailing N of the word internationalization. To this

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,960
point in our course, we haven't been internationalizing our pages

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,030
to accept other languages.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,860
Everything has just been hardcoded. This same code

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,030
internationalized that we have here,

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,620
where we've got firstName and lastName and the Save Changes text

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,130
just hardcoded in English would look like this.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,160
Notice that we have removed any of those references to just plain English

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,650
language in here and are now grabbing them from a resource bundle.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:52,280
FirstName, lastName, and the Save Changes text are all pulled from that bundle.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,920
Even notice that the case with the Submit button is changing the value of that

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,140
actual button and not just the label on the page. To do this,

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,280
though, we need to introduce a new concept,

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,240
and that is interceptors.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,620
Interceptors are used to allow us to intercept calls to our

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,740
server and perform special tasks on a call.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,350
Common uses for interceptors are logging.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,580
We can change the log level on an application without having to redeploy it. Not

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,290
useful to end users but very useful for debugging a specific problem in an

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,740
environment without having to restart the application.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,540
Another common use is security.

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,100
When we want to intercept each call or direct them to a page,

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,500
make them log in and then redirect them back to that page that they were

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,610
trying to access, it's a very common use of an interceptor.

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,210
Security is outside the scope of this course,

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,640
but there is a separate course that is focusing on the use of Spring Security

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,770
in your applications here on Pluralsight. As we mentioned earlier, I18N

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,960
internationalization of sites and catching their request to change locales is

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
a very common use of interceptors. And, lastly,

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,680
performance monitoring. Similar to logging, this is not

33
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,910
something we're going to display to the end users,

34
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,620
but we may want to intercept each call to perform

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,000
some metric gathering on a request. Let's add internationalization support to our application now.
