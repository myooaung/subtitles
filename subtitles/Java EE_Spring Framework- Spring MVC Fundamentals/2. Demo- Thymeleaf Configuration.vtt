00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.120
To add Thymeleaf to our project, it's actually quite easy.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.310
We just need to add another Maven dependency.

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.960
So we're going to build a dependency element.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.080
We're going to add in a groupId of org.thymeleaf,

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.470
an artifactId of thymeleaf‑spring5 because we are using spring5,

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.760
and then the version of 3.0.11.RELEASE,

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.940
as that is the current release at the time of recording this course.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.860
Let's go ahead and add that into our POM now and verify

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.110
that it's downloaded it to our project.

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.520
Adding that to our POM is as simple as opening up the pom.xml file,

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.330
and I'll make mine full‑screen so you can see it a little bit better.

12
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.830
I'm going to go underneath our spring‑boot‑starter‑tomcat,

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.480
but above the spring‑boot‑starter‑test.

14
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.060
And yes, order does matter in your dependencies.

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.070
It will load those onto your class path in the order in

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.330
which you have them in this file.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.910
So, I want to go ahead and add that in there, I've just got

18
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:12.480
org.thymeleaf, thymeleaf‑spring5, and version 3.0.11.RELEASE.

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.100
I'm going to save that, and when I save it,

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.080
it'll automatically download that from the Maven repo. And I can verify

21
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.530
that it's in my project by scrolling down to the external dependencies

22
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.160
of my project structure, looking at the very bottom, and you can see

23
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.430
that I've got org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.0.11 and

24
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.200
org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf‑spring5:3.0.11.RELEASE, so I've got everything

25
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.620
in there for the Spring versions that I'm using and the Thymeleaf

26
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.000
dependencies that I need.

27
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.540
I'm going to close this back over and get it ready for us to

28
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.000
add the rest of the code in our project. Let's look at what it takes to add the resolvers in here now.
