00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.170
We went through a lot of stuff in this module.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.030
We talked about the duties of controllers and the

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.550
various annotations associated with them,

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.960
specifically the @Controller annotation,

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.140
the @GetMapping, @ModelAttribute, and the @PostMapping so that we

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.940
could do the full lifecycle of our controller.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.010
One thing we haven't covered yet, though,

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.620
is what's really going on with how we find those JSP

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.640
pages inside of our application.

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.610
We went ahead and made some modifications to our application.properties,

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.540
but it really didn't help you in understanding how we resolve those views.

12
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.780
We're going to dive into that in the next module and hopefully

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.000
clear up some of that mystery that goes on with how we find those pages inside of our application.
