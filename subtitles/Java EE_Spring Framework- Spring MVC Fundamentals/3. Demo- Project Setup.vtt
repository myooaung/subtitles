00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.500
To get started with setting up our project,

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.350
I've gone ahead and opened up a browser and gone to start.spring.io,

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.950
and it pulls up this page.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.300
We're going to start off by first selecting the type of project.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.340
We want a Maven project, and the language we're going to choose is Java.

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.440
And the current release of Spring Boot is 2.2.4, which I have chosen here.

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.720
And then I'm going to change the project metadata

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.080
to the group of com.pluralsight.

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.800
And the demo name, I'm going to change that artifact to now be conference,

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.110
since we're building a conference app,

11
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.010
as we saw in that earlier demo in the previous module.

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.940
I'm going to name the artifact conference,

13
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.430
and this has some other things that will change in the pom for us by doing so.

14
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.110
I'm going to select to drop down those options.

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.830
You'll see the name again.

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.330
Should be the same as the artifact.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.400
We can leave the description the same,

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.000
or if you want to put something more significant there,

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.430
I'm fine with that.

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.220
The reason,

21
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.680
though, that mainly I chose to expand the options is to make

22
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.550
sure that the packaging type is currently Jar.

23
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.710
I'm going to show you what happens when we change that to a War later.

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.330
But I want to specifically choose Java 11.

25
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.750
So you'll notice that they have versions 13, 11, and 8 in here.

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.130
We want to choose 11, and as I mentioned in the prerequisites section,

27
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.600
that's because it's the current version that has long‑term support.

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.830
Now, before we get too anxious and skip out of here,

29
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.590
we want to go down here to this Search dependencies to add and choose Web,

30
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.340
or search for web, and click the plus sign.

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.080
And when you've done this,

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.400
you should see it expand over to the right saying Spring Web,

33
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.990
Build Web, including RESTful applications using Spring MVC.

34
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.720
And it includes the bundled or embedded Tomcat container,

35
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.070
which is what we want to start with as well.

36
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.990
Now that we have this in here, let's go ahead and click the Generate,

37
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.050
and it will download that for us,

38
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.820
and we can now go over and expand that in our file space.

39
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.810
When it downloads that,

40
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.910
it'll actually name the ZIP file the same name as what we had called

41
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.520
our artifact in the start.spring.io initializer.

42
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.340
I'm going to double‑click on this and just expand it.

43
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.740
And now we can open up IntelliJ and have it import that project in.

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.400
When we first open IntelliJ,

45
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.320
we're presented with this splash screen asking us if

46
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.130
we want to create our project, import it, just open it,

47
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.110
or get it from Version Control.

48
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.010
Since we used start.spring.io,

49
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.090
we want to import our project because it was already created for us.

50
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.310
So let's select Import Project.

51
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.540
You want to choose the home directory of that application.

52
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.490
I store mine underneath dev/workspace/spring‑mvc/conference,

53
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.500
so I'm going to choose conference.

54
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.760
And you'll notice there's the src folder here and the

55
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.940
pom.xml and some Maven command stuff.

56
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.600
Go ahead and choose Open.

57
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.700
And then it will ask us if we want to finish importing that from Eclipse,

58
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.600
Flash Builder, Gradle, or Maven.

59
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.260
We want to choose Maven and click Finish. And it will go

60
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.550
ahead and load up the application.

61
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.760
Now, The first time you do this,

62
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.820
it's going to resolve some dependencies and spend a

63
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.040
minute scanning all those files, indexing them,

64
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.150
bringing them all into your workspace. Behind the scenes it's actually

65
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.480
going out and grabbing everything from the Maven repo.

66
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.250
And you'll see the little progress indicator in the lower‑right portion

67
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.130
of your screen is it goes ahead and does this for you.

68
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.780
It's downloading a bunch of stuff. And if you haven't used Maven

69
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.160
before, it may take it a minute. So now we should have a project

70
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.380
structure in here. And inside of our project structure, we should

71
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.040
have our src/main/java app,

72
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.140
and underneath that it should contain our package structure

73
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.450
and our actual conference application.

74
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.340
We can open it up and see that it's just a basic

75
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.220
configured Spring Boot application.

76
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.540
And then outside of here,

77
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.990
we also have our pom file and we have our resources directory.

78
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.600
Right now there's really nothing contained inside of here.

79
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.800
If we go back to this conference application and right‑click on main,

80
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.430
we can run this application.

81
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.110
It will bring up our build window for us and tell us that it's

82
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.280
building all of our code and everything else,

83
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.370
and then it will fire up the server. And we're up and running now. So

84
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.690
now our actual app is deployed and running on 8080.

85
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.750
Let's pull up our browser and see what it looks like the first time we hit it.

86
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.390
The first time that you pull up your app in a web page,

87
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.500
you're going to get this nice, ugly Whitelabel Error Page,

88
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.120
basically making you think you've done something wrong. And

89
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.650
really what it is, we don't have an index.html page or anything

90
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.030
else configured in our application yet.

91
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.280
So the basic project that gets downloaded and the structure that

92
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.310
gets supplied for your app has no greeting page.

93
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.770
Let's switch back over to our IDE and fix that now so we have at least

94
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.630
something nice to greet us as we go into the app.

95
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.500
We need to do a couple of things to add that index page to our application.

96
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.870
First, let's go over to our src/main/resources/static directory,

97
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.540
right‑click on it, and say New, HTML File. And we can select HTML5 file.

98
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.600
It should already be selected for us.

99
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.740
We'll just go ahead and give it a name of index.html. Click Enter.

100
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.930
This will give us a standard.

101
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.200
page. I'm going to change the title to Index. And inside the body,

102
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.940
I'm just going to add an H1 so that we have a nice big

103
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.390
greeting or hello for us to land on here.

104
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.270
So we can save that. Now the other thing that we need to do is, we

105
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.110
actually need to restart our server, and this seems a little odd. Where

106
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.060
things were all self‑contained in a JAR, that file hasn't been

107
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.790
repackaged up and moved over to the server yet. Once we have deployed

108
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.630
files and have a reference to them,

109
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.930
we can change them without always redeploying them.

110
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.410
But if it's never been deployed to that server, it won't work.

111
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.010
So I'm going to go ahead and click that redeploy button and have it restart

112
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.400
our application for us and switch back over to our browser.

113
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.510
Now let's see what this page looks like when we refresh it.

114
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.340
Hey, we have our Hello, just like we expected it to.

115
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.670
So a quick recap of what we did there.

116
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.870
We went out to start.spring.io and downloaded a bundled‑up Spring Boot

117
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.890
application for us, expanded that to our file server.

118
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.520
Then we went ahead and imported that into our IDE,

119
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.380
deployed it, launched the application,

120
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.170
seeing that it had an error page for us, went back in

121
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.700
under src/main/resources/static,

122
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.320
added our index.html, and then came back to reverify that

123
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.690
it displayed like we thought it should.

124
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.480
Pretty simple, but there are a few steps to do,

125
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.520
and if it's new to you,

126
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.000
it may seem a little overwhelming. And we're going to break that down through the next few examples.
