00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,410
The Post/Redirect/Get pattern, or PRG,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,100
is a technique used to help eliminate form resubmission.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,550
The user's POST to the controller does whatever intended action was requested,

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,690
but before returning the view back to the user,

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,370
it does an internal redirect and issues a GET back to

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,600
itself to display the page to the user.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,280
This makes sure that all the variables of state have been cleared,

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,940
so a back button then resubmitted is disabled or stopped.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,740
Let's implement this in our app now.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,730
We've already done all of the work that we need to for us to

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,090
implement the Post/Redirect/Get pattern because we've set up our

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,470
GetMapping and our PostMapping separate.

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,320
A lot of examples out there show these being combined.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,510
All we actually needed to do is go to line 22 now and

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,770
put in redirect: and save that,

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,680
and this will tell the ViewResolver to go ahead and do a

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,190
complete redirect and a GET back to registration, and it will

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,740
clear that form out for us. Now, yes, you can still back up,

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,020
but it will be a new,

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,650
completely separate POST. It won't be reposting the same information,

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,070
if that makes sense. So let's save this, start or restart our server

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,290
depending on what state you left yours in.

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,010
And now we can go to our registration link, and inside of here,

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,810
if I put in my information and click Add Registration,

25
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,940
notice that it has submitted it and returned us back here and cleared it out.

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,180
So we've done the whole GET, and then a Post/Redirect/Get back to

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,520
ourselves, and it's cleared this form out. And that just helps us

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:57,000
have that information in a safer state to not resubmit or overwrite the existing page that's there.
