1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,990
This is where we left off our registration page.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,700
After just performing a GET to display the page.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,940
Let's now turn this into a form where we can use it to

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,640
turn a POST back to our controller.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,940
Going back to our IDE, I'm going open up that registration.jsp page,

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,200
and the first thing we need to do is add that spring

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,960
tag library up at the top of it.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,030
And the syntax for that's a little bit odd. So we've got to do a %@,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,490
and it's going to ask us if we want to enter a tag library,

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,640
which we do.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,140
And we need to give it a prefix.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,250
The prefix want to give this is form.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,760
And you can name this whatever you want.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,510
We can do a URI and choose springframework.org/tags/form.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,730
So now we've got our tag in here,

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,410
and that's going to help us auto complete stuff inside of our body.

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm going to go below that h1 that we created and create a form

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,640
using the form tag library that we just imported.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,740
And inside of here, I'm going to do a couple of things,

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,780
and I'm not going to bore you with all the typing details.

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,160
I'm going to throw in a table, yes, just a basic HTML table,

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,580
and we'll do something fancy here with CSS and other stuff later.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,440
But inside of here, we're going to do a tr,

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,530
and we're going to give this a td,

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,260
and this is where it starts to get a little bit fun.

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm going to give this a name, and in the next td,

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,650
I want to give this a form input of name.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,930
And what I mean by this is I'm going to input this form tag here,

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,240
and the path of this is name.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
Now, you might be wondering why it's called a path,

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,970
and it's because it refers to the binding object for this page.

32
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,330
It's actually tied to a backing object that we're going

33
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,140
to sync up with the model attribute.

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,540
Don't worry, we'll show you here in a second what that means exactly.

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,940
I'm going to create another tr.

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,240
I going to do another td here.

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,380
I'm going to give that a call span of 2.

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:22,090
And then inside of that, I'm going to just do a regular HTML input,

39
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:30,310
and this input we're going to do a type ="submit" and

40
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:39,260
give that a value of Add Registration.

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,410
Now, we can save this.

42
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,960
And I'll be honest with you, the first time we run this, it's going to break.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,070
And I'm going to make this break on purpose because I want

44
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,370
to show you the error that it displays.

45
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,070
So when you run into this, because you will at some point,

46
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,850
you'll know how to fix this.

47
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,940
So I'm going to restart my server,

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,560
have it pull up that page for us again and deploy everything,

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,940
and then we'll have references to this new JSP page.

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,210
Now, we can go to our Registration link,

51
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,640
and when I click on it, it'll break, and it gives us this error.

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,170
Now, one thing that Spring Boot does that I don't really necessarily care for,

53
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,210
is it hides some of that stack trace.

54
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,850
It's not an actual problem because I can see where the error is at.

55
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,670
It tells us Name: 14, td: 15 and 16.

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,200
It doesn't know what this form:input path="name" is on line 16,

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,090
and it's telling you it doesn't know what to do with Name.

58
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,840
It's because it doesn't have the field in a backing object to tie that to.

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Let's fix that now.

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,270
Fixing that binding error is actually pretty easy.

61
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,060
We only need to do a couple of things inside of our application.

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,980
So I'm going to go ahead and click on

63
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,250
com.pluralisight.conference right below src,

64
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,980
main, java, not controller.

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm going to right‑click and say New, Java Class,

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,540
and inside of here, I want to type model.registration.

67
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,490
And what this will do is create a new package and class at the same time,

68
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:16,080
and you'll see that our controllers and our model on the left are separate.

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:23,780
Inside of here, I'm going to just do a private String name,

70
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,430
and then below that, I want to right‑click and generate our getters and setters,

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,990
and click OK.

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,240
And now we've created that registration object.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,460
I want to go to our RegistrationController now.

74
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,630
Inside of here,

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,960
we're going to get rid of that map that we have for that basic model object.

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm going to replace that with @ModelAttribute,

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,490
and we name this ModelAttribute so we can reference it in our page,

78
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,940
and I'm going to call this registration,

79
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,740
and then we tie it to an actual object.

80
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,840
So inside of here, I'll say Registration,

81
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,910
and I'll call the instance of that registration as well,

82
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:18,430
and now we have our object bound by our model to this ModelAttribute.

83
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,640
One last thing we need to do now is go back over to our registration.jsp page,

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,740
go up to our form,

85
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,430
and we want to add the ModelAttribute here of registration and save that.

86
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,690
Now,

87
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,490
if you've looked at old code or you have old code that you're

88
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,730
upgrading to a Spring 5 MVC implementation,

89
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,670
this used to be called commandName.

90
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,430
That will no longer work.

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,350
It's been deprecated and removed.

92
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,750
It will break, and you'll be left scratching your head,

93
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,980
wondering why. It's now called ModelAttribute,

94
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,520
which I like because the name is now consistent.

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,630
It used to be inconsistent.

96
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,130
So on line 9 here, this ModelAttribute that we just added to our

97
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,330
form tag ties to our RegistrationController on line 14 where I

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,800
say ModelAttribute registration.

99
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,590
Those objects are bound together now when we display

100
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,720
our page. I'm going to save that, pull up our server, and redeploy our server.

101
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,890
And now when I click on our Registration link,

102
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,730
it should pull our page up, and it does.

103
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,510
I will tell you, we're not done yet though, and that's probably not

104
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,240
what you wanted to hear. If I enter in a a name here, so I just put

105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,050
Bryan inside of here and click Add Registration, it's going to break

106
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,640
because we haven't supported POSTs yet.

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,180
We did a GET mapping, but we haven't done a POST mapping.

108
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,670
Really easily, let's switch back over to our IDE. On line 13

109
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,540
in our RegistrationController,

110
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,070
you can see that we're only supporting GET mappings with this

111
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,040
method. There is a way to make it to where it will do both a

112
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,130
GET and a POST in one method.

113
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,260
It's honestly not a good to use case though.

114
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,730
I'm going to go ahead and copy that, and paste it down to a

115
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:17,240
new line, and do POST, and then I want to change the method

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:28,690
name to addRegistration, save that, make sure you've imported everything.

117
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,050
And now, we should be ready to bring that back up to our page.

118
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:39,370
I'm going to go ahead and add a System.out.println here, just so we

119
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,430
could see the value that's in registration as it comes through. I'm

120
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:52,130
going to say registration, and then add just a getter on that

121
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,530
registration for the Name, and just dump that out to the console.

122
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,340
So I'll save that.

123
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,130
Let's restart our server,

124
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,580
have it pull that up, and now when we click on that Registration link,

125
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,010
it'll display that page.

126
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,410
We can enter our value in here, I'm going to put in Bryan,

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,680
click Add Registration,

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
and it will direct us back to the page because we don't

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,670
have anywhere else for it to go right now.

130
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,680
But if I go back over to our IDE,

131
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,630
we can see in the logs at the bottom of here that it

132
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,470
printed out Registration: Bryan Hansen.

133
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,720
So it went full cycle.

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,200
It went through our GET mapping, displayed the page, went through our POST,

135
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,990
printed out what values we had there, we could do this in a debug mode and

136
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,340
toggle for a breakpoint there to stop us and see what that value is, but

137
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,200
this was quick and dirty and got the application up and running to where you

138
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,020
could see those values and the full lifecycle of our GET and our POST inside

139
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,640
of that object.

140
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,740
We also just created a simple registration that we bound to,

141
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,120
and then we created those forms inside of our JSP pages

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,210
that went out and bound it to that object.

143
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,930
We also have validation in there.

144
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,730
We haven't done anything with that yet.

145
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,210
That's in a separate module.

146
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,440
But everything is set up.

147
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,350
It's full featured.

148
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,190
We've got our dispatcher servlet, our GETs, our POSTs, our

149
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:20,000
controllers, our model objects that are backing our forms. We have all the pieces of our application set up for us now.
