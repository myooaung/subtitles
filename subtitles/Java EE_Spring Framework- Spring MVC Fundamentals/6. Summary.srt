1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,900
This module was all about Ajax, Ajax calls,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,540
pulling back, RESTful services from our server.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,140
We did this implementing a RESTController.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,500
We showed you how to do the GET and the POST,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,380
and honestly, the PUT and the DELETE are identical.

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,440
It's really no different,

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,940
so there's not a lot of sense in going through those exercises.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,110
We then showed you a quick example using Postman and how

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,050
powerful it can be to use that to not only GET but have canned

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,030
examples of POSTs back to the server.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,230
It's a great way for you to test your web services and

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,340
run through that pretty quickly.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,510
And then we did a final example using JQuery and showed you exactly how

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,350
easy it was to use an Ajax call in your HTML to pull back that JSON data

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,020
from your URL. And this is the end of this course.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,130
I want to thank you for staying with us this long and completing everything.

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,360
I would recommend looking at some of the continuation courses after this. I

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,990
have a Spring Data JPA with Hibernate course, Spring Security, I have other

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,190
courses on RESTful services, and a great series on design patterns that,

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,060
regardless of using Spring, if you're doing any type of Java development,

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,000
I would recommend you look into those. Thank you, and I appreciate you sticking with us.
