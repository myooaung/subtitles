00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.340
JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React,

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.910
Vue, etc are changing faster than ever.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.000
Although a simple example with Angular would be nice,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.320
it would be out of date faster than we could publish this course.

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.050
What has been very consistent though is jQuery.

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.340
Before we dive into JavaScript though,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.560
let's look at the Spring configuration we need to

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.640
serve up some RESTful services.

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.870
Specifically, let's look at RestControllers.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.070
The RestController annotation is the heart of serving up RESTful

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.980
services. Looking at it though, it looks very similar to other

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.290
controllers that we've already created.

13
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.090
In fact,

14
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.500
we use the same annotation for the GetMapping that

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.240
we'd do in a standard controller.

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.780
In this particular example,

17
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.060
we're going to call the User URL and get back either a default or

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.040
pass in the name that we would like to retrieve.

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.140
Obviously in a larger example,

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:06.000
we would pass in a name and retrieve the user from a database. Let's add this RestController to our project now to retrieve a user.
