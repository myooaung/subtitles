00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,770
Views are resolved in Spring MVC by the controller building a

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,000
model that it passes to a view resolver,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,610
which then will determine the correct view that we want to display and

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,830
choose the appropriate view based off of that request. And there are

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,710
various view resolvers that are provided by Spring.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,990
You can create your own custom view resolver,

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,340
since they just extend the ViewResolver interface.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,820
Some of these resolvers are used for templating

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,550
tools like Thymeleaf or FreeMarker.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,750
It just configures where it should be looking for those templates and then

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,090
executes the bindings and writes the output. The ResourceBundleViewResolver

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,440
is used for internationalization purposes,

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,530
and it's used for things like templated layouts. In

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,260
a later example in this course,

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,090
we're going to look at XML content negotiating and how to

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:05,000
respond with JSON responses versus HTML or JSP responses, and we'll walk through one of those examples.
