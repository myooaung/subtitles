00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
Hello.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.710
Welcome back in this lesson,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.690
we're going to be talking about get requests,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.840
not get Quest,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.370
get requests and is actually super super simple.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.750
We've actually done quite a bit of this in this course so far.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.130
In fact,

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.210
we've done so much at this point,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.400
you should actually sort of have an idea of what we're going to be working on.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.900
So the last lesson we've created a form,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.850
the method was get.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.230
And when you submit it the city name,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.670
we type in Edmonton submit and we can see that in my u R L.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.550
It says question Mark City is equal to Edmonton.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.190
That's all there is to a get request.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.550
So what we can do here is we can now auto fill this form.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.290
We can now check to see if there is a city set,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.720
and we can say that Ah,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.810
you are from a certain city.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.720
Now this again is a super basic example.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.050
But it works very,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.790
very well because eventually you're going to create a lot of forms that automatically do

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.460
this because when I type in,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.160
let's type in another city.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.700
Let's type in New York that goes away.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.990
But We know that it says New York in the u R L but it doesn't say anything in the city

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.200
names,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.760
so let's auto fill this.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.880
So let's go in here and type.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.080
Value is equal to and blankets always going to be blank by default.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.950
And let's type some PHP in here.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.160
But what I'm going to do is,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.470
ah,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.960
I'm gonna write some PHP and then going to re factor it,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.150
so it's a lot cleaner,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.850
so we're going to say PHP t to If is set,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.350
get City Echo,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.840
get City.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.550
Otherwise do nothing and a refreshment page and it broke because I have not enough

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.350
parentheses around there.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.210
There we go and how it says New York.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.950
Or if I type in Edmonton,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.860
it will say Edmonton or if I type in literally,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.450
anywhere else,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.260
it says in the URL,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.050
anywhere else.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.350
But in the form it also says anywhere else.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.460
Now,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.370
let's quickly look at re factoring that what I like to dio is if I'm not using any sort of

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.020
framework or an M V C or anything,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.190
I'll put my PHP at the very top of the page,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.230
and I'll set variables so What we'll do is we'll set a very well called city name and it's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.660
empty.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.140
And then we can write our If statement,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.460
if is,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.690
is set.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.390
You do is that's the opposite is set.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.880
Get city we can type.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.190
City name is equal to get city now,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.260
Just so you know,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.050
this is technically a security breach because of someone types in some JavaScript or a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.240
specific set of characters.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.450
They can actually break this page and cause what's called on excess scripting breach.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.720
It's now what we're going to do is because we know that city name is always said,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.230
and if there is a sea name,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.280
we're just going to override it.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.750
We can just type Echo City name and this is much cleaner,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.740
much easier to reach.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.050
Let's make this a little smaller.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.080
Save,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.850
refresh and let's do test and it still works Wila.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.640
Now,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.610
if you haven't guessed it by now,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.350
this get request where it says get here matches up with this,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.250
Uh,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.890
actually,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.730
what this looks like is kind of bizarre.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.790
It's not like a normal variable,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.530
so it's a dollar sign.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.480
Underscore capital G et,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.800
and everything comes in the form of an array.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.000
So you know about a raise?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.450
Ah,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.040
you know about variable And,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.650
you know,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.910
Or I guess now you know that this is called a super global variable.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.660
So it doesn't matter what function or class you're running.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.210
And these,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.280
like that stuff comes later down the road.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.290
But you can use these literally,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.830
anywhere.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.510
It's always available to you.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.740
You don't have to worry about scope or passing things in.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.030
And if I'm confusing you right now,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.550
guess what?

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.950
You also don't have to worry about that stuff just yet.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.270
One step at a time.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.350
That's all we're asking.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.420
So now what we can say is PHP Ah,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.700
it's right.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.900
Some other stuff down here to do Bear with me.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.150
I'm gonna make some space so I can move this up way too big.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.700
OK,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.260
Petri,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.050
if is not empty,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.230
and we know about this one.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.280
So if basically,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.840
if the city name is set,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.840
bite Ah,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.660
it's not empty.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.670
So basically,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.610
if it's set and anything has been typed in here and it shows up in the well,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.380
let's let's despite something.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.390
So if is not empty city name and in here we can type um echo.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.460
Hey,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.970
Caleb,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.230
you are from it will contaminate this city name.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.320
In fact,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.380
I don't really like doing it that way.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.280
It's I find it hard to read s.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.120
So let's just do this.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.240
We're not gonna can Captain eight.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.250
We're just gonna write two different echo statements.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.370
And the reason that I have this space here is because if there is no space pH people

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.890
automatically,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.150
you know what?

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.550
In fact,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.330
I'm not even explained.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.050
I'm gonna show you.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.800
Look,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.670
it says you were from tests or its Edmund in which is where I'm from.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.730
Says you were from Edmonton.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.520
But there's no space.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.970
So I've actually had this question quite a bit in a javascript course of mine called

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.750
javascript Essentials or learn javascript on Caleb dot io.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.810
All you have to do is,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.190
um,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.330
append a pen to space in there,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.970
and it works.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.280
So there we go.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.410
We've got a simple form that submits.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.140
And if we have nothing in here,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.500
let's just go ahead and ah,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.440
it's to to do to do.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.350
Let's get rid of this stuff.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.780
Cool.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.260
So there's nothing in there.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.660
Ah,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.520
and as soon as there is a test boom It's as you were from tests,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.720
which is probably a place,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.750
but it's not where I'm from.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.750
So your task for this lesson is to create a get form,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.770
and then I want you to check if anything is said.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.890
If something is said,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.800
I want you to echo it back now you're going to have to use is set and empty.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.590
You can mix and match this any way you like.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.190
I find that this is the cleanest way.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.110
So I've got most of my PHP logic at the top,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.430
and I've also got I mean,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.770
I've got some logic at the bottom,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.310
but I don't have to worry too much about like if the city name is actually set because it's

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.500
already set up here.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.770
So logic up here.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.190
Ah,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.900
your template,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.350
your display stuff is below.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.810
Go ahead,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.710
Give that a shot.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.110
Once you're done with that,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.150
we're going to go ahead and we're going to learn about post and post is a little bit

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.750
different
