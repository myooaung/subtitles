00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
Hello.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:02.450
Okay,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.630
you've made a pretty far in this course,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.850
and this lesson is pivotal.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.690
This is something that is Oh,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.710
I don't even know how to explain it.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.010
This is the fundamental of programming right here.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.370
It all comes down to,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.570
if else statements.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.380
So in this lesson,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.090
we're going to learn about if statements and what an if statement is is.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.050
What we see here is it's a conditional and what that really means on a personal level,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.370
not on a programmers level,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.690
because programmers use weird terms and weird words to describe things.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.650
But as a regular person,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.750
what this means is,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.840
if something is true,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.150
if something returns to be positive in a sense,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.550
execute some code.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.200
For example,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.310
if you have milk in the fridge and you have cereal in the in your cupboard or your pantry,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.350
make cereal for breakfast.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.150
If you do not have gas in your car,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.590
go to gas station to fill up tank.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.630
If you are thirsty,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.610
take a drink.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640
If you are tired,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
have a nap.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.220
That is what an if statement is.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.190
We execute them with out thinking all the time in a reigns billions of times a day,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.860
most likely,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.050
and for the most part,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.050
it never ever comes into our conscious brains.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.590
It's just something that our brains have been doing for so long that we literally no longer

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.150
think about it.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.490
So let's hop into this.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.350
Okay,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.050
so I've got some PHP in here and I'm in or say my name.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.880
My name.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510
My age is equal to 28.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.450
So far,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.990
all we've been doing is eco age.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.720
Okay,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.270
that's cool.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.150
That gets us started.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.240
That gets us off the ground.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.890
We've even put things like this into,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.500
Ah,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.410
an array and associative Ray ah,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.620
multi dimensional associative array.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.050
We've done all of that,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.060
but that's not useful to us yet because we're not telling a program to do anything with it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.060
.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.010
All we're saying is,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.650
give us a number back and put it back on the page because,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.210
frankly,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.450
I could write the exact same thing on this page right here.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.400
And guess what?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.640
It will look the exact same wanna hit refresh,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.460
Bam!

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.190
It looks like nothing happened,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.630
and that's because I wrote it in the HTML section versus the PHP section.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.570
The browser doesn't know the difference,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.710
so we need to create some sort of conditional statement.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.850
So let's go ahead and create a conditional statement,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.510
and our 1st 1 is going to be just a basic if statement.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.790
So it looks like this if some stuff in here is true and if statements always need to return

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.910
true and there's some tricky logic in here,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.160
it takes a little bit of time toe.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.460
Get your brain to think in positives and negatives,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.250
black and white or what we call them earlier billions.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.320
If something is true,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.570
you got curly brackets in here.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.720
Execute some code.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.050
That is it.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.000
Don't over complicate that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.290
That is all it is.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.760
So we're going to say if age is equal to 28 Echo,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.150
you are 20 eight.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.790
There we go,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.120
and that is as easy as they get.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.450
That is really all there is now.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.540
We can over complicate this for days and days and days,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.090
but we're not going to and good programming.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.740
Honestly,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.270
it comes down to keeping things as simple as possible.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.850
Just because you can make things complicated does not make you a good programmer.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.560
It just means that your brain is able to think on a slightly higher level than other people

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.560
,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.190
and you're able to read something that's messier than other people.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.280
That's not a bragging right.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.080
That's not something employers are looking for.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.350
That's not something you're going to get hired for.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.440
In fact,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.460
that might even be the opposite.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.330
That's something that you might get made fun of.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.490
People give you a hard time on the Internet because you're writing things that are too

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.190
complicated.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.800
Don't do that.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.010
Keep things nice and simple.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.450
OK,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.760
that is a fundamental lesson from almost 20 years of programming.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.050
Keep it simple.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.550
That is my experience,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.080
that I cannot stress that enough.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.750
Keep it simple.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.060
All right,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.060
So moving on,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.240
we have to equal signs.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.100
What does this mean?

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.400
Okay,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.070
with one equal sign means age is equal to 28.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.820
We're pretty familiar with that.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.760
The two equal signs means we're checking to see if the age is,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.530
in fact 28 because if we said ages 27 nothing will show up just like that.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.210
But if we said the ages 28 just like before,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.150
it will show back up,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.070
and you will,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.130
I promise you,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.610
you will make this mistake where you will be writing Ah,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.580
conditional statement and you only use the one equal sign.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.140
Just what it still happens to me.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.050
20 years later,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.000
it's often just a typo and it will hang you up.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.010
You will get stuck now In this case,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.690
PHP thinks that this is true.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.140
But I could also run this as ages equal to 21.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.600
And PHP still thinks this is true.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.900
Why?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.050
Because this value was set to this age properly,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.800
it worked.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.210
And if I said echo age,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.370
it now thinks my age is 21.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.450
That's no good.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.480
And that's because you basically overrode this age with an age in an if statement.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.150
So you're going to run into that every now and then.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.520
Just be aware of it.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.630
And it's not the end of the world.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.990
So just a heads up.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.230
You will make that mistake.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.850
And it's not the end of the world if if you make that mistake so basic operators here All

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.060
right,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.900
I'm gonna clean this up and let's do this eco hr And let's talk about basic operators.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.270
So what you see here is the two equal signs that that's just an operator.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.960
That's all that's called as an operator.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.350
It means,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.960
if it's true,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.960
if it's not true,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.450
like when I said ages 27 this does not show up because that's false.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.160
And just to really drive this home,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.830
what we're saying here is you see how it matches up at the top online seven and line nine,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.150
where it says Agent age.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.720
What the computer thinks is this.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.670
If 28 is equal to 27 we know that that's wrong.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.630
Even if you're not a super logical thinker right now,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.760
your brain is saying,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.250
Ooh,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.050
that's not right And it won't work because it's false In programming,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.580
that's a logical fallacy is called falsehood.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.510
So this is a false.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.070
And if we just said that back to 28 that's true,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.350
because the computer thinks essentially 28 28.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.750
Yep,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.580
that is true.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.590
28 is 28.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.310
There's no other number.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.140
28 can be.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.310
It can only ever be itself.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.000
That's true.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.750
Run some code,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.680
all right,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.650
moving back onto basic operators.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.170
So we have a few different operators in here.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.530
We have got the greater then we have got the less than we've got,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.020
the greater than or equal to less than or equal to.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.980
We have got equal Teoh.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.250
Now,

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.820
don't panic,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.530
because these are super easy And I'm gonna fly through these really quick because you will

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.040
pick up on these just like that,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.270
It's gonna be super easy for you.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.130
So let's change age here,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.650
too.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.460
18 and just so that when you look at this later,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.690
it's not wrong if age is greater than or equal to 18.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.910
So in my province in Alberta,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.550
Canada,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.760
the legal drinking age is 18.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.850
So I can say you are allowed alcohol.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.650
Alcohol?

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.490
Oh,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.030
boy.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.410
Sorry.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.070
New keyboard not really used to typing on it yet.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.670
All right,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.950
so my age is equal to or greater than 18.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.610
That's true.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.430
Is is the age 18?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.880
Yes,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.150
it is.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.720
Is it greater than 18?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.010
Well,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:52.220
if I change this age to 20 it still says you're allowed alcohol and the 18 operator

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.850
disappeared.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.350
And the 18 conditional statement,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.810
the if your age is equal to 18 disappeared.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.020
So let's change it back to 18 and says I'm allowed alcohol.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.330
But if I said my age,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:06.910
No,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.450
that's wrong.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.610
But if I said my age was 17 because you're not allowed to drink alcohol.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.680
Your it's at age 17 that goes away.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.400
You are not allowed to drink alcohol when you were 17 years old.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.050
The legal age is 18.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.600
You have to be 18 or older.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.550
That's what this is.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.750
Think of that as the greater than or equal to that greater than or equal to is you are 18

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.550
or older.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.900
Alright,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.450
changing that back and let's say you are less than 18.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.950
Okay,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.610
you are less than 18.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.240
You cannot vote well.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.210
It says I'm 18.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.710
Cool.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.600
We know that my age is 18.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.080
If I'm less than 18 I cannot vote.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.850
Nothing showed up.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.840
That means it's false.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.050
What this is saying is,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.250
if 18 is less than 18 we're just false.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.610
Excuse him code.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:56.990
Remember,

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.120
this always has to be true.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.450
This has to be true.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.470
So let's change that back to age.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:10.190
And let's change my 8th May my age down to 17 says I cannot vote.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.890
I can change that,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:11.350
too.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.800
Seven.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.140
I still cannot vote because it is less than 18.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.570
Cool,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.110
basic.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:24.250
Right now let's say I wanted Teoh give access to someone onto a certain group of users on

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.880
my website that ages 45 under.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.160
So my age is now 45.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.550
I'm at the very tip of that threshold.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:38.130
This is you can be less than or fort.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.190
This is you have to be 45 years old or younger,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.490
less than or equal to 45.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.250
So what this means is 44 is acceptable.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.790
46 is not acceptable.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:59.370
45 is acceptable and we'll say secret access granted and the real secret access granted.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.150
But if I said my age is now 46 because I had a birthday,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.450
I don't have that access anymore.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.490
And now for the real simple ones,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.620
because I actually started off where the hard ones is.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:19.950
If your age is greater than 45 so you are not allowed to be 42 43 44 or 45 you have to be

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.650
older than 45 secret access granted,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.460
okay,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.640
because my age is 46.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.450
If I said 45 I don't get that anymore,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.680
because again,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.850
just think about replacing this with that number.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.850
If 45 is greater than 45 runs in code,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.500
it doesn't work that way.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.630
The opposite of that is if 45 is less than 45 secret access would be granted.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.620
But again,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.350
mathematically,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.050
that doesn't make sense.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.700
45 cannot be less than 45.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.360
45 is 45 and so nothing happens.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.530
But if I said my age was actually 44 because I lied about it Well,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.140
guess what?

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.550
I now have access to that.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.980
Okay,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.110
so this this is an if statement and remember,

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.590
you have your basic operators in here.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.350
So what I want you to dio is do exactly what I did in this video.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.070
You don't have to fully understand because you were going to write millions of these things

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.050
in your lifetime as a programmer.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.140
But you do need to understand that Ah,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.450
to equal signs are not the same as one equal sign.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.160
Um,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.400
and that you are going to be validating certain things.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.480
If your name is equal to Caleb,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.200
for example.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.690
Right.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.950
Let's make this example.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.650
My name is Caleb,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.900
and I wanted to say if name is equal to Caleb,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.050
notice the capital K and both of them.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.380
Then I get secret access.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.930
Granted,

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.450
if the name is John,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.450
then your secret access is granted but my name is not John,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.180
so I don't get that.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:55.530
But here's what I want you to do for your task check of these different operators use basic

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.340
numbers to begin with,

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.290
just using age.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.750
It's the easiest way to start.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.780
And then once you get that down one to understand how these work a little bit,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:08.260
I want you to change it from age and numbers toe a string,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:15.080
so change it from age to name and and check if your name is equal to John or in this case,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.410
it's,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.330
uh,

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.330
what sweeps up ups.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.850
What am I doing here in this case is Caleb.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.830
And what happens?

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.260
What happens when you use a lower case K?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.180
Is that still acceptable?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.150
We know that PHP is a loosely written language,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.920
so it should probably be acceptable,

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.300
right?

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.680
If there is a capital K in a lower case K or whatever letters you want to use,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.760
I want you to go and explore that option explored by yourself.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.720
The best way to learn is by doing get your hands dirty,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.550
figure it out,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.700
struggle a little bit,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.390
but not too much.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.600
And if you really get stuck,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.150
ask questions in the Facebook group.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.900
There you go.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.550
You know,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.520
know the number one thing that rules the entire world.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.660
If statements in the next lesson,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.030
we're going to learn about else statements,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.130
which is the exact opposite.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.290
So if something is false,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.350
what do we dio?
