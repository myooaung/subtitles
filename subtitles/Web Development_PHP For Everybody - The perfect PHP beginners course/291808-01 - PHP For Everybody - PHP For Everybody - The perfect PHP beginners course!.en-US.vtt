00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
Hello and welcome to PHP for everybody.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.820
My name is Caleb telling,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.070
and I've taught over 130,000 students worldwide,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.160
and I have started several start ups by writing PHP.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.250
Now PHP is a super in demand language.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.590
It is very hot right now.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.530
There are over 1.8 billion websites in the world,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.010
and over one in three of them are using PHP.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.080
So roughly 600 million websites are using PHP.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.060
By the end of this course,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.940
you will be able to talk very confidently about programming,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.380
programming,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.580
fundamentals and even server side coding,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.820
and you can also consider yourself a junior PHP developer.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.880
In this course,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.700
you will learn programming fundamentals from scratch,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.640
and each lesson comes with a task at the end of it.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.810
Or,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.330
as I call it,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.200
homework for some immediate hands on practice and experience with everything you've just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.630
learned.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.310
Some things you will learn in this course are what is PHP?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.160
Where is PHP used?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.400
We'll talk about variables,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.360
data types,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.680
data structures,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.270
conditional statements.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.030
We will talk about four loops while loops form validation forms and so much more.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.810
At the end of this course,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.170
there's a project where you could get hands on experience with everything you have learned

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.950
in this course.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.250
And if you are brand new to Web development or or you're interested in just learning PHP,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.820
then this course is definitely for you.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.140
However,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.790
if you already know Ph.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.990
B,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.070
if you are familiar with it a little bit ah,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.390
you would consider yourself an intermediate or expert PHP developer.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.490
This course is not for you.

and I've built several start ups using just PHP.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.100
PHP is a hot language.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.380
It is in serious demand right now and over one in three websites are using PHP,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.600

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.040
Programming,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.490
programming,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.330
fundamentals,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.440
server side coding,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.030
and you can actually consider yourself to be a junior PHP developer in this course You will

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.730
also learn programming fundamentals from scratch,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.750
so no experience is necessary.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.850
And every video lesson comes with a task at the end of it,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.040
so you can get some hands on experience right away.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.950
Now some of the things that you will learn in this course are what is PHP?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.740
Where's PHP?

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.910
Used variables,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.710
data types,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.720
data structures,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.530
four loops,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.690
conditional statements,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.690

Now,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.320
