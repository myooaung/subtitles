00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Howdy.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.180
Howdy.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.650
Howdy.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.520
Let's take a look at Echo in that last lesson.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
If you watched it,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.950
you saw a lot of this.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.470
Actually,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.680
that doesn't look highlighted.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.780
You actually saw quite a bit of this test Basic PHP,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.660
syntax and this weird little echo statement.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.070
Now,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.340
if you've ever written in any other programming language,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.180
often you'll see print or you'll see something along the lines of Prince with parentheses

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.760
around it.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.410
Well,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.610
in PHP,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.580
we can actually do both.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.470
We can do print.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.240
Let's just save this and refresh.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.040
And it says,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.560
Test on you.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.150
I'm gonna zoom in so you can see this make this huge for you.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.550
And we also have echo test two.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.910
I say that refreshes says test and test two.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.970
So this is the 1st 1 This is the 2nd 1 So,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.470
really,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.950
what is the difference between print and echo?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.750
Well,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.320
there's a lot of speculation out there.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.450
Should you use printer to use eco PHP Developers have sort of just resided to using echo,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.590
and it's based purely on one principle.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.650
It is one letter shorter than the word print meeting that if Prentice five letters and this

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.350
is four letters it's 20% faster.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.150
Basically,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.470
that's what the math boils down to.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.240
Also,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.790
in PHP,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.650
we've just written the word echo forever were echoing something to the page.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.840
So that's the difference between ECU in print.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.440
You won't see me use print,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.490
probably it all through the rest of this course.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.950
I will be using echo for everything.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.950
But if you come from a programming language that doesn't use Echo,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.990
just think of print as echo.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.640
So print is equal to echo literally the same thing.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.770
Now here you can see we have an opening quotation of closing quotation and a semicolon.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.250
When the last lesson about syntax learned all about that,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.250
well,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.010
let's get rid of that.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.250
And let's use regular apostrophes.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.550
Hello world.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.210
I use apostrophes instead of quotations.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.750
I save and refresh and guess what?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.150
It works just the same.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.130
So what's the difference between a posture,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.080
freeze and quotations?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.960
Well,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.500
I'm gonna keep you in suspense for a little bit,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.390
because we're not going to learn about that just yet.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.290
There's a few other things we need to learn before we can get into that,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.280
but for the time being,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.670
you can.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.100
You can consider these to be the exact same.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.350
Now what if I type?

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.030
Hello,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.350
It's nice to see you.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.700
You can see that my color has changed.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.950
My editor thinks something is wrong.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.620
It's probably correct.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.750
Sometimes it's not correct,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.720
but is probably correct.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.150
So if I refresh the page Oh,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.100
I get a 500 error now a 500 air and you can see that because it's those little http ever

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.650
500.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.700
A 500 error means something went wrong while it was trying to run the program at it could

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.660
not finish.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.080
Now,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.930
if you're using something like X debug,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.100
you can figure out exactly what this is.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.190
If you have syntax highlighting in your editor,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.690
which,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.190
by the way,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.670
if you don't,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.490
I would highly recommend getting some sort of syntax highlighter.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.490
There's tons of plug in for sublime,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.650
although Sublime comes with a PHP syntax highlighter built in.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.310
Adam has syntax highlighting.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.870
V s code has syntax highlighting syntax.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.710
Highlighting is basically well,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.990
I'll just remove this and my my my text here.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.860
My string Don't worry about what a string is,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.150
but my text here is all green.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.850
You can see that echoes orange and my semi colon is white.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.550
So that's what syntax highlighting is.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.240
So if I throw this back in here,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.970
how on earth do I write this?

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.240
Because I can't get this page to display now.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.850
Well,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.360
this is something you're going to run into.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.670
Ah,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.180
lot.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.730
This is very,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.350
very common.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.530
So we have two options here,

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.830
and this is the simplest one.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.970
Option one is change your outside apostrophes to quotations.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.690
So they're not the same as the one that's being used on the inside.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.550
So if I refresh Hello,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.050
it's nice to see you.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.140
Alternatively,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.420
I'm gonna changes back to apostrophe,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.570
so we're not using a quote.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.360
Refresh page will get the 500.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.930
There it is.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.710
We can do this thing called escaping.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.700
Now we're going to learn all about escaping down the road.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.950
This option is a little more advanced for you right now,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.490
but all we do is add a backslash and you can see that this here has turned into a lighter

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.750
green slash yellow we color.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.600
Meaning I can now save this page.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.700
Go over here.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.950
Refresh and whoa.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.550
You notice how that backslash is not visible in there.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.880
That's called escaping.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.870
This means don't render this as the same as this apostrophe.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.580
This backslash is saying,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.220
Hey,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.150
this apostrophe right here,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.900
that one is just know possibly.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.050
It's part of the text that I want to render to the page.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.250
Just use it normally.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.750
And if I wanted to throw a bunch of backsplashes in here like this,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.150
save it.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.950
Nothing's going to change,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.310
but and we'll get into this with escaping.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.750
If I add two of them in here,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.600
you only see the one again.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.830
That's that's something for the whole escaping lesson.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.380
We'll talk about that in the future,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.940
but you now know of two methods to solve this and again,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.250
this is a very common problem.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.450
Now your task for this lesson is to just echo something to your page.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.650
Don't forget.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.370
Open your PHP tag.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.850
Echo,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.420
I would say for now,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.590
use quotations.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.310
So you've got an opening quotation closing quotation and sme colon and then put some text

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.830
in there just like you did that last lesson.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.270
It's good to get this practice underneath you because the more and more you do it,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.320
the better you'll be.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.750
The faster will come to you.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.610
Don't forget your closing PHP tag loaded up in your browser.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.950
Once you see that you are good to go to the next lesson,
