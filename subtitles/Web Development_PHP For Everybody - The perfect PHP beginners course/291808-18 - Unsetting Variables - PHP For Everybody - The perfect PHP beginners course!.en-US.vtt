00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Hello.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.680
In this lesson,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.790
we're going to be talking about how we can not necessarily delete a variable,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.590
but how we can unset the value of it.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.450
So we learned before that a variable did open up my syntax here,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.090
and we learned that a variable looks like far is equal to something like this.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.780
Very simple,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.950
straightforward variable.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.250
Now this part here,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.150
that is,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.560
that's the value.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.290
That's what we call a value.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.330
And this value can be unset.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:43.650
So if in here I typed Echo and I refresh my page,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.510
it says killed on.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.510
That's also in H two because they didn't close that tag.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.490
So let me just quickly fix that up there.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.040
Go says Caleb,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.880
I'll make this bigger so you can see this now if for whatever reason we want to unsettle

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.390
variable on,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.520
this happens from time to time.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.320
So this is a good thing to know we need to be able to get rid of the value.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.550
So the way we do that is by using a built in function in PHP called unset,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.410
and it can take a bunch of variables,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.010
but in this case,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.750
we're just going to give it the one variable.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.890
Now,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.030
if I refresh the page,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.530
you'll notice that this still shows up.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.310
And that's because in computer programming,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.050
most languages execute from top to bottom,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.030
so this variable is already set.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.810
This variable is now echoed out,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.490
and now the variable is unset.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.500
It's already been echoed.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.140
It can't can't be UN echoed so as a demonstration.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.090
Let's echo this out once more after it's been unset.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.700
So I'm refreshing my page here and nothing is happening.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.650
And we can see this when I type Echo.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.570
Uh,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.880
let's just put stopper in there just so we know that it stopped and there's nothing in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.000
there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Even when I view the source,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.940
there's nothing in there.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.990
It says.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.140
I'm sending a variable.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.370
That's my H to tag,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.610
says Caleb.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.550
That's what we echoed in here.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.350
We unsaid the variable,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.390
and we tried to echo it again,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.340
and nothing happened.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.250
There's nothing in here and then just says stopper.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.260
So that's how you unset a variable.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.420
Now,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.080
if you want to accept more than one variable,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.200
all you have to do is not variable 12.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.370
I mean,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.830
it could be variable 12 if you wanted to.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.520
I just use a comma separated list and type your variable names.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.560
Now they don't have to be var fire two of our three of our four.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.170
It could be also your name or whatever.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.080
Whatever the name of the variable is,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.300
you can unset it now.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.180
That's also works for a raise and objects and and all sorts of things.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.750
You just need to unset one particular value,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.000
and this is how you do it now.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.620
Your task for this lesson is to write your own variable.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.320
You know how to do this.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.900
Now echo that variable out.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.120
You also know how to do that.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.310
I'm set your single variable.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.180
You don't have to do to three or four variables,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.660
just unset the one variable that you've written and try to echo that out.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.480
Load that up in your browser and you'll see that nothing happens.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.200
And if you get similar results to what I have in this video,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.850
then you were good to go and we'll see the next lesson.
