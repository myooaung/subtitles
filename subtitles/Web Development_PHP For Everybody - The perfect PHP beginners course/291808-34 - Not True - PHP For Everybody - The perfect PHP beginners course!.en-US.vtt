00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
Hello.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.150
Hello.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.950
so we quickly learned about incremental Zand Detrimental Z.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.500
But let's quickly hot back to condition ALS.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.750
So there's another one that we should learn about.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.640
And I actually realize that we haven't really been using Boolean that often.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.430
And Boolean is a fantastic actually Tate a type because it's so simple.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.400
Boolean can never only be true or false,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.990
So let's say we have Oh,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.500
what could be true or false?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.330
K Ah,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.980
the sky is blue so it's a blue sky is equal to capital t Is python eso lower case?

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.410
True,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.550
We could also say it's false if the I don't know if this guy is gray if it's a rainy day

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.900
But let's stick with true great And we said,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:52.950
If blue sky echo today is nice outside and we echo list of the page,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.780
you notice how there is no conditional in here.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.320
This is not saying if Blue Sky is greater than one,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080
or if blue skies equal to true.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.600
Although this will work as well.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.730
In fact,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850
the strict comparison will also work.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.070
Um,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.540
and maybe just as an experiment,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.610
let's do this.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310
What happens if Blue Sky?

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.300
Because this is a Boolean.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.080
This is a different data types in the string.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.490
If we did a soft comparison to the word true also turns out okay,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.760
but just to blow your mind here,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.750
What if we wrote false?

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.050
It still works.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.770
If you are interested in learning more about that,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.850
feel free to ask in the Facebook group.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.220
And I would be more than happy to explain,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.720
um,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.850
otherwise you can hop on the old Google machine and,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.430
you know,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.380
do a little bit of Googling.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.500
It's also a good way to learn,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.350
do some research on your own time.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.620
Not that I'm trying to be lazy or anything.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.400
It's just,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.730
you know,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.350
I'm trying to prep you for the future because once you get out there,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.690
once you're done this course you're going to be doing a lot of research on your own as well

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.690
.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.750
So we did not need any conditional in here because this is true.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.320
Remember,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.690
if statements always have to be true if that condition is met,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.640
if this is true,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.750
it's just the exact same is saying True,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.370
This will still say today is nice outside.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.830
But if we said if this is false,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.350
it won't say anything because false is not true.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.180
Now we can also do the exact exact same thing using the number one or the number zero.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.930
So we can say Blue sky zero.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.870
Nothing's gonna show up because this is the equivalent of false.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.420
Or we can say one which is the equivalent of true.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.960
There we go.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.570
And in fact,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.660
any number that's higher than zero is considered true.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.410
So we could do something like this also considered true.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.950
But what if we did like minus 12?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.300
Also true,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.390
Because it's not 00 is false.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.550
Everything else is true.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.400
Great,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.060
false,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.030
but for purpose of keeping this code so you can access it later on.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.850
Get hub.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.250
Keep it as ah,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.300
this.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.150
And in fact,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.910
just because I want you to be familiar with brilliance because billions air so powerful if

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.930
you can boil everything down to a Boolean,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.950
your logic becomes so much easier to understand.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.810
All right,

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.410
so these are the same thing now.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.220
What if we did something opposite?

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.970
What if we said this guy is not blue?

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.130
What we could say?

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.570
If the sky is equal to false right,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.110
nothing's gonna happen in fact,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.930
let's change this.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.950
Let's change us too.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.480
This guy is not blue.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.610
There we go.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.430
Nothing happens because this is still set to true.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.190
If we said this is false now we're getting into some weird territory where false is equal

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.770
to false cause.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.520
That's what this is.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.250
So what we're saying here is zero is equal to false is equal to false.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.340
All of that is the same thing.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.810
It's like in school.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.150
When you learn that 1/1 is the same as one is the same as 100% is the same as 1.0.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.750
It's the exact same thing.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.640
We're just We're changing the measurement in a sense,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.410
so we say blue sky is equal to false cool.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.010
That works,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.100
but there's a faster way.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.310
There's a better way you don't have to say is equal to false,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.000
because the shortcut for that is this exclamation mark.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.660
Exclamation mark right here says,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.850
Is this the opposite?

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.630
And so what we're saying here is the opposite of this.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.780
In fact,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.350
let's actually changes back to true.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.310
So remember originally,

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.410
if this is true,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.400
the sky is blue.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.390
This guy is blue else.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.620
Echo the sky is gray Refresh.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.310
The page says the sky is blue because that's true if we wanted to check to see if this guy

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.950
was not blue All right.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.800
Ah,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.410
we could change that to false This guy is gray.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.880
Or if we wanted to change this to B blue still right,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.040
because at this point and again,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.820
it's really,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.820
really hard to explain.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.060
This is one of those things that you really need to understand.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.600
You need to,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.350
uh,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.690
work with it a lot.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.500
You need to pound it into your own brain into your gray matter so that you understand this

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.500
.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.190
And again,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.240
this is much better if you do it on your own.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.580
Don't coffee this code.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.910
You know,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.520
good practices to write this out,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.280
to play with it,

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.100
to mess with it until it messes with your head until you go.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.460
Actually,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.660
you know what?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.350
This makes sense.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.050
Okay,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.660
I'm done rambling,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.170
I promise.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.600
No,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.330
I don't promise.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.320
I'll probably ramble some more eso were saying,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.440
If this guy's not blue right,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.250
that's what does it means.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.970
So you can actually read this like a sentence.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:08.550
So this says if not blue Sky Code stuff here That's what this is saying.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.950
If the sky is not blue,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.450
if sky not blue,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.790
if not blue sky,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.270
right?

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.160
Sort of the same thing.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.390
I mean,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.920
it's terrible,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.760
terrible English,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.600
and the grammar is impeccably bad.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.550
But it still makes sense,

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.050
somehow to your brain to make sense.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.220
So we say the sky is not blue.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.550
This is actually going to spit out the wrong text,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.050
which is correct.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.810
This guy is not blue and the sky is blue.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.750
And so now all we've done is changed these lines.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.820
And in fact,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.310
I want to show you essentially what this does all right.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.960
As an example,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.850
the sky is blue.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.790
Let's let's keep this simple.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.270
The skies.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.280
But you're looking outside.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.300
It's beautiful out.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.470
There are no clouds.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.250
It's just a nice blue sky.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.540
Okay,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.910
when we refresh this page,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.310
it says the sky is blue.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.330
It's because it's true.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.090
It's nice out.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.300
It's beautiful middle of summer.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.150
Perhaps Now,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.870
if you want to check to see if this guy is gray,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.510
you would add this not and we will just reverse where these lines were.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.640
So I just switched them,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.950
That's all I didn't refresh and it still says the sky is blue.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.750
That's because it's checking for the negative.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.500
It's checking for the not it's checking for the false first.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.600
So if we change this one now the sky is gray.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.130
Why?

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.350
Because we said is this guy blue?

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.070
It is not blue,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.930
is it not?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.480
Not blue,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.280
because this is the equivalent of saying,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.250
Is this guy not not blue?

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.220
Now,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.800
I know this is terrible English because you're never supposed to use a double negative like

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.110
this.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:54.550
But you can essentially say these will cancel each other out is the sky blue.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.650
And that's what this is asking.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.680
Because is this guy not not Blue is the Sky blue is the same thing.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.220
This guy is currently not blue.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.170
So this guy is going to be gray.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.180
All right.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.140
I have said way too much for this lesson.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.850
Um,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.530
you will see these not symbols all over the place.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.930
These things here,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.920
you're going to see them.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.210
Ah,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.750
lot.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.830
And all we're really saying is is something true or false,

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.420
or is it the opposite of true?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.030
Or is it the opposite of false like,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.890
What kind of answer are we looking for here and the general reason why we would use that is

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.020
so that we don't need an else statement at all.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.510
We can say if the sky is not blue,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.290
do something else or if the sky is blue,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.150
do something.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.690
So there's no task for this lesson because our I've already talked to your ear off on this

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:43.970
one.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.440
Uh,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.200
um,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.790
about something that is already sort of confusing if you want to,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.530
uh,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.730
play with us a little bit,

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.230
right some of your own code and just test it out.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.900
But generally there's no task for this one.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.200
And you might see this in the future a little bit.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.450
I'll try to ah,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.090
to remember,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.470
as I'm recording these lessons,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.120
um,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.600
Teoh explain things like this just because we're going to see these more and more.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.950
And I don't want anyone feeling left out or confused or feeling like we didn't learn this

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.350
already.
