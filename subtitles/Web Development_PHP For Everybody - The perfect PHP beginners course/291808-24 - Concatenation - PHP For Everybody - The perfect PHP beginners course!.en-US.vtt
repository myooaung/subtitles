00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
All right,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.060
let's talk about coming.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.020
Katyn Nation concatenation again.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.100
For whatever reason,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.000
programmers like to use big fancy words.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.520
Really?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.150
Just means you were joining data together.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.250
Now,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.250
we've seen this a few times.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.780
Um,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.250
I have Ah,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.080
yes.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.520
I've created a few examples where I use,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.340
um,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.860
if else statements things that you haven't learned yet.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.470
Can Cat Nation again things that haven't learned yet?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.400
I've sort of been using them to get you use to how they look and how they act without

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.100
formerly understanding how they work.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.350
You're just sort of dabbling your toe and the realm of the unknown right now and that is OK

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.350
,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.250
so in this lesson,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.800
we're going to learn what can Katyn ation formally is.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.150
So I'm gonna start,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.300
as always.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.210
I'm gonna open up that PHP syntax and I'm gonna write.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.650
Name is equal to Caleb,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.550
and I could say hi,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.820
my name is Hi,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.650
My name is Caleb.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.510
So,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.950
in a sense,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.220
this is a form of concatenation,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.530
but not not proper concatenation.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.670
This is really just adding it variable inside of a string.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.850
But what if I wanted to say my last name is well,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.210
well,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580
this variable has already set.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.600
How am I going to do that?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.500
I could theoretically,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.720
Right?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.650
Caleb Tallinn.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.530
And it'll say Hi.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.550
My name is Caleb telling,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.630
just as expected.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.250
But then I have to override the variable.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.550
And sometimes you don't want to overwrite the variable.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.510
Now I could can cat Nate in two different ways.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.950
I can say name is equal to name and I can use this does dot in here so this dot means

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.450
stereo.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.700
So this dot right in the middle,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.660
that's my period.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.950
That's my period symbol.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.050
It's saying,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.200
Add this 1st 1 with this extra stuff.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.950
So now if I save and refresh,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.910
nothing changes because it's still contaminating perfectly.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.890
Now there is another option.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.120
I was going to remove that and we could echo it directly out.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.750
We could say Echo name.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.590
I'll make the smaller so it fits on one line.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.360
Hi,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.370
My name is Houston Cat Nation.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.980
In the middle of my string,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.510
I place my variable inside there.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.390
I can can't need another string.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.700
Save it.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.370
Refresh.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.940
Hi,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.810
My name is Caleb telling.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.840
So that is concatenation.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.550
That is as easy as it gets.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.970
I mean,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.520
that's really all there is to it now.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.290
Few other examples you could say Echo name Holly.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.720
And so it's Caleb to lean on.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.100
By the way,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.880
when you're doing this,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.230
you don't have to use my name by any means.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.220
Use your own name or use the name of your favorite Ah,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.020
Pat movie TV show Anything.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.450
Really?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.150
Eso this will work as well.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.630
Um,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.770
Up,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.900
up,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.070
up,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.370
up.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.080
Let's let's get a little fancier here.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.860
So define HR,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.060
and this one is going to be horizontal.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.260
Tag this one.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.570
Echo HR.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.750
This is a constant constant.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.450
Never changes.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.350
Echo concept constant Ever changes echo.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.160
My name is so there we go.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.850
Now we're integrating.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.680
Ah,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.090
constant variable concatenation were starting to actually join all of these things that

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.250
we're learning together.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.270
So now if you're asking yourself a question along the lines off Caleb,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.830
why would I ever need to use concatenation when your first example actually worked?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.750
Perfectly fine.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.280
Because I could take this out,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.380
save refresh.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.750
This line didn't change at all.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.700
So why would I even do that?

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.410
Well,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.700
it's because there are two types of quotes in PHP,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.610
and this is again I'm going to create a lesson.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.950
All about these quotes,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.180
but there are single quotes and there are double quotes.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.140
So you've got your quotation marks,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.790
these double quotes and these magically let you use variables in here.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.850
Name is my name.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.580
And so we'll see at the bottom.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.490
Caleb is my name and one cycle missing.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.910
Push this down.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.550
So this is more in the center of your screen.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.760
And I could also write in a single quote.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.950
Name is my name,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.600
and this actually displays the variable name,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.510
so double quotes let you use the variable inside them,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.320
and this one doesn't.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.350
So when I want to use,

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.730
like for example,

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.560
I'm talking about PHP right now and I want to be able to print this to the page.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.030
I could say something along these lines.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.750
Name space at that dot in there.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.750
Name.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.350
There we go.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.040
And now that works.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.750
So that's the reason why we use the period concatenation.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.060
So that's all there is rather simple.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.510
Really.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.150
Your task for this lesson is to ah cat me So creative variable.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.010
Put it as your name.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.580
Your favorite.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.120
Ah,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.010
your favorite pet.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.250
Your favorite TV show.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.950
Whatever you like,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.560
make some sort of sentence use that variable.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.690
And can cat need it like this or like this,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.210
But not like this.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.590
In fact,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.150
I'm actually gonna change that one back so that this code is not saved that way.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.230
Okay.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.100
Or you could do this way.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.900
Cool.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.570
When she done,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.450
I'll see the next video.
