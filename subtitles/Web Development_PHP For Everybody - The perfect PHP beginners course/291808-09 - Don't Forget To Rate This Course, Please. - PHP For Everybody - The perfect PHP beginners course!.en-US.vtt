00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Hello,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.540
It's me.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.010
I'm the voice behind the videos.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.150
Just a quick reminder that if you've enjoyed any of these videos so far,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.580
you can follow me on skill share.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.120
But more importantly,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.900
you can actually rate this course.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.050
And just by simply reading this course,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.700
that actually helps me out a lot.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.170
It's super easy and super quick only takes a couple seconds,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.490
and I mean it really would mean the world to me.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.320
So if you've if you've loved what I've been teaching you,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.400
if you like the style of my courses,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.450
give that a good old thumbs up,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.610
Um,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.030
and let other people know what you fluffed about these videos as well.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.430
Cheers.
