00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
all right in the last two lessons we talked about,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.570
if statements and else statements.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.550
But there's one more in between,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.200
and that's the else if statement.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.120
So right now,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.320
we know that I'm just gonna reek.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.520
Recreate this example.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.050
We've done the last two episodes.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.140
If my age is equal to,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.520
let's say,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.850
21 Echo,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.450
Um,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.310
I don't know B'Day party in Vegas.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.850
Okay,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.040
else my age is not 21.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.680
My age is anything other than 21.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.450
It's 22 or higher or its 20 or less echo.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.570
Do anything else.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.570
And here we go.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.050
It says,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.550
Do anything else because my age is 21.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.460
Sorry,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.890
my age is 18 but it's checking to see if the ages 21 now there's one that we can add in the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.280
middle here called else ifs and this else if it's literally else.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.190
If and actually wow,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.750
that's pretty cool.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.080
Sublime.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.230
Just fill that in for me when I hit.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.000
Enter so else if and here's my condition else.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.350
If age is equal to 18 and my code is going to be echo,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.350
I am 18.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
Let's go snowboarding or something along those lines,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.120
and let's just clean that up,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.280
Put those back on the same line.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.150
And here we see it says I am 18.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.850
Let's go snowboarding.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.690
And if I flip this back to 21 B'Day party in Las Vegas now,

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.250
we can have as many of these as we want.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.180
Now,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.270
keep in mind that these are all going to check for the same thing,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.160
so it's pretty pointless.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.950
But if we said 19 and then 20 and then this one would be 22 let's say this one was 17 and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.850
I'm just gonna it's like all of these echo and all I'm gonna do is put the age in here age

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:09.550
1920 22 and 17 and this is gonna be some other age.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.380
Now look at this V Day party in Las Vegas because my age is 21.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.310
But if I said my age is now 18 it says 18 and I say 19 it's 19 is going to keep going

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.750
through if I co down into my age is 20 hoops drag and drop.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.510
If I say my age is equal to 22 guess what is going to say 22 because I said that because I

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.660
said check if 22 just like that.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.050
22 because I said check if 22 And if I said my age was 1000 years old,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.450
it's a some other age.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390
Or if I did a really,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.840
really small number,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.550
let's do minus 1000 some other age,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.880
so you can see that we have unlimited else.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.250
If possibilities here.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.950
No,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.620
it's always going to execute from the top to the bottom.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.010
If this one is true,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.050
excuse this code.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.550
The stuff in here online 10 and ignore everything else.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.640
If that doesn't work,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.050
is going to check the next line.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.640
If the ages 18 execute this code and ignore everything else.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.090
And it's going to do that until it gets to the else statement where it says if the age of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.640
17 well,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.230
it's not so.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.550
It's not going to execute this code.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.570
And if it is anything else,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.660
anything else that does not match any of the requirements between line nine and 19 or

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.390
however many elf else.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.150
If statements that you create it does not matter,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.270
it will execute some other code.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.850
And again,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.990
the else statement is completely optional.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.670
So if you are some other age.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.000
You were not 2118 1920 22 or 17 because I put that in a weird order.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.710
For some reason,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.610
it won't do anything.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.650
So now you can execute certain bits of code based on certain bits of information.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.200
And if some requirement is not met,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.050
you can either take action or not take action because that's exactly how life works.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.150
Something happens to you.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.450
You're able to either do something or not do something.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.830
I mean,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.250
it really just comes down to that.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.390
So what I'm going to do here is just creates a more advanced example so you can see what

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.380
I'm going to be doing in the future again.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.560
This part is like,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.350
you don't have to worry about this next part.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.870
Just this lesson.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.050
Focus on the else F,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.210
but I want to show you something cool to help keep you engaged to help show you how dynamic

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.710
PHP can actually be.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.630
So I'm going to use what's called a super global variable on which change that to set that

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.550
as name get name and if name is equal to Caleb Echo.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.940
Whoops.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.060
Hello,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.650
Caleb.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:19.530
I was in the tech world else if name is equal to Is that for Echo my kitty Else?

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.750
If name is equal to hunk,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.340
we are going to say Echo smash.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.050
And if you were nobody else,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.950
grips should be lower case echo.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.850
It will be a little more professional.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.730
Be like welcome,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.150
guests.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.720
Okay,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.000
so you're gonna see that.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.500
Welcome.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.490
Guesses What shows up.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.190
Now,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.330
this is the part that you don't have to worry about right now.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.380
Is what is this?

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.120
Get parameter.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.360
We're gonna talk about this later.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.880
Again.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.150
I'm just using this as an example to keep you interested.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.250
So I say name is equal to Caleb.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.020
Hello,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.650
Caleb.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.250
My name is now equal to Zephyr.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.610
My kitty,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.320
uh,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.570
name is equal to Hulk.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.820
Smash.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.590
Right.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.930
So now we're changing all of these parameters based on the U R l The U R l is actually

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.690
changing every time I add something else in here.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.050
This is actually reloading the entire page.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.440
And what is doing is it's saying,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.690
Oh,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.060
if there is a parameter in the u.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.310
L called name and it matches Caleb,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.160
say hello,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.500
Caleb,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.050
If it matches,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.850
ever say my kid,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.000
if it matches hulks a smash.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.640
And if it's anyone else,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.480
they welcome guest.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.160
And so now you're not just hard coding anything.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.810
You were actually letting people change things based on the U.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.910
R L So there you have it.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.850
You now understand if statements l statements and else if statements and there's another

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.630
one that actually sums all of us up really easily,

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.990
it's called a switch statement.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.720
Um,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.850
and we'll talk about that one in some other lesson.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.440
But for now,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.080
what I would like you to do for your task is create an if statement an else if statement

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.220
one or more else,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.720
if statement.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.180
So you've got two of them in there and create an else statement.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.690
No.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.370
Remember that all of these air optional,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.830
including the else statement and all you really need to do is validate one thing.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.810
If any one of these matches,

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.050
it will execute that block of code and ignore everything else.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.480
So there you go.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.540
You have a little bit of homework,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.570
tinker around with that,

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.450
have some fun with it,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.140
possibly play with different operators as well different conditional operators,

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.350
so that is greater than or equal to.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:39.420
That's less than or equal to is greater than is less than there are a couple more that

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.180
we're gonna talk about in ah,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.360
conditional lesson.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.840
That's all about more advanced condition ALS and sort of how we get some more advanced

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.540
logic in here.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.310
But for now,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.450
this is all you need to do.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.220
So go have fun with that.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.570
Feel free to tinker around with us,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.880
get parameter as well.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.930
And once you were done with all of this,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.350
head on over to the next lesson and I'll meet you over there.
