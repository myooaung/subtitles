00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
to quote or to apostrophe.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.460
And the last lesson we briefly talked about the difference between that.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.110
But in this lesson,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.410
I want to actually explain a little more in detail about with the quote or what the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.520
apostrophe does.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.710
So in PHP and Emerson open nametags here in PHP,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.220
we can say name is equal to Caleb.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.530
You know what I'm bored of using?

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.220
My name is my cat's name Zephyr,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.550
because he's pretty awesome.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.550
Ah,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.890
yes.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.170
I am a programmer with a cat.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.290
That stereotype is true.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.850
It's riel.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.540
So I could say echo name?

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.340
Um,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.800
yeah,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.150
I could say I co name or I could say echo name.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.060
And this will really just say zephyrs effort.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.150
Just like this suffers ever.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.420
But if I wanted to put his name into a sentence,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.650
my cat is,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.160
and he is.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.650
It's put color in there.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.850
Color is equal to gray.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.650
My cat is ever He is great period in there.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.850
So that a proper sentence.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.680
Okay,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.960
cool.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.910
That works.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.350
But if we use regular quotations,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.490
it now displays not only the actual variable name,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.170
um,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.090
but the variable color as well.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.520
And we don't really want to ever for the most part.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.150
Um,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.120
talk about the variables,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.040
as as their names.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.750
We want their variable values.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.870
And so that's the difference between these two.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.690
And what I'm going to do is just fix this up.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.750
So the fear ever looking at this code a little later,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.620
you'll see the difference.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.670
Cool.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.750
So that's the difference now,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.150
even though we have I Let's turn out toe break.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.370
OK,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.840
But now what happens if you have a sentence that has a quote in there,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.670
for example?

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.390
Echo?

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.110
Um,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.250
let's think of a quote,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.450
Do or do not.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.950
There is no try Yoda.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.850
Okay,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.680
Pretty typical.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.150
We know all about this already,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.670
but if we wanted to add a quote in here so that it actually looked like a quote this going

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.200
to cause a problem because now I've got an empty string.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.050
I've got no concatenation in here.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.540
And over here,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.680
I've got it's trying to Can Katyn eight,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.420
something like it doesn't understand that this is not ah,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.990
constant.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.850
It's not a Ferriol.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.460
It doesn't know what this is yet and is trying to contaminate it with the rest of the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.910
sentence.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.850
This is several errors in one.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.930
So what do we do?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.250
This is called escaping.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.160
So when we have quotations on the outside quotations on the inside,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.650
as you can see in the title up here,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.450
all you do is put a backslash in front of it.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.540
Save it and there we go.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.920
It works.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.020
That backs natural natural.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.530
Because all that backsplashes saying this thing right here,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.350
it's saying,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.510
Render this as normal.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.980
Don't think of this as a program in quotation.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.950
Think of this as a sentence quotation to display,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.200
and likewise,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.950
we can do the same thing with a regular quote.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.800
So I just selected all of those and I've replaced those with regular quotes or apostrophes

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.950
and hold on one second.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800
Let's go ahead and copy that in there.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.620
So there's some formality.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.500
Some formatting rather not formality.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.350
Do or do not.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.870
There is no try again.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.580
Quotations work.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.480
Now you can also use the opposites in here.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.270
You don't have to stick with the same one so you could use quotations in here and

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.950
apostrophes on the outside That would work absolutely.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.710
And once I can listen to make some room to breathe,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.680
your PHP give us unlimited white space,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.120
meaning that it doesn't charge us.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.160
It doesn't cost us extra toe have white space.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.290
So I prefer to have some of it little more open just for legibility purposes.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.190
Okay,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.280
so this one worked as well.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.310
So I've got the apostrophe on the outside and I've got a quote on the inside that works.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.650
And the exact opposite of that will work as well.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.820
Now,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.850
why is this important?

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.990
Because if we said do or do not try and let's say his efforts at this and as his name,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.650
because I'm using the wrong type of quote in here.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.590
So now I have to do one of two things I needed to contaminate this.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.440
Make this little smaller.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.070
You can see it again.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.350
I need to Cat needs this.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.490
Now.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.850
This is starting to look a little bit messy.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.150
But if I refresh Issa Zephyr or I'm not do that,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.950
I can swap out the apostrophes for quotations.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.590
See how long it took me to do that?

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.550
That kind of sucks having to do that a lot is not fun work,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.770
or I can use thes types of quotes inside where I'm escaping them.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.090
Remember,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.150
that's called escaping Save and networks.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.790
So That's the difference between basically your quotations in your apostrophes.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.990
Now your task for this lesson is very,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.230
very,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.840
very simple.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.650
Don't worry about all this other stuff that I did.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.340
Just do the 1st 2 just right.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.050
These two sentences out my cat name that there's not even a thing.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.250
It's my cat's name.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:43.140
My cat's name is and then I want you to use this sentence with regular apostrophes and use

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.190
the other one with regular quotations and notice the difference.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.210
Now,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.540
the reason we're learning this one is because in the future you're going to stumbling on

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.210
something like this.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.090
Like why?

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.920
Why is my variable name actually showing up and why is the variable value not showing up?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.250
This is why this is the only reason that this will ever happen to you.
