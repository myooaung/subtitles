00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
Hey there,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.760
boys and girls.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.970
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.780
programmers of every variety.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.610
And this lesson,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
we're gonna talk about how to mix html and PHP.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.920
Now,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.450
we've seen it a little bit up until now,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.250
and this lesson should be fairly short because we've actually done it a few times.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.580
So when were mixing HTML and PHP?

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.200
Remember,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.020
you've got index dot PHP file has to be dot PHP It's not dot html not dot txt not dot Js

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.960
Not anything like that.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.520
It's dot PHP file is always dot PHP Forgive the typos.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.980
I'm standing a little bit away from the mic just so that you don't hear the tech attack

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.190
attack of the keyboard all the time or the fan of the computer.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.240
So the PHP file always ends in a PHP dot PHP.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.530
You know that we've been doing this for,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.860
like,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.480
seemingly 14 lessons already,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.680
But if we want to make some html in PHP,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.320
all we have to do is echo Echo H one.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.750
This is a church one close H one,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.810
close my PHP.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.440
Save it Cool.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.060
H one.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.950
What if I want h 20 k?

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250
Was it a copy and paste this entire line.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.620
And did you do select all three of those and do a church to save that refresh?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.750
Look H two,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.320
By the way,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.550
how I did that in sublime.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.780
I just liked my tax and hit command D or controlled D,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.950
and it will just select the next one of that type.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.320
So if I select H one command or control D,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.270
it looks like the next one or this one.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.340
It'll suck the next one as well,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.810
and I could type in two places.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.600
Now let's get a little bit more creative.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.710
Let's do echo Div style border one pixel solid red.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.150
True to do,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.080
close that tag.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.420
And in here don't report that in dense.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.020
Remember,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.990
PHP gives you all the white space in the world so you can use as many indentations as you

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.350
want.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.340
I would suggest you would ever make sense to you for right now so that your code stays nice

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.680
and clean.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.150
Makes it easy for you to read Echo.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Hello to make this look absolutely terrible.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.150
And there we go.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.010
Now,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.050
we've got some CSS in there,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.350
too.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.830
But you know what?

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.580
Maybe maybe let's not do that.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.920
Let's do something a little bit different.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.940
Let's do make a bunch of space here.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.360
Get that off the screen and let's type regular HTML because right now we've done PHP with

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.430
HTML in strings.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.370
But let's through the other way around.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.350
Let's to h e mail with PHP inside of it.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.140
And let's create a variable appear called name is equal to Caleb and in my h one I type Ph

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.650
b Echo name,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.800
say that refresh.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.970
But,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.790
uh,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.350
just like that and that's actually name in there so we actually see what we're looking at.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.400
So now we have HTML some or HTML.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.590
We've got some PHP with a variable that's referencing a variable that was made outside of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.960
this current PHP tag.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.550
By the way,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.170
this was made up here.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.350
So this PHP tag closes this code up here,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.550
and it was still accessible later on,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.310
as long as it's on,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.170
the same page is completely accessible and then some closing html.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.690
So that's really all there is to it.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.320
Now,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.570
if you want to do a task for this one,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.430
this one is totally optional because we've already done this a number of times.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.080
But I would suggest creates an H one tag or a div with some style,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.760
uh,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.190
do any sort of html CSS mix that you want and throw some PHP inside of it,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.180
just like you would build a regular website.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.320
You know something along the lines of this?

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.750
Let's do this style,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.130
that's you.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.190
Background color whips,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.850
color read and hello.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.370
So regular a she male regular CSS Nothing fancy.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.280
You should be fairly familiar with that by now that go name,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.250
and that's just going to say,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.900
Caleb in there.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.160
And Tut uh,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.670
we're already familiar with that.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.390
So go ahead,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.200
give that a shot,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.450
mix and match things.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.510
You don't need to worry too much about how this works,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.210
because over time this just makes perfect sense,

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:25.650
because now you're mixing html with possibly in line CSS and PHP.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.860
I mean,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.090
if you really wanted to in your page,

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.050
you could even type.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.250
Let's not do it there cause that's messy.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.020
Let's do it here script,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.240
and you could do like an alert.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.190
If you're familiar with JavaScript Now,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.630
I've got PHP inside of my JavaScript on the refresh The page did.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.060
Ah,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.060
it says my name and the code for this,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.850
by the way,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.550
looks as expected.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.980
Google.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.780
So maybe go practice.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.650
That maybe not really depends on how comfortable you are with this concept right now.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.170
If you're comfortable,

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.780
let's move on.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.420
If you want some practice Cool,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.900
guess what?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.300
These videos aren't going anywhere,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.620
so feel free to pause or to stop where you are.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.390
A little bit of practice underneath your belt.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.050
And when you're ready in your own time,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.550
feel free to head on over to the next video and I'll be waiting free over there.
