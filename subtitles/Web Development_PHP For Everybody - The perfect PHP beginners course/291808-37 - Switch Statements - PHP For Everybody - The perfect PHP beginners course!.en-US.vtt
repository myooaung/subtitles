00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850
Okay.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.710
Hello.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.820
The last thing we need to know about if else if else statements in PHP is that there is

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.150
technically a faster way and they're called switch statements and a switch statement,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.750
very simply put,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.040
is a faster way to write and if else,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.270
if else statement.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.710
But this syntax,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.600
the way it looks,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.000
is very different.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.080
It's not just if,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.750
ah,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.800
can I auto feel this if bam condition otherwise And it didn't,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.310
uh,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.940
else else,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.610
if otherwise else.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.740
It's not quite like that.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.520
Very similar.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.760
I'm gonna comment this out so we can see the difference in just a little bit and said,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.850
What we want here is color is equal to Brown.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.350
Let's write a switch statement.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.670
So what we're doing here is we're switching the color statement.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.660
All we're saying is,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.060
whenever this switches Chuck So we say if the case is brown and these air fairly exact you

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.060
,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.620
so these don't get too complicated.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.260
Nor should they.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.010
These air just very quick ways of writing.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.560
If else if else statements,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.050
you could say echo color is brown.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.750
Um,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.260
break default Eco.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.270
No color is presented or supported,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.130
I guess would be a better word supported Break bam!

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.570
Just like that.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.550
So we've got a switch statement?

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.370
No,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.050
for this one,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.860
it's odd.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.110
Um,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.250
I'll give you that.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.450
So this one says,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.020
basically,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.670
the if else statement is based purely on one variable and that one is the color Now,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.250
If that color is brown,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.310
well,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.510
say that the color is brown and end your statement.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.650
Otherwise,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.240
if you don't add that break in there,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.960
watch this.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.470
It says both of them.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.320
Color is brown,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.010
and color is,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.440
uh,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.180
due to do not supported typo in their type over lack of typo.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.550
Anyway,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.030
now you can also do multiple cases if you wanted to.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.770
So let's just put that break in there so that it only ever supports Brown.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:26.920
But let's say we wanted to support Red Case Blue and case yellow echo cool colors.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.300
Bra color is brown.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.970
We know that already,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.250
But what if we change it to read cool colors bra?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.610
Because it is executing color red?

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.790
What about blue?

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.580
It's gonna do the same thing.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.880
Cool colors,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.830
breath because it's blue and if we said yellow when it's going to the same thing.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.350
But let's say yellow had a typo There's two W's in there,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.580
says Color is not supported.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.300
So it didn't match this because there was a typo.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.630
It did not match brown,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.930
and it fell back as the Elsa statement.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.040
It fell back to.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.980
No color is not supported.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.280
This color is not supported for a double typo and a double loss on that one.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.230
Now that is literally all there is to it now.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.080
This is the exact same as writing,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.890
and I'll write it down here,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.620
Middle commented out when I'm done,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.450
and I'll keep that in the code so you guys can reference it later if your color is equal to

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.340
read else.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:43.490
If your color is equal to blue else if your color is equal to yellow else.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.500
If your color is equal to brown,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.160
you see how how this is taking me a while to write else.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.240
Eco.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.930
No color.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.330
Now I can go and copy these in here and Bam,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.980
bam,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.430
bam!

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.940
And invent all of these that are out.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.600
Dende all of these at same time and copy the Brown went in here and that was a lot of work

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.590
for very little output.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.480
And now when we change the color.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.850
It's always going to be the exact same two sentences over here.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.710
Now,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.850
if we look at this and feel free to add some extra space in here,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.370
which one looks cleaner?

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.250
Does this one look cleaner or does this one look cleaner?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.200
I mean,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.430
if you've got a simple if else statement where you're just checking the colors or if you're

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.480
just checking Ah,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.920
Boolean while billions probably a switch statement is overkill for a Boolean,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.240
or if you're checking something that could have multiple,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.800
um,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.490
if else statements a switch statement might be for you.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.700
Now there's one other thing that we didn't talk about that we've sort of brought up in.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.010
This one is multiple cases,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.390
so this one supports red,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.220
blue and yellow.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.140
Where is down here?

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.300
This one supports red or blue or yellow or brown.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.760
We can actually also do the or statements and or comparison using to pipe signs.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.870
So these are not the letter l not l.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.970
It's not l.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.950
It's not I.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.150
It's not capital I.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.250
Those air pipes usually found above your return key above your n tricky,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.740
and this means,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.680
or you can also write,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.170
or depending if you have deciding enabled in your PHP.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.800
Um,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.850
but generally you're going to see the two pipes as the or so if the color is red or color

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:38.150
is equal to blue or new or color is equal to yellow.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.850
And now here it of blue and yellow.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.050
And this looks better.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.760
But now I've got this really long if statement in here.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.550
So let's go and sort these out of it.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.650
Something like that.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.980
But I mean,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.750
that still looks a lot harder to read than this one.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.290
This one is literally You can read it.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.020
Switch the color out if the color is red,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.420
blue or yellow echo cool colors brought in here it's it's the same thing.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.230
It just looks messier,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.710
that's all.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.490
So that's a switch statement.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.560
Now I'm gonna show you one more cool example of where you can actually use a switch

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.230
statement and let's do this Color is equal to we're going to use a super global variable

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.990
called Color.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.850
We want to support only a few colors in this example.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.100
Okay,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.120
so if the color is equal to read,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.840
um,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.260
cool,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.500
we don't have to do anything.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.860
All we're gonna say is it could be red,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.690
blue or yellow.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.640
If it's brown,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.420
you know what actually changed that color?

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.430
So that is not brown.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.150
We don't want Brown.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.270
Let's say we just want to support black and echo.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.750
The default color would be in here,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.750
and that default color could be Let's go with green.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.770
So the reason I left this blanking here is because color is already set to something that

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.170
we like.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.760
We know that the color is is either set to red,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.750
blue or yellow,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.150
which is the equivalent of saying color is equal to get color,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.550
which is up here.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.020
We're just leaving.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.750
That commented out for now.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.710
Okay,

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.340
clean that up and let's add something to our You are all in here.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.720
So we go.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.850
Color is equal to blue.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.850
Nothing's gonna happen because I broke something somewhere right there.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.090
Okay,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.960
so nothing happens because guess what?

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.270
We haven't done anything.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.300
Echo color is the color.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.060
Blue is the color right now.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.150
If we said,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.100
uh,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.020
brown right up here,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.850
it says brown.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.410
But in here says black.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.950
And that's because this was the equivalent of saying Brown.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.280
And it checked for Brown.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.500
It matched and said actually know what override that color with black.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.510
That's all I did.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.630
So no,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.150
let's take a look at how this can actually affect our page.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:08:01.450
Let's create some HTML and inject our new PHP inside of it.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.020
So we've got a logic up here and down here.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.710
We've got more code,

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.220
and this one is just basic HTML and stuff.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.550
So do Div.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.790
Style is equal to background color,

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.010
whatever that color is.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.010
PHP echo color three.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.910
Black broom brown actually can't be brown,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.680
black,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.130
yellow,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.200
blue read or the default would be green.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.460
Color is white,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.700
so the text color is white.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:40.320
Height is equal to 300 pixels with is 100% and padding is equal 200 pixels.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.480
So this is gonna look pretty gross.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.670
But here's a good example,

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:48.950
and the color is actually the background color is.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:54.550
And so now we're actually mixing or h email and our PHP together.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.150
And this one says the background color is black.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.970
What about blue?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.280
What about red?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:09.410
What about Ah and unsupported color was put in pink and a defaults degree,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.510
And so now we have our page actually being fully dynamic based on a switch statement based

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.110
on something in the U.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.250
S.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.480
Also,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.780
now where a page is fully dynamic Now,

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.280
this is not actually super useful example or an experiment,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.950
because generally you're not going to do little things like this.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.410
Instead,

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.000
what you're going to do is you're going to say,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.220
if the page is the home page,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.720
include another file,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.190
and it will change everything on your page.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.850
It will change your dashboard,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.700
change your layout to change your header in your foot,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.920
or it'll do a bunch of things.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.930
Or if the pages,

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:47.350
um let's say the pages a blood post and you just want to see that one block post it can seo

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.480
that block post I d.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.150
I get it.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.680
I got it from yet searched the database for that,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.730
bring it back and put it all in.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.820
Here were this green boxes,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.650
and that is exactly how blog's work.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.030
So without actually using a database,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.510
you essentially know how a blawg now operates.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.110
And guess what.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.210
If the block post isn't found instead of color green,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.340
it'll say 404 page not found or go to the search page.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.050
Or maybe add some related articles or something like that.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.220
So there you go.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.920
That is the power behind switch.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.500
Ah,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.130
we used it in a cool little instance where you can change the color.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.560
I'm not gonna have this Lincoln here.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.490
I want you to actually read this again.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.390
Don't worry too much about what get is we're gonna talk about those later.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:39.250
Although I have a feeling that by now you have a pretty good idea of what get actually does

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:39.250
.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.050
And what I would like you to do for your task is I would like you to create a switch

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:44.470
statement.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.000
You do not have to use the get super global variable.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.280
You can use age.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.590
You could use a name so you could switch out people's names and give them different

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.140
greetings based on who they are.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.350
You could give it a sport.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.330
So if sport is hockey,

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.470
that could be your favorite sport.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.450
You could say hello.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.040
Hello,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.380
world.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.800
My favorite sport is hockey or basketball or different balls.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.650
You could say if the sport is,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:15.530
uh if the sport is something like hockey and don't ever forget that break statement.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.380
The break statement is very,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.050
very important.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:23.640
If the sport is hockey you could say Ball is equal to It's actually a puck.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.100
It's not a baseball or soccer ball or anything.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.240
And in here you could say Echo ball.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.260
And essentially,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.350
this is your first form of server side validation.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.100
What you're saying is it always has to be hockey blue,

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.360
yellow or brown,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.630
or it has to be whatever default you have said it to.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.200
Now it can't be anything else.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.720
And this is technically your first lesson on security as well.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.950
So we're learning a lot in this lesson.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.800
We've learned switch statements are faster for basic,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.760
if else statements we have learned how to integrate it into a page.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.770
We have learned that Ah blawg Post essentially work off of a switch statement at centrally

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:02.770
.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.640
I mean,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.350
the code is sometimes a little bit different,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.150
but the concept is the exact same,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.360
and you have learned that you can also write a bunch of code in here,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.000
close your PHP syntax and have it affect your page.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.090
So there you have it.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.090
Those air switch statements you are probably a pro at if else else if and switch statements

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.650
by now,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.020
and at this point I would highly suggest.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.600
Ah,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.480
just building something small,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.590
Just a little dynamic page.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.510
So when someone enters their name in the URL,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.180
um,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.660
where it says color is equal to pink.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.060
You could be name is equal to,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.890
um,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.560
Jonathan And say,

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.110
if your name is Jonathan,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.850
greet them with a big smile.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.200
Or you could say,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.200
if the name is Jonathan in in here,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.450
you could echo big image or like actually an image tag.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.280
If you wanted to,

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.740
you could put a huge image in there something like that.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.020
So there you go.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.800
Have fun.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.310
And,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.560
ah,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.300
when you're all done that I don't know if the next video if you get stuck here because this

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.220
was a surprisingly big video,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.100
I didn't plan it to be this big,

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.750
to be honest,

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.010
But if you get stuck here or if you have questions or you need some clarification,

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.350
head on over to the learning to code Facebook group were there to help.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.050
All right,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.350
See the next lesson
