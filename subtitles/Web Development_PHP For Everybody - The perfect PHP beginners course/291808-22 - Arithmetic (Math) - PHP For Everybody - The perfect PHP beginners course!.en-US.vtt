00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Okay.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:01.860
Hello.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.590
Welcome to another lesson on PHP.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.020
We're gonna be learning about arithmetic or as I like to call it,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.750
because why not math?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.820
Now,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.750
don't get scared.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.130
And don't get too excited because we're not going to be getting into anything super

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.710
complicated.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.930
We're not going to be getting into,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.750
uh,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.400
linear regressions or or calculus or anything like that.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.530
We're just going to be talking about how do we add minus subtract,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.520
divide and add exponents to something in PHP?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450
Because a lot of times we are going to be doing some basic math.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.430
For example,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.150
you're creating a dashboard and you want to see the number of users.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.610
And maybe you're doing a prediction thing where you want to see,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.450
um,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:01:01.850
where you have grown 50 users at 50 users per week and that grows by 10% This plus 10%

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.810
every week for four weeks or something like that.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.790
So that's not really advanced math.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.620
That's more advanced in what we're going to do in this lesson.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.550
But I'm gonna show you how to take care of all of that stuff.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.650
So that's just go ahead.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.250
A little break there,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.990
renamed the Back to math because that's where I like to go.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.350
Because arithmetic is that dashboard arithmetic is math.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.210
Open up my PHP syntax.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.580
Give me some space toe work.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.110
And if I said number is equal to 10 and I said,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.850
Echo number shows me 10.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.220
In fact,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.190
let's do something better.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.750
Let's do echo H four results.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.240
Okay,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.060
so we know the results are gonna be down below here Now,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.350
what happens if we want to add 10 to this number?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.500
Well,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.600
we could do number is equal to 10 whips,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.570
10 plus 10 and now we're going to get 20.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.870
But that's not useful because you don't you don't know where these 10 numbers are going to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.960
be.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.780
The whole idea behind programming is that your data becomes fluid.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.050
It becomes dynamic.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.210
If you already knew that your number was 10 plus 10 at all times,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.400
you would never actually need a programming language.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.220
You could simply write 20 on your page and get the exact same result,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.500
because that's never going to change.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.970
So what we need to do is we need to say,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.250
Here's our base number.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.670
We're gonna start with 10 and we're going to create a new variable called number using that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.240
base number.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.450
So base number plus 10.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.260
So we got a base number of 10 and now we've we're adding another 10.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.750
In fact,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.290
let's not do that so we don't get confused with that last example.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.320
Let's add 11.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.750
Now,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.750
this will say 21 refresh page and it says 21.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.550
Now why is that?

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.850
This here?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.820
See how these are referring back to each other?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.050
This is saying,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.930
basically,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.330
instead of based number in there,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.330
it's just saying 10.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.150
It's referring back to the value now in high school math.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.610
You're always told to,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.420
you know,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.660
do of this formula or something.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.350
Uh,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.920
and the teacher would always say something along lines off,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.510
find X,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.650
or find the value of why.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.840
And you were like,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.150
Why would I ever need to know this?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.610
Well,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.530
this is one of the times.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.870
Now,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.130
if you don't know if you don't remember how to do any of that two things.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.150
One Khan Academy is fantastic.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.440
If you're interested in the math,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.480
if you're not interested in math,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.030
don't worry about it,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.250
because this is actually super super easy to grasp.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.820
So now we have our base number.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.760
We've got a new number in here called number and always doing is adding 10 plus 11.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.510
And that's how we do our basic arithmetic.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.540
We just add a plus sign now to minus it.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.100
We get negative one because we're saying 10 minus 11 is going to be negative.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.030
One again.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.050
Basic math if we multiplied it.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.020
So the multiplication is the asterisk.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.090
So if you hit shift eight on most keyboards,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.550
you'll get that little asterisk sign.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.800
Ah,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.820
it's not the X.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.910
Don't don't confuse it with X when we write it on paper,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.540
multiplication is often X,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.250
but in computer programming we use an asterisk.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.610
So let's do this.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.150
Do 1.5 and that'll give us a float.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.170
And by afloat,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.450
I mean an integer 1.55 would give us afloat.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.750
So all this is doing is multiplying.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.950
10 by 1.55 gives us 15.5 C.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.420
You don't need to actually know this.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.840
You don't need to know the math.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.140
You don't need to know if if that answer is technically correct,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.910
you just need to know how to do the arithmetic operations.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.490
And let's divide this will give us a weird number there.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.970
You so 10 divided by 1.55 We get six point 4516129032 to 58 Pretty straightforward stuff

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.290
there.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.570
But if we wanted to exponents something so let's say 10 to the power of No,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.180
let's not do that.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.030
Let's do three because this will be easier to understand.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.650
I think 10 to the power of three we use to multiplication signs in a row.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.050
And let's do three.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.270
Oh,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.420
Page 500 on May didn't have my colon in their refreshed 27.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.250
How did that get?

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.840
27.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.160
Well,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.050
exponents are essentially you've got three times.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.650
Three times three.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.820
So three times three We know this is already three times three is nine times three and then

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.150
nine times three is 27.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.750
And that's how we got that exponents.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.140
So exponents is one of the harder ones.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.400
There's also another one in there called module ISS,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.210
and what module is is is the remainder.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.150
So you remember when you were doing math back in?

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.180
I don't know greed.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.620
Six ish,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.400
and it was,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.670
like 10 Divided by three gives us 3.3.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.890
But what is that remainder?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.430
And so it was like three goes into 10 3 times,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.600
with the remainder off one.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.850
How do we get that?

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.810
Remainder in programming and in most programming languages,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.060
this is the same for most programming languages.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.410
We use the percent sign.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.250
This is the module ist sign.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.930
So this is not the percent of something this is saying.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.690
Get the remainder of and now we see the remainder of that is three.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.990
So this is saying three goes into 10 three times,

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.950
which we already know that off the top of our heads.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.500
So 3699 out of 10.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.620
And then we invert that so we go or inverse that rather we go 10 minus nine is one.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.870
Now,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.000
if that was way too complicated,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.070
all you have to do is remember this little percent sign it'll do all that math for you.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.750
So that is arithmetic in PHP.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.450
So what I would like you to do is I like you too.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.150
Ad subtract,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.850
multiply.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.150
Divide.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:06.250
And I would also like you to add an exponents and a module ist,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.050
and I'll just throw that in here.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.750
Your task.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.780
Add,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.110
subtract,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.420
multiply,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.040
divide exponents and modulates.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.730
Um,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.650
print out those results to your page and see how they work.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.360
I think this will be fairly straightforward for pretty much everybody.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.990
Once you're done that well,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.350
head on over to the next lesson and ah,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.550
I'll see you over there.
