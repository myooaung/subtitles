00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
I'm going to teach you something that a lot of other PHP teachers tend to just totally

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.550
forget.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.830
And that is there are documentation for basically everything other.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.280
Any package you install any programming language you write.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.230
Basically,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.280
everything has some form of documentation.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.260
Now the documentation may be very scarce.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.510
It may not be very well written,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.450
but in the case of PHP,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.150
their documentation is actually very very.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.410
I guess strong is the word.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.430
I would use eso if you head on over to PHP dot net.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.130
You'll see a page that looks something along this I it's not,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.650
you know,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.710
I know it's not a good looking website by any means.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.220
Ah,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.050
lot of documentation,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.750
websites or not,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.040
but the power is not what it looks like.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.650
It's it's what is written on here.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.410
So throughout this course you're going to see a lot of functions,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.610
a lot of different things that I am using,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.180
and you may not totally fully understand what I'm doing or why I'm doing it or why I throw

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.920
in a certain parameter into a function.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.730
Caleb,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.650
what's a function?

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.900
Don't worry about that right now.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.650
If you weren't totally familiar with what a function is or what documentation is or any of

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.220
that stuff.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.740
That's a OK,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.840
because right now I'm just arming you with something that is going to help you a lot in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.250
future.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.580
So if you head on over to PHP dot net,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.480
you'll see a page like this and you can type in basically any function now for me.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.940
I'm going to just type in date because I know that this is a common function written in PHP

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.940
.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.340
Now,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.900
the search bar.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.480
You can see that there.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.260
73 results for functions,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.450
six results for classes and one result for extensions.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.700
We're going to ignore what extensions and classes are right now.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.670
And we're just going to go to date now in this page.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.450
And this is this is a page that you're going to reference a lot as a PHP developer.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.320
This is probably the most common page that you're going.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.980
Teoh,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.500
you're going to read in the documentation just because there are so many options and I'll

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.370
show you what I mean in just a moment.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.280
So on this page,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.390
we see date,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.740
we've got the date function in here again.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.650
If you don't know that is That's totally OK.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.650
I'm just setting you up for success right now.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.510
There are parameters in here,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.250
and these parameters take,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.040
I guess,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.060
is one parameter is is formats,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.220
and it takes a series of different formats.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.740
Little de capital de little J Lower L A Capital and Capital S W zed capital.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.650
W f I mean,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.240
this list goes on and on and on.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.450
And by no means will you ever have to remember all of this.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.290
This is absolutely insane.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.650
You don't have to remember that.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.050
And this is why the documentation exists.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.220
So what this lesson is all about is basically,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.980
if you ever get stuck writing PHP and you can't remember what rule exists or of certain

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.260
function or how variables look or what ah,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.450
class construct her looks like or what a constant looks like.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.300
Guess what?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.150
That's totally okay.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.440
Everything.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.350
I'm going to be teaching you in this course you confined in this documentation,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.060
it's just this course will lay it out a little nicer for you.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.940
In a way that doesn't seem so overwhelming.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.160
Because if you look on the right here,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.070
these are all the different date time functions like there are a lot of them.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.050
What do they all do?

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.550
Do you need all of them?

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.160
Is this the right way to do it?

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.090
Would you rather use a function or a class?

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.470
I mean,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.190
these are all questions that hopefully will be addressed to you in your mind that will be

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.200
answered for you.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.950
Throw it the rest of this course.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.590
But this last one right here is all about the documentation.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.050
So if you ever see me type something like this in PHP Echo Date,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.210
month,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.420
day,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.950
year.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.170
And you think,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.370
Well,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.180
I don't remember what m Day Watt m d Why is that?

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.840
Could be month,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.570
day year,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.250
obviously.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.130
But we don't know if that's going to be the number.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.610
Does that does a month numbers start with a zero,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.530
not start with zero.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.820
Does the day start with you?

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.660
Not start with zero.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.190
Is the wind just last two numbers?

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.650
Well,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.110
fits.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.650
Take this as an example and let's go take a look.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.920
So I had capital m little D capital.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.350
Why little d day of month.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.180
Two digits with leading zeros.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.040
So this would show 01 all the way to 31 it won't show one.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.070
It won't show to.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.720
It'll show 01 or zero to now let's look at month I wrote Capital M a short textual

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.860
representation of a month,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.600
Three letters.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.120
So this isn't even the full month.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.410
This isn't even the number the numeric value off the month this justice Jan Feb Maher Ah,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.890
a pr j u n for Joon jae ul for July D.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.990
C for December.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.290
Those short kind of those shorthand methods for months is what this would produce.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.720
And let's take a look at why I did capital.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.010
Why?

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.740
And this is a full numeric representation of a year.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.990
It's four full digits.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:13.680
So we see this would be like 1999 or 2018 or 2019 for 2020 if we did little why this would

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.920
just show the last two numbers.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.020
So this is why the documentation is really,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.790
really important,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.600
and this is why you need to be not familiar with the entire documentation.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.820
But you need to be familiar with the notion of I don't know everything,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.260
but I know where to go and find it,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.250
because that's the real power behind Web development,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.850
and I will let you in on a secret right now.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.460
No.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.770
Okay,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.990
look,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.150
don't give away the secret.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.300
So one thing that Web developers basically never,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.280
ever tell you and they never want to admit is they don't know everything.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.770
K a python developer doesn't know 100% of Python.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.360
It's It's just too large.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.170
Okay?

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.150
I am a really good PHP developer.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.150
I don't know,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.340
100% of PHP.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.920
I know a lot of it,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.150
but I certainly don't know 100% of it.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.110
If we looked through all of these functions,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.600
could I tell you off the top of my head what every single one of them does and all the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.260
parameters and what it returns?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.710
No.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.570
Absolutely not.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.420
And hey,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.120
surprise.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.750
That's totally okay.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.050
You don't have to know all of this.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.950
That's why the documentation exists.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.370
So what?

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.230
I would like you to do your task for this lesson,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.820
if you will,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.200
is open up PHP dot net and just type in dates.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.890
Go into the search bar type in date,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.000
click the 1st 1 or maybe go explore something else and just take a look at this page.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.930
This page,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.910
albeit this page is actually quite ugly.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.980
This page actually has a lot of information on it.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.920
You don't need to understand all of it.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.170
We're going to dig into this,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.940
I promise you.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.180
But you need to be familiar with the documentation.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.280
All right,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.650
That is it.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.680
I will see you in the next video.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.750
And don't forget,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.540
you don't need to know everything.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.850
That's why the doctor here.
