00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
All right,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.780
let's take a look at who uses PHP.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.450
Now.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.560
When you look at different programming languages,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.250
there's Ruby.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.160
There's python there.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.800
See?

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.580
Swift Scotland,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.460
Java PHP.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.220
You know you name it right.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.910
JavaScript is a huge one right now.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.150
And there are a lot of people in the world that say,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.280
Oh,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.620
you know,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.190
is PHP dying?

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.040
I guess I'm not saying they're asking that Is PHP going to die?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.660
Is is it a dying language?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.350
And there are people who say Yes,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.560
but that's because they simply don't know better.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.950
PHP is by far the world's most popular server side programming language.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.590
Now there are people who will disagree with you,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.200
but these people do not understand facts.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.850
OK,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.020
let's take a look at some facts now.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.790
We did a quick Google on,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.340
uh,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.230
what did I type in here?

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.850
I typed in,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.450
uh,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.840
who uses PHP,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.190
and I went to 1/4 answer and we have Facebook Wikipedia by do Yahoo.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.400
I mean,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.070
Yahoo is not really around anymore,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.620
cos sort of crumbled tumbler flicker WordPress,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.700
which is a huge one.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.560
This one runs over 27% off all the Web sites on the Internet.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.470
So basically one in four websites that you have visited are running on PHP.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.250
Actually,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.950
more than that,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.820
chances are you're using Facebook,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.270
or you might be using slack,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.420
which was built with PHP as well.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.220
Um,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.220
male chimp use it uses it.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.430
Ah,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.430
what's another big one here?

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.360
Dig uses it,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.750
although dig is not as popular as it once was.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.090
But these are still huge,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.010
huge companies that are using PHP.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.760
Now the big one.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.250
I want to focus on his WordPress.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.260
WordPress uses PHP.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.330
It's strictly PHP Drew.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.130
Pill and Juma also use PHP,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.080
so let's make a little this year.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.780
So we've wordpress websites which make up 27% of all websites,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.830
and that number is only growing.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.310
That number used to be 22% than it was 23 it just kept going up and up and up droop.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.500
Oh,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.200
now I don't I don't actually know how many sites are running.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.760
Drew Paul.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.310
Um,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.750
that stat has not been published as far as I'm aware anyways,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.250
but there are a lot of dribble sites out there.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.360
Jumla.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.010
Okay.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250
How many times a day do you go to Facebook?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.010
How many times a day,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.320
Do you?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.700
Slack?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.060
If you're in the tech industry,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.230
chances are you're using slack to communicate with your colleagues.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.560
Your co workers appears.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.300
If you have ever received a marketing email,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.250
chances are one of those emails,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.180
at least one of them,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.950
but probably like hundreds and hundreds of them have been from this company called Mail

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.090
Chimp Mail.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.690
Chimp uses PHP.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.850
That's a huge one.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.620
Okay,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.540
Wikipedia.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.650
We have all used Wikipedia.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.790
Wikipedia uses PHP.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.850
It was built in a time when PHP was all the rage and guess,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.080
but it still works.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.540
It is one of the top websites in the entire world.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.870
Facebook is also one of the top websites in the entire world.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.190
Both of them are running PHP.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.330
So when someone says you who's using Ph,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.800
we really tell me who who's using this?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.830
You say the biggest,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.060
most common websites in the world are using PHP Now.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.930
That is not to say that other languages are bad.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.550
Great.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.710
There are sites that use python.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.240
There are sites that use Java,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.280
their sites that use node.js,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.000
which is server side javascript.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.600
There are sites that will use Ruby and an example of these Python,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.480
YouTube,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.640
Jabba Amazon.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.150
No Js Netflix,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.650
Ruby get hub.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.480
So is it safe to say that you should be learning PHP?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.390
I would say absolutely yes if you are not learning PHP.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.830
Honestly,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.150
I think that is a huge mistake.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.360
Based purely on the number 27 27% of all websites run on PHP.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.530
Now that's not using Facebook or slack or mail chimp or any sort of a P I or doing anything

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.880
custom.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.770
That is purely based on the fact that more than one in four websites that you visit are

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.640
using PHP.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.130
Now.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.240
If you want a job,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.230
you have to go where the demand is and you always want to be in demand.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.760
So when there are inevitably,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.560
30% of all websites are using PHP,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.820
are there going to be more PHP jobs or they're going to be Mawr Python jobs?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.740
Economically speaking,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.520
there will always be more PHP jobs available for you just because the demand is higher,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.750
the use is higher.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.810
Will that change in the next 10 years?

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.690
Maybe.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.230
Who knows?

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.570
But it hasn't changed in the last 15 almost 20 years,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.370
and it's unlikely to change any time soon,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.640
so learning PHP is a really,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.320
really good idea and getting people involved to learn PHP is also good idea because you

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.430
don't have to learn alone.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.880
You can also use our Facebook group called Learning to Code to ask for questions to,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.580
ah,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.290
look over to piers to see what they're building to get help from everybody,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.180
including myself.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.010
Ask questions,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.800
get involved.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.600
It makes learning anything a lot easier.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.130
So in summary,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.960
when someone asks you who uses PHP,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.620
you can say at least one of these guys.
