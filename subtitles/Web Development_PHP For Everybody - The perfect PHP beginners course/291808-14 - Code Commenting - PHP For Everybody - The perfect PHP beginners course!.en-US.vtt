00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Hey there.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.540
It looks like I haven't lost you yet.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.310
That's good news in this lesson.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.550
Let's talk about comments now when you begin to create bigger programs and bigger websites

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:13.550
,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.900
eventually you're going to have ah,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.810
lot of code.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.850
We're not talking hundreds of lions.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.300
We're not talking thousands.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.870
You might have tens of thousands.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.010
And if you're using third party packages,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.520
you might have millions of lines of code to deal with.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.750
And how do you read all of that code?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.990
Well,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.770
you can't just open up someone source code or 10,000 lines of code and start reading

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.390
through it because that's gonna take you forever.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.160
And then you gotta figure out what everything does not.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.240
No,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.450
no,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.670
that's no way to live your life.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.880
So what you want to do here is add comments to your code and a comment can come in three

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.600
different forms in PHP.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.850
Now the 1st 1 is just like this.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060
This is a title,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.080
and when I save and refresh the page,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.760
nothing shows up.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.950
And when I view the source,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.850
it still only says H one comments close H one.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.850
So what this does essentially is nothing now.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.540
PHP has this cool little rule where you have all the white space in the world where you can

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.530
literally use 1000 lines in your in your in your source code in this index dot PHP file and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.900
it's not going to make any difference.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.570
I'm going to refresh the source.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.040
Look at that.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.570
It's still only shows one line,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.500
and that's because it is considering everything in here to be one line.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.410
Well,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.520
one line of HTML,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.450
it's actually multiple lines of PHP.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.130
No,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.950
I was gonna do that.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.740
Clean that up a bit.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.430
So this is a comment.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.240
The first style starts with a number side or,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.750
you know,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.440
as you're probably familiar with this looks a lot like a hashtag.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.180
So this is not technically the proper term.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.750
But I'm gonna call this a hashtag comment.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.460
Now.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.560
There's another kind,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:05.850
and it's the double slash so we can write Echo test test comment,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.180
and this one will comment out anything to the right of it.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.450
So and you can see all my comments or blue,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.950
by the way,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.840
if I comment out this and refresh my page,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.100
we're just looking at the source here,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.990
but I can refresh the regular page for you,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.250
too.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.450
Nothing has changed,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.890
and that's because all of this has commented out.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.450
But if we remove this one,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.420
there we go.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.540
We can see that test is in there.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.910
And when I refresh the page,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.390
we can see that test comes after comments now as a little refresher.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.860
If you're not totally familiar with HTML,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.320
that's okay.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.680
This is not an HTML course.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.610
But if you're wondering Caleb,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.230
why does comments show up at the top and test shows up underneath?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.040
But in the source code there,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.650
side by side?

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.370
Well,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.200
that's because H one is called a block element,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.210
doing air quotes here,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.250
block element.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.840
And that means it's going to take up this entire section here,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.480
this whole section and anything any other HTML comes after it gets knocked down underneath

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.650
it.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.950
All right,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.200
let's get back to the PHP now,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.400
I said.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.150
There's three kinds.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.410
Let's look at number three.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.340
Number three is a multi line comment,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.010
so this will only ever comment one line.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.180
Oh,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.760
by the way,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.710
we can also comment the entire line using the hashtag comment.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.620
If we put the comment at the beginning of our code Not gonna do that,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.770
cause Well,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.950
I think you get it by now.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.820
Now,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.850
let's say we have another line in here.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.850
My name is Caleb.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.770
Save Refresh.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.430
It says test.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.270
My name is Caleb.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.950
And what if I want to comment out one of these lines?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.620
Well,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.190
we know we can use the hash tag one we know we can use the double slash one,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.270
but if I wanted to come out Oh,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.700
comment.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.860
Oh,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.500
both of these.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.150
I could actually do both.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.030
I could just use the hashtag one or or a double line and Kuala they go away.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.540
But again,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.550
that's no way to live your life.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.290
Because if you have 100 lines of code that you just want to comment Oh,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.710
because you're debugging something you want to use the slash asterisk and you can see that

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.320
it turned all of my code blue.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.910
And if I save and refresh,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.650
nothing shows up at all.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.350
But if there's something else in your let's let's say,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.690
Hey,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.080
guys,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.130
I want hey,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.400
guys,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.250
to show up in here,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.250
display me.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.850
Refresh the page.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.630
Yeah,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.450
it's not showing up.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.250
It's not showing up in her source code.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.650
either.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.090
The problem is because this is a multi line comment and we can close it with an asterisk

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.720
slash.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.980
So the way we open it,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.010
it's the exact opposite.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.930
A lot like how we open PHP with something that looks like this and we close it with the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.550
opposite.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.910
We opened a multi line comment with slash asterisk and we close it with asterisk slash.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.050
So now when I save and refresh the page there we go test and my name is Caleb does not show

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.750
up at all.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.500
But we have comments and we have Hey,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.760
guys,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.640
display me now.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:22.020
Your task for this lesson is to echo 345 lines of text.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.820
It could be anything you can't say Hello World exit comments.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.000
You could put some HTML in there,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.440
and you could experiment with that if you like,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.410
But I want you to comment one of your lines with this hashtag comment.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.250
I want you to comment out another one using the double slash comment,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.750
and then I want you to comment out one or more lines using the multi line comment.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.090
So once you're done being a pro with these three different kinds of comments,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.950
let's head over to that next video
