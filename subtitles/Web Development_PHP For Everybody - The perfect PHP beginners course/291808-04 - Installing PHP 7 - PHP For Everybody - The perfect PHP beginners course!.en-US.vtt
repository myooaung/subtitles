00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
Okay.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.990
How low in this lesson,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.000
we need to learn how to install PHP.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.580
Now there's good news and there's bad news depending on which operating system you're using

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.580
.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.470
If you're using a Mac like a Mac book,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.750
which I'm currently using,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.400
by the way it does not matter what operating system you're using.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.540
You do not need to buy a Mac.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.710
I get this question all the time.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.520
You do not need Lennix.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.660
You do not need windows.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.570
You just need a operating system.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.630
So whether you're using Windows,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.470
Mac or Linux is totally fine.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.670
There are options for you,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.610
but you need to install them.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.880
So what I was saying before was,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.260
when you buy a Mac book,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.330
PHP already comes on your computer.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.510
You might need to update.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.230
It might come with PHP 5.6,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.780
and in this course we're using PHP 5.6 is wrong.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.860
We're using PHP 7.0,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.160
although technically we are on PHP 7.2 right now.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.450
But I'm just in a use PHP seven just for the simplicity of it.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.170
Now,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.890
if PHP doesn't come on your computer or even if it does,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.280
you might want an easier way to manage your sites.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.080
It's not like reading an HTML CSS and JavaScript file,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.780
where you can just write thes these blobs of code and they just work.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.670
You actually need a server to run PHP now.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.260
To do that,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.600
we can head over to Apache friends dot or GTA slash download dot html,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.920
and it will give us options we can download.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.300
Zap.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.550
I actually spelt that wrong.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.070
We can down the exempt for windows for Lennox Ah,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.300
for Mac.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.980
Now,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.970
I am not going to use any of these.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270
I'm going to be used something called Docker.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.240
Now,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.560
if you really want to increase your PHP game,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.950
I would suggest using Docker,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.560
and I will provide the link to my doctor set up for this course so that you can use

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.750
everything that I'm using in one of my get hub repose.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.170
And ah,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.010
it's not currently up as I'm recording this,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.250
but I will go and make that repo in just a matter of moments right after this video and it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.970
will be called PHP Doctor or something to that effect so you can go to get hub dot com

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.150
slash Caleb tolling slash PHP dash doctor,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.280
and you will be able to get the doctor files,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.860
make files.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.120
Dr.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.760
Compose All that stuff that I'm using,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.630
I'll build a little.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.380
Read me in there.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.780
All right?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.670
A little read me in there on how to install it,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.770
if that is too much for you,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.920
and it's totally okay.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.880
If that is too much for you,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.340
then don't use Docker.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.830
I like Dr because basically,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.830
you can set up a small virtual operating system inside of your operating system and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.660
everything is completely contained.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.720
So nothing's going to leak into your actual system.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.010
So you're not bloating your operating system Now again,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.580
if that is too much for you,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.800
don't worry about it.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.780
Download Samp from Apache friends dot org's slash download dot html Again,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.670
whether you're on Windows,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.760
Linux or year on a Mac.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.750
That's cool.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.260
Download it,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.880
install it,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.620
get it running.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.830
It should be very,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.310
very easy.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.890
The version that you're gonna want is either version 77.1 or 7.2.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.800
Get the most recent one if you can get 7.2 or 7.3 is out,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.180
which it currently is not.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.740
But if while you're watching a 7.3 is owed.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.140
Maybe get that one instead.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.230
It's always best to stay up to date with these things.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.090
I'm just recording Petri 7.0 for the sake of being a little more backwards compatible for

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.490
people who might not have access to 7.1 or 7.2.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.000
So your task for this lesson is to head on over to Apache friends at orig.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.250
Download Samp.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.090
Um,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.840
if you're on Windows,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.140
there's another option called Wamp.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.230
It's basically the exact same thing for Windows,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.500
But if Sam I supported here,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.710
why not get it here and again,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.950
if you're feeling a little more confident and you don't want to use something as easy as

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.220
amping,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.430
you want to get a little more into develops down the road.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.820
If you're already familiar with some of that stuff and you might not be in again if you're

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.730
not familiar with that,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.560
it's OK.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.650
Don't feel overwhelmed.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.800
There's a lot of stuff you're going to learn in this course,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.850
but if you wanted to increase your game a bit,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.870
you can download Docker and Docker compose again.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.780
It will be in the Read me file in my get hub repository.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.050
And then you can install all of this via Docker.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.060
Otherwise,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.310
really,

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.860
all you need to do is get some sort of server set up.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.530
Zampa,

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.900
Wamp,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.230
Doctor,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.740
whatever.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.010
It just needs to run your pH.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.170
Me?

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.140
I don't I don't even care if you get from Apache friends are or have no association with

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.360
them.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.260
You can get it from literally anywhere.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.190
If you want to install it right on your operating system and do it all manually.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.850
By all means.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.450
Go for it.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.120
I just need you to be able to run PHP files on your local computer.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.250
Probably your laptop.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.090
Cool.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.290
So once you have all that set up and good to go head on over to the next video and we will

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.240
learn about what a PHP file actually is and how to execute it.
