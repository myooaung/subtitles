00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
Hello.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.360
Welcome back.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.770
This is just a Sam summary of everything that we've learned so far.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.690
Maybe not everything,

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.160
but ah good portion of what we learned so far.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.660
Um,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.010
and how you can apply it.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.740
So far in this course,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.040
we've actually learned a lot.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.210
So you've learned the most important parts of PHP.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.540
You know how to get around.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.720
You know how Teoh,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.030
right?

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.690
Variables,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.980
You know how to write comments.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.880
You know how to do things like unset a variable.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.570
So once it's set,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.150
you can unset it if you want to.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.620
Ah,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.750
you know about var dump or,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.200
um,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.050
print our print are are var dump depending on if you have X debug installed.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.320
Ah,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.560
you know about typecasting,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.970
which is a huge thing that most PHP Debs actually don't know about.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.290
Typecasting is incredibly important.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.130
Basic arithmetic Subasic Mass.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.800
Because we're programmers were not mathematicians.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
But we still need to do some basic math constants which are variables that you can not

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.180
change once they're set,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.020
they're set for life concatenation which is basically you write out a sentence and you add

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.090
more stuff to that sentence quotes first apostrophes where quotes in here.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.050
You can have a variable,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.970
and in here you cannot have a variable.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.260
You learned how to do string.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.450
Replace replacements.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.700
You learned about a raise?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.400
Um,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.820
you've learned that not only can and Arabi just one integer,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660
but it can also be an inter jury can have a list of floats.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.840
It can be all sorts of things.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.530
You can mix and match all of your variables and just makes a list of variables for you.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.050
And then you learned how to loop through all over those.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.990
Now you learn to vote.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.710
If statements else statements if else statements you've learned turn eri logic,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.140
which is crazy logic.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.530
So it's not just like if something is true,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.310
it's it's really what it comes down to is variable is equal to if something is to her if

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.730
something is true.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.810
Uh,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.220
10 right coronary logic.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.150
You've learned about that.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.460
You learned about implode and explode.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.300
So you basically you taken array and you imploded into one string or you take a string and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.730
you exploded into a bunch of different parts in an array again,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.020
while loops four loops for each loops.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.930
You've checked us to see if a variable is set or for variable is empty.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.970
And then you learn all about forms,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.720
which is by far the most important part of dynamic programming languages like peach.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.200
But you need to be able to accept that user input and customize their experience.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.150
Otherwise,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.470
really,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.750
you just have a static website.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.440
So you've learned all of this in what,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.690
a few hours and honestly,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.730
this is good enough to get you going on writing any sort of Petri that you need.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.040
Now,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.190
there are some other missing components such as functions,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.810
object orientated programming,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.180
name spacing,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.040
all that stuff gets quite advanced.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.060
But really,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.550
you have enough to pick up a PHP Web site and to figure out how things are working.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.610
So at this point in time,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.670
it would be safe for you to say that you are a PHP developer.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.750
I would say you are a junior level PHP developer and that you understand all this stuff now

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.750
.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.360
So with that said,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.490
I just want to give you a big congrats like,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.090
hey,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.480
you got through a lot of material very,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.550
very quickly and you now know things that you didn't know before.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.720
Now where do you go from here.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.010
Well,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.240
you can keep learning more PHP or if you're kind of second tired of PHP and you want to try

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.310
something else like Python,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.540
go take a python course.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.990
Because now that you know how wild statements work,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.120
you know how variables work.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.050
You know how lists or a raise work?

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.120
All that stuff is transferrable.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.460
You can learn python.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.300
You can like PHP,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.140
even learn node.js or just regular JavaScript because you have all that programming

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.950
fundamental inside of you.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.050
You understand it.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.870
But in my opinion,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.600
I would say,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.920
Ah,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.740
your best next step is to continue learning more PHP.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.030
You've already gotten through the hardest part,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.450
which is getting started and figuring out the fundamentals of it.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.760
After this,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.990
it's just really getting a little more complicated with things,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.530
making things easier,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.120
learning how to write code once instead of having to write it two or three or four times

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.410
over and over and over again.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.840
And then it's really just bundling that code into nice little packages where basically,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.880
you can ship it and send it to someone else,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.450
and they can use your code flawlessly in their application as well.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.940
So I would suggest Keep learning PHP because you're already here.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.200
But if you wanted to,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.150
you could pick up a python.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.830
You could pick up JavaScript or node.js,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.310
um,

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.870
or Ruby,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.580
Because again,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.610
you know all the programming fundamentals.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.760
So again,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.460
congrats.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.070
You got through a lot of stuff on.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.580
And I really hope to see you in one of my other courses.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.880
Possibly my JavaScript essentials course,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.250
which is a huge favorable course amongst the JavaScript developer community.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.740
But if I don't see you there,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.280
I wish you the best of luck.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.760
Um,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.660
and don't forget,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.520
you can join our Facebook learning to code group where not only do we help with just PHP,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.610
but also python and A S P and Java and C plus plus,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.150
um,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.120
android systems,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.050
IOS systems,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.440
all sorts of questions.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.240
And there are tons of javascript as well.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.630
We're happy to help.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.150
We're happy to help.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.240
We've got thousands and thousands of developers.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.750
Ah,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.250
and we can answer basically any question that you have.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.270
So again,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.010
congrats.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.760
And I look forward to seeing you either in the next module or in another course,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.790
or just in the Facebook group just kicking around
