00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
Hello.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.300
Welcome back.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.990
In the last lesson,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.040
we talked a boat.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.490
If statements we learned a boat,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.620
if statements and condition ALS and greater than and less than a greater than or equal to

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.150
or less than and equal to the two equal signs at all that stuff.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.250
But what happens if we want to excuse him code when something is false?

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.890
Now,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.510
remember,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.740
if this section in here world his daughter is true,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.250
it will execute the code in here.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.610
But if we want to execute something that isn't true in any other situation,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.760
we can write some code in here,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.980
and this is this intact.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.090
We write else,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.210
and it just attach is right onto this last curly bracket.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.520
Here,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.990
Ellis opening curly bracket,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.740
Your code closing curly bracket.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.590
Literally.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.150
That's it.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.800
Now,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.390
if you wanted to,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.410
you could theoretically turn the video off right now.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.040
And you are good to go.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.700
But if you're not comfortable with that,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.740
let's learn about this so age again.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.610
We're just using a very,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.600
very simple,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660
simple conditional here.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.210
Okay,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.920
if age is equal to 18 um,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.270
actually,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.830
let's not do 18 because that seems limiting for,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.270
uh,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.720
examples.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.080
Ages 18 or older than you can vote,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.650
you can vote.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.450
You can also be drafted.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.340
You know,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.850
if you live in a country that supports drafting,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.570
All right,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.250
So if your age is greater than 18 echo,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.050
you can vote.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.410
But what if your age is not greater than or equal to 18?

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.570
What if your age is less than 18?

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.450
You are a child,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.050
maybe not a child that seems sort of offensive,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.370
but you are definitely you are young still.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.850
Now when we run this,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.150
this is going to say you can vote.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.810
Why?

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.860
Because age is greater than or equal to 18 again.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.670
This is equal to,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.390
ah,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.920
the computer,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.560
thinking that 18 is greater than or equal to 18.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.480
It's not greater than,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.770
but it is equal to 18.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.530
Let's undo that.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.680
And let's change that age,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.250
too.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.250
12.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.510
Okay,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.720
so my ages 12 now,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570
And when I refresh this page,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.350
it's not going to say I can vote because that's inaccurate Again.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.470
If we just replaced this with 12 is 12 greater than or equal to 18?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.820
No,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.530
absolutely not.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.350
It's it can't ever be anything other than 12.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.180
So if if we're avoiding age,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.200
say we can vote otherwise say we're still young and boom!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.160
It says we're still young.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.370
It doesn't care if the ages 123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 or 17.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.380
All the or any negative numbers all it cares about is that it is less than 18.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.940
Now,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.210
this is the equivalent of saying if your age is less than 18 echo you whips,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.340
you are still young.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.810
You are young still,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.690
you were still young.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.240
There we go.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.680
They both show up because this one was true.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.020
Your age is less than 18.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.150
It executed this.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.240
This one was not true.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.400
Your age is not greater than 18.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.330
It did not execute this.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.050
What it did was it said ok,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.080
that's not right.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.450
Execute this other block of code in here.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.390
And so now we're dealing with a false ID.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.050
So this one false.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:30.050
But this one is true and this one is the opposite of true a que false.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.880
Now that's all there is to an else statement.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.730
In the next lesson,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.980
we're going to learn about else if statements which basically lets us right more of these

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.310
and If nothing is met,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.050
then we can run an else statement.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.130
But just so you know,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.900
the else statement is completely optional.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.920
You do not need it.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.810
It is not required for an if statement to work.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.050
All you need is the if statement.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.600
So your task for this lesson is to create an if else statement.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.330
Keep it simple.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.670
Remember,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.060
don't make it complicated.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.350
Don't confuse yourself.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.290
Don't get overwhelmed.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.070
There's a lot of time to learn this.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.710
And again,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.360
you're going to be writing so many of these in the future.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.030
That this is just going to become a second sort of nature for you is going to become very,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.910
very easy.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.150
So don't worry about mastering this part right now.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.750
So your task create an if statement and then create an else statement.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.530
And I want that l statement code to actually execute the if statement should be ignored.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.680
But the else statement should execute.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.000
Once you've done that,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.680
let's head on over to the next lesson.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.750
We'll talk about else if statements
