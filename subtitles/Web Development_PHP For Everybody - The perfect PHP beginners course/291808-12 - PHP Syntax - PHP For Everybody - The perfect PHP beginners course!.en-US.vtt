00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
welcome to your first PHP lesson.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.000
Everything else was just getting ready.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.340
Setting you up for success,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.480
getting PHP actually installed on your on your hide,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.850
Not your website on your laptop or on your desktop.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.730
And if you've made it this far,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.010
Well,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.050
this is where the fun starts.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.820
In this lesson,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.030
we're going to learn what the PHP syntax,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.750
actually.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.420
Well,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.800
looks like what?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.950
The syntax.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.030
Hey,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.060
that's great question.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.150
What is the syntax?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.400
Okay,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.710
well,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.150
a syntax is how a programming language is actually read by the computer.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.920
So in PHP,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.810
there's two things to know PHP always opens with.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.580
Well,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.500
it looks like this.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.440
And let's just take that a little bit slower.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.500
So you've got your So you've got your less than sign,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.790
and then you've got a question mark,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.450
and then you just type PHP.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.380
You can see my auto complete thinks that there is a lot more in ad there.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.130
There actually isn't and wallah,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.980
you have started writing PHP.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.420
Next thing to know is,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.110
any time you echo something to the page,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.830
you need to encapsulate it or basically put ah,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.850
quotation or an apostrophe around it.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.580
So what?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.700
That looks like is.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.120
I'm going to use a quotation here and there is a difference between quotations and

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.870
apostrophes.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.460
But don't worry about that right now.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.830
I have a lesson plan for that a little bit later.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.820
So if we just write echo quotation and so I'm using sublime,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.330
by the way.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.260
And as soon as I opened,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.230
one quote is automatically puts another one at the end.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.250
Your editor may or may not do that.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.750
C type echo.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.310
Hello,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.150
world.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.980
I ended with my quotation That was actually a poor highlighting job.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.320
So I've got my quotation at the end and I've also got a quotation.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.310
You can see it at the start and it always ends with a semi colon.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.240
All your PHP lines need to end with a semi colon.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.010
Your line can be as long as you want.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.980
It could be 300 characters long,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.800
if you really want.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.150
I would prefer if you didn't do that and PHP while it's being read by the computer by your

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.650
server,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.060
your server is thinking.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.520
Okay,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.780
well,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.180
this is all one long line.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.870
I'm going to execute this all is one command until I see that semi colon.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.270
If you don't put a semicolon.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.930
PHP has no idea what to do,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.750
and you will see errors.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.890
So always put that semicolon at the end.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.120
Next,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.280
we have variables.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.500
Now,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.590
if you're familiar with any other programming language,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.030
you're probably familiar with the concept of variables.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.510
Now,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.170
if you're not familiar with variable,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.480
well,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.970
that's okay.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.480
Just think back to high school math.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.130
Don't worry.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.250
We're not doing high school math.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.030
But think back to high school math.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.840
When you are a teacher,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.510
would be like Here's this algebraic equation and you have to basically reduce this equation

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.700
so you can find X.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.560
Remember your math teacher always saying,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.780
Find X grow.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.380
We're not gonna find X,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.880
but that's what the variable is.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.760
X is a variable,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.180
and it's a lot easier to do in programming that it is to do in high school Math.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.800
So very well always starts with a dollar sign in PHP.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.450
It never starts with a number.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.950
It can start with an underscore,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.050
but it should always start with a letter.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.870
So no special symbols,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.650
nothing like that.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.180
And you can see that I type this name that's a regular variable is equal to,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.050
and my name is Caleb.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.210
So to assign that variable is an equal sign and we'll get into variables.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.690
I promise you,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.690
this gets a lot easier.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.300
We're just quickly running through this very,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.890
very quickly.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.480
This is the data that it's supposed to echo,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.050
not echo the store.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.650
Echo is a little bit later.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.330
Ah,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.600
and then we finish that line with a semicolon,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.660
not a regular colon.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.750
A semi colon.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.470
Now you know what a variable looks like in PHP.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.280
If I wanted to echo that variable,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.550
I would echo name something like that.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.750
And while you're echoing things,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.040
this is the power behind PHP.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.550
This is the true power behind PHP is.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.090
You can write all sorts of HTML within pH.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.750
But you can make your website completely dynamic this way.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.950
So I'm going to write h one and echo my name.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.250
And then I'm going to close my h one tag and that's it.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.610
So my page will now say,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.940
Hello,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.300
world.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.560
There's a variable named Caleb is going to open an H one and close an H one and inside of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.050
it's going to say name now to close my script,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.470
I type question mark greater than symbol,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.800
basically the opposite of this and my script is complete.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.460
So now I can save this.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.960
And this is what the page looks like before anything happened.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.450
I'm going to refresh the page and we're going to see Hello World and Caleb.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.650
Now let's take a look at the source.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.540
It says Hello,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.300
World H one Caleb H.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.550
One,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.880
just like our code says hello,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.460
World H one name,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.010
which you can see is the variable.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.260
And my editor sublime is actually highlighting both of them is equal to Caleb.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.070
So Caleb gets injected into here and then close my h one tag,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.070
and that's a PHP script that is as easy as PHP gets.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.650
And ultimately,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.050
that's all there is to PHP.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.350
Now we're going to get into different kinds of variables and data types and functions and

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.960
classes and all sorts of awesome programming stuff.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.280
But at the end of the day,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.750
you're writing a PHP application because you're building a website and that website,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.670
just like every other website in the world,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.850
has to use HTML.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.520
So there you go.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.920
That is Ah,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.980
I guess a crash course into PHP syntax.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.490
This whole thing is called a syntax,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.970
by the way.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.260
So you've got Ah,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.810
your semi colons.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.230
You've got your quotations.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.060
You've got your opening and closing.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.850
PHP tags all of this together.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.360
Bundle that into a package and we call that syntax.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.080
Now,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.950
your task for this lesson is create a new file minus called Index up huge being.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.000
You can see it right up there.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.300
And I just want you to open a PHP tag and you don't have to understand,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.630
echo.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.480
But I want you to do something like this.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.950
Type echo.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.450
My name is and then insert your name.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.950
Don't forget your semi ical.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.000
And don't forget your quotations.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.130
They have to be the same on both the beginning and the end.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.630
And don't forget to close your tag.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.080
Save that loaded up in your browser.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.780
So go to local host slash index PHP or my cases.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.150
Local host Colin 8000 slash some folder name because I've got this in a different folder.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.920
Folder Lessons folder 90 PHP,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.250
syntax and then index dot PHP.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.350
So go ahead.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.870
Give that a shot.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.440
Once you have done that,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.110
which really shouldn't take that long.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.510
Hopefully if you get stuck,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.720
don't forget you can ask questions.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.500
I'm here to help.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.820
I've also got a group called Learning Skoda Facebook.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.990
Thousands of Deb's in there.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.110
We're all willing to help you out.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.250
But once you've done that,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.250
head on over to the next video and let's learn something new.
