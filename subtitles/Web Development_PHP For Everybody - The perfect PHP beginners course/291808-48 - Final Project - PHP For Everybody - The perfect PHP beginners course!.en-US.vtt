00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey!

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.320
Hello.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.820
so this is your main project now,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.860
this project don't get me wrong is not the most exciting thing in the world.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.610
But from everything you have learned in this course so far,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.450
you can write Ah,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.490
lot of really,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.550
really cool pH be super dynamic pages that your project for this course is actually super

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.060
straightforward because we've learned everything that you need to use.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.720
What I would like you to do is I would like you to create a new post form.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.650
We've seen a lot of this in last few lessons.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.220
I wanted to have three input fields not to,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.850
not for just three.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.240
Make them all required fields.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.900
So not only should they have the required HTML field,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.750
not field um,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.510
the attributes,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.310
but they should actually be required.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.580
Eso if someone was to go and hack up your page and get rid of that required attributes.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.500
Guess what?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.650
It's not going to get past your PHP because you're a great developer.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.610
I also want you to write clean code,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.950
so don't write messy code.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.380
It's it's totally okay to write gross messy code while you're you're sort of in the heat of

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.710
the moment you in the middle of all this.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.340
But maybe when you're done going,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.900
clean it up,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.250
re factor your code,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.180
make it nice and clean and ledge a ble.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.830
Add comments if you have to.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.050
That's totally okay.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.020
Just make sure you write clean code.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.680
One of the things that a lot of developers don't like about PHP and PHP developers is that

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.570
they tend to write really messy code.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.370
A good example of that is WordPress.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.590
WordPress is terribly messy code.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950
It is a terrible way to write PHP.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920
And I don't want you to go down that road.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.720
I want you to be able to write and read very clean,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.420
friendly code.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.790
So other developers who will eventually be working with you will go.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.490
You know what,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.850
that guy or that girl knows how to write some good code.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.550
Then when the form is submitted,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.800
I want you to create a success message.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.650
So basically,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.210
when all the fields are submitted and they meet the requirements that you know,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.500
they are actually required,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.520
um,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.490
put a little green message on your page saying,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.700
Hey,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.840
yeah,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.800
I think you will get touch with you shortly or your form was successfully submitted.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.410
Something like that.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.550
Just so the user has some feedback.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.120
And then I want you to also create an error message at the bottom of the form.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.950
So not only should each input field have three error messages,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.280
so each input field has its own error message,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.840
I should say,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.550
but at the bottom of the form,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.000
if there are any error messages,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.970
I want you to put that at the bottom of the form above your submit button so that if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.080
someone submits the form and all three input fields are empty,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.190
it will say input Field one you're missing in Patou input field to you're messing and field

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.740
number three,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.170
you're also missing that.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.850
And then at the bottom,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.370
it should say,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.770
Guess what?

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.860
You were missing three fields or you're missing required fields or just something like that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.860
,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.640
so that it's really blatant and in the user's face so that they know that they've actually

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.900
missed a bunch of stuff.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.050
I'm not going to give you the source code for this.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.920
This is completely up to you If you have questions.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.750
If you get stuck,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.050
feel free to ask questions like I'm here to help.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.920
This is what I do.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.550
Um,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.980
also,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.950
there are thousands of developers and the learning to code Facebook group.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.730
So if you ever get stuck,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.350
guess what you can ask people in there.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.590
I'll help you out in there as well.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.730
I'll help guide you,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.000
but I'm not going to give you any of the code for this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.260
You got to figure this out on your own.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.040
That's part of learning that's struggled,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.790
that you're feeling that a little bit of frustration,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.130
trying to figure all of this out.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.450
That is what's important here.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.140
That's what's gonna make this a memorable experience for you.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.600
And that's how you're going to be able to reference all of this in your head without having

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.020
to Google without having to come back to this course.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.530
It will make you a better developer,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.410
I promise.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.780
So go ahead,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.350
create this amazing form.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.960
Feel free to use,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.660
um,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.300
a raise.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.250
Feel free to use print are to see what's coming back,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.040
something that we didn't talk about.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:55.700
You could also dio echo instead of just echo post you could do to do prints are post and

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.760
you could see all your post variables in there as well.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.490
You might even see some extra stuff.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.360
Experiment with it.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.180
Have some fun.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.140
Do whatever you need to do to get this done.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.940
Um,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.640
and again,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.510
I'm here to help.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.970
I look forward to seeing your finished work.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.050
If you want to share that with me,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.650
I would be happy to take a look at it.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.430
Cool.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.470
So that's your project.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.280
Go ahead.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.200
Get started on that.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.600
Um,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.370
and there should be one more video after this.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.340
Just a quick little summary of what you've learned.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.870
Um,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.850
and where to go next?
