00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
all right,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.750
before we actually start learning about what PHP is works,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.160
know the intricacies behind it.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.890
Let's take a look at what it does.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.770
So I'm just gonna quickly skip through a bunch of stuff here.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.830
We're going to learn about all the bits and pieces,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.680
throat the course,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.150
and actually,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.330
in the next several lessons,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.460
we're going to actually get her hands very charity with writing some actual code,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.330
which is great for hands on experience.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.040
But for now,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.260
I just want to show you how this works.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.820
So here's an example of how PHP works.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.850
I guess so.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.340
On my left I have my text editor.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.280
I'm just using sublime.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.810
You can use Adam V s code.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.440
Really?

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.950
Any other text editor you like?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.330
I just like sublime.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.120
On the right is Google Chrome.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.320
It's just a Web browser.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.060
It's loaded up with local host 8000 lessons.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.000
We'll talk about you,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.140
r l structure and what the 8000 means and all that stuff in just a little bit.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.570
But for now,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.910
let's go ahead and create our first string.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.390
So,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.630
actually,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.520
before I do anything,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.070
I'm gonna refresh this page and you'll see that nothing shows up,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.300
there is just a blank page.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.140
And in fact,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.300
if I view the source,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.960
there's absolutely nothing there.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.100
Now if I go into sublime and I type hello world and I say this go over to chrome and to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280
give it a refresh boom and says Hello,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.610
world.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.000
Now,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.440
if you're familiar with HTML,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.100
this is not a mind blowing thing.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.680
This is not anything new.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.640
The only difference is it looks like you're writing a lot more code than what you would

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.850
normally right When you're writing html And if I go into the source here,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.560
refresh.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.910
You can see that in the source.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.710
It also says hello,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.970
world.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.450
Now where this gets really,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.290
really powerful is the dynamic nature of what PHP is.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.280
So if I type in here Ah,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.450
let's type in color is equal to blue and I hit enter Absolutely nothing is gonna change

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.690
literally Nothing is gonna change.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:55.680
But if I write regular html in here and I say the body html and maybe also all paragraphs

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.690
just reading some general CSS here they all have to have a background color of I'm gonna

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.000
make this little smaller so you can see it all in one line,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.980
they only to have a background color off whatever this new color is.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.640
So again,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.490
don't worry about what this really is on.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.320
We're gonna get into all of the intricacies in this course just as a reminder.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.780
I'm just showing you how this works.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.590
So I'm gonna show you that we can get the color from the Earl by typing get color.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.490
And when I saved the page and refresh this my pages blue And if I change the you on I see

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.230
red Or if I wanted to change it and go to Black right?

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.910
This is the dynamic nature of what PHP does for you.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.260
It changes your templates.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.520
You don't need to compile anything.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.780
This doesn't like sea or python or anything like that.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.280
It just works.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.480
And it's a very quick So this is a very basic example of what PHP is on a dynamic level.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.120
Now if I changes back to white,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.290
everything looks white.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.320
And if we go into the source code and give that a refresh,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.110
we can actually see that Hello World shows up and we can see that right there.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.800
We've got the style and we're saying body HTML and P tags all have to have a background

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.550
color off.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.740
This one doesn't have anything.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.910
So that's type question mark is equal to blue and it puts blue in there for us or again,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.890
If I changed it to read,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.010
it changes it to read.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.200
And now this is writing CSS for us.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.830
Now,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.240
we don't generally use PHP to write CSS,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.380
but we do right PHP to change our html to change the output.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.250
So if the color is red,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.700
can we show certain information If the user is locked in,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.000
do we show them their own account information so you can see how that's already relatable?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.440
So that is how PHP works on a very basic level.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.270
Now we're going to get into what all of us actually is.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.240
How it operates,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.800
how it prints to the page functions,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.820
objects,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.780
you name it,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.870
we're going to get into it.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.420
But for now,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.760
again,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.020
I just wanted to show you like,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.550
hey,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.830
this is what it can do.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.030
And this only took me like in total.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.760
If I wasn't,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.140
you know,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.720
creating this list lesson for you.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.740
This probably would have only taken me 15 seconds,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.560
and I could have changed the background color of any page just like that.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.170
All right,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.270
so that's a basic example.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.560
If you want to give that a shot.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.000
Ah,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.450
if you don't know how to get set up with PHP or anything like that Ah,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.460
the next few lessons are definitely gonna help you up,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.450
and I'll see you over there.
