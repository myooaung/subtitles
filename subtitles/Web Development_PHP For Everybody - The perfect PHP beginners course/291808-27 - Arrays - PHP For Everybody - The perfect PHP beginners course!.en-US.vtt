00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Okey dokey.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.150
Welcome back.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.810
We are going to be talking about a raise now.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.660
We've seen a lot of a raise in the past.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.440
We've not really formally dived into them.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.650
We talked about them in data types,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.290
printed them out in print,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.250
are and in Varg Dump.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.320
But now now is the time to learn what they actually are.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.030
So the simplest way that I can think about how to describe an array is it's simply just a

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.080
list of values.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.570
It's a list of strings or floats or INTs or anything like that.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.540
Anything we've been working with so far,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.740
it is a list of those.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.540
So let's go ahead and dive right into this and make it a little bigger or a lot bigger.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.810
And let's take a look at our first array.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.350
Now it already can be set in two different ways.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.550
We have,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.800
ah,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.370
ABC do 123 something like that and I'm going to use var dump.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.490
But if you don't have our dump accessible to you because you're an ex debug ah,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.850
use print are and so far Dump Beret.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.730
And here we have we've got two strings.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.960
ABC and 123 There's also another way to do this.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.520
Instead of using these hard brackets,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.330
you can use a soft bracket and use the word array.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.540
This is literally the exact same thing.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.650
So if I was to,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.050
you know,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.790
let's move this up and I'll copy that below.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.850
It's literally the exact same thing.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.900
Vier Dump doesn't even know the difference.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.760
It's just two different ways of basically in Stan Sheeting or starting an array through

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.150
this course.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090
You might see me doing both ways.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.710
Um,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.510
sometimes I prefer just to use the hard brackets like this.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.970
And sometimes I like to actually write the word array so that it makes more sense of,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.480
Ah,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.480
while you're learning,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.870
you know exactly what I'm I'm working with here.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.580
And it's not like,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.810
Oh,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.040
what are these hard brackets like?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.240
Oh,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.710
you know that this is now in array.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.340
All right,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.750
so I know for that.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.970
Let's go ahead and create an array.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.710
So we've got an array of names s Let's not call it a ray.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.550
Let's call it names.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.380
And remember,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.280
Petri gives you as much white spaces you want,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.500
So feel free to put things onto new lines and I'm gonna put Caleb Nathan.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.110
Fan knows and no Thanatos,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.690
because that's Nathan and Panels together.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.950
And I find that hilarious.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.330
00 actually,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.990
speaking of hilarious,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.750
you wanna hear a joke?

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.650
Okay.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.830
Yeah,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.590
I've got a good joke here.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.600
Why did the developer get fired?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.660
Because he asked four a raise more,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.350
More.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.660
All right,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.600
So,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.300
uh,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.230
do of our dump here.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.090
We do have our dump of the names,

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.850
and we will see a regular list.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.490
Caleb Nathan Thantos.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.940
Nathaniel's.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.070
So this is the easiest array that you could possibly work with.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.830
And if you want any of these values,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.650
if you only ever wanted to show,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.900
let's say fan knows we could write echo names.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.640
These numbers here,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.950
0123 always starts at zero.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.130
But in human terms,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.460
zero is always the number one.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.450
So is here was First one is second two is third,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.850
three is fourth.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.170
So in this case,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.610
we just want to plug that number in here.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.490
So we want Thantos.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.470
We echo names Thantos,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.650
and that's comment that out.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.830
And,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.410
uh,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.780
it shows us Thantos.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.600
So why would we ever use something like this?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.210
Why not just have a variable called Thantos is equal to fan knows why not just do that.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.590
Well,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.690
we could very well do that.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.650
But when we start working with a lot of data,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.330
we need to be able to loop through things.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.650
We'll talk about loops down the road,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.190
but essentially we need to be able to store things in a way that we can access later.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.710
Now,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.000
if we wanted to say for each of these names,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.150
we also want to give them the same last name.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.300
How would we do that?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.620
Well,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.250
we could go in here and we could give them all a last name like Tall Lean.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.860
Or we could loop through all of these and we could Katyn ate the value so we could say,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.590
Caleb,

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.190
And then we know how to contaminate.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.560
Right?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.290
We go can Captain eight telling again loops,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.980
air coming.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.270
It's down the road.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.820
So worry about loops too much right now.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.570
But what you should know is that storing data in lists or objects or in this case is called

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.830
an array allows us to group similar information together.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.490
So in this case,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.600
all the names are together and we can work with all of those all at once down the road

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.370
instead of having to do one at a time.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.360
So if if we had ah,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.260
Caleb is equal to Caleb.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.860
And then we had Thantos is equal to Thantos,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.920
and we also had Nathan is equal to whips.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.000
Nathan,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.810
we would have to do the exact same thing three times would have to write the exact same

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.900
code three times to modify any of these.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.150
And there's an easier way to do that again.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.550
Those air called loops will get to those eventually.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.950
Don't worry about learning loops right now if you're unfamiliar with those,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.650
but for the time being,

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.000
you should know that this is an array.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.160
Now,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.100
this is also a simple array.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.680
So I'm just going to put this in here Simple array or,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.490
um,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.080
simple basic are a like It really doesn't get too much easier than that.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.070
So I'm gonna go do echo H R and make some space for us.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.300
Teoh see what's going on here and let's go ahead and create another list of names.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.270
But this one is going to have names and ages,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.400
so I'm gonna create the array a different way and this one is going to have the exact same

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.730
stuff.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.820
And in fact,

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.360
I'm not actually gonna write that out.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.950
I'm gonna copy and paste that because it's literally the exact same thing.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:19.110
And if I come down here and var dump names open this aired out Because if you have error

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.110
logging turned on this will also tell you like what the air actually is.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.460
It'll probably say something like,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.100
uh,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.350
missing syntax or missing colon.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.880
Or it doesn't understand what var dump is.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.550
Meaning that the problem is right before it.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.730
Anyways,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.860
here,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.200
Rio.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.640
So okay,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.450
it's all the same.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.840
But now if we said,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.270
Oh,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.610
you know what?

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.820
We actually want to correlate the names with people's ages.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.050
We can do this.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.390
So this is another kind of array.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.050
So in here,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.450
we're just going to create what's called a fat arrow.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.870
So you use the equal sign and of the greater sent the greater than sign,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.390
and it creates what looks like a fat arrow.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.740
And I'm gonna put 28 26.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.750
I don't know how old Thantos is.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.380
I don't know,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.150
Uh,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.850
80 I know 800.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.390
I honestly have no idea.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.770
And Nathan knows our made up character are hybrid between Nathan,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.650
and tha knows he is going to be 12.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.500
Okay,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.870
so now we have a value in here,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.860
like all the way down here.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.570
And in fact,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.380
let's line this up.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.340
So this makes more sense again.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.810
White space.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.440
Not a problem.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.790
If this makes reading your code easier,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.950
by all means do this.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.160
And so we've got a list of names on the left and we've got a list of ages down the right.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.950
And if we refresh your page,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.250
you notice that the array of the top now no longer looks like the array down below.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.740
And in fact,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.430
what we've done is we've actually replaced the 0123 with Caleb,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.150
Nathan Thanatos and Nathan knows.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.170
So if we wanted to get the age of Thantos,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.730
we could type echo names Faneuil's.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.840
So instead of how we did it up here,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:09.430
where it was echo names to Furtado's notice How that's just a number,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.880
because this is just a number.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.150
And here you can actually see that there's apostrophes in there.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.750
We know that if there's apostrophes,

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.950
it's a string.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:23.130
So we go echo names Thantos and when we echo this out and I'm an uncommon this so we can

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.050
actually just see what's going on in here.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.670
This will say with all certainty in the world,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.270
this will say 80 bam!

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.480
Just like that is as 80.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.670
Now,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:39.650
I'm gonna quickly undo that because that is not technically part of the lesson.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.350
So here we go.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.660
We've got Indurain here that basically points to other information.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.850
So all we've done here is we've reset the indices.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.880
So the 0123 is now Caleb,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.400
Nathan Thantos and the Thanatos.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.720
Okay,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.070
cool.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.680
So now let's look at one more array.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.890
That's bump this down.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.000
That's not gonna work because that's html inside of PHP and needs to be inside of a string

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.000
.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.390
And let's create what's called a multi dimensional array a multi die mention no array.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.170
Now,

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:14.930
really,

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:21.280
what this means is array inside array for a raisins had a raise plural,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.750
possibly depending how many you have.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.270
And this gets a little bit hard to wrap your head around at first,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.530
but it gets pretty cool.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.330
Uh,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.250
once we start dealing with larger data sets because you can now associate a ton of

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.870
information with Caleb.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.530
Nathan Thantos.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.220
Jonathan knows.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.730
Let's do this.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.340
We've got names.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:39.690
In fact,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.380
I'm gonna just copy Lis because I'm being lazy.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.090
And instead of you know what this is.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.090
This is actually gonna look better if I use a ray instead of the hard brackets.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.610
And instead of just having a name in here,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.850
what I can do is I can say this is another array.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.700
So this is like inception for a raise.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.590
And in here,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.360
we can say age is equal to 28.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.750
Height is equal to 1.83 meters,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.250
and we'll put a comment in their meters.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.450
That's smaller.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.450
What else do we need to know about me?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.050
Um,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.530
profession like job.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.180
Okay,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.070
programmer.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.500
How many friends do I have?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.280
Friends?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.060
I have.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.030
Let's everybody 40 friends.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.700
Okay?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.810
I'm gonna realign these again.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.010
You don't have to rely on these.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.490
I just do this so it makes your array a little easier to read.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.250
And now we can see that we've got a rain here called Caleb.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:56.280
And when we dump these names down here,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.810
we can see near the bottom,

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.150
right?

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.620
We've got an array.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.440
It's got a bunch.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:00.960
People in it.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.780
We've gone array for Caleb as well.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.180
Now,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.870
I've also have the age,

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.160
height,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.530
job and friends number.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.780
And you can see that these air ins floats,

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.450
strings,

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.100
whatever you want them to be.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.650
And in fact,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.250
the Caleb,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.390
this Caleb Index here is pointing to another array.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.050
So again,

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.090
this is sort of a little bit of a mind blowing concept at first.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.800
And I remember when I was first learning because I was like,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.160
Wow,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.590
why would I ever need to use these?

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.650
But the real power comes from this.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.580
So if I wanted to get Caleb's height,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:38.950
I could say none of that because I keep making so many typos names I could go into.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.600
Caleb.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.130
That's my index here.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.650
We know that that's going to,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.530
uh,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.050
basically allow access to this array.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.260
And if I want to say the height,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.150
I simply go height and let's do this echo.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:06.310
Caleb's height is Caleb site is 1.3.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.660
We don't know what that is,

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:15.160
but likely have got some comments in here that tells me that it's meters them.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.650
Caleb's height is 1.3 meters.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.470
Okay,

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.550
what if we wanted Caleb's job killed job is,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.880
and we'll get rid of the meters because that's irrelevant.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.750
Killed Job Is programmer Caleb's age.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.500
No,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.230
I did that wrong,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.450
Caleb and age.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.600
Caleb's age is 28 and now you see,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.550
we can do us with everybody else in here as well.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.930
And now,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.440
instead of having to write something along the lines of,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.150
uh,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.140
let's say Caleb is equal to Caleb.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:13:02.790
And Caleb's age is equal to 28 and Caleb's friends is equal to 40.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.490
And instead of going over and over and over again,

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.020
because we're gonna have to do this for Nathan as well,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.240
right?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.850
Nathan is equal to Nathan.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:16.140
Nathan's friends is equal to 40 Nathan's,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.780
and I'm purposely writing this out the long way so you can see how painful this congee

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.450
Nathan's age is equal to 26.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.250
So now all of a sudden we have six variables,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.760
two of which we have to remember,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.320
and Nathan may eventually change in the future.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.920
In fact,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.550
we might even want to unset him.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.320
We might want to remove him from this list entirely.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.530
And how do we do that?

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.830
If we have three variables,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.880
we'd have to unset each one individually or or here,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.250
I'll show you what we can do here,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.860
and I'll just reset this so that you can see in here.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.800
That's got Caleb,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.120
Nathan Thantos and Nathan knows at the very bottom,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.450
right?

00:13:52.450 --> 00:14:02.350
And we can unsaid this unset names Nathan and look at that.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.000
He's gone.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.840
So we've got Nathaniel's with the Thantos with Caleb,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.110
but Nathan is no longer in here,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.450
and all of this code is irrelevant.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.980
So now we didn't have to unset Nathan's agents,

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.440
friends or,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.140
if we added more properties to him,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.030
more details about his life.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:23.430
We don't have to worry about having to unset every single one or finding all of them.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.050
We can write one command that does it all for us,

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.700
and this is just the beginning of us.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.550
So now you're working with larger amounts of information that is nicely organized.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.610
So there you have it.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.800
These are a raise now,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.530
Unfortunately,

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.700
until you learn about loops,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.410
honestly,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.150
a raise or not that useful,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.030
they look cool.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.910
It's it's a good way to store data.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.300
It's a good way to organize your data board honestly,

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.440
until you know about loops.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.300
They don't do anything.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.220
They're just lists.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.010
You can't do anything with lists yet,

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.890
except print emote with other print are or Vardy Bug on by Vardy Bug.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.290
I meant X'd bugs module called Var Dump,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.710
But again,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.900
I'm just setting you up for success right now.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.860
These will become a lot more prominent in the future,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.030
especially when we're dealing with loops and we'll talk about all that stuff in the future

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.290
in in their own individual lessons as well.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.340
So your task for this lesson is very,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.000
very simple.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.250
I don't want you to do anything complicated yet.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.780
I mean,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.310
if you want to,

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.850
by all means,

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.280
Go for it.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.930
I would never say no to you going a little bit above and beyond.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.250
But what I would like you to do is create an array.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.510
Call it names,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.400
put a bunch of names in their var dump.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.950
The names or print are the names,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:38.050
and then I want you to echo the 3rd 1 in the list.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.740
So remember the indices started zero,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.080
but human start counting at one.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.210
So 123 But the indices don't start there.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:52.360
The industry started 012 so go ahead and print that third name from your array.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.630
And once you're done that,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.440
we're gonna head on over to the next lesson.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.600
We're gonna learn something else.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.600
And don't forget if at any point you get stuck,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.700
feel free to ask questions in the Facebook group.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.100
This is exactly what the group is for.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.900
The group is made for support.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.460
With thousands of developers in there.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.330
We can answer all these questions for you very,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.110
very quickly.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.910
All right.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.430
Thanks for bearing with me through this lesson,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.050
and I'll see you in that next one.
