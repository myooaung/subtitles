X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
all right.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.100
There's gonna be a lot of times when you need to check if a variable or ah kee in an array

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.780
is set.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.540
What I mean by that is does it actually exist?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.280
Does it exist or doesn't not exist?

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.220
Now the reason for this is because PHP is so dynamic and people create so many variables

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.000
with this is,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.850
sometimes it's hard to tell if something is actually set.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.450
So,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.190
for example,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.740
let's say I've got a much more complicated script in this,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.400
but I want to say,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.000
uh,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.670
Echo Hello.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.260
Name and I refresh my page.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.250
It just says hello.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.900
So if I don't ever want this to say just how low Hello.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.530
Uh,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.990
in fact,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.240
let's make this a lot more awkward.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.250
Hello and welcome.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.850
This just says hello and welcome.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.210
Yeah,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.560
that's actually not awkward,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.130
but,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.840
you know,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.680
let's make it more awkward.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.250
Hello,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.510
And I should say,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.730
Hello,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.000
Caleb and welcome.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.580
But it doesn't.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.510
So now this is awkward because there's obviously two commas in here in two.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.960
Common should never be side by side.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.530
It's weird sentence structure.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740
So how do we check to see if this name exists?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.940
Well,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.690
first of all we can set.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.350
The name name is equal to Caleb.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.110
Cool.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.660
That works,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.150
But there's no names that.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.630
So what we can do is,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.340
if is set name than echo this very,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.950
very easy.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.490
Otherwise,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.930
it's not going to echo anything.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.140
And we will say else,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.750
echo.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.310
Welcome,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.830
guest.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.310
And now we have something set in here.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.720
Now we can say at any time,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.430
just by changing,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.480
changing this name,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.120
and by changing us,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.250
I mean adding this name is equal to Caleb.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.050
Hello,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.360
Caleb.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.000
And welcome.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.060
So there we go.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.650
That is how you check if something is that.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.220
But what if we wanted to check if something Mawr comprehensive was set?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.470
Let's say who we want to see if there's a whole array of information set on someone,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.330
so Ah,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.550
we've got an array.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.800
You know,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.040
Let's call this people.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.160
We've got an array,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.970
and in here we've got person one.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.430
His name is Caleb and he has an array of information is we're talking about myself in the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.900
third person,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.380
by the way,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.250
his age is 28 or so and his favorite sport is I don't know,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.170
snowboarding,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.050
snowboarding.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.350
You got smaller.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.670
And what is his favorite food,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.070
right?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.780
Food tacos.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.790
Okay,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.300
so we've got one person in here.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.830
Let's go ahead and duplicate this and make a second person and 1/3 person.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.920
This was Nathan.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.700
His favorite food is nachos with a need with Arnie,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.790
Let's do without me 26 his favorite sport.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.500
I don't know,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.800
actually,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.270
hockey.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.190
It's not hockey,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.550
but I find that kind of money.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.810
And let's say Thantos is I have no idea.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.860
We're gonna say 1000.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.650
His favorite sport is destroying worlds,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.490
and his favorite food is,

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.120
um,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.050
probably as guardian people.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.370
That's totally inaccurate,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.960
But it's funny.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.750
Okay,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.300
so let's get rid of name up here.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.150
We'll get rid of name and we'll say,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.170
If is set,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.190
people people is definitely set that exists so we can say something in there.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.630
But let's say we want to see if a particular person is set.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.720
So if it's set,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.610
Caleb Okay,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.770
so now I need a name in there because without it it still has those awkward comments.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.050
So what do we do?

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.460
We could put people name.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.530
There's no name in here.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.840
Ah,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.340
we could I mean easily,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.670
very,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.310
very easily.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.550
And just put a name in here.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.590
Name is equal to your name.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.950
Just something like that.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.460
People.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.650
Caleb.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.430
Name again.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.700
I'm making the smaller I apologize if this is hard to read.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.520
Caleb people,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.550
Caleb name people Caleb name.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.220
So we can,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.880
for the most part,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.300
assumed that if people Caleb is said that there is a name.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.150
But if we're not 100% certain,

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.040
I mean,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.550
we could sort of look like fools.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.390
It's like whenever you get an email address and it's like,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.150
Hi,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.440
person,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.260
you know my name.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.250
Why don't you just put my name in there and it doesn't take that much work.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.190
So what we would do in this case,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.200
we would double check.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.750
We would say,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.250
if it is that person name people Caleb name,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.280
then we can say hello,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.540
people.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.050
Caleb name.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.990
And there we go.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.220
So that all works.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.560
But if we got rid of this comment this out,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.950
so it sort of pretend that it doesn't exist.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.370
People Caleb name does not exist.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.620
It's not in here anymore.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.430
You see that blue?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.670
It's the equivalent of not having it in there at all.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.980
And so it just says,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.450
Welcome,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.950
guest.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.210
Now what?

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.640
You can also Dio is you can say if is not set.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.330
Remember that,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.960
not operator.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.110
This is important people,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.070
Caleb name and that looks like a mouthful.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.530
But remember,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.670
most of that is just the arraign.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.400
That's all this is.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.730
So if this is not set,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.770
we can now go ahead and set this.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.190
So we say people,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.530
Caleb name is equal to Caleb Tall,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.200
lean and bam There it is.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.350
So we checked.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.200
If it's not set,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.170
and then all of a sudden it is set,

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.980
Okay,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.760
now we can use it.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.100
So that is the premise behind is set.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.460
Now,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.120
the idea is to use this on bigger projects when there's a lot more files when the stuff

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.480
going on in another file that you don't know how to access yet or you don't actually know

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.580
is available.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.710
And you'll see this a lot,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.160
a lot,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.460
a lot,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.410
a lot with WordPress because WordPress is a very,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.820
very sloppy content management system,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.900
in the sense that the code is just so terrible and you'll see this all the time because you

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.880
don't know what set.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.060
You don't know what the scope is.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.220
You don't know how things are technically working,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.660
and so you always have to check.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.530
Is something set?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.700
Is there a certain setting set?

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.420
Is something set along the lines?

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.820
If not,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.650
then I can do something,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.660
and that's because you don't want to overwrite.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.290
So if one person has a plug in,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.880
um,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.950
and it's called,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.860
uh,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.590
it's called Send emails and you create a plug in called send emails.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.940
You want to make sure that they're variables are not taking place in your code or vice

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.270
versa.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.950
You want to make sure that your code is not overriding their codes and so use things like

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.150
it's set to double check that things aren't being over written.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.030
Now,

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.880
your task for this lesson,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.380
but I would like you to do is I like you to create.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.730
You don't have to create a massive array.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.450
Just create a regular variable.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.150
Call it name.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.890
Name is equal to fan knows or something,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.490
Um,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.630
and then check to see if it exists.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.560
If it does exist,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.950
awesome.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.040
If it does not exist,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.650
I want you to make it exist,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.390
so usually if not exist if does not exist,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.150
then make it exist.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:18.690
And I'm purposely I'm deliberately being vague here and a little bit complicated so that

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.900
you can practice learning how to do these things without full guidance.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.150
So every now and then,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.930
I'm gonna start getting a little more vague,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.050
and that's totally okay.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.320
Remember if you got questions?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.980
Facebook group learning to code were there to help.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.640
I'll add clarity and there if you need,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.370
um,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.950
otherwise have at her.
