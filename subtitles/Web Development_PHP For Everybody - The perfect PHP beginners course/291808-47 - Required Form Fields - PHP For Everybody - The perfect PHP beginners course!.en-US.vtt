00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
All right,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.380
let's talk about some required fields.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.310
So in HTML we have this little attribute called required,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.250
and we can just type required.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.450
And when we refresh the page and try to submit,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.360
our browser says,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.540
Please fill in this field.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.920
But sometimes that's not an option.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.750
Or sometimes someone goes into your page and they hack it up a little bit in their dumb,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.000
their document object model.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.600
Now we can go in here and we can remove that,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.970
and now it tries to submit for us.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.500
So it's easy to hack up the HTML,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.080
the dom,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.330
the document object model.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.950
And we can't always rely on the fact that this is required by our browser,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.610
especially since there are people out there who still have really old browsers who just

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.250
don't have support for the required attributes.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.900
So the way we get past this is we basically check to see if everything is set up the way we

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.710
needed to be set up.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.970
So what I'm going to do is due to do.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.570
I know that last sentence was very vague,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.130
but just bear with me just a moment.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.800
And so what I'm doing here is I'm just going to create Ah Div for both city name and your

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.580
name for actually actually been city name as well.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.980
And this one's gonna be just my regular name.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.520
So you know what?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.100
Let's call it.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.660
Oops,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.550
let's call it first name first name.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.350
And when I refresh the page Oh,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.150
it's gonna ask me because it's a post page.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.340
There we go.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.600
OK,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
so I've got my city name and my name and in fact,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.160
let's get rid of the required Let's just assume that this does not exist because we should

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.140
never rely on that.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.650
As I just said,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.090
we should never,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.820
ever rely on that.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.850
So now we also need to have a sentence down here that says,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.190
Hi your name.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.750
Welcome to and in the city.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.280
So essentially,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.700
it's going to fill in these blanks.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.810
Now what happens if someone only specifies the city name or your own name?

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.760
It's one of these is empty.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.690
Then it's going to say hi,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.010
Caleb,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.080
Welcome to blank or high Blank.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.850
Welcome to your city.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.720
It's gonna look terrible.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.050
And people are gonna look at that and go,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.240
Oh,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.450
well,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.810
something's obviously missing.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.990
This is not,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.500
you know the service for me type thing.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.100
And we've got to make sure that this stuff actually always works because a lot of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.560
applications are data required or they,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.990
ah,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.250
they basically rely on data.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.850
Um,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.620
without it,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.300
like without having someone's name,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.850
you can't personalize a message you can't say,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.260
Hey,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.660
Caleb,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.850
welcome to my website if you don't know the name of that person,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.450
So let's go ahead and check this out.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.730
We type in city name Edmonton.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.600
My name is Caleb.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.130
Submit.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.970
Nothing happens.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.420
All right,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.530
So let's add some pre defined logic at the top of our page.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.040
And let's say the city name is always blank.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.400
And let's say your name.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.970
Uh,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.200
that's not Do your nameless.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.850
Your first name is also always blank,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.380
and we know that if these are blank,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.970
this should not show up.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.350
So let's look for something here.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.630
In fact,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.660
I apologize about that.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.990
Let's make some room so you can see what I'm typing.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:26.550
PHP if is not empty first name and is not empty city name.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.150
Sorry must make this little smaller cause I like to put it on one line.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:42.230
Close that if statement and then we can move this up so I don't have to take that out again

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.230
.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.550
Echo High.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.690
And today,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.900
today,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.390
uh,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.260
it's put first name.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.150
Welcome to city name.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.110
And when I refresh the page,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.650
nothing happens because first name and city name are still empty.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.630
But what if I did?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.150
City named Edmonton first name Caleb.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.110
Now we have some logic problems because these aren't showing up now.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.230
Why is this not showing up?

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.400
Well,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.720
it's because we're not actually using the user input yet of this point.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.980
We're just saying city name and first name is always blank.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.020
It doesn't matter what someone puts in.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.640
It's always blank.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.870
So now we need to check if they are set.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.330
If the form has some information in there and overwrite these variables so we can say if is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.890
set post,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:38.830
we know it's post because the four method is post city name and we can just simply override

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.000
it.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.260
See you.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.920
Name is equal to post city name,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.750
and we can do the exact same thing with first name.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.840
Just be careful when you copy and paste here whips because whenever you copy and paste,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.180
you will inevitably run into errors.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.040
You will forget to paste one certain spot.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.670
In this case,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.420
this is very simple.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.400
It's always just first name,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.970
and it's like three lines of code,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.840
so it's not a big deal.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.210
But when you deal with 50 lines,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.110
code or 100 lines of code,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.820
you're gonna miss stuff.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.400
So just be careful when you copy and paste.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.170
Now,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.830
if I say this and I refresh,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.260
it's gonna say,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.460
Hey,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.870
you already submitted that stuff.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.150
Hit.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.820
Continue.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.150
Nothing is gonna happen.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.340
But if we try once more and properly,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.300
submit the form.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.640
There we go.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.210
Says Hi,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.560
Caleb.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.340
Welcome to Edmonton.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:31.680
We can also add the values in here Eco city name and for my name Weaken.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560
Say pH B Echo,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.890
first name Refresh.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.900
There we go.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.850
We've got auto fill.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.480
Cool.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.800
So now what happens if someone does not put in their name?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.460
Watch this.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.910
Okay,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.860
nothing shows up.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.360
That's a required field,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.150
but the user doesn't know that yet.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.530
The user has no idea that they are missing a field now.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.550
Usually we denote this to a user by adding a little asterisk,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.970
saying,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.190
Oh,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.350
this field is absolutely mandatory save,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:09.210
and I was gonna refresh here and so this asterisk essentially is saying this field is

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.690
required.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.520
But you know what?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.580
A lot of people actually don't pay attention to that.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.290
And even if they do pay attention,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.610
if I type in Edmonton,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.020
nothing is happening.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.940
The user does not know what's going on,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.580
so we need to give them some sort of way of saying,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.860
Oh,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.460
guess what.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.100
You need to fill out this particular form.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.240
So let's go and do this.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.950
Let's try it with our first name first.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:34.690
We're going to write some logic in your PHP if is not set.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.250
No,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.790
I did it wrong.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:49.250
If is set post first name and empty post First name Echo Missing field.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.600
Okay,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.480
I'll explain this.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.350
I did a lot of typing and not a lot of talking there.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.530
Eso What this is looking for is is is post first name set.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.320
What that means is,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.680
was this fit?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.790
Was this form filled out?

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.700
Was was this field entered in some degree.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.740
Even if it was empty,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.560
it will be set.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.380
But is it also empty?

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.810
Because if no one types anything in here,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.090
it's also going to be empty.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.400
So let's go ahead and submit this there ago.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.350
Says missing field.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.020
Um,

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.620
but you know what?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.340
That's Ah,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.550
a little bit too ugly,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.180
in my opinion.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.180
So let's write some quick CSS.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.530
It's right.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.340
A styling here,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.220
ah dot error background color,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.640
red whips.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.850
I don't know why I got that in there.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.880
Padding 10 pixels,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.150
font size 13 pixels and color whites.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:49.550
What we can do in here is we can say div class read and close that div.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.630
And by a diff class read,

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.550
I actually meant def class error.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.600
I got confused because it is read a big red section.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.990
So says missing field missing field.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.710
In fact,

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.370
let's b'more informative if be as informative as you can.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:06.580
So,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.290
um,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.650
missing first name.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:17.510
And we can actually apply this logic into the city section as well,

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.280
in case the city name is missing.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.320
So we say we just replaced both of those posts.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.770
City aim.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.000
So is the city name set.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.700
If it is,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.180
also check to see if it's empty.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.890
If if it's both set but empty,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.180
then say missing city name.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.990
Okay.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.260
And let's do this.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.290
There we go.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.520
Missing city name missing.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.920
First name.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.050
So city name again.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.890
Let's put in Edmonton because that's where I'm from.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.200
Your name.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.700
Let's put in any name.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.850
Let's put in Jacob.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.150
And there we go.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.220
So that is how you do required fields.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.420
Now,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.300
the logic behind this is actually very,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.000
very easy.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.200
The logic is you check to see if one of the fields has been submitted.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.600
We can check to see if it has been set in either the post or get super global variables.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.080
In this case,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.680
it's post,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.400
and we can also check to see if it's empty.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.960
So now what I would like you to do your to ask for this lesson is to not only replicate

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.940
this to create a required field in your form,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.740
but I also want you to take this kind of code here.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.470
And I want you to re factor this.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.640
Put this into some sort of variable up in the top page top part of your page where all the

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.350
logic lives,

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.740
and then I want you to re factor your if statements.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.390
So basically it should say something like,

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:39.090
um if city error and then show the error.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:45.110
I want you to learn how to re factor things because this is so much more readable than this

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.110
.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.020
Now go ahead.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.460
Give that a shot if you get stuck.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:48.940
Guess what?

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.020
There's a lot of support here.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.670
I'll help you out.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.980
Either.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.980
Ask a question down below.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.920
If there's a common section or hop on,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.290
learn to code on Facebook.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.660
It's Facebook Group and asked the question there.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.550
I'll be happy to help.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.440
Once you're done all that,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.050
let's head on over to the next lesson.
