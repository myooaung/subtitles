00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490
Okay,

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.850
welcome to another lesson.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.480
I guess this one is not really a lesson more than it's just I'm letting you know some of

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.370
the prerequisites that you should ideally have before learning PHP.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.800
Now,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.650
the honest truth is you don't need to know a whole lot before you learn PHP.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.690
Now the reason that I say this is because although it's great to know your HTML as well as

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.450
your CSS,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.280
you don't actually need those because PHP is a server side language,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.380
meaning it runs on the server.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
It has nothing to do with your browser except for the fact that if your PHP spits out a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.720
little bit of hte email or CSS or some JavaScript or something,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.190
your browser will render that as if you wrote it in HTML CSS or JavaScript.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.450
So that's cool.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.320
I would suggest that you do know some HTML and CSS.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.580
If you don't know HTML or CSS.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.650
I have lessons on both of those subjects.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.170
If you're if you're sort of a keener and you want to know a little bit more,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.470
you can also learn JavaScript.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.830
I've got a great JavaScript essentials.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.940
Course it's highly rated.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.250
Definitely go check those out.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.300
But for now,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.780
I'm gonna let you know that technically those air unnecessary.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.330
You do not need to know HTML or CSS or JavaScript or python or anything.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.610
This course will take you from zero to hero.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.590
From a dizzy,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.860
you will know exactly what you have to do.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.750
By the end of this course,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.840
you will know everything.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.860
There is no a boat PHP and you will be a professional PHP developer.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.300
By the end of this course again,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.100
you do not need to know html CSS.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.620
But in this course,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.740
you will definitely see me,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.970
right?

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.850
Html CSS Probably some JavaScript here and there.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.670
Anything that's not PHP related.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.580
Guess what?

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.260
You don't have to learn it again.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.440
I would suggest that you do learn it.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.340
But if you see me writing any of this,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.410
don't freak out.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.520
It's not necessary.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.620
This course is strictly PHP.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.980
Everything else is extra.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.040
I want you to focus on just the PHP stuff now.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.370
Right now,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.310
you might not know what that PHP code looks like.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.580
And in a little bit we're going to get into PHP syntax,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.390
variables,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.100
how things are written,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.930
how to make your code work what happens when code breaks all that good stuff.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.580
So again,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.260
if you don't know your HTML aeration of five CSS CSS three JavaScript,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.330
all that stuff,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.600
don't worry about it.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.150
It's not technically necessary.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.820
But if you see me writing it again,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.650
don't freak out.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.300
It's just some icing on the cake for this course.
