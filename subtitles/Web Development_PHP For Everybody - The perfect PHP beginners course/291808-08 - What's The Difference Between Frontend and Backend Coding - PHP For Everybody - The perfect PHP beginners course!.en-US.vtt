00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Okay.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.710
Another question that's going to come up a lot is what is front end and what is back end

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.990
now.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.050
You may or may not be familiar with either of these terms.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.030
I'm just going to assume that you aren't familiar with these.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.660
If you are,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.710
feel free to skip this video and just head on over to the next one to begin.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.560
Let's talk about what front end work is.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.800
Assuming I could type anything correctly.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.990
Front End is purely HTML CSS and browser based JavaScript by browser based JavaScript.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.380
I mean,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.580
not know dot Js not expressed RGs.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.430
It's just like regular JavaScript es six stuff that you run on your browser that does not

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.590
require a server.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990
That is all.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.440
Front end is back.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.460
End is databases.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.050
It's often mostly Dev ups.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.670
It's writing PHP.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.730
Its databases.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.750
Like my SQL,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.590
it's file management.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.160
Back end could also include right writing languages like Python,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.050
ruby,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.350
Java,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.220
you name it.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.810
If it runs on a server,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.630
it is back in,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.080
So that is the difference.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.760
So a lot of people say Campbell,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.020
what is the real difference?

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.230
Like,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.050
I mean,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:22.370
if I right some HTML and I write some python or I write some CSS and write some PHP and my

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.760
both front and back end.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.370
Well,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.840
you know,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.380
you met you might be Now if you dio both front and back and that is called full stack.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.880
And what full stack means is you can do front end and back end.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.710
That does not necessarily mean that you can do everything in the back and world.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.970
Front end is very limited.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.450
Okay,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.950
So front.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.030
And really what?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.490
Ah,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.320
front and Effie.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:56.570
For short front end means is html html five CSS CSS three javascript,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.050
including things like Jake Weary React View.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.650
Yes.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.800
678 You know,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.770
all that stuff that is purely front end.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.200
So if you know how to do html,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720
CSS and javascript,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.340
you're a front end developer if you know how to do.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.920
Ah,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.860
some database work,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.260
some some PHP work,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.740
perhaps,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.970
or another language.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.830
It doesn't necessarily have to be PHP,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.850
but if you know how to do any of that back and stuff B e for short,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.790
then you're probably writing python PHP.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.520
You're probably working with something like Engine X or Apache.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.400
In this course,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400
we're using Apache,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640
um,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.790
and you're probably working with some sort of database.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.350
Now if you can mix and match these,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.750
so if you can do HTML CSS JavaScript and you can also do like python and post dress or PHP

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.780
and my SQL or Apache and PHP with JavaScript and CSS,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.300
then you're a full stack developer.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.190
That's all that means.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.320
Full stack means you were both front and back end.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.260
Front line is html CSS JavaScript Back end is basically everything that is not front end,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.420
which is a huge,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.150
huge world,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.890
and that is the only difference.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.710
Really,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:16.870
it comes down to do you write code on a server or on ah browser,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.370
and I shouldn't be using the word on what I should be using is,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.890
do you write code for a server or for a browser?

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.360
That's the difference
