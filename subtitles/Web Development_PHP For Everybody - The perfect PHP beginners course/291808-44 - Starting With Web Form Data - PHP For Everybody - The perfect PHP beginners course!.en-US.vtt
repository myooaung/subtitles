00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
Hello.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome back in this lesson.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.440
We're going to be talking about forms.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.430
So if you remember when you were learning HTML,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.610
you learned about a specific element called form and it had a method attributes,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.950
and it was either get or it was post and actually spoke those side by side.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.800
It was either get or post up until now.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.490
That has been completely useless to you.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.230
You don't know what get or Post is.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.630
We've actually done a little bit of work with Get in this in this course.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.590
But let's go ahead and actually work with the form.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
You're going to formally learn what this stuff actually is because up until now it's a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.570
complete mystery,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.900
and it's completely useless to you.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.050
If you don't remember what poster get is,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.920
don't worry.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.950
We're going to go over all this,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.400
so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a form that uses method

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.230
called get,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.690
and we're not going to actually write any PHP was going to set up this form,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.030
so let's put an input and I type input tab on my plug in called Emmett E M M.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.220
E.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.590
T.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.830
Will auto feel that for me the type is text and let's go ahead,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.550
give us a name.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.740
The name is going to be,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.550
uh,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.370
no,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.940
it's OK.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.850
Let's not call it name.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.870
His name is able to name.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.760
That's confusing.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.630
I see that a lot.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.500
Let's Ah,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.600
let's put City okay.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.000
And let's,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.390
um let's throw a label on here as well.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.380
Um,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.050
going to call this city and city name.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.940
Okay,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.390
so we've got City City name and the last thing we need is a submit button.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.750
So button type is equal to submit and not style.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.420
I don't know why type that Ah ends called submit.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.340
Because this form does not need to be beautiful.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.750
This form dress needs to work.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.170
So this is the most basic form that we can possibly use.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.790
Ah,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.810
for really adding user input into our page.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.130
So what we're going to end up doing is we're going to say a city name.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.890
You type in the name of your city.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.540
So in my case,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.920
it's admin.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.180
Tonight,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.760
I'm gonna type,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.610
submit and it's going to show up on the page.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.730
But nothing happens.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.390
However,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.170
there is one thing that did happen.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.200
You notice that says question Mark City is equal to Edmonton up here now that is actually

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.870
fantastic,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.900
because we know we know from previous lessons that we can echo get City and it will tell us

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.790
the city name.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.900
Now,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.480
we're not going to do that in this lesson because I want that feeling of suspense.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.940
I guess,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.460
um,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.460
we're going to do this in the next couple of lessons,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.220
and we're going to learn how to not only use,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.430
get,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.600
but how to use posts and how to check if things actually exist and when to show things and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.530
all that good stuff.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.930
So let's go ahead and,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.250
ah,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.210
create this form.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.700
It's very basic.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.870
You could probably take this out in 30 seconds or less when you're done that head on over

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.390
to the next video and let's go ahead and actually create something amazing
