00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
Hello.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome back.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.900
This is going to be a very quick lesson.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.310
Ah,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.640
this is something we probably should have learned,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.250
Uh,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.360
quite a while ago.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.500
But you know it.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.390
Better late than never,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.920
I guess,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.400
eh?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.060
So in this lesson,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.380
we're going to learn how to increment and deck Crimmins by one.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.240
And it's actually super super easy.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.230
And you know what?

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.610
You're honestly going to use this a lot more than you think you would possibly use us.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.330
So let's say my age is 20.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.520
And if my age is also equal to 20 execute some code in here,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.390
execute this code,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.180
and I want to say you know what?

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.790
Let's let's let's make this a little more complicated.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.120
Another bonus.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.570
Let's do points is equal to let's say,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.910
I've got 75 points and my age is 20.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.880
So for whatever reason,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.030
just being the age of 20 gets me one extra point.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.240
I could do points plus plus.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.660
And so let's do this.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.650
Let's go echo points.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.790
The number of points that you currently have are points,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.550
and let's add a line break in there just so that the smell doesn't look terrible.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.790
You now have points.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.730
There we go.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.950
And when to refresh the page,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.200
take a second.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.250
And just think about this.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.450
What?

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.780
The point is going to be okay.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.320
We said plus,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.750
Plus,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.650
we know that this lesson is about implementing and Decker Menting.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.130
So I mean,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.680
even tells you in the subtitle right here.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.450
When you refresh the page that will say,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.730
76 Boom.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.020
Just like that 760.75 unit have 76 and that's all this does.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.320
And you can keep doing this over and over and over and over again.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.270
I'm going to copy a bunch of and I honestly have no idea how many have put in here.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.600
I just hit copy and paste a bunch.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.970
I now have 89 points,

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.280
so I'm gonna go and delete that and let's say for any given reason,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.850
we just need to decrease the number of points by five so we could do points is equal to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.540
points minus five.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.780
If we wanted to do it that way,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.760
or we can do points minus minus and do that five times now,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.550
I prefer this way personally because it's just a lot cleaner,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.800
but you can also do it This way,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.190
so I'll show you both.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.340
Okay,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.760
now I have 71 points because I went from 75 76 75 74 73 72.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.800
I now have 71 points,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.770
and that's what is displayed on the page.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.440
But if I comment that out and use the first way,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.680
it also works.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.920
Now let's comment that out and let's try one other way.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.220
Points is equal to minus.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.150
Nope.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.350
Minuses equal to five.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.340
This also works.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.790
Okay,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.660
so watch us.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.730
I'll common this out.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.590
I have 76 points and this one is saying points.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.980
Basically,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.740
it's shorthand for this.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.030
It's saying points minus is equal to five.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.980
So whatever it currently is minus five.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.330
Refresh the page and it's 71 I could do the exact opposite with the plus sign as well.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.650
Plus is equal to,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.370
and it's just shorthand for this.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.050
That's all it is.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.370
So your task for this lesson is to write an age or some sort of number,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.640
I guess.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.330
And remember,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.890
this really is only going to work with numbers because Onley numbers or floats can

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.350
increments or document by one.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.560
So right a number variable increment it by one using plus plus deck,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.260
prevented by one using minus minus.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.640
And really,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.090
that's all you need to know for this lesson.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.950
Once you've done that,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.400
let's quickly skip on over to the next video because this one was honestly not as fun as

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.290
programming can be.
