00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Oh,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:01.990
hey,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.750
Welcome back.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.650
Let's talk about variables.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.860
A couple lessons ago,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.290
we were talking all about variables and sort of what they are.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.740
And remember,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.540
always like your mouth teacher was like Find X And you were like,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.880
Now I don't want to find X.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.460
Don't worry,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.410
we're not finding X.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.590
But variables are a very important part of programming languages.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.670
Now we're not doing algebraic formulas were not doing linear regression.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.400
We're not doing anything complicated.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.740
Fact.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.690
At this point,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.360
we're not doing anything mathematical were simply assigning a variable so that we can use

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.250
it more in one spot.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.210
Now let's go ahead and create our first variable.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.660
So variable does not start with Echo that was have it from a couple of videos of writing

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.920
echo.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.610
So many times.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.010
A variable starts with a dollar sign.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.300
So let's type name now.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.150
If you remember,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.510
maybe you don't.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.250
Maybe you skipped over that that last lesson or a few lessons ago,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.350
where we talked about variables.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.450
uh,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.950
rewind real quickly,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.330
so variable starts with a dollar sign.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.360
It cannot have a number as its first letter.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.480
It can be name one,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.090
certainly,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.820
but it cannot be one name and you can see that my my syntax highlighter went from typical

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.430
gray to white,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.750
telling me that it's different for a reason,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.850
so it cannot start with a number.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.050
It cannot start with any special characters.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.720
In fact,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.260
it has to start with ah,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.250
letter or alternatively,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.750
and underscore.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.710
Now I would suggest staying away from underscores because I had conflicts with something

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.060
called Super Global Variables and Private Variables or private Properties will get into all

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.950
of that down the road.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.880
But for now,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.150
maybe just stay away from using underscores because it can be a little bit confusing.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.420
So I'm going to write Name.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.980
Oh,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.760
and by the way,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.510
name is not the same as name.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.720
Where the capital end is not the same as name all caps,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.040
thes air,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.750
three different variables.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.870
So let's assign this first variable.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.960
And that's what is called a signing.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.430
That question mark,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.350
not that question mark.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.090
What am I saying?

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.480
Caleb,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.180
Get it together.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.180
That equal sign that we see here that I have highlighted is saying that we're assigning a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.050
value to a variable.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.560
So let's say the name is going to be Caleb,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.240
and if you're doing these exercises.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.150
If you're going along with me while I make these videos,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.530
feel free to use your own name.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.650
You don't have to use my name.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.080
Remember,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.280
it ends in a semicolon,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.950
and I'll I can type name.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.980
Remember how eco works We just act was something.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.850
But instead of using quotation marks around it,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.310
we don't No quotations,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.950
no apostrophes who we just use.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.050
Dollar sign name ending with semi colon.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.160
Now I'm gonna refresh the page.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.430
Now it says Caleb Sobule.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.730
Yeah,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.780
that's a variable.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.150
But if you're asking.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.760
But if you're asking Well,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.810
why would I write this when I could just write it?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.900
You know,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.970
this way.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.550
Well,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.210
that's because we can use this over and over and over again.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.840
We can say echo,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.650
name and copy and paste this over and over and over again.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.550
Manager shows up over and over and over again.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.550
Okay,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.660
Not particularly useful,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.790
but we can also put it in our eco statement.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.290
So if I just do this and refresh the page,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.550
it doesn't say Caleb anywhere on there.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.950
But if I wrote my name is the variable in there.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.870
So we've got quotations,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.190
Remember?

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.350
Quotations are important.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.760
So starting quotation,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.810
closing quotation.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.350
Oliver Syntex looks good.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:54.280
Says my name is and this matches this hit save and we'll see that it works perfectly.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.110
Says my name is killed.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.150
It's the equivalent to writing,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.750
Caleb.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.430
It's the exact same at this point.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.460
So why on earth would we ever use a variable?

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.780
Okay,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.960
well,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.070
let's say we're writing a short little application.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.110
A little website that creates a story for someone.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.600
And you want that name to be completely dynamic.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.480
You say hello.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.710
Let's actually I see this.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.270
Hello,

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.550
Caleb,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.450
please.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.600
This Well a Hello,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.050
Caleb.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.340
We can also put some HTML in here.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.250
Br echo.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.310
Uh,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.950
did Ah,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.050
my name is I don't know,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.150
Jacob.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.650
I think you make that a proper sentence.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.150
And now we can write name.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.650
It's nice to meet you,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.590
but a space there.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.450
Otherwise there won't be a space.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.630
Hello,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.000
Caleb.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.990
My name is Jacob.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.390
Caleb.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.250
It's nice to meet you.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.050
Okay,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.340
cool.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.030
So now we've got one name in two places.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.450
Not really as dynamic as you thought it was going to be,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.800
right?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.640
Well,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.510
that's because right now we're still in some of the boring phase of learning.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.330
What variables and what not actually are.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.940
But if we fast forward,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.380
like,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.710
20 lessons from now and just don't mind what I'm writing here,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.350
I'm just going to show you how this actually it's very dynamic.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.740
We type in this super global variable mentioned in the last video.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.690
And I type in a question mark.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.480
Name is equal to What does my name on to be?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.950
Maybe my name is Nathan,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.750
right?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.620
Look at that.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.970
Hello,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.520
Nathan.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.800
My name is Jacob.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.220
Nathan.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.140
It's nice to meet you.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.850
I could put anything in here literally anything.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.320
Hello?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.310
Literally anything?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.190
My name is Jacob.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.730
Literally.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.150
Anything?

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.080
It's nice to meet you.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.850
So this is the power of a variable.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.010
Now again,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.240
Do not worry about what this is.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.730
What I have highlighted has nothing to do with what we currently know.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.380
So if you're looking at that and you're like,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.850
Whoa,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.530
that's I have no idea what that is.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.720
Well,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.050
remember,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.260
you have two options.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.810
You can ignore it until we learn about its in a few lessons.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.470
Well,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.770
quite a few lessons,

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.260
actually.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.140
Um,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.750
or you can look up What a super global variable is on stack overflow.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.640
You can Google it.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.760
I'll even type it out for you.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.590
In case the audio quality is not fantastic.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.750
It's called a super global variable.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.430
Variable.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.320
Second times a charm,

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.750
right?

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.670
Look that up.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.260
Or look up the dollar sign.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.740
Underscore.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.750
Get in the PHP docks.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.210
You can do that.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.890
Otherwise,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.190
feel free to ignore it and we'll get to it eventually.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.790
Now you know what a variable is.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.130
You know how to assign a variable?

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.950
You know how to make your name as a variable.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.370
You can also do something like age is equal to 13.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.020
I'm going to get rid of this.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.770
Hello,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.400
Caleb.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.550
You are?

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.750
Here's old.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.380
Hello,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.680
Caleb.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.600
You're 13 years old.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.760
What's actually very,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.470
very incorrect.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.060
Flattering,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.210
but very incorrect.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.190
You are,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.910
Let's say,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.450
25 ish.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.610
Wow,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.560
that's also incorrect.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.730
Your 30 ish.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.450
You were 30 ish years old.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.450
Now if I wanted to use just a number,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.690
Guess what?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.280
We can use just a number just like that.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.590
And there we go.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.050
That's variables now,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.050
but I would like you to do your task for this video,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.050
create a new file.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.710
You don't have to worry about the header here.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.520
I'm just adding that so you can see what we're doing over here,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.800
but create a new variable.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.440
Call it name calling age.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.520
Call it whatever you want.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.250
A sign of value to it,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.920
and then echo it out.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.150
It can be as simple as as simple as this.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.250
So we have variables.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.750
Name,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.850
echo name.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.050
That's all we need.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.250
So once you've done all that and you've got it working in your browser,

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.170
go ahead,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.510
Click that next video are You know,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.500
wherever you're watching this video head on over the next video,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.250
and we're going to learn,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.090
you know,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.730
a little more,

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.930
a little more willing to take the step by step.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.250
We're definitely getting there.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.250
These are things you probably didn't know too much about,

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.930
you know,

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.950
just 10 15 minutes ago.
