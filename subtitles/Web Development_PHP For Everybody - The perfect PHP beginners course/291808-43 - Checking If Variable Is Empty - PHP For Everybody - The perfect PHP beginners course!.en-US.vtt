00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
okay,

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.260
Pretty soon we're going to start talking about forms.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.000
Forms are how users submit information to your service so that you can manipulate it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.760
You can manage it.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.830
You can do something so that you can provide a service.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.320
Otherwise,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.490
you just have a completely static website built on a dynamic language that can't do

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.070
anything.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.050
Now before we get there,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.440
we need to check if something is empty.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.740
Is is an email address empty.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.630
So when someone signs up for your site and they need an email address if it's empty,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.840
well,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.900
they can't sign up because that email form is required that email field is required now.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.560
How do we check that?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.550
We can say E mail is equal to,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.390
and we'll just put empty string in there and we'll say,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.090
If empty email echo,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.730
please enter your email address and look at that,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.780
please enter your email address.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.210
Now if we put literally anything in your literally anything that does not show up,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.810
so that's a good thing.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.090
This is called form validation.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.080
This is the first step in form validation as well is we need to make sure that every email

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.730
addresses properly validated that there actually is one,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.910
all sorts of stuff.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.000
We'll get into that eventually,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.680
but right now we're just going to talk about empty.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.960
Yes,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.850
And so the whole premise of this is the check if something is empty.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.870
So as an even better example,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.050
what we can do is get email,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.650
and we're actually going to see this in the next couple of lessons I refresh,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.290
the page says,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.590
Please enter your email address.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.960
But in my you Earl,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.020
if I type question mark,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.300
email is equal to Ah,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.880
Caleb killed dot io.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.990
That warning goes away.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.090
It's no longer there.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.800
It's no longer needed because there is an email address.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.380
And in fact,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.350
if we do an else statement ago,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.450
thank you E mail.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.910
Bam,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.760
Dario says.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.180
Thank you,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.250
Caleb Caleb dot io.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.600
Now,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.250
as a little security tidbit,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.400
whenever you have a get parameter post parameter again,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.050
we'll talk about these next few lessons.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.930
Whenever you're taking unknown information from a user,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.880
always assume that it's malicious,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.180
always assumed that their intent is to bring your website down.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.920
And so simply echoing this back to the page is not a good idea.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.850
Now the reason for that is if I was the type.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.060
Oh,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.460
chrome,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.130
you're too good.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.750
Okay.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.530
So generally,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.480
what would happen is ah,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.480
this is called.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.260
Well,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.890
if it's a database,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.140
its SQL injection in this case is called on X S s injection.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.860
And so what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to put a little bit of javascript in the u

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.410
l so that in here,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.330
it also puts a little bit of JavaScript on my page and can execute code within itself,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.710
which is a security breach.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.910
Chrome was smart enough to block that for me.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.660
So there you are.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.700
That is empty.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.120
Ah,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.510
what I would like you to do is spend about one minute create new index dot PHP file or an

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.690
empty dot PHP file.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.200
Ah,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.640
and just simply check to see if the email address variable is well empty or not.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.860
And if it is empty,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.450
ask for them to put it back in.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.740
Ask for them to put something in there and then just change that end once.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.250
Once you have a variable or a value inside of your email variable,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.560
that message should go away.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.120
And this is getting pretty close to concluding the basics of PHP.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.100
And in the next few lessons,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.510
we're going to get involved with forms,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.410
get post all sorts of things,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.180
validating and making sure that people can actually submit information.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.540
All that good stuff.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.950
We're going,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.370
Teoh.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.650
We're going to learn about it.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.050
Also,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.500
don't forget semicolons.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.470
All right,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.260
See you the next lesson.
