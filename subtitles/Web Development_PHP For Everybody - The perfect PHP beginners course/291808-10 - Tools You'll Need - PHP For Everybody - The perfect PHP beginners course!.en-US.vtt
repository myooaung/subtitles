00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.570
Okay.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.320
As a Web developer,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.370
you need some tools like any trade,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.240
carpentry,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.930
machining,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.610
electrical.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.100
Those all have tools.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.790
Web development is no different.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.650
You have tools that you need.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.050
So one of my favorite tools is a text editor called Sublime,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.750
and you're going to need a text editor as well.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.000
Now there are many different editors out there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.160
I like sublime.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.760
This is one of my favorite ones,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.740
but there's also Adam.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.900
There's also V s code.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.650
Ah,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.090
there's Dreamweaver.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.250
No pad plus plus.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.580
Generally,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.110
I tell people to stick with one of these three.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.330
They're sort of the big three right now.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.010
Sublime has been around probably the longest.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.570
I like it because it's lightweight.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.360
It's superfast.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
I can open big files with it and it doesn't have a problem crunching that kind of data.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.610
And V s code is the newest one made by Microsoft,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.800
and it's actually really,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.320
really good,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.650
too.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.630
So you're going to need a tax editor if you don't have one of those.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.450
Go and get one of those now.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.460
Ah,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.810
heads up.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.030
V s code is free,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.650
Adam.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.820
Ah,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.790
I believe is free.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.110
Actually,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.760
don't use Adam,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.930
so I couldn't tell you,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.630
um sublime is free to use,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.120
but it's called Nag where So every now and then has a little pop ups like Oh,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.380
hey,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.150
pay for me.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.210
I paid for my version of sublime.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.180
I think is worth it.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.380
If you don't want to pay for it,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.090
definitely check out V s code.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.020
The next to where you're going to need is something called Git.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.480
Now,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.900
in this course,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.250
I'm going to be using get a little bit here a little bit there.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.040
It's not really required,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.190
But as a Web developer,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.020
it is good practice.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.760
Put your code in a version repository where you can see your get history.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.570
You can collaborate with other people,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.600
all that good stuff.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.960
If you don't know what get is,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.910
maybe go and Google something along lines like,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.350
um,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.150
what is get.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.180
And if after reading an article or two,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.540
you still aren't sure what get is that's cool.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.200
I would suggest getting get downloaded through your command line.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.030
Ah,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.440
brew,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.870
install,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.600
get or sudo apt Get,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.250
uh,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.570
yeah,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.400
install Get something like that or it comes with um V s code has a plug in Forget it's a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.190
visual one sublime has one is also visual.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.190
I do the command line stuff.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.780
I'm gonna teach you the command line stuff again.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.930
That's completely optional.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.020
But you're going to need get anyways because eventually,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.280
as a developer,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.740
it's just a requirement.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.320
You need to be able to collaborate with other people on the same project with the same code

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.620
at different points of time.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.880
And you need to be able to overlap.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.940
That coat somehow get,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.890
is the way we do that.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.850
Now you're going to want a get hub account,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.580
and you might also want a get lab account.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.160
So it's just type that out and get lab account and get hub account.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.900
Get help.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.510
Account is basically your public repository.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.890
So if you looked at my get hub account,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.430
I've got a few repositories on their free,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.140
useful things.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.500
I don't have really any projects on there,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.700
though,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.870
because a lot of my code needs to stay private and private repositories.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.750
A repository is basically a folder with all of your code inside of it stored with get hub.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.500
Ah,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.950
private repository is going to cost you money with get hub,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.580
but with get lab and let's just put that dot com in there with get lab,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.310
you get free repositories.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.410
Basically,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.150
the services are identical,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.630
but get lab gives you free repositories.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.130
Get hub does not beget.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.600
Hubby is sort of like you know,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.840
it's where your future employer is going to look at its going.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.540
They're going to say,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.670
Oh,

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.710
do you have a get hub account?

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.900
You should be able to say yes and you're also going to need some sort of server on your

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.420
computer.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.180
It doesn't have to be a cloud server.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.250
Doesn't have to be a real server,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.600
but it has to act as a server Now.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.880
We've already talked about Zampa and I must write this in here.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.730
You're going to need server of some sort so you can have ah Zampa.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.150
Or you can run,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.960
ma'am,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.650
There's another one called lamp.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.160
Now what this means is Mac os X Apache,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.510
My SQL PHP python.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.370
Ah,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.740
this one is not ma'am.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.970
I met Wamp.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.760
This one is Windows Apache.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.910
My SQL PHP and lamp is Linux Apache of my SQL PHP.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.750
Now it really depends on your operating system.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.760
You can use example on all three of those,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.790
but typically this is a Mac one.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:20.360
You can use Wamp on windows and you can use lamp on Lenox such as you bun two or fedora or

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.850
w and a really any sort of flavor of the next that you want.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.470
So you're going to need these.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.710
You should already have zap set up.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.890
We we had a lesson.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.690
Ah,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.470
few videos ago about Zampa and where you can get it from.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.030
And for now,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.520
these air the only three things that you need You need text editor.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.280
Like what I have.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.130
Ah,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.470
that you can actually see my code so you can write your own code you need get,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.980
um,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.120
just because it's a good practice.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.590
Ah,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.030
and you definitely need a server.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.430
Otherwise,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.650
you can't execute any PHP on your computer at all.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.180
So your task for this video is to get a tax editor if you don't have one already created,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.550
get hub and a get lab account and set up a server with whether that Zampa wemp or a lamp

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.630
I'm also using docker so you can go to my,

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.120
uh,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.410
get hub repository could get hub dot com slash Caleb Holley and slash PHP dash docker and

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.570
you can get started with Docker as well.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.630
It's the way I'm doing it,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.420
but you don't necessarily need to do it that way.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.300
If it's a little too difficult for you,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.220
stick with Samp samples the easiest one.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.240
So again,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.250
get a text editor,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.200
create your get accounts and get a server running.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.820
And just make sure that you can execute a PHP file,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.590
because after this,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.350
we're going to actually start writing some PHP.
