00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
all right.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.450
And this lesson we're gonna talk about something called a constant now a constant in

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.880
essence,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.150
is a variable that can never change.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.900
And it is a basic variable.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.340
He could not be like a multi dimensional array.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.610
It cannot be,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.300
Ah,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.270
an object or a set of classes will talk about objects and all that stuff.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.650
When we get more advanced down the road and essentially,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.510
that's all it is.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.850
It's variable that cannot change.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.130
Okay,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.650
so let's create an example.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.640
Your let's open up my PHP syntax.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.350
And we've got a regular very variable variable called Caleb.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.270
Right.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.400
We know all about these,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.560
and we know that if we wrote Echo whips,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.880
caps,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.150
lock,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.630
echo,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.170
vire and then we said Viers equal to Nathan Echo of our This is going to say,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.050
Caleb in the Nathan Caleb a thing just as expected.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.110
But what if we want a variable that can never change?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.650
And this is good for config files?

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.340
Uh,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.350
certain settings never need to change.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.860
Um,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.050
and admit email address may never change.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.840
And so what we can do is we can set a constant with this function called define.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.780
And so we give it a string,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.600
and this is what it's going to be used as later.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.350
And we say,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.370
Um,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.740
it's make it name and his name is going to be Caleb Now notice that I'm not setting a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.400
variable.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.870
I'm not setting and Ray or anything.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.340
This is not happening.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.130
It is just simply a function in my code that says Name and Caleb.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.870
And if I echo name,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.650
guess what?

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.090
It doesn't work because this is not a variable.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.250
What it's looking for is just a constant.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.550
So a constant does not have that dollar sign in front of it.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.890
Now if we echo this boom,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.280
there it is,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.650
Caleb.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.180
But what if I said name is equal to Nathan five hundreds on me.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
That error is if I had proper error.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.150
Logging set up right now.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.800
That error would be saying you cannot either have a variable without the name are without

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.120
the dollar.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.810
Sign in front of it,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.470
or you cannot rename or ah,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.650
revalue or repurpose a constant something that's already been defined.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.760
Something go ahead,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.050
remove that refresh page.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.980
Cool.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.670
So when we're dealing with variables,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.290
we can also check to see if a variable is set,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.890
right?

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.900
We can say Caleb,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930
And if it's that again,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.290
we'll talk about this in the future.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.790
For sure,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.650
we definitely will,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.550
he said.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.160
If that's set,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.350
Echo,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.850
Caleb is set and this will say Kayla beset.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.350
There we go.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.450
But if we said if it's that constant,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.290
nothing happens again,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.640
we just get this stupid air this,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.480
http,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.910
ever 500 That means there is a server error.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.220
What is it doing?

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.600
Well,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.820
instead of saying is set.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.600
This one has a different definition.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.150
And again,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.650
don't worry about remembering this part because we'll cover this in the future instead of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.660
define,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.420
we say defined there,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.900
you because this is referencing the string.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.670
This is not This is not the name of variable.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.090
This is simply a string that is stored in the memory that can not ever be changed.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.590
So So that is your introductory lesson to constant constant can never be changed.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.390
Once it is set,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.090
it is set.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.300
You do not unset it.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.580
You do not change its value.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.630
It is there forever.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.920
For as long as the script is running and again,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.800
that's really good in config files.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.350
Now your task for this lesson is to create a constant echo it.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.150
Try changing it.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.950
Echo new constant.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.710
Just try that.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.380
So create new,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.350
constant echo that constant out like we did here.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.050
Try changing that constant.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.350
Try changing it any way you could possibly think of,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.650
and then echo that new content out.
