00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.510
Okay.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:01.870
Hello.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.340
If you're coming from the last lesson,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.460
we were just talking about the print,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.260
our function,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.650
and I'm gonna show you something might be actually a little bit easier for you.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.450
So instead of just using the print our function,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.670
which sometimes you have to go into her source code to make sense of because when things

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.590
gets just spit out to the HDL to your document object model.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.320
Basically,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.350
when your browser just views a bunch of nonsense,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.040
it's going to remove extra spaces,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.510
is going to be very hard to read.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.130
And there's a better way to do this now there's a little caveat with this one.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.050
VAR dump requires actually attacked us up.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.050
This requires the X debug module.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.850
No,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.050
a lot of hosting places come with ex debug installed.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.650
If they don't,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.810
you can usually turn it on.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.320
And if you can't turn it on,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920
then you can probably just use print.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.040
Are to be totally honest now that you know how to do that.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.300
But I'm sure you an easier way.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.650
So we're going to open this up,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.640
got a bunch of PHP in here,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.590
and I've got an array and this array has a bunch of names in it.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.140
So it's got Caleb.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.880
It's got Nathan.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.850
But let's capitalize that because it's a name and that's proper.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.410
And let's go with Prairie and let's add some more in here.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.370
Let's go with John and let's go with Moses.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.790
And if I type eco array,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.160
you know by now that this is not going to show me anything.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.080
It just says Array.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.150
That's not useful at all.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.050
Let's comment that out.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.030
And let's type print are array.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.450
This is what we did in the last lesson.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.560
Okay,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.740
so we've got an array and we've got a bunch of indices and stuff in there.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.440
OK,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.780
that's all right.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.510
And we know that we view the source.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.050
It becomes a lot more legible.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.550
But what if we didn't want any of that?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.950
What if it's gonna sort of clear this off here and make a little break?

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.210
What if we just wrote Var dump and we just wanted to dump the entire variable called Array

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.210
?

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.460
It doesn't have to be an array.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.320
It could be a string.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.400
It could be an object.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.590
It could be anything you want.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.350
It just happens to be that this Ray has the name of a ray.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.000
Look at this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.450
I'm actually gonna make a smaller This tells me where my file is located.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.790
On what line?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.900
That this VAR dump is being called on,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.930
which is really good for debugging because now you know.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.660
Oh,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.100
okay.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.690
I have to go to index dot PHP.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.400
It's in the 1 70 Vier dump folder which,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.630
if you look in my sublime,

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.650
is actually right here,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.850
and it's saying cold and 17 that means Colin 17 Line 17.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.420
That's where this is coming from.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.830
And now this also reads the array for me.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.860
So it says array sizes five there five items in it.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.510
It starts at zero and goes to force a 01234 If you count those on your fingers,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.450
that's actually five.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.150
It tells us the length,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.720
the length of each array item.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.430
So this is telling me that this is five characters long.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.740
This one is six characters long,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.300
this one a 73 and five and they can tell me that these air all strings as well.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.120
So now you don't have to go and print are an array and then loop through that array and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.290
prints are all of those or print our individual indices.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.890
This just tells you everything,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.590
and you don't have to view your page source because if you view your page source,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.210
it looks terrible.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.970
And that's generally how life is going to be.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.540
As a program,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.930
your source is going to look terrible.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.400
Don't ever worry about how well or how not,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.920
well,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.370
how terrible your source coaching look like.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.190
And by that I am simply referring to the source code in your HTML page,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.970
your source code in here.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.450
What you're actually writing the PHP that your browser does not see.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.350
Try to keep it as clean as possible.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.760
So far,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.200
I've been doing a terrible job,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.590
you know,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.180
do do as I say,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.310
not as I do type thing.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.190
These air purely for demonstration.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.270
Actual production code is much cleaner,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.830
so this is var dump.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.530
Far dump is print are,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.810
but so much better.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.290
If you have access to this,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.750
if you can enable it,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.290
I would suggest using this because this is just so much more informative and you don't have

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.660
to worry about like viewing your source and parsing HTML on reading a bunch of HTML

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.920
entities and all that other stuff just far.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.660
Dump works.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.160
So your task for this lesson is creative.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.270
Variable an array put a bunch of names and it just like we did not last lesson where we

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.110
were learning about printer and then it's out of print are which looks like this.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.640
I want you to use var dump now.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.630
If this does not work,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.330
it means you do not have X debug module installed,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.150
and you might just have to ignore this this lesson for a little bit.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.720
Or you can hop on the Google and you can figure out how to enable X debugging typing.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.940
Google How to enable X Debug for PHP seven or PHP 5.6 were using PHP seven in this course,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.550
but you might be using PHP 5.6 if you're on older computer or an older hosting service.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.500
Let's go ahead,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.890
give our dump a try,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.090
and once that's all done,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.510
either will work or it won't work.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.120
I don't oversight next lesson,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.850
and we'll learn about something new
