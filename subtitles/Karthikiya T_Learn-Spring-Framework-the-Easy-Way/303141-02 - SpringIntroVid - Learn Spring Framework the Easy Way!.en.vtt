00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.010
spring is the most popular framework and an inversion off control container for developing

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.150
Enterprise Java applications.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.680
Applications that are developed years and spring will come with a whole stop advantageous.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.180
Some of them are.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.190
Spring promotes loosely coupled architecture where all the application components are less

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.590
dependent on each other.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.710
Spring will also help us get rid off the crosscutting concerns and help the dollar per

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.950
focus only on the core functionality.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.050
Off the application spring will help us create applications that are easily testable,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.320
using some of the unit testing frameworks like J Unit Market.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.460
Oh,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.200
etcetera.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.250
Spring is pretty lightweight,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.940
and you can completely get it off an application Silver altogether and there are many more

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.140
advantageous and using.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.480
Spring Spring has lot off projects,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.430
and depending on the type off application that you're building,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.410
you need to choose one or more off these.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.920
But you won't be able to understand or used these projects without understanding the core

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.470
concepts.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.200
Offspring.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.650
And that's what this course is focused on were to talk about spring core and understand

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.340
some of the core functionalities offspring,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.650
and that will enable you to understand the news any off these models.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.850
What we cover in this course.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.710
If you wake up in each our developer in the middle of the night and asking mortars for

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.140
everything about spring,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.890
he's going to say dependency,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.540
injection in motion,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.410
off control,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.360
aspect oriented programming.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.200
And he would go back to sleep Well,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.640
will give a great deal off attention to these concepts,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.180
and in addition to that,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.750
we will also cover a host off other concepts that you're seeing on the screen.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.150
Obviously,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.100
some of these may seem strange to you at this point,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.570
but I assure this course is going to cover every core concept offspring in great detail.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.260
I trust my abilities off teaching,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.010
and I understand the fact that you are a big nervous spring.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.680
So I will start from scratch and a guarantee that the course will be a great value.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.650
Add for your professional growth.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.720
Just continue watching the free preview videos,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.060
and I'm sure he will like them.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.350
I will see you soon
