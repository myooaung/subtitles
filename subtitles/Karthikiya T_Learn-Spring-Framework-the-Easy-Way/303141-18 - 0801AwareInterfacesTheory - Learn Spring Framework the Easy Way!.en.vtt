00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
so far,

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.600
we had explored all the phases involved in the being life cycle.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.920
But one thing that we had left out is this face haven't office call back method that comes

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.150
in picture right after the dependencies are injected and before initializing method.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.870
Well,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.110
there are hosts off interfaces you can use in your being to get access to some spring

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.100
specific objects to do a variety off things.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.580
Basically watch it would do is you would implement one off the interfaces so called ever

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.470
interfaces.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.970
And when you do,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.460
spring will take care off,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.150
injecting its respect to object into your being.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.660
We're going to take a look at all those examples in this chapter.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.820
I also would like to take a moment to explain how our code is organized for this chapter.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.360
Instead of creating multiple projects for each and every example for this chapter,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.950
I have created all the examples in a single project.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.560
Once we import the project that is bundled along with this chapter,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.670
you should be able to locate all these packages.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.350
Well,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.250
each and every individual package responds to a unique example.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.730
For example,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.440
this package in here that ends with be any stands for being named ever here.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.390
We had used the being named ever interface to get the being name.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.200
And if you expand it,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.510
he would see all its files in here that we're going to work on to demonstrate that specific

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.410
example.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.440
And in addition to that,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.950
we also have the Java convict file that corresponds to this package or this example.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.790
And the name ends would be any.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.570
Similarly,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.050
we also have the XML file associated with it.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.370
Likewise,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.350
we have a couple of other examples and their associated conflict files.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.750
I just want to let you know before we move on.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.540
All right,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.370
I'll see you soon.
