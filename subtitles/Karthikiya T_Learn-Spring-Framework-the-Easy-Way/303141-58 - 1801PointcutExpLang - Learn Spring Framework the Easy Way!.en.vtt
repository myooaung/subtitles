00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Okay,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.030
We already know what is the point cut in this chapter.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.430
We're going to talk about so called a point.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.210
Could expression language the point Could expression language would help us target a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.510
specific set of joint points where we won't apply the aspect on.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.080
But before we dive in,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.680
let us try to understand what is a point cut signature.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.500
The point cut signature would help us express the point cut in more readable manner.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.650
Let's take a look at an example off point cuts it nature and then you'll understand better

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.050
So what I have here is the same example that we had looked at in our previous chapter,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.650
.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.270
and this time let us make use off the point.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.780
Could expression inside the point get annotation as off Now,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.000
in our examples,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910
we expressed our point.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.350
Could expression in the advise itself in this case as part of the before annotation,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:09.180
I'm going to copy this and make it part off the point Qattan notation as simple as that.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.750
But he can't just specify the point could annotation anywhere in the class.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.280
Former leaving would specify annotations a direct free level or it matter level so way to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.710
sort off introduce an empty method that does nothing.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.210
And the purpose of that method is just to hold this expression.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.470
So I'm just simply going to copy this from here.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.530
And although control shift all to import the point cut class so that we can use that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.060
annotation and once you do that,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.970
you can just call.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.850
This method has bottled the advice in this manner.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.550
Now this is as good as he specified the following expression right here.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.880
The advantage off it is the court will look more readable.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.540
Also,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.020
it would say some typing because next thing that you want to use the same expression,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.990
you don't have to remember and type the entire expression.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.430
Instead,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.350
you can just call this method just as we did in here and looks like we have the same

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.750
expression going on in all these advises.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.780
So we can know just simply copy it all over and things will work as usual.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.670
And if you want to make changes to this expression,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.280
you can just change it over here and it would get reflected everywhere you're using it.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.360
So that's the beauty off the point cut signature that's on the program and make sure things

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.750
are still working and it's working.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.070
Hold.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.650
It will continue from next video
