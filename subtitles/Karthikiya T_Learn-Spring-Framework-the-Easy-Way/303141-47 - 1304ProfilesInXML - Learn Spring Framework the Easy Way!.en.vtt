00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
in this way,

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.050
they were going to take a look at how we can configure profiles in case off XML conflict.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.570
So just as we had a couple of Java conflict files for each profile,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.250
we now have a couple off maximal files corresponding toe each profile.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.950
And the way you specify the profile is by using this attribute profile with its name inside

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.150
the bean stank.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.900
So whatever the beans that you define inside the bean stag would be qualified for that

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.310
particular profile Assassin Plaza.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.500
Similarly,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.890
we have production profile specified in here and from our main class.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.050
All I'm trying to do,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.870
he is instead of performing the scan off a package to find the conflict files in case off

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.660
XML,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.950
I have to know load them.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.090
And here I'm trying to use a regular expression.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.640
So this instruction will actually choose all the convict files that start with this name,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.060
followed by any sequence of characters and with dot xml extension Jasim al Assad for on the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.760
program.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.050
Depending on the enrollment,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.350
you would see the result task simple as that.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.550
And just as with Java con Vic,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.090
you can just simply use one single XML file.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.050
And for that we have to get it off these instructions and space for your conflict file

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.150
right here.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.460
It's as simple as that.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.660
And here's the file.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.660
So this time we have multiple profiles in the same conflict file,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.140
and for this you're going to be using the nested bean stag.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.870
So here it is for the development profile,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.350
and here he would mention all the list of beans that you want them to be qualified for

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.400
development profile.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.430
Similarly,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550
we have another one for production,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.010
just simple as that.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.850
It's on the program and see the result.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.250
All right,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.390
I'll see you soon.
