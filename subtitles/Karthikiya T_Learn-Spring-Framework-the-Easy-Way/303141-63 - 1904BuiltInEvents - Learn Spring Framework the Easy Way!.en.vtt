00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.150
spring publishers certain application context related events by default,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.030
and it would like to listen to them.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.860
He can use the sanitation.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.400
He went listener to listen to particular events.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.650
For example,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.870
this even didn't hear Context Refreshed Event would be published whenever the context gets

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.550
refreshed.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.670
Similarly,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.690
we have events for context.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.230
Stop,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:36.400
start and close and here are there even handling code for each one of those events.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.820
And as you might have guessed in this case,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.900
the even classes as well as the publisher,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.550
Cord is reciting in the spring framework,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.750
and they get triggered when one of these operations would take place.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.600
But if you'd like to listen,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.840
you can listen to those events and do something meaningful.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.110
Typically,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.540
all these evens would be used internally by spring framework.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.050
We don't use them as often as the custom events and the real usage and the significance off

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.340
custom evens would come into picture when you're developing a spring application using

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.450
Spring Embassy.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.310
But since we're concerned with the spring core module at the moment,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.100
we just take a look at a very simple example off event in spring and that would sell fires

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.250
to understand the behavior and the core functionality off events.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.230
All right,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.130
I'll see you soon
