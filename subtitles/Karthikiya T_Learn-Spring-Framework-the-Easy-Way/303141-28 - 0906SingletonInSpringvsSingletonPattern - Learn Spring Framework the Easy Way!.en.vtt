00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
I gave an example off Singleton descent Patton to experiencing Wilton in spring.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.480
However,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.200
they're a little different from each other in the single ton designed Patton.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.660
The Singleton instance would be unique,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.940
per jbm,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.030
but whereas in spring it is unique,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.180
per container and pour bean,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.950
let me explain what I mean.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.650
So what I have here is on simple being with the default constructor and inner conflict file

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.350
have declared a couple of beans.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.650
Now do taken note that these two beans,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.150
the long the same class,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.170
but the only difference is their name.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.450
And from all main logic,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.450
all I'm trying to do is to retrieve those beans.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.220
And then I'm trying to print the hash cord.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.550
Now what the hash could be same are different.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.250
We'll ask for the singleton designed pattern that we had talked about.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.080
They're supposed to be same,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.710
but in spring,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.250
like had all that I mentioned.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.750
The Singleton instance is Par Bean with a unique name.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.770
So this in here would actually result in two different hash cords.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.260
Let's on the program and see the result and Harris.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.110
So that's one quick point to note.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.340
Hold it.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.240
That's about it.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.450
I will see you soon
