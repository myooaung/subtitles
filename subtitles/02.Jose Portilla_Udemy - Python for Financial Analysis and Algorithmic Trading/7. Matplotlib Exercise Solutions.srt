1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,780
All right here I am the notebook for the most part lip exercises.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,800
Let's go ahead and jump right in and get started.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,850
We're going to go out and run that first cell to get the data.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:27,070
And let's go at an import map plot lived up high plots as Piazzi and map plotted in.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,570
Now there's one more question which is what Comanche is if you are using a Jupiter note book and as

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,400
a reminder that would be Piel Tiede that show at the end of all your plotting commands.

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,800
Let's to sort of exercise one.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,600
We want to create a figure object called fig using Pilat figure.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,170
All right.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:50,390
So this is just the object oriented method of using Map Cutlip where we say fig is equal to peel T-Dog

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,180
figure and then we want to use add underscore axes to add a set of axes to this figure.

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:05,370
And I'm going to go in and say x is equal to Fig and underscore axes.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,700
And we actually get the position we wanted that 0 0 1 1.

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,040
And then finally I wanted to plot x comma y on that and run this.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,550
OK it looks like we have a good match here and we want the labels and titles to match below.

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:28,620
So if we go ahead and set that in we want to say set X label

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:41,910
to be X and then x whip's x set y label TB Y.

18
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,150
And we also want to set the title and it should have just been a simple title.

19
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,890
All right.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,510
So what do we do here.

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,660
We went ahead and created a figure object added a set of axes a figure object plotted on that figure

22
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,440
object and then set the X label the y label and the title.

23
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,220
Let's go ahead and move on to exercise 2 which is a very similar exercise.

24
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,310
We're going to say fig is equal to peel T-Dog figure to create the figure object.

25
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:20,290
And then we want to put two axes on it x 1 the next to go and say x 1 and x 2 and I'm going to say fig

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,910
thought add underscore axes.

27
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,660
First one is located at 0 0 1 0 1.

28
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,530
That's the larger one.

29
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:39,670
And then the second one is located at 0.2 point five point two point two.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,160
It's going to run that and it looks like we get a same result here.

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,010
Great.

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,640
Now continue this exercise we want to do is plot both x and y on both axes here.

33
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,060
Let's go ahead and add that into the cell.

34
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:03,040
So I will say x 1 plot x y and x to plot x y.

35
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,800
And here we have the same plot right here.

36
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,260
You want to be red.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,970
You could have just added in the color arguments red

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,410
you just pass in a string and now it will be red to match this lower plot.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,620
And then if you wanted to you could have also added in the X labels and the y labels it's good to move

40
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,980
on to exercise three which was create the plot blow by adding to access to a figure object at these

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,110
specific canvas points.

42
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,620
All right.

43
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,210
So not as much guidance though on exercise 3.

44
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,400
First thing I want to do is create a figure object something to say fig is equal to peel t the figure

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,220
and then the next thing I want to do is begin to add the sets of axes.

46
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,010
I want to say x is equal to Fig dot axes.

47
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,420
And we'll put them at the same locations that were requested.

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:12,760
I will say x 2 is equal to Fig dot and underscore axes or we'll set these at point to point five point

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,830
four point four.

50
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,160
All right.

51
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,170
Running that looks like you get the same result and then coming up next you wanted to use the x y and

52
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,800
z arrays to recreate this plot below.

53
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:32,600
Let's go ahead and check out that plot below to comment these out and bring this a little closer so

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,350
we can see it.

55
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,770
Let me zoom out a little bit.

56
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,800
OK.

57
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,260
So it looks like we have a couple of things going on here in the outer Plaut we have X versus Z.

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,140
Let's go ahead and add that in.

59
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:53,210
So in the large plot which has X in our case it's going to plot x versus Z and I'm actually going to

60
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,350
set the labels for that.

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:09,670
So the X label wups set X label set that to X and X the set y label set that to Z.

62
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:18,980
So this is the large plot and now it's going to talk about the insert plot so we take a look at the

63
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,330
insert plot has going on.

64
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,370
It's going to be X by Y over here it looks like the title is zoom.

65
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:40,610
So I'm going to go ahead and say X plot x y and then I'm going to set the title to be zoom and I'm also

66
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:48,670
going to go ahead and set those labels to be X and then or the Y to be y.

67
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,270
You know we're actually not quite finished yet let's go and run this and see what difference we get

68
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,250
so note right now.

69
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,060
I made a mistake that should have been on the insert.

70
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:06,530
So this should have been x 2 for all of these it's go ahead and run this and this is looking OK.

71
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,010
But there's still a difference here.

72
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:15,580
Notice on the zoom the x and y limits X goes from 20 to 22 and y goes from 30 to 50.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,390
Here we're just using the default limits.

74
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Let's go in and change those on the insert.

75
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,480
That's going to be X to dot

76
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,910
set X slim and we want to go from 20 to 22.

77
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,740
Add that in 20 to 22.

78
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:42,460
And I'm also going to set the while him and if we scroll back down we can see the Whyland went from

79
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,270
30 to 50.

80
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,450
So we'll say 30 comma 50 in this list run that.

81
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,150
And now we can see that we're matching completely on both the insert and the outer plot.

82
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,100
All right now we're on exercise four.

83
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,770
Let's go ahead and use that subplots to recreate this plot below.

84
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,740
I'm going to say Fig.

85
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:11,830
Come axes is equal to peel T-Dog subplots and one row by two columns.

86
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,700
Let's go in and run.

87
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,040
That's And looks like we get that output correctly.

88
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,620
Now we want to plot x and y and x versus Z on the axes and I want you to play around with the line with

89
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,610
and style.

90
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
Let's see if we can match these up correctly.

91
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,180
I'm going to go ahead and plots over here.

92
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,410
Let me empty that out.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,910
And let's go ahead and say xes 0 members using subplots now.

94
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,230
So we're going to be able to iterate or call the sequence of the array of axes.

95
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:56,350
So I'm saying axes zero plot and it looks like I'm going to go ahead and mess around this would say

96
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:06,540
x y and on the axes one will go in and plot x z.

97
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,710
You know it's going to set these colors so we'll see that color for the second one to be red and it

98
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,420
looks like the line with a little ticker.

99
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,460
And then this one.

100
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,670
The first one looks like let's go in and set the color to be blue as a string.

101
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,960
And it also looks like the line style LS is a dashed line.

102
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,670
Go and add that in.

103
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,590
It also looks like it's a little thicker sole but in LW we call three it's going run this.

104
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,250
See if we get everything looking OK.

105
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:41,810
All right.

106
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,350
Not bad.

107
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,830
Looks like we're getting a match.

108
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,140
And now we want to see if we could resize the plot by adding in this Fig's size arguments.

109
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,560
Let's go in and check that out.

110
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,780
Remember we can just add fig size arguments into the subplots call so we can say Fix size is equal to

111
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,210
and looks like we want wide and short.

112
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,250
So we want the first number to be larger so some wider numbers which just well in the second number

113
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,060
to be smaller so we're going say 12 to.

114
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,740
And if we run that looks like we're going to match to the second plot over here.

115
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,690
And they also messed around the stiles a little bit so switch it up on us.

116
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,560
We can go out and do that ourselves.

117
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,620
We just say something like this over here is equal to dash lines.

118
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,910
Now we switched it and matched it.

119
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,550
All right.

120
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,340
That's it for the exercises for Matt plotless.

121
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,730
Hopefully really drilled in as far as the syntax for using Object Oriented map plot live.

122
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:44,140
All you have to do is say call the figure axes to the figure and then plot on those axes or if you're

123
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:51,370
using subplots as in the last problem call fig come axes to peel t those subplots and then iterate through

124
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,490
those axes or call using the array of axes to plot on each particular subplot.

125
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
That's really all there is to it.

126
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,030
Go ahead and review the solutions book in case any of this was unclear or feel free to post a question

127
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,950
to the Q&amp;A forums.

128
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,150
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
