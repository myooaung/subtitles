Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,530
Welcome to the Quanto open pipeline series where we discuss filters and screens.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,990
So we're going to continue learning about pipelines and filters and screens basically allow you to take

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,420
an asset and a time stamp and then return a boolean and the screen portion of it allows you to actually

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,000
execute those filters in your pipeline.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
The best way to learn about this is just by coding them out.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,430
So let's hop over back to that same research notebook we were using in the last lecture.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,460
OK so here we are back in the Jupiter notebook.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,390
Let's quickly review the make pipeline function from the previous lecture in the previous lecture we

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,940
had a couple of factors such as the 10 day simple moving average the 30 day simple moving average grabbing

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,470
the latest close prices.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,820
And then we had this custom factor or the combined factor of percent difference or percent DFS.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,870
And it just calculated the percent difference between the 10 day and 30 day simple moving averages.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,430
Now let's go ahead and create a filter off of this.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,580
Now the filter is essentially just going to be a comparison operation against one of the factors you

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,200
imported or created.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,920
So for example we can say if we remember if we run this show this again I run those three cells I can

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,880
see percent difference is sometimes negative and that it's sometimes positive which makes sense.

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,690
So we're going to do is let's say we only wanted to grab where percent difference happened to be positive

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,150
or we can do is falling will say

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,650
PERQ filter percent filter whatever you want to call this and we'll grab where percent difference is

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,360
greater than zero.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,090
And then we're going to do is adding a new column here and we'll have this be something like we can

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,600
just say percent filter and pasand the actual filter itself.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,130
So let's run that make sure it worked out for us and he can see our new percent filter column.

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,970
Remember a piece or a filter in general takes in an asset and some sort of time stamp and then returns

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,380
a boolean So you're taking in the time stamp and the asset and it's returning a boolean.

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,370
Now that Bulleen is then calculate on top of a factor so keep that in mind as well.

29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,460
So we can see here that false this is not Graydon's zero.

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,790
Falses not ground zero and true this is greater than zero.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,640
So let's actually discuss the screen.

32
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,260
Typically you're not just going to ask for a filtered column where you want to do is actually execute

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,160
that filter.

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,620
And the way to do that is with the following method.

35
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,600
When we zoom in here so it's a little clear here we already have the columns argument inserter pipeline.

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,890
We're going to add a new argument and that argument is going to be called screen and that screen argument

37
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,390
isn't going to allow us to actually execute the filter so I'll say screen is equal to.

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,610
And then you just pass in the filter itself.

39
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,560
So we're going to run that again grab our results and you'll notice you only get back where the filter

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,480
happens to be true.

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,330
So you see true true true.

42
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,490
And all these percent differences happen to be above zero.

43
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,980
Now let's say you wanted to do the opposite.

44
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,470
You want it to just quickly reverse this filter.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,950
Well one way you could do that is instead of saying greater than zero you could say less than zero.

46
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,860
But what's nice about using the screen methodology is you can put the tilde symbol there and it will

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,990
reverse the screen for you.

48
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,030
So let's run that and I can see you have the opposite everywhere where the filter was false.

49
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,390
So that's the way you can use filters and screens.

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,150
And that's also how you can then reverse the filter.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,110
What's also nice about this is that you can combine filters sourcecode and create another filter.

52
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,530
So we're going to say Pearch filters percent difference greater than zero.

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,450
And then we'll say the small price is equal to.

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,330
Let's go ahead and grab the latest close price have it be less than $5 and I'm filtering on two things.

55
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,110
I want the percent difference to be positive.

56
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,650
And then I want the latest close price to be less than $5.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,780
So relatively small small price stocks I mean it's hard to tell because we're not really asking for

58
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,960
market cap or that sort of thing but I was kind of low priced stocks.

59
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,590
So in order to actually combine these into a single filter.

60
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:21,510
So we're going to combine filters right now what you end up doing is you say something like final filter

61
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,890
is equal to and then you just use logical operators to combine your comparison operators.

62
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,100
So say Tilke percent filter here.

63
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,640
And you're going to use ampersand and then you use a pipe operator for or case you want to combine them

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,020
that way.

65
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,880
But we're going to say Pearch filter and small price.

66
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,610
So it was a little different between pythons built in and in OR.

67
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,690
But that happens to do with the same logic when we're discussing panderers comparisons the fact that

68
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,670
the truth series ends up being ambiguous so you need to use either ampersand or that or operator.

69
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,220
And then if you want knots it's going to be an exclamation point.

70
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,530
But so far we just combined those two filters the percent filter and small price and then we call that

71
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,690
final filter.

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:12,600
So let's go ahead and for our screen we'll pass the final filter so we're going to run that run that

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,690
run that.

74
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,080
And you'll notice our present filter happens to be true for all of them which makes sense because it's

75
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,490
part of the final filter that has to be greater than zero percent difference and we also have small

76
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:23,980
price.

77
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,950
So notice all the close prices are less than $5.

78
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,270
All right.

79
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,910
That's really all we need to know about using a filter and then using screen to actually execute the

80
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,780
filter.

81
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,210
So again all I need to do to create a filter is simply grab a factor and then use a comparison operator

82
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,710
on it.

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,670
If you want to combine multiple filters just use logical operators in this case ampersands and then

84
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:50,160
the pipe operator that you can passes in to grab a new column and then play around with the empanadas

85
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,480
Or you could just pass it into screen and then actually filter out the results when you run the pipeline.

86
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,620
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
