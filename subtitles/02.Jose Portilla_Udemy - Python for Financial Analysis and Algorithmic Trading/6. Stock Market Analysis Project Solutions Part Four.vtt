00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.780
Hello everyone and welcome to part four of the solutions lectures for the stock market analysis project.

2
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.120
So this last part of the project focuses on cumulative returns.

3
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
So let's discuss what that actually means and then we'll head over to the Jupiter notebook and answer

4
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.710
those last few questions.

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.090
A cumulative return is the aggregate amount and investment has gained or lost over time independent

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.000
of the period of time involved.

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.960
So there's a little bit different than just the stock price of the current day because it's going to

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.000
take into account the daily returns.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.470
Now keep in mind the simple calculation that we're going to be showing here doesn't take into account

10
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.380
stocks that give back a dividend.

11
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.540
So let's say that there is a stock ABC and that's actively being traded on some sort of exchange like

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.220
the New York Stock Exchange.

13
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.410
Now this company ABC has the falling prices correspondence that dates given.

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:04.770
So we can see here the first four days of the year 2018 the price goes $10 $15 $20 and $25.

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.690
So the thing we calculated earlier in the previous lecture was that daily percent return.

16
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.840
So that daily return is the profit or loss made by the stock compared to the previous day a value of

17
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.260
one would indicate a profit.

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.350
And similarly a value below 1 it would indicate a loss.

19
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.460
Now we actually expressed this as a percentage in order to convey the information a little bit better.

20
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.160
So when expressed as a percentage the value is above zero.

21
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.570
The stock has given you a profit.

22
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.730
Otherwise it's giving you a loss.

23
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.110
So for example if we have those four dates with the 10 15 20 25 the daily return is going to be in comparison

24
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.930
to its price of the previous day.

25
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.180
So the very first one we're just comparing it to itself so there's really no percent daily return there.

26
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.360
But for the next day when it jumped up to $15 we can see we had a 50 percent daily return.

27
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.700
The very next day when it jumps from 15 to 20 you get a 33 percent return then on that last day when

28
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.120
it jumps from 20 25 to a 20 percent return which makes sense because it's going up $5 every day but

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.870
everyday you have more money to start with see it 10 15 20 25.

30
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.020
Which is why your daily return starts going down.

31
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.090
So that's what we previously calculated.

32
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.450
So this brings us to the cumulative return while daily returns are useful.

33
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.160
It doesn't really give the investor an immediate insight into the gains that he or she had made till

34
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.590
the current date especially if the stock is very volatile.

35
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.370
So a cumulative return is computed relative to the day the investment was actually made.

36
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.300
If cumulative return is above 1 you're making a profit.

37
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.800
Otherwise you're still in the loss.

38
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.840
So what does a cumulative return looks like.

39
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.960
Is the following.

40
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.940
You have your same prices 10 15 20 25.

41
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.950
But if you bought in at the very first day at $10 the cumulative return is going to constantly be comparing

42
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.240
to the price that you actually bought into which is $10.

43
00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.380
So you can see cumulative return is expressed as a percentage cheere 100 150 percent 200 percent 250

44
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.000
percent.

45
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.500
So that price keeps rising.

46
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.900
Comparison to that first day that you bought it.

47
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.550
You get that positive return.

48
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.000
So the formula for a cumulative daily return is the following and we'll see this and a better font.

49
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.860
And the actual Jupiter notebook but it's basically your investment is equal to one plus the return times

50
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.700
the investment team minus one.

51
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.640
So here we can see that we're just essentially multiplying our previous investment.

52
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.950
But T minus one by one plus our percent returns in Pavlos actually makes it really easy to compute if

53
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.810
it's Prod. method.

54
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.010
So it is it's a cumulative product method and we're going to be using that actually calculate this of

55
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.570
pandas so let's jump to the Jupiter notebook and actually code through this and answer those last couple

56
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.430
of questions.

57
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.370
I'll hop over to Jupiter notebook now.

58
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.010
Okay here I am at the Jupiter notebook and you can see here I'm at the last section on cumulative daily

59
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.040
returns and everything we just discuss right now here for you as well.

60
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.370
And as you can see here is kind of a better formatted version of that formula written in late latex

61
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.600
and we can also see the corresponding pand this code for it.

62
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.400
So we're going to do is create a cumulative return column for each car companies data frame and we essentially

63
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.790
do is just copy what's written here for you.

64
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:23.540
So zoom in one more level here and we're going to say Tesla data frame it's cumulative return it's going

65
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:33.220
to be equal to 1 added to the Tesla returns column that we created and then we're going to take the

66
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.140
cumulative product of it.

67
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.750
So what does it just return as a cumulative product over the requested access.

68
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.430
In this case we can just go with the default access.

69
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.340
So if we take a look at this and then call Tesla I can see the cumulative return here expressed as that

70
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.000
last column and what the cumulative return is doing.

71
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.770
It's comparing your Basically your cash out option at this particular day relative to the very first

72
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.070
day that we invested.

73
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.800
Assuming that we invested on January 3rd we can see that we would have lost until we actually reached

74
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.120
January 11.

75
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.630
That's when we have a positive Culina return the other way around to think about the daily returns our

76
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.480
original data column I can see just based off day to day.

77
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.630
So we start off negative negative negative and then positive from the previous day.

78
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.100
But still in reference to our original investment we would have still been at a loss until we sold on

79
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.700
the 11th.

80
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.120
So that's kind of the difference here.

81
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.770
You're taking into account the entire time period and the very first point that you invested so that's

82
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.550
for Tesla we're just going to kind of copy and paste that code for the other two data frames here as

83
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.830
we've been doing so.

84
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.980
Tesla we're going to change this to be forward and then we'll change this one as well to be forward

85
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.930
and we'll do the same for General Motors or GM over here.

86
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.540
And say GM OK.

87
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.020
So now we want to do is plot the cumulative return columns against the time series index in which stock

88
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.360
showed the highest return for $1 invested and which showed the lowest.

89
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.380
So all we need to do is actually just plot out the columns themselves will say Tesla grabbed that cumulative

90
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:26.300
return call in that we just created and then I'm going to plot it with the label Tesla we'll give it

91
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:37.010
a fixed size of 16 by 8 and then we're just going to do the same for Ford.

92
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:46.060
So I'll say Ford cumulative return plot that give it a label of Ford and then we'll say General Motors

93
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.450
cumulative return plot.

94
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.010
Give it a label and it's going to be General Motors.

95
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.440
And if I just say Pulte thought legend OK.

96
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:06.120
So if we run this we get this out and we can see here that clearly Tesla had the largest return cumulative

97
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.030
wise.

98
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.060
They all start off pretty similar but once Tesla starts jumping you can see that has a similar relationship

99
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.200
to its opening price.

100
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.090
If you want to see who had the lowest return you can see Ford here has a little bit below General Motors

101
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.550
now it's actually compare tests or a Ford and General Motors more closely we should probably just eliminate

102
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.980
Tesla.

103
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.340
So I can comment it out and then do this plot here that kind of shows a nicer plot we can change this

104
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:38.170
figure size so it's not so blurry that in here and there we can see the killer return between Ford and

105
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:44.440
General Motors because the Ford a little bit less than General Motors so had you invested $1 at the

106
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.960
very first time point and you sold at the very end of this it would have been back with like a dollar

107
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.890
and seventy cents for General Motors and Ford you would have been about a dollar and ten cents ish.

108
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.130
OK.

109
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.360
So everything we did for this project consisted of pretty basic analysis and really it was to review

110
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.060
the library so we covered in that first half of the course.

111
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.040
The second half the course we're going to focus a lot more on the actual algorithmic trading and the

112
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.290
financial analysis aspects of the course we're also going to really dive into functionality designed

113
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.930
specifically for time series so how do you actually analyze a time series using mathematics.

114
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.980
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section of the course.
