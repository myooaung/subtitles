00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,520
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on order books.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,220
So let's say you've decided to either buy or sell a stock.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,410
You end up logging on to your brokerage account like Robin Hood on your phone or e-trade Ameritrade

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,860
etc. then you click on the stock either want to buy or sell.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,300
And then you either pay or receive money.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,010
But what is actually happening when you click that buy or sell button.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,100
Let's go ahead and go through the process.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,900
The first thing you end up doing is when you click that button an order gets created and an order should

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,740
include the following information it needs to include buyers cell symbol number of shares limit or market

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,630
and then the price.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,650
So let's actually discuss each of these.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,790
First off you need to indicate whether you want to buy the stock or sell the stock.

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,950
The next thing is to actually say what stocks you want to actually buy or sell.

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,210
And that is the actual symbol for example for Apple stock.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,370
You would put AAPL then the next piece of information that's needed is the number of shares how many

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,490
shares of Apple do you actually want to buy or sell.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,430
The next piece of information that's needed is limit or market.

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,810
So what does that actually mean.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,120
Well if you have a limit order then you end up also passing in a price and that is the price limit that

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,310
you're either going to buy or sell out.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,040
So let's imagine that you're going to buy a stock and you put a limit with that that basically indicates

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,130
that you're willing to buy a piece of apple in this case or whatever stock you want to buy a certain

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,700
number of shares of a stock but you're only willing to pay up to a limit.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,480
So that is the limit price that you're willing to pay up to now for a sell order.

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,060
It's essentially the same thing except the limit is how low you're willing to go to sell it.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,270
So you end up saying buy or sell Simbel number of shares limit and then price.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,370
Now typically you're just going to do what's known as a market order and in that case there's no price

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,810
needed.

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,420
You're just going to either buy or sell at whatever the current market will accept.

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,340
So some example orders may look like this.

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,480
You could say buy Apple 200 shares at the market price or sell Tesla for 100 shares at the market price

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,010
or buy HMD 2000 shares but keep the limit.

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:27,930
You're not willing to pay more than $13 and 95 cents or maybe you want to sell Nvidia's stock 150 shares.

34
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,440
However you're not going to sell below $160 an 89 cents.

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,750
So once you sent out an order that's usually to your broker what ends up happening is is it actually

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,180
goes to an exchange and a for a larger order it can go to multiple exchanges.

37
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,010
But we're going to discuss more on that later.

38
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,630
For our scale it typically is all handled even within a broker or to an exchange or something called

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,610
a dark pool which again we'll talk about later.

40
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,050
But once that exchange actually receives your order it goes into an order book.

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,010
So every exchange has their own order book.

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,760
All right so let's actually build out in order book we're going to pretend that we have the order book

43
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,550
for the New York Stock Exchange specifically for A B A C that is the Bank of America stock So A B C

44
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,590
is the ticker and we have our order book.

45
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,410
The New York Stock Exchange just opened and we're going to get our first buy order.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,030
So the very first order that comes in is a buy order for Bank of America stock that goes into this biase

47
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,100
order book and they want to buy 200 shares.

48
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,330
And the limit of their price they're willing to pay is one hundred ninety nine dollars and 95 cents.

49
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,200
So right now there's no one selling.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,630
It's still the very first order that came into the market.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,670
And we need to wait till someone comes in and they want to sell that stock.

52
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,370
So boom we get our first sell order and this person selling Bank of America 100 shares.

53
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,500
And the limit they're willing to sell at $199 in 90 cents.

54
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,880
Then it comes in another sell order make America 50 shares limit $199 91 cents.

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,400
That another one hundred ninety nine.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,250
Ninety two cents.

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,210
Again Bank of America 50 stock.

58
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,590
So what actually ends up happening here is the person that sent that buy order for 200 shares with the

59
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,880
bid price of $189 and ninety five cents is going to end up getting their shares from these three different

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,740
people.

61
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,080
They're first going to get 100 shares at $199 and 90 cents then the next 50 shares are going to come

62
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,260
in and they're going to pay 1 9 9 and 91 cents for those in their last 50 shares to make up their total

63
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,330
order of 200.

64
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,820
It's going to end up being $199 and 92 cents for those 50 shares.

65
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,530
So you can see they paid different prices for different portions of their shares.

66
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,200
However all those prices ended up meeting their bid price of $189 in 95 cents.

67
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,720
So that's the very basics of how a very simple order book would work.

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,820
Now keep in mind for a very popular stock there's hundreds if not thousands of orders coming in all

69
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,140
the time.

70
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,170
So this would happen very very quickly.

71
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,440
So what are the real order book actually look like.

72
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,320
Well usually have to pay for a particular service to see the book.

73
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,830
But here we can get kind of an idea for some Nasdaq book viewer and there you can see an example.

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,500
You see the bid price in the ask price and you have the ID basically telling you the marketplace provider

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,470
here and you can see the different exchanges Nasdaq et cetera and they're kind of lining up by not just

76
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,020
color but also by the bid and ask price in the center.

77
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,810
So on your left hand side you can see the buy orders for Google or alphabet.

78
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,460
And then on the right hand side you can see the sell orders and how they're matching up.

79
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,950
So that's essentially what a book looks like in real life.

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,660
All right.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,510
So the question arises How does an order actually get to the exchange.

82
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,880
And this is actually now a little more physical.

83
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,270
So we're going to do now is walk through the steps and we're also going to explain how something called

84
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,120
HFT or high frequency trading firms actually works and what they end up doing is they attempt something

85
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,770
called latency arbitrage.

86
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,840
So let's talk about all this OK so let's take a look at the simplest example possible and this kind

87
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,210
of the classic example of what would happen.

88
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,990
It's not very common that it happens this way.

89
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,770
But this kind of classically the idea of the stock exchange and how it's connected to you.

90
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,600
So for a simple example of you wanting to issue a buy order you end up contacting your broker and this

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,630
is usually done through an app or a Web site and you say hey I want to buy let's say ten units of Apple

92
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,390
stock.

93
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,000
Your broker then gets in that order that we just discussed earlier and then they send it to one of the

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,770
exchanges and it goes into their order book you get matched up for a person selling stock and then it

95
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,390
comes back to your broker and then they give you the money back or the stock's back depending if you're

96
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,340
buying or selling.

97
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,520
In this case since you're buying.

98
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,630
To give you the stocks and the broker then take some sort of fee for doing that whole process for you.

99
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,780
Now scenario number two which is kind of a broker buy sell is a little more realistic of what's going

100
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,710
to happen.

101
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,290
Now your broker doesn't just have you as their client.

102
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,940
They may have other clients.

103
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,970
And what happens all the time is that you want to buy a stock and your broker has another client who

104
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,710
wants to sell the same stock.

105
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,800
So what they end up doing is the entire process we discussed earlier except it all gets matched up inside

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,750
of the broker.

107
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,750
So this could all happen within the broker or ever actually reach in the exchange.

108
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,180
However keep in mind by law at least in the United States the broker must provide the same price.

109
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,890
You could have gotten on the exchange.

110
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,470
So whatever the best prices in the exchange the broker must have provided that to you.

111
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,090
If they do the interaction of the broker.

112
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,130
Let's take a look at a third example that involves what's known as a dark pool.

113
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:44,110
Let's imagine that you send a buy order for particular stock to your broker and another person is selling

114
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,390
that same stock to a different broker broken number two.

115
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,760
Could end up happening is that both those orders go to a dark pool first and never actually reached

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,930
the exchanges.

117
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,830
So a dark pool pays brokers to see orders before they hit the exchange.

118
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,200
Now Dark Pools it's a really ominous sounding term but essentially what it is is just a private exchange

119
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,480
or a forum for trading securities.

120
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,340
But unlike stock exchanges dark pools aren't really accessible to the public.

121
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,890
They're not transparent.

122
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,970
So that's why their name is dark pool because you can't actually see what's going on inside them unless

123
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,420
you're the institution that owns them now because of their lack of transparency there is some potential

124
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,210
conflicts of interest by their owners and there can even be some predatory trading practices using HFT

125
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,310
which we can discuss in a little bit.

126
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,890
That's high frequency trading.

127
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,300
But keep in mind that dark pools have actually been around since the 1980s.

128
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,370
And one of the main purposes they serve is if you're a large institutions such as a bank and you want

129
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,000
to sell a million shares of a particular stock or some really large share number of shares that's going

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,380
to cause a big jump or movement you don't really want to do that at the exchange.

131
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,570
Otherwise people get wind of it and they will either Jack up their price when they're selling the stock

132
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,860
because we want to buy a million of them or the price will plummet because you're selling a bunch of

133
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,220
stock you're offloading it all.

134
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,400
So what the dark pool can do because of its lack of transparency to the exchanges is the entire interaction

135
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,110
going to happen within that dark pool.

136
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,190
So you end up affecting the stock price a whole lot.

137
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,600
Somebody to keep in mind is when discussing dark pools in 2014 which is only three years ago.

138
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,700
About 40 percent of all U.S. stock trades didn't actually ever reach an exchange.

139
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,880
And about 15 percent of those trades actually occurred in a dark pool.

140
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,300
So dark pools definitely more and more of these trades are happening inside the dark pools and never

141
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,160
actually reach the exchanges themselves.

142
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,170
So keep in mind moving forward into the future dark pools are becoming more and more important part

143
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,750
of this entire process.

144
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:51,210
And so finally you may have heard of the term high frequency trading or HFT and basically HFT firms

145
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:58,170
what they end up doing is they take advantage of latency differences due to geographical distances and

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,770
these times of latency are on the order of.

147
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:09,060
So this is all happening extremely fast and discussion about HFT as were really popularized by Michael

148
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,040
Lewis his book called Flash Boys and that book is about a banker or a trader.

149
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,620
Brad Katsuyama who was working at the Royal Bank of Canada and he ended up starting the investors Exchange.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,900
So go ahead and read that book if you kind of want a little bit of background behind the shift.

151
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,760
He's how they develop what their purpose was.

152
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,520
But it's really more a story about this person Brad Katsuyama and how the investors exchange got started.

153
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:32,970
I read it.

154
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,690
It was pretty good.

155
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,970
I recommend that though we're going to do is we're going to briefly explain the basic idea of HFT but

156
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,510
keep in mind this is an area that changes extremely fast technology and HFT does serve a purpose and

157
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,870
I explain that later on.

158
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,800
It's not all bad but let's go ahead and explain the idea first.

159
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,630
So let's imagine that you are a large institution or a bank as far as HFT is concerned.

160
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,300
It doesn't really affect people that are operating on the scale we are if you're just selling a couple

161
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,230
thousand dollars or even a couple of thousand shares that's not enough for HFT is actually going to

162
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,170
affect you.

163
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,360
It will affect a very large institution or very large orders.

164
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,530
So if you're a large bank or an institution and you're putting out an order that's large enough that

165
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,370
it actually needs multiple exchanges to fulfill the order.

166
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,200
So we imagine that you're a bank and you're sending in an order for ninety thousand shares or something

167
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,450
and you're going to buy 30 thousand shares from Bhatt's that's another exchange that as that one exchange.

168
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
And then your stock exchange.

169
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,270
You want to buy 13000 shares because the order is large enough that it probably needs to go to multiple

170
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:43,090
exchanges so it ends up happening is it takes about 2 milliseconds between the order first reaching

171
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:48,870
bats and that's physically the closest exchange to this bank and then versus reaching the last exchange.

172
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,990
That's the New York Stock Exchange which happens to be the first away.

173
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,840
Keep in mind things are moving here at the speed of light so two milliseconds is a very short time frame

174
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,860
for reference.

175
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,550
If you blink your eye that takes about 300 milliseconds.

176
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,050
So physically two milliseconds is extremely fast.

177
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:13,150
However what happens is high frequency trading firms they bill were called co-located servers.

178
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,280
And that's basically literally placing their servers as close to the order book server as possible.

179
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:28,670
Now because this HFT firm has built this co-located server it's actually literally placed in their servers

180
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,000
as close to the order book server as possible so they're retrieving that information first.

181
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,950
And what ends up happening is you as a bank or institution send out your order.

182
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,290
And they say OK that by 30 shares at the bats exchange and it's part of this large order and you're

183
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,380
going to need to buy a 30 K from Nasdaq and 30 K from the New York Stock Exchange the HFT happens to

184
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,590
have a co-located server at bats Stock Exchange and they realize this huge orders coming in.

185
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,470
So because of that and due to their technology.

186
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,710
Microwave towers whatever happens to be straight a fiber optic cables cetera.

187
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,250
They have a speed advantage on you and what they can end up doing is while it takes you two milliseconds

188
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:19,880
to reach the New York Stock Exchange they can actually beat you to the New York Stock Exchange and they

189
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,870
take around 476 microseconds.

190
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,370
So they end up doing is they realize you're making a larger order and they beat you to the other exchanges

191
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,800
quickly buy up and kind of raise the price just by a sense it's almost nothing for a larger order since

192
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,450
they know the orders coming in they're virtually guaranteed to make money here.

193
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,530
And by the time your order ends up breach and the other exchanges the price has jumped up a tiny bit.

194
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,520
And that's how an HFT firm can make money.

195
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,680
Now again this is kind of a very simplified version of this and it really only affects larger institutions

196
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,200
are people moving around larger sums of money or larger amounts of shares for us.

197
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,570
It really doesn't affect this.

198
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,210
So again that was a very simplified overview and you can check out the resource links.

199
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,210
If this is a topic that interests you HFT in general is not really relevant for our scale or approach

200
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,770
to trading.

201
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,810
It just happens to exist in the marketplace.

202
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,080
So you should be aware of it.

203
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,040
All right I hope you found those topics interesting.

204
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,150
Again they don't really affect this in any way with what we're going to be end up coding out or how

205
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,520
are you working with finance of Python.

206
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,070
But all those ideas do exist in the marketplace.

207
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,830
We should be aware of them as we continue on through this course in the next lecture.

208
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,970
We're going to discuss short selling and how that actually works.

209
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,520
Thanks and I'll see you there.
