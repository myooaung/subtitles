Welcome everyone to the section on working with pandas with time series data now that we have an understanding

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.950
of how to work with pandas for general data let's go over a few key points of working of time series

3
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.480
data with the panda's library the majority of our data sets will be in the form of a time series that

4
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.690
is it has some sort of date time index and some sort of corresponding value per that date time index.

5
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.570
For example some stock price for a particular date on the index Well we're going to be doing in this

6
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.350
section is learning how to use this special time series features to work the sort of data this section

7
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.760
will cover the following.

8
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.980
We'll talk about that time in the CS.

9
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.200
Talk about time resampling how to work with time shifts and then we'll also discuss Pansy's built in

10
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.750
rolling and expanding methods OK let's get started.

11
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.890
I'll see you at the next lecture.
