00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,620
Hello everyone and welcome to this trading algorithm exercise.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,540
So as I mentioned welcome to your trading algorithm exercise and keep in mind this is really an exercise

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,700
and using to Quanto platform and reviewing everything you've learned such as scheduling functions grabbing

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,920
historical data.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,850
You shouldn't take this as an exercise in learning a real trading strategy while older trading strategies

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,170
did use Bollinger bands which we're going to discuss in just a second.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,210
The actual execution that we show here is really too simple to be effective so keep that in mind.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,490
So we're going to have you execute a very basic blunder bands trading strategy.

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,650
So let's quickly review of Bollinger bands are.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,140
But keep in mind to actually discuss them previously during the rolling mean lectures.

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,130
Bolinger bands record bounce above and below the 20 day rolling mean or rolling average and Bulgar bands

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,220
consist of two bands an upper and lower bound.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,030
The bands are calculated from the 20 the rolling mean and 20 day rolling standard deviation.

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,880
So the way you calculate them is you just take your 20 day rolling average or rolling me and then for

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,220
the upper bound you're going to add on two times the 20 day standard deviation or the 20 day rolling

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,620
center deviation and then for the lower bound you're going to calculate the 20 day average and then

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,650
subtract from that two times the twenty day standard deviation.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,540
And if you actually want to see this implemented go ahead and go back to the pan this time series lecture.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,080
We do have an implementation of these actual bands in case you want to see how to do this pandas.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,910
So we're going to use these bands and compare them to the current price and use that as a trading signal.

21
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,120
So let's see a visual representation of what these bands actually look like.

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:49,290
So if we just plot this out T-Ray have a very simple example of the current price this purple line and

23
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,030
then I have the upper bound and the lower bound and those are my two Bollinger bands and you calculate

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,850
them by calculating the 20 day rolling average or attone they mean.

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,140
And then you add on two times a 20 day rolling standard deviation and that creates your upper bound.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,540
And if you subtract two times to 20 standard deviation that is a 20 day rolling second deviation.

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,300
You end up getting that lower bound.

28
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,710
So we're going to be implementing kind of an extreme version of the boulder band strategy.

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,370
Our basic idea is the following.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,150
If the current price is ever above the upper band we're going to short the stock.

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,850
Now we're going to send 100 percent of our portfolio to short the stock.

32
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,640
If the actual current price is ever below the lower band we're going to go long on the stock and we'll

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,950
have 100 percent our portfolio go long on this so our version of the strategy is extreme in the sense

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,980
that we really only enter exit positions based off the upper and lower bands.

35
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,560
You may want to play around of exiting off some smaller band off the mean.

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,930
Maybe when the price comes back and crosses the 20 day rolling average you exit out of that position.

37
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,490
But our strategy is pretty extreme because we essentially only look at the upper band and a lower band

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
and that's because it's the simplest to.

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,220
So again the strategy is pretty reckless and I would actually never recommend it to anyone.

40
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,860
However it is simpler to implement.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,740
So it's perfect for us to use our practice on the Quanto open platform.

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,200
So you'll be implementing the strategy on the Johnson and Johnson stock although really you can kind

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,430
of play around if any stock you want and you can check out the notebook for the back to start and back

44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,160
end dates so you can make sure that your actual code matches up with the results of the example solution

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
code.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,880
So let's quickly review it using the visual representation the actual strategy that is.

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,240
So what does this actually look like in practice if we implement our strategy.

48
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,540
Well you can see if calculated some upper band that upper Bollinger Band and the lower bowl in your

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,070
band.

50
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,290
And as I'm going along through the time on the x axis if my current price that purple line ever surpasses

51
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,990
the upper band I'm going to take that as a signal that the stock or security is overvalued and will

52
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,060
have to come back down.

53
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,610
So I'm going to short the stock using my entire portfolio.

54
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,110
The other signal I'm going to look for is if the current price ever then goes below the ban on going

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,520
to buying go long on the stock for 100 percent portfolio.

56
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,650
So keep in mind those are my only entrances into the strategy.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,030
If it goes above the band or below the band I'm never going to exit in another fashion.

58
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,050
That's why it's pretty extreme version of this.

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,710
So you're only going to check these bands once per day meaning you will need to use the schedule function

60
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,250
and you can check up the notebook provided for a full overview.

61
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,240
Now all of this seems a bit overwhelming since you've just started learning about Quanto in code along

62
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,640
the solutions lecture first and then go back and see if you can implement it on your own.

63
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,950
All right let's go ahead and get started.

64
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,120
Again remember to check out the trading algorithm exercise notebook for full details on how to implement

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,750
this.

66
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,450
And in the next lecture we'll go over the solutions.

67
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,710
Thanks and I'll see you there.
