00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.920
All right now that we learned about that plot live let's go ahead and have a quick set of exercises

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.020
for you to complete.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.490
And then after this lecture we'll go through the solutions.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.010
This will finish off for us and will then head off to a series of lectures on pandas visualization.

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.750
If you go ahead and go to the visualization that Cutlip pandas folder and then go to the subfolder for

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.510
his or one map plot lib.

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.020
You should see a notebook called Map pilot exercises as well as another note book called Map Cutlip

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.370
exercises solutions.

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.860
We're going to walk through just the exercises notebook.

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.210
Let's go to it now.

11
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.960
OK.

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.150
Here I am at the map plot lip exercises notebook and these are just some exercises for reviewing that

13
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.900
lib.

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.640
Definitely take your time with these.

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.290
If this is your first sign evidently in fact lib it can definitely be tricky to understand at first

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.910
although these are relatively simple plots and they follow along with a lot of what we did in the previous

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.820
three lectures.

18
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.840
If you really dislike that map plotless syntax he found that frustrating just wasn't for you.

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.520
Don't actually worry about it too much because often throughout the course we're going to be using pandas

20
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.480
built in visualization capabilities which are a lot simpler to work with.

21
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.640
However those are built off of that play live which is why it's still so important to get at least some

22
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.120
exposure to plotless.

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.600
And it's quick now all the commands for plotting a figure should go in the same cell separating them

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.730
out into multiple cells in the Juber notebook may cause nothing to show up.

25
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.580
They have a set of exercises here and you have some data.

26
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.330
So remember to run the cell to actually find the data.

27
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.580
You have an x y and z set of arrays.

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.910
You're going to import map lib and then you'll see that live in line.

29
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.940
If you're using a Jupiter notebook and there's a command here like what you use if you're not using

30
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.880
the Juber notebook I'll go ahead and do this first one for you.

31
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.290
So again all you have do for the first want to say import.

32
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.890
Map plotted the PI plot as Piazzi and then you'll set map plot lib in line.

33
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.720
If you aren't using the Jupiter notebook remember at the end of your cell you'll need say peel t that

34
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.320
show or at the end of your code you'll need say PBT touch show to actually show the visualization.

35
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.860
All right.

36
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.760
After that there's Exercise 1.

37
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.410
Once you create this following figure remember that if you're going to create this falling figure here

38
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.490
it's probably a good idea.

39
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.730
You don't overwrite it is if you select the cell and click here insert cell above then you'll have a

40
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.230
little extra cell here to work with.

41
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.500
That way if you run it you don't accidentally overwrite this then exercise to create a figure object.

42
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.430
Put two axes on it x 1 and x 2 again so you don't overwrite this.

43
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.340
You can do just insert cell above or below.

44
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.520
And then you can run stuff in this cell such as Prince high.

45
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.000
And then you won't overwrite the output here then what you're going to do is plot x and y on both axes.

46
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.050
Now again remember this you need everything that corresponds to this particular image in a single cell.

47
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.010
So you can end up doing is copy and paste what you wrote up here to get these two grids to show up and

48
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.830
then paste the here and add in x and y to both axes then you'll continue along.

49
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.560
Create the three here with this particular two sets of grids then you'll copy and paste that here in

50
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.230
add an X Y and Z arrays.

51
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.400
OK.

52
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.980
So continue on to exercise for Petey's subplots and this will just have you practicing a little bit

53
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.730
on subplots and plotting x and y on the axes.

54
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.610
And I want you to play on the line with In Style the way does that to be exactly like this.

55
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.110
Just play around so you can mess around with styling.

56
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.410
And then also see if you can resize the subplots.

57
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.680
OK.

58
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.490
So feel free to treat this as an exercise or if you really want to you can treat it as a code along

59
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.830
hop over to the next lecture.

60
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.710
And we're going to code through solutions.

61
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.350
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
