00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.560
Welcome everyone to this lecture on fut. on Quanto open in this lecture we're going to basically be

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.970
messing around for research in a book on the Quanto open platform and showing you how you can work with

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.840
futures contracts on the Quanto open platform.

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.630
So let's open up our browser and open up and you know book in Quanto.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.330
OK here I am a Jupiter note book on Quanto in as a quick note.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.500
There are going to be a lot of sources of information in the note book that corresponds to this lecture.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.240
So here in the new tab I have open the notebook that we provide because there there's a lot of useful

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.090
lists here that we can't really like type out for you live.

9
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
So I might be hopping back and forth to this tab to show you things like a list of all the available

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.710
features on Quanto in the for now the top over back to this notebook and do a couple of basic imports

11
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.630
are going to be using.

12
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.110
And these are all ones you're already familiar with some pie Pandurs.

13
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.600
And then we'll also important that plotless

14
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.370
all right.

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.930
So remember that a reference to a futures contract can be obtained via the symbols function in futures

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.740
contracts are noted by a base symbol Plus a code for the month and year or of delivery.

17
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.160
So for example if we come over here you have all the available futures you'll notice some of these are

18
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.370
commodities futures some of these are futures based on some sort of index or volatility index et cetera

19
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.570
and we'll discuss later on the differences between them.

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.320
There's also currency futures but we'll kind of focus just on commodity futures.

21
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.740
Those are the easiest to understand because it's something physical.

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.140
But again futures contracts use the symbols function.

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.960
And you have a base symbol Plus a code for the month year of delivery.

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.420
So here something like CNF 16 is a contract for crude oil.

25
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.650
So if you come down here and eventually search for crude oil you'll find that C-L is on this list somewhere

26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.010
around here.

27
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.670
And then once you have the actual commodity or you know contract future you want to trade then you say

28
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.620
the month and then the year.

29
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.630
So January has the month.

30
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.610
2016 is just 16.

31
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.330
So if we come down here a little more there's a list a day in time codes for you.

32
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.280
So you can see every single month has its own particular letter code.

33
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.170
So we're going to do is try to grab natural gas for some maturity date in January 2018.

34
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.870
So if you're reviewing this lecture in the future you may need to change your actual times.

35
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.780
So right now I'm kind of in mid 2017 while I'm filming this.

36
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.630
If you already are way into the future when you're watching this video maybe it's like mid 2018 you

37
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.010
may need to change some of these times for them to make sense to you otherwise you'd just be looking

38
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.100
at futures contracts that have already expired.

39
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.220
So we'll come over here to the notebooks and let's go ahead and grab the future contract data for natural

40
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.080
gas with the maturity of January 2018.

41
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.290
So I say future contract is equal to.

42
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.240
And then I use this symbol's function and then I'm going to pass in my code so the code for natural

43
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.970
gas is ngi and then I end up wanting in January 2018.

44
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.650
So I say F 18 run that and eventually grabbed the information of the future contract so future contract

45
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.530
you can check a bunch of attributes here such as asset name and this sort of thing is one of the very

46
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.660
first things we did when we were learning about research on Quanto Appian.

47
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.940
And remember if we wanted to see everything that was in the future contract we ended up doing was a

48
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.550
little for loop.

49
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.110
So I said something like four key in feature contract and we can pass this as a dictionary that I could

50
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:47.730
print out the key I could print out the future contracts dictionary value at that key and then we could

51
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.450
print out a new line and make sure that's some princes there.

52
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.900
So I can run that so I can see the root symbol the tick size and the exchange it's listed on which is

53
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.010
in New York.

54
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.880
Basically the mercantile exchange that we have the symbol the multiplier et cetera.

55
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.990
So just a bunch of information and then you also have the security ID here that you can reference for

56
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.440
it.

57
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.800
So obviously a long number here.

58
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.440
OK.

59
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.910
So let's actually see what this looks like by kind of plotting out its price.

60
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.330
So to get its price we're going to use the get pricing function that we've used earlier so it's a feature

61
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:33.810
position value is equal to get pricing and then I'm going to pass in my future contract because it basically

62
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.100
already has that security information and then I'm going to person a start date.

63
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.550
Of 2017 0 1 0 1 and then an end dates.

64
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.280
Let's go ahead and say 2018.

65
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:59.820
0 1 0 1 and the field I want or fields I want is price and you can copy and paste this from the notes

66
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.160
because there is a lot of text here that we're typing out.

67
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.480
It's really easy to make typos or just I would recommend is copy and paste it from the notes.

68
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.640
Make sure you don't accidentally have a typo somewhere.

69
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.080
So we're going to do is offer this features position value.

70
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.470
I'm going to go ahead and just say the name of it.

71
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.530
Is equal to the future position value.

72
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.280
Name that symbol.

73
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.770
So that basically just gives us a nice title on our plot when we're about to plot this out to then I

74
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.310
say futures position value that plot.

75
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:44.460
And if I run this I can see I have a nice plot of the price versus the time and this price is per some

76
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.310
unit of natural gas.

77
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.850
So another really useful thing we can do is get historical data and that will basically give us a data

78
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.730
frame that we can play around with and plot out.

79
00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:03.980
So we're going to do is say from Quanto up in loop's not quando Quanto in the research that experimental

80
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.250
and the actual import location may change in the future once this is no longer experimental so keep

81
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.060
that in mind.

82
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.470
I'm going to import history and just so you can kind of see what history is about.

83
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.220
You can say history the under underscore the see underscore underscore and this basically just prints

84
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.280
out the documentation for this history object.

85
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.410
And it just loads a table of historical data.

86
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.360
We've used this before it's really similar to that data that history function that we use in the ID

87
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.250
you pasand some symbol the fields you want price open price volume etc. the frequency start date end

88
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.500
date symbol reference how you handle missing data etc..

89
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.220
So lots of stuff you can do here.

90
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.910
We're kind of already familiar with this given that we've worked with data like history before.

91
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.780
So let's actually say natural gas F 18.

92
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.260
So remember that's the natural gas futures contract for January.

93
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.330
That's the F code 18 is equal to future contract.

94
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.500
And the reason I'm just essentially relabelling future contract is so one I don't have to type as much.

95
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.860
And also it's a little more clear when I'm actually working with.

96
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.470
So this is kind of just for convenience.

97
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.770
Cell Number eight.

98
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:17.270
OK so let's actually grab some historical data on natural gas futures for January 2018.

99
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.750
So I'll say ngi F-18 underscored data this is going to be a data frame we're going to grab our history

100
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.470
function that we just import it and we're going to pass in our future contracts with this future contract

101
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.200
right here that we got earlier get pricing on the symbols excuse me and then we're going to do is pass

102
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.290
in the fields we want.

103
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.170
So I'm going to ask for several fields.

104
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.100
I'll ask for a price.

105
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.740
In fact I'm going to ask for all of them so I'm going to just copy and paste it from here.

106
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.660
So we're going to say price open price volume contract and this has curly braces for a dictionary that's

107
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.500
actually not what we want.

108
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.720
We want a list so don't copy those just have them in kind of the square brackets for a list.

109
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.330
So those are all the fields I want basically to grab everything I'm going to specify that the frequency

110
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.740
of the data I want is just daily definitely don't want to get overloaded with minute by minute information.

111
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.420
And then I'm going to set a start day let's say 2017 06 or 1.

112
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.660
And again the pending or what time in the future are you watching this lecture video you may have to

113
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.640
kind of play around with these technically should be able to do all the same data I'm doing but just

114
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.130
keep that in mind and let's go up to August 1st so basically just two months of data here.

115
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.960
I'm going to run this and once that has grabbed my data for me I'm going to call for the data frame.

116
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.460
And as you can imagine it's probably a really large data frame salaciously the head of it.

117
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.560
And here we go.

118
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:51.710
So I can see right here I have the time stamp the price the open price that time the high price the

119
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.200
low price closing price the volume traded on that day and then the actual kind of official label that

120
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.440
futures contract which is natural gas January 2018 as well as that security ID.

121
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:03.730
OK.

122
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.910
So let's start plotting some of this out so we can get a look at some of this behavior.

123
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.540
Let's go ahead and see the volume traded.

124
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.550
So say natural gas generating data and I'm just going to grab the volume column.

125
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.120
This is just simple Panas code.

126
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:26.770
And then I'm going to plot this out so this will plot out based on kind of a dot to line to dot to line.

127
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.400
I actually like for volume since it's essentially kind of almost categorical per day.

128
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:40.240
We usually set this as some sort of bar plot and then this usually makes a lot more sense so I can see

129
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.560
that the total volume traded on this day happens to be almost 6000 et cetera.

130
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:49.120
You can see some days when it was higher and then some days when it was lower and noticed this day in

131
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.730
particular is really really low.

132
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.570
And if you kind of take a look at it it happens to be July 4th which is a national holiday in United

133
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:00.010
States which is why there's almost no trading activity and you probably get almost no trading activity

134
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.850
for most features especially those based in the U.S..

135
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.740
So what we're going to do now is compare different maturity dates.

136
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.490
Right now we're only dealing with a natural gas future that matures on January 20 18th.

137
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.220
Let's go ahead and see the kind of pricing behavior for crop across different maturity dates.

138
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:27.900
So to do that I'm going to make a list of contracts we'll call these natural gas contracts and the symbols

139
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.290
functions actually really flexible.

140
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.210
It can take in a list of symbols not just a single symbol.

141
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.610
And we discussed that earlier on but we haven't really implemented it.

142
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:42.690
So let's go ahead and say natural gas 17 January 17.

143
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.680
So at the time in Filomena's this has already passed but we are going to grab historical information

144
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.440
off of this and then I'm going to basically just grab a couple of months worth of data for early 2017.

145
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.560
So I'm going to kind of keep copy and paste this go ahead and grab kind of six consecutive months of

146
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.300
data.

147
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.390
So I have one two three one two three.

148
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.880
And then the thing I'm going to change right now these are all at January 2017.

149
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.970
I'm going to change the month codes.

150
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.510
So G is for February.

151
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.330
H is for March and they said are you going to keep going forward in time.

152
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.330
Okay.

153
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.890
And then.

154
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.650
So again that middle letter that I'm changing.

155
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.540
If you come back to the notebook I'm just changing it to these codes.

156
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.100
So right now what I'm going to do is grab a bunch of contracts for different maturity dates.

157
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:38.770
So January 2017 February 2017 March 2017 April 2017 and then May 2017 and at the time of filming these

158
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.360
have actually all expired.

159
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.070
So we'll be able to see the price go up and then come back down as it expires or at least the volume

160
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.450
of trading not the price itself the price won't come down to zero but the volume of trading will come

161
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:55.980
down to zero which makes sense because you're not going to trade a future after it's matured OK once

162
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.760
we've done that.

163
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.020
We're going to create some sort of new data frame we'll call it natural gas.

164
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:08.550
And let's just call it consecutive contracts and I will mention the volume right now so I'll just say

165
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:15.120
volume going to pass in the history function I get a pass in that list of contracts that I just made

166
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.360
there's natural gas contracts.

167
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:21.650
And as far as the fields I want I'm just interested in the volume field.

168
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:27.850
So we're going to see how volume kind of changes as the maturity date changes.

169
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:36.490
And then we're going to ask for frequency to be daily data and let's go ahead and give a start date

170
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.000
and we're actually going to get the start date almost like half a year earlier or let's say even just

171
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.080
a year earlier.

172
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.040
So let's have our start go from January 1st 2016.

173
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:55.520
So again the very first futures contract I'm grabbing right now ends or matures on January 2017.

174
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.320
I'm saying grab me the volume data a year in advance of that.

175
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.760
So you can start treating these futures ahead of time much further in advance which makes sense.

176
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.850
The whole point of a futures contract.

177
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:12.370
So that's why I kind of have a start date that goes way beyond that are way before the actual maturity

178
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:12.770
date.

179
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.700
And then we're going to end.

180
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.060
And then we'll say 2017.

181
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.970
And let's just say 0 8 0 1 like August 1st that we can see all of these kind of dropped down to zero.

182
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.290
So this is way past the end of this one because this one matured in May Okay.

183
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:38.390
So I grabbed all my contracts and now let's go ahead and plot them out or say natural gas consecutive

184
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.590
contract volume.

185
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.960
Let's go ahead and plot it and see what it looks like.

186
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.460
All right so now we can see the actual volume being traded per future contract.

187
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.780
And this is really typical behavior where you kind of see a jump and then come back down as it reaches

188
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.100
the maturity date and you can see all of these come back up then come back down come back up come back

189
00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.650
down.

190
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.070
And the reason I wanted to grab everything from January 2016 is you can see there's actually some light

191
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.620
activity almost a year in advance of the maturity date.

192
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.790
And as you get closer and closer the volume is being traded as people speculate on the price and have

193
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.310
more information closer ties to the price.

194
00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.900
Obviously as you get closer to that maturity date you have a better and better idea of what the actual

195
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:23.240
market price is going to be for whatever contract you're actually trading.

196
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.740
So let's go ahead and kind of cut this off to when the activity gets really hot maybe around October

197
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.920
2016.

198
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.260
So I'm going to copy and paste this Slyne but I'm going to set an excellent on this.

199
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.210
So say X limit and we'll say 2016.

200
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.400
Just say October 1st.

201
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.160
So that's kind of around this market can kind of see it start to pick up and for the end we'll just

202
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.480
say let's keep the same and so we can see them all drop off which is August of 2017.

203
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.430
You can even do a month before that if you really want it to.

204
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.320
So we're going to plot that out.

205
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:03.850
So the limits here and now I see this behavior which is really again typical.

206
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:10.370
So we can see here that trading activity in terms of volume jumps from one contract to the next.

207
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.620
And these transitions happen just prior to the delivery date of each contract.

208
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.660
Now this particular phenomenon actually makes it difficult to work with fut. because maybe you're trading

209
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.300
a particular future or maybe you want to kind of have futures being traded on a more continuous time

210
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.730
skill but unfortunately a future will come up in volume traded and then drastically drop down.

211
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.260
And then finally go to zero.

212
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.730
Once it reached the maturity date you can see here all these zero marks or the monthly marks when that

213
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.080
particular contract has matured.

214
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.680
So because this particular aspect of fut. the fact that they kind of come up and then come down makes

215
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.110
it difficult and it makes a little bit of a hassle.

216
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:54.140
What we can do is we can actually have some sort of underlying future and we're going to call that future

217
00:15:54.170 --> 00:16:01.070
a continuous future and a continuous future is essential is going to be an abstraction over the underlying

218
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.210
either commodities assets or in the seas of futures.

219
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.720
So we're going to go ahead and cover that in the very next lecture and it's going to allow us to kind

220
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.830
of see a more continuous behavior off all of these and there's different times where you can kind of

221
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.320
switch off from one future contract to the next feature contract.

222
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.140
We are not dealing with this kind of weird behavior of up and then back down up and then back down.

223
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:20.790
Okay.

224
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.600
So we're going to cover continue futures in the very next lecture.

225
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.420
But let me give you a quick review of everything we just did here.

226
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.720
So scrolling back up to the top so you have these future contracts and you can just use symbols to actually

227
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.110
grab the information off of them.

228
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.180
And again probably the most important part of all this is you have the name of either the commodity

229
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.080
or the underlying asset the month and then the Year of the maturity.

230
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.310
And if you want the codes for all this go ahead and visit the notebook right now.

231
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.780
This is a list of all the available futures on Quanto Appian.

232
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.910
This may expand or may decrease.

233
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.630
Always reference the documentation and then down again on the notebook we provide there is a list of

234
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.330
time codes.

235
00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.060
So when you have those you can go ahead and build out your future contract.

236
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.110
You can see there's a bunch of information here.

237
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.760
Asset name expiration date etc. you can kind of use get pricing to get pricing information off of this

238
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.040
or if you want historical information you can use history function to essentially grab all the information

239
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:16.830
that's available.

240
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:23.660
Price open high low close volume and contract and the contract is just a particular label on what actual

241
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.160
particular contract we're dealing with.

242
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.500
And you'll see when we do have continuous feature that Colin's going to become a lot more important.

243
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.270
And here we can see kind of plotting out how volume is being traded for a particular future time.

244
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.140
And then here we can see a bunch of continuous fut. or I should say a consecutive futures excuse me.

245
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.700
So a bunch of consecutive futures here.

246
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:51.610
So we have January February March April etc. and we can see how as far as volume activity they increase

247
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.780
in volume activity more and more as they get closer to the date of maturity.

248
00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.140
And then at a certain point once it becomes clear that kind of your speculation is going to match the

249
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:00.790
market price.

250
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.660
This is about a month in advance at least for natural gas.

251
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.440
It starts to come back down and it eventually just goes to zero because it reached maturity date.

252
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.980
So you're no longer going to be trading.

253
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.350
And again this is volume not price.

254
00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.390
Okay.

255
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.540
So in order to kind of deal the situation we're going to learn about continuous futures in the next

256
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.270
lecture.

257
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.880
I'll see if there.
