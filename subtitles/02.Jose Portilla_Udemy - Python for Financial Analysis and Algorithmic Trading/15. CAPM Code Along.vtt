00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.850
Welcome back everyone in this lecture we're going to show you a simple coding example of cap m the capital

2
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.150
asset pricing model.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.760
Let's open up a Jupiter notebook and get started.

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.400
OK.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.200
As we discussed before we can almost treat kep him as a simple linear regression.

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.900
So what we'll do is we'll save from side pie import stats.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.400
Go ahead and run that.

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.480
And if you want to check out the actual functional are we going to be using it's going to be Lin regress

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.400
or linear regression offs that so if you say Help stat's thought linear regression you'll see the help

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.010
on this function.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.690
Basically it just calculates a linear regression using least squares with some x and some y.

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.610
So let's go ahead and get our data passed in and kind of play around with this.

13
00:00:49.610 --> 00:01:00.620
So I'll say import Pandurs as PD and then we're also going to import Pandurs data reader as web and

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:12.010
then we're going to get the spy ETF data reader say spy use Google as our source.

15
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.590
And this is going to give us an index and basically what this index actually is is the market.

16
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.550
So you can use different indices as the market.

17
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.440
Most commonly it's the S&amp;P 500.

18
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.340
So spies essentially ETF in that care of that.

19
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.170
So if you take a look at Spy ETF just the info of it we have about 2000 entries for open high low close

20
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.460
etc. for entries for close in volume.

21
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.000
And if we check out what the actual spike values look like Chika the head of this we can see open high

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.820
low and close and volume.

23
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.000
So this spy is going to be an indicator.

24
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.020
It's not the actual S&amp;P 500 values.

25
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.550
It's an exchange traded fund which represents the S&amp;P 500.

26
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:05.940
So let's go ahead and create a start date so say PD to date time and we're passing 2010 0 1 0 4 so that's

27
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.240
our starting day of this exchange traded fund.

28
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:16.120
And if we take a look at the tail of this there anything that looks to be like 2017 so 25 that's fine

29
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.140
as well.

30
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.810
We'll do that.

31
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:32.360
PD to date time 2017 07 5 so run that and let's say our portfolio strategy is just to completely invest

32
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.010
in Apple.

33
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:48.190
We'll see Apple web data reader grow Apple stock using Google's API will say start and end and then

34
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.170
once we've done that we can check out the head of the state of frame and we can see we have open high

35
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.380
low close volume.

36
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.530
So cap em basically says that there should be some relationship between Apple's stock performance and

37
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.060
the overall market performance.

38
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.140
So let's go ahead and check that out.

39
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.160
Well first try to see this visually by saying that plotless pipeline as Piazzi not polyp in line.

40
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.400
And then I'm going to say the closing price of Apple plotted out and using google it automatically gives

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.040
you the adjusted close price so just keep that in mind.

42
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:32.390
We'll label this apple we'll sort the figure size here to be let's say 10 by 8 and then our spy exchange

43
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:40.840
traded fund will say close will plot that out and let's give this a label of spy index.

44
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.720
Essentially our market will say peel t legends run that.

45
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.280
So here I can see Apple and the actual index of the S&amp;P market 500 or at least an exchange traded fund

46
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.040
which essentially mimics its behavior.

47
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.240
Now what we want to know using cap M is the beta and alpha values so we can do is actually compare these

48
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.450
two.

49
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.440
So it's going to compare first Their cumulative return.

50
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.240
So to do that I can say Apple

51
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:25.220
cumulative is equal to Apple's close price divided by Apple's close price on the very first day that

52
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.880
I'm going to copy and paste this for the S&amp;P 500 so spy T.F. will come down here.

53
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.910
Changes to spy T.F. as well and change this to Spight here.

54
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:50.040
So we're on those calculate cumulative will plot the so and the label will be Apple and then we'll say

55
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:59.860
fixed size here is equal to 10 by 8s and then we're going to say Spight T.F. also grab the cumulative

56
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.950
column and then it will plot that as well.

57
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:12.430
Now let's get the label of spy for the S&amp;P 500 exchange traded fund Piazzi legends run that.

58
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.930
OK.

59
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.510
So this is the cumulative return basically had I invested $1 at the beginning towards 2011 how much

60
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.250
would I have in 2017.

61
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.680
So you can see here if you just invested in the S&amp;P 500 you would have done well you would have gotten

62
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.920
some returns but not nearly as well as a few to invest in Apple stock.

63
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.570
OK.

64
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.320
So let's go ahead and check out the daily return for these two.

65
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.890
We'll see.

66
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:46.990
Apple Daily return number that's simply just the clothes price and then the percent change from one

67
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.440
day to the other.

68
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.240
So say percent change one.

69
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.190
I'm going to copy and paste this for the spy ETF as well.

70
00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:04.900
He'll say spite of spite T.F. OK we'll run those and then we'll take a scatterplot of them and see if

71
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.790
there's any correlation.

72
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.410
Just visually here.

73
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.350
So the return spy T.F. daily return.

74
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.360
And then we're going to provide an alpha of let's say zero point to five because we're gonna have a

75
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.220
ton of points.

76
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.450
All right.

77
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.130
So if there was like a perfect correlation we would imagine we'd see some sort of linear behavior here.

78
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.270
Now it looks like there's some slight correlation.

79
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.710
One of the values here cetera but it's be interesting to see.

80
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.680
Using a linear regression What's the actual beta value.

81
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.230
So let's go ahead and actually calculate that.

82
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:47.090
So we're going to say Beta Khama Alpha is basically tuple and packing our value p value and then standard

83
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.920
error is equal to.

84
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.630
So those are all things that this that's linear regression returns.

85
00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:00.350
We're really only concerned about beta and Alpha we'll see Alpha or excuse me Apple Daily return and

86
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.910
we can't passen no values.

87
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.510
So we're going to use I Alosi to grab everything beyond that first row and then we're going to do the

88
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.850
same for spies will say spite if they return.

89
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.500
Let's go ahead and start a new line here.

90
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.860
So we have no space for the return.

91
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.970
And again I also see because we can't Pessin null values there run that.

92
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:32.970
And if we check our beta value it says 0.1 9 and over Cheka our alpha value it is close to zero as expected.

93
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.780
But it is there is something there.

94
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.260
So keep in mind with 0.1 9 it basically moves along the market along the speed of value and everything

95
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.970
else that's not there can be described with this alpha and we can all seen our value so for how well

96
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.170
these actually fit.

97
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:54.460
So if I were to fit a line between these two axes here it have an R squared value of point 3 3.

98
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.840
So obviously not a very good fit.

99
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.140
OK so what do we expect if our stock was very much in line of the market.

100
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.990
So let's imagine we have some sort of stock which pretty much behaves just like the market you expect

101
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.920
it to have a really high beta value.

102
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.110
So we're going to do is going to create some artificial noise for stock data and then try to make it

103
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.930
line up a lot with the actual stock market and see if we get a higher beta value and that will basically

104
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.620
confirm that the cap and model is working as we expect it to.

105
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.840
So again if I just took out my dealer returns here the head of them have these kind of daily return

106
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.610
values.

107
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:42.370
What I'm going to do is I'm going to import some pie and P and I'm going to create some noise and this

108
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.590
noise is just going to be random.

109
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.630
Normal So it's going to be normally distributed.

110
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.210
And if you use random but normal is that a random thought ran then you can set a location and a scale

111
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.470
which basically is the mean and the kind of variance for standardization you expect.

112
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.360
So you can set a mean interesting deviation so let's add the mean around 0.

113
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.220
Now let's set the standard deviation to be points there is are one kind of in line if these daily return

114
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:17.150
values and then we're going to create the length of this to be the same as spy UTF they return everything

115
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.280
past the first row.

116
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.460
So now if I take a look at my noise basically have an array of random noise that I'm going to add on

117
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.080
to this day they return.

118
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:40.140
So if I say spy ETF they they return I'll see one colon Plus this noise.

119
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.950
I now get a little bit of noise added to this daily return.

120
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.980
So let's go ahead and set that up.

121
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.750
Something else I will say this is

122
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.210
some fake stock.

123
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.840
All right.

124
00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:04.880
So we're going to do now is if I plot out we'll say peel to scatter and I'm going to create a scatterplot

125
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:13.750
of my fake stock against my spy ETF and let's give it an alpha value of zero point to five.

126
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:23.460
Let's make sure the Spight T.F. is actually just daily return column ILO's see what Colin.

127
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.510
So we run this in now we can see we have very much a linear behavior here.

128
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.470
So that makes sense because the stock is essentially daily returns with some noise added to it.

129
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.750
So this with here that we see along this plot is that noise.

130
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:41.170
So given that this relationship is very clear we should expect to have an extremely high beta value.

131
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:47.490
And if you had more noise here so if you say like point 0 0 2 etc. This will get noisier noisier.

132
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.710
But right now we just really want to prove to you the cap works.

133
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.210
So let's go ahead and grab this equation again and scroll down here.

134
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:06.550
Paste it in and now instead of the apple return we're going to say pass and this fake stock so far on

135
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.240
this and I check my beta value.

136
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:16.390
It's almost 1 which makes sense because thake stock almost lines up exactly with the daily returns of

137
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.100
this index because it's just the daily returns with some noise added on to it.

138
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.760
So if you have a particular stock that moves in line of the index a lot your beta value is expected

139
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.040
to be really high.

140
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.980
And if that's also the case then you would expect your Alphaville to be extremely small.

141
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.950
In this case it is so we have negative 2.4 times tends of the power of negative 5.

142
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.990
So you can imagine that this Alpha is a lot smaller than what we got previously.

143
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.070
And if we take a look at the previous beta values versus the alpha values there's quite a difference

144
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:42.550
there.

145
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:48.100
So basically what they're saying is cap them is working as expected here because if you have a stock

146
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.660
that lines up with an index or the market itself you'll have a really high beta value.

147
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.940
Now the idea behind our algorithmic trading is that we're going to be able to at least work through

148
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.120
some sort of system that can have a stronger Alpha value.

149
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.420
OK we'll discover all of that when we talk about working with Quanto in.

150
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.290
But for now this is all we really need to know.

151
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.350
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
