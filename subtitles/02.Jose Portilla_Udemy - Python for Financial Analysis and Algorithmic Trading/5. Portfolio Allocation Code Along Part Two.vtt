00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.920
Welcome everyone to part two of the portfolio allocation and Sharpe ratio CO-2 long lectures we're going

2
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.660
to go right back to the same notebook and we're going to first cockily a couple of full six and then

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.930
we'll walk through calculating the Sharpe ratio.

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.190
Let's open up the notebook and get started.

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.820
OK.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.010
Here in the notebook if we take a quick look at Portfolio yvel which is the data frame we created the

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.210
last time we have all the positions for each of the stocks as far as our allocations.

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.430
And then we have our total position so we start off a million dollars spread in some sort of fashion

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.640
between these four securities.

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.600
We're going to do is calculate a couple of statistics things like daily returns average daily return

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.330
sorry a deviation and then we'll use those to actually calculate the Sharpe ratio.

12
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.330
So let's begin by grabbing our portfolio Velle and then off of this we're going to create a new column

13
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.670
called daily return and call it daily returns if you want.

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.350
And this will be the portfolio.

15
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:12.460
Well those say total position PC t change one number that's the quick way using Pandurs and if you take

16
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.830
a look at the overall the head of it now we have an extra column called daily return where the first

17
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.600
value is now null and that makes sense because your first daily return should be no because there's

18
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.360
no previous day to compare it to.

19
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.240
And then all we're going to do is get our average daily return.

20
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.270
So to do that we just have to get porfolio yvel the return call the men off of this and then we get

21
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.890
our average and say portfolio yvel daily return and called SDD they'll give us the standard deviation.

22
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.230
Okay.

23
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.070
And we can also always plot the returns themselves.

24
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.630
So you can say portfolio yvel daily return and then plots a lot of times you want to plot either a histogram

25
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.750
so we can say something like kind is just maybe specify several bins 100 bins and then even a fixed

26
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.800
size would probably be a good idea here.

27
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.270
Something like eight by 10 or whatever whatever dollars you want here.

28
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.250
So you can see a histogram of what they looked like that was probably way too much.

29
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.070
It's kind of put these in half.

30
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.730
There we go.

31
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.440
So histogram is one way people like to look at these.

32
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.380
They also like to look at them using a kernel density estimation plot which is kind of making a distribution

33
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.100
out of it.

34
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.980
So say K-T for that we don't need that been sold like that and run that and then we'll get our little

35
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.570
Katy here and it goes from zero and then on negative side we see 0.05 all the way down 0.1.

36
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.760
On the positive side.

37
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.580
Okay.

38
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.780
And then finally one other stick that we won't really be using for the sharp ratio but sometimes it's

39
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.880
nice to know it's just your overall percentage on return.

40
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.270
So sometimes people can just call this a cumulative return.

41
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.990
So cumulative return.

42
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.830
Keep in mind this is not the daily cumulative returns to just the overall cumulative return.

43
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.640
So from the time period 0 all the way to the very last time period which you could say index at negative

44
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.210
one.

45
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.990
What is your total percent return.

46
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.200
So we can say something like 100 times to get a percentage here.

47
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:22.310
Grab the portfolio value at the total position negative one that or at the very last position of value

48
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.050
and then divide it by portfolio.

49
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.780
Val total position zero.

50
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.120
And then just subtract one from that.

51
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.720
That should get us the percentage.

52
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.520
If I check out cumulative return I can see it's eighty four point seventy four.

53
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.600
So our returns.

54
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.630
Eighty four point seven percent.

55
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.380
On top of what we've already started with OK.

56
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.430
And then if we really want to see it we can just say portfolio whoops cancel that.

57
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.720
Copy this Fiorillo and see if we can just see here.

58
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.310
If I start with $1 billion.

59
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.410
Now I have one million eight hundred forty seven thousand four hundred twenty eight dollars et cetera.

60
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.370
And you can see that it matches up with this right here.

61
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.860
Now it's time to discuss the sharper issue.

62
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.960
Again remember the Sharpe ratio is a measure for calculating risk adjusted return and this ratio has

63
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.590
become the industry standard for such calculations.

64
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.390
So the Sharpe ratio is essentially the mean portfolio return minus the risk free rate divided by the

65
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.770
standard deviation.

66
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.460
Now we're going to take the assumption the risk free rate is going to be equal to zero.

67
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.590
Again this kind of changes in the future especially if the Fed starts raising interest rates higher

68
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.340
and higher.

69
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.420
But for now to keep things simple we'll calculate it as just zero percent on your risk free rate.

70
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.340
OK.

71
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.250
So how do we actually grab the Sharpe ratio.

72
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.210
Well we're going to say S.R. is equal to our portfolio value.

73
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:54.550
We're going to ask for the daily return take the mean of it and then divide it by portfolio value to

74
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.490
daily return and then take the standard deviation of it.

75
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.570
Run that and here we can see our sharp ratio.

76
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.640
Now remember Sharpe ratio was actually intended to be a yearly data source.

77
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.290
So for example when you're actually using this equation of mean over standard deviation to get the annualized

78
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.780
Sharpe ratio you're going to multiply that by some sort of value for your sampling rate.

79
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.220
In our case our sampling rate is daily.

80
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.350
So we're going to need to multiply it by the square root of 252 sensors 252 business days year essentially

81
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.310
as far as trading These are concerned.

82
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.170
So we're going to say the following.

83
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.330
Take 252 to the power of 0.5.

84
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.280
That's the same as the square root of it.

85
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.470
Now we're going to multiply that by our Sharpe ratio and this will result in our analyzed shirt ratio

86
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.430
and if you take a look at our annual surprise show we get out 0.8 1.

87
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.920
So when you see this annual A sharp ratio value of 0.8 one you might be wondering well what's a good

88
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.550
sharp ratio value to actually get generally a sharp ratio greater than one is considered acceptable

89
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.020
to good by investors.

90
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.540
The pending on what kind of risk tolerance is.

91
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:09.110
But more importantly the pending on who their actual customers are a ratio higher than 2 is usually

92
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.560
rated as very good.

93
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.380
And their ratio of 3 or higher is considered to be excellent.

94
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.970
And as you go throughout this course you realize kind of just how hard it is to get a ratio that high.

95
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.690
Now the basic purpose of the Sharpe ratio is to allow investors to analyze how much greater a return

96
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.990
he or she is obtaining in relation to the level of additional risk taken to generate that return.

97
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.890
Okay now that we have this really important number this sharp ratio we're going to be able to use it

98
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.540
in order to allocate our securities in the most optimal fashion.

99
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.650
Let's go ahead and learn how to do that and then we'll actually code it out.

100
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.490
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
