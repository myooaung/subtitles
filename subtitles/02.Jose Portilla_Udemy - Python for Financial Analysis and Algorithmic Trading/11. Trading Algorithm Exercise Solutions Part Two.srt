Welcome back everyone to this series of lectures on Quanto Appian pipeline's.

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,700
Now that we understand the basics of Quanto Appian research notebooks and we realized how to use Quanto

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,750
in IEEE Let's move on to this Gus Quanto be in pipelines.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,020
Pipelines are useful for our rhythms that follow a set structure.

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,090
Let's quickly review the set structure.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,830
Typically the pipeline structure follows four key steps.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,340
You first need to compute some scalar value for all assets then that's usually based off some rolling

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,390
time period.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,260
So essentially for each asset in a known or large set such as the S&amp;P 500 or all U.S. equities you compute

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,020
some sort of scalar value for the asset.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,440
Maybe the 20 day rolling mean so you do that for all the assets in a really large set.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,120
Then the second step is to select a smaller tradeable set of assets based on the values computed in

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,610
step 1.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,260
So basically what you end up doing is out of all the U.S. equities you calculate that known scalar value

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,500
and then you're going to filter for that particular scalar value.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,520
Then once you have that you move onto step three which is essentially to calculate the desired portfolio

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,930
awaits on the set of assets selected in that second step.

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,240
Once you've done that the last step is to place orders to move the algorithms current portfolio allocations

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,360
to the desired way it's computed in step three.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,940
Now there are several technical challenges with doing this robustly and those can be things like efficiently

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:35,430
queering large sets of assets such as queering the entire U.S. equities pricing data set performing

22
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,680
computations on these large sets of assets handling the adjustments such as splits and dividends doing

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,960
things like taking care of asset listings in case a ticker gets the listed and will Quanto business

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,140
try to do is with the pipeline kind of system.

25
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:55,060
It exists to solve those challenges by providing a really nice uniform API.

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,470
Now the opium pipelines really offer a nice syntax to perform these operations repeatedly and we're

27
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,710
going to be breaking up each major step into a separate lecture.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,760
Now all I keep saying that it's a nice syntax.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,830
It does take some time to getting used to.

30
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,890
So take your time with this topic while the concepts are pretty simple and there's really only that

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,610
kind of these four major steps.

32
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,350
The syntax can be tricky at first you need to give your time to let it click.

33
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,830
So remember to reference the notebook in case you need a copy and paste any code into the research notebook

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,520
that first will be basically just dealing with research notebook who won't deal Quanto an ideally.

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,110
And I actually recommend you upload the provided notebook to your Quanto profile so you can just directly

36
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,070
follow along.

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,230
All right let's get started.

38
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,230
I'll see you at the next lecture.
