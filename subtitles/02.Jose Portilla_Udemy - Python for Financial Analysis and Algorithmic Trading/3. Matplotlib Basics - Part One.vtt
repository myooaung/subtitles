00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.440
Hello everyone and welcome to the series of lectures on that plotted map plot lib or as some people

2
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.560
say that plot libe is a python to the plotting library which produces publication quality figures in

3
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.640
a variety of hardcopy formats.

4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.020
That is to say you can export any figure and map plot lib to things like a PNB a JPEG file a PDA file

5
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.780
etc. and you can also display plots in environments across platforms will do the cheaper notebooks and

6
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.710
you'll see how nicely Jupiter interacts that plot live.

7
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.360
But if you're using something like pite charm it will also work fine just there.

8
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.970
It allows you to generate plots histograms power spectra bar charts error charts scatter plots cetera.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.340
Just a few lines of code and really it is the most powerful and customizable visualization library for

10
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.130
Python.

11
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.260
There are many other libraries out there as you mentioned before but several of those libraries are

12
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.700
actually built on top of Matt plot lib Matt lib was initially based off of Matlab plotting capabilities.

13
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.450
So if you ever heard of the programming language Matlab or if you've actually programmed them plotted

14
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.790
with matlab that plotless will feel like a natural extension of what you already know.

15
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.900
As far as plotting now people tend to either love or hate that plot Lim.

16
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.660
Either way it really is so fundamental to visualization with Python.

17
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.520
You should know the basics of working with it.

18
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.330
I personally think one of the reasons you tend to read on line that people dislike map plot lib is the

19
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.020
fact that it has two API structures one is an object oriented API structure.

20
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.590
In other one is a function API oriented structure and people tend to get confused they don't realize

21
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.450
that there's two separate ways of work live and when they see one way and the other way kind of mixed

22
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.510
up they think it's an issue at the library when it's really just two different ways of working with

23
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.520
that plotted.

24
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.260
So we're going to be really clear in the two different ways of working of map Cutlip the functional

25
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.440
API and the object oriented API so that you end up loving map.

26
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.400
Hopefully so to get an idea of what is possible.

27
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.350
Matt plotless you can go to map plot lived or slash gallery the H T.M. and you'll see a bunch of images

28
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.480
galleries all create a map plot libs you can see what's possible and basically anything plot wise you

29
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.590
can think of is going to be possible.

30
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.530
So it tries to make easy things easy and the very difficult plots actually possible to create.

31
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.450
So we're going to do is explore the basics of that plot lib and its API and we're also going to understand

32
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.550
its core principles which will be very helpful later on when we actually do a visualization of pandas.

33
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.700
OK let's open up a notebook and get started.

34
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.110
Once you've installed that live the first thing you're going to be able to do is say import live high

35
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.330
plots as well.

36
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.940
And then if you're using the Jupiter note book what you're going to do is say percent sign map plot

37
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.530
lib space in line and that's going to allow you to actually see the plots you create inside the Jupiter

38
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.320
notebook.

39
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.390
So go ahead and run this if you are not using the Jupiter notebook's system.

40
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.610
What are you going to go ahead and do.

41
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.420
Is at the end of all your commands for plotting which will show later what you will type is t that show

42
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.340
close print the CS and later on we actually start plotting some examples.

43
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.690
Asha you would actually put that into your code.

44
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.780
All right let's go ahead and walk through the very simple example using two umpires when to go in and

45
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.330
say import NUMP pi as N.P. and say x is equal to N.P. Lind's space.

46
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.240
So it's going to be linearly spaced we'll go from zero to 5 and grab 11 points.

47
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.470
And then y is going to be equal to x.

48
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.990
So the power of two.

49
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.740
So if we take a look at x and y we have an array from 0 to 5 and then WHY are just all those elements

50
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.590
squared.

51
00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.440
Now basic math plot live commands allow you to very quickly create a plot and we'll show you two ways

52
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.210
of creating map plotted plots.

53
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.790
One is a functional method and the other one is the object oriented method will show the functional

54
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.340
method first and then we'll shift over to the object oriented method.

55
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.420
Since that's usually the better way of creating a Cutlip plot.

56
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.000
Let's go and show you the functional method first.

57
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.300
The functional method is actually quite simple.

58
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.980
You say Piazzi got plots and then we can do shift tab here and you're going to pass in several arguments.

59
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.390
First one you're going to do for just a basic plot is passing your X and your y elements and then we

60
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.310
can go ahead and do shift enter and here this will actually show the plot.

61
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.340
We've went ahead and plotted X versus Y.

62
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.590
If you're not in the Jupiter note book which you are going to do at the end of this line before you

63
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.040
run your code say peel t show and then if I run that you can see we get the same plot.

64
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.130
You don't have to use puti show unless you're using something that's not the Jupiter note but the difference

65
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.400
in the Jupiter notebook is essentially like you're printing the plot.

66
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.270
Notice here if I don't have to show I can out.

67
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.080
So if I remove this or actually put it back in then I don't get the out.

68
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:21.810
So that's essentially the same thing just to do a quick analogy as typing a string versus saying print

69
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.290
the string

70
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.810
and that's the exact same thing what TLT that show's doing it's essentially printing out this plot instead

71
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.980
of just showing the plot.

72
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.850
All right.

73
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.030
For now on we won't actually concern ourselves with concert's consistently typing appeal to that show.

74
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.760
However if you're not using Jupiter No but you will have to keep typing that should just keep that in

75
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.250
mind.

76
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.390
All right so that's the most basic way to plot something about plot live which isn't so bad.

77
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:57.790
You can actually add that plot Matlab like arguments such as color and lifestyle and that will allow

78
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.100
you to continue to edit this plot.

79
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.250
We'll talk a lot more about this later on as far as line styles and color styles.

80
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.120
But if you're familiar with Matlab this probably already seems familiar to you.

81
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.360
Let's go ahead and remove that for now and just go for the basics.

82
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.690
If we want to add an X label y label or title to this plot we can do that with the following methods.

83
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:26.490
Can say Piazzi X label and then just pass in a string you want for the label will go in and say X label

84
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.920
and then for the y label you can say p t y label passing a string y label.

85
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.790
And then for the title you can say Piazzi that title and then we'll just go out and put in a title string

86
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.540
there.

87
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.000
Go ahead and run this.

88
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.670
And now we can see we have an X label a y label and a title.

89
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:53.090
And later on we're going to learn how we can specify the CPI or dots per inch in order to get some more

90
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.630
clarity here such as a finer font.

91
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.830
Let's go ahead and continue on with creating multi plots on the same canvas we're going to go ahead

92
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.350
and scroll down here.

93
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.570
Remove this cell and talk about putting multi plots on the same canvas nerd's to do that.

94
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.980
We're going to say peel t subplot and subplot takes in a couple of arguments as well.

95
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.660
Right now we can't see him so I'll go ahead and tell you the first one is going to be the number of

96
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.590
rows.

97
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.540
The number of columns and then the plot number you're referring to in this case we'll just go ahead

98
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.630
and say one that we'll go ahead and plot something on that cell.

99
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.950
We'll say X Y and we'll go ahead and specify that it's the color red string are.

100
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.900
As a third arguments.

101
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.380
Again don't worry too much about fully understanding this because once we get to the object oriented

102
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.760
method a lot of this is going to make way more sense.

103
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.810
But I just want to show you what's possible for now.

104
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.460
Let's go ahead and say another appeal to that subplot.

105
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:02.430
We specify one row by two columns and the third argument is the plot number.

106
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.200
Now we're going to edit the second plot and we'll say peel t that plot.

107
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.860
Well go ahead and do Y versus x and specified B for blue as a string here.

108
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.530
Let's go ahead and run this and see what we get.

109
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:25.310
OK so now we have two subplots here that's creating multiple plots on the same canvas.

110
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.900
Now we're going to do is after we've seen the very basics of creating a plot we're going to break this

111
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:36.170
all down for a more formal introduction to that libs object oriented API method and this means we're

112
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.970
going to instantiate figure objects and then call methods or attributes from that object.

113
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.810
And that's going to be a much better way of actually using that plot live.

114
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:50.630
So the basics for now are just using PLDT that plot and then putting in your data or PBT that subplot

115
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.880
specifying the number of rows and columns and then the figure we are working on and then using to plot.

116
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.290
Let's go in and switch gears to the object oriented method.

117
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.130
And this is going to be much better.

118
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.730
The main idea in using the more formal object oriented method is to create figure objects and then just

119
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.830
call methods off of this.

120
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.760
Let me go in and show you what I mean by that.

121
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:19.120
I'm going to go ahead and say fig is equal to peel t figure and I'm going to go in and close the princes

122
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.560
there.

123
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.210
Now if I just run that cell.

124
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.670
Notice I have a figure object has been created this figure object you can think of it as just kind of

125
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.830
this imaginary blank canvas.

126
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.140
And we can add a set of access to this canvas.

127
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:42.380
So in the same cell I'm going to say XS is equal to Fig dot add underscore axes and I'm going to add

128
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:49.550
a set of axes and the way you can add a set of axes is by passing in a list and the list takes in for

129
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:55.160
arguments a left bottom width and height arguments that range from zero to 1.

130
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.200
Basically the percent of that blank canvas you want to go ahead and take.

131
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.060
Let me go in and show an example.

132
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.370
And again I'm kind of going to be showing you a lot of stuff that won't make sense at first but everything

133
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:11.090
will make sense at the end as you see repeated examples and you break it down further.

134
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.350
So I'm just typing in some numbers here.

135
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.330
This is going to be left of the axes.

136
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.570
It's going to be the bottom of the axes.

137
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.490
And this is going to be the width and the height of the axes 0.8.

138
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.570
Let me go ahead and run this on the cell and now notice what I get here.

139
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.170
Now I have a blank set of axes.

140
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:35.570
So I said P-T that figure created a figure object and then off that figure object I called the method

141
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:42.130
add a set of axes and passed in a list of where I actually want the axes to be placed next what I'm

142
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.080
going to do is actually plot on that set of axes.

143
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.550
And this is going to feel familiar to what we just did earlier.

144
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:55.100
You're going to say axes stop plots and let's go ahead and plot x and y on that set of axes and then

145
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.430
shift and turn.

146
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.700
And now you can see we've basically come up with the same plot we did earlier except using an object

147
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.690
oriented method.

148
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:08.780
So if I scroll back up here this was the plot we did earlier we just said Appeal teed up plot but now

149
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.300
using this sort of object oriented method we're going to have a lot more control over this.

150
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.210
It's a little more involved as far as the steps we need to take.

151
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.640
But it's definitely worth it.

152
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:25.970
So we've created a figure we call the figure method axes on this pass then a list of axes and then plotted

153
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.780
on that sort of axes if we want to continue by putting x labels y labels and titles.

154
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.230
You can go ahead and do that on that set of axes.

155
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.680
You can say set underscore X label.

156
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.690
It's a little different from the appeal to you just X label.

157
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.210
We're looking at this axes object you're going to say sets underscore.

158
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:50.490
And now we can go ahead and pasand the string x label and you're going to do the same thing for y labels.

159
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.400
Looks y label.

160
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:02.780
And let's go ahead and the same thing for a title set underscore title.

161
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:08.690
Now if we run this we should see our new labels X label y label and set title.

162
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:16.220
Let's go ahead and continue this idea of object oriented programming with that limb by putting in two

163
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.960
sets of figures on one canvas.

164
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.610
And this will start to make sense as far as what this list is referencing.

165
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.440
I'm going to go ahead and scroll down to a new cell and zoom in a little bit just so you can get a very

166
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.020
clear picture of what we're actually doing here.

167
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.840
I'm going to say fig is equal to peel that figure.

168
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.360
So I'm creating that figure object.

169
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.540
So there's my figure object.

170
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.370
I'm going to say axes one is equal to Fig.

171
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.450
Axes.

172
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:58.270
I don't want to go ahead and set my own axes it will be zero point one zero point one and then zero

173
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.120
point eight point eight.

174
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:06.640
And again this is the left the bottom and then the width and height of that sort of axes.

175
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.790
And they're going to add another set of axes.

176
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.620
Call them axes to going to say Fig.

177
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:20.470
Add underscore axes and then when I'm going to go ahead and do is basically put inserts axes I'm going

178
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:28.850
to say the bottom of the set of axes starts 20 percent from the left 50 percent from the bottom.

179
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.490
So excuse me here I'm talking about basically this.

180
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.050
This bottom corner of the axes the left in the bottom.

181
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.700
So 20 percent in from the left 50 percent up from the bottom.

182
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.580
And then we will say it takes up 40 percent of the canvas size and width and 30 percent of the canvas

183
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.550
size and height.

184
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.200
So all these values here must be between 0 and 1.

185
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.390
Let's go ahead and run this and know what we get out.

186
00:13:53.530 --> 00:14:00.090
We get this basically insert set of axes and hopefully now you can begin to see what these values actually

187
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:06.150
correspond to what I want you to do now is go ahead and pause the video and play around with these numbers.

188
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.790
Make sure they're all either between 0 and 1 and see how they correlate with the set of axes.

189
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.360
Go ahead.

190
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.450
Just play around with axes 2 and move it around.

191
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.290
For instance try to get the set of axes two over here at the bottom corner.

192
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.320
Good and positive.

193
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.270
See if you can move this insur over to the bottom corner.

194
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.710
All right I'll see if I can do that.

195
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:34.990
Now so if I want this at the bottom corner I probably want to say that it goes left bottom width and

196
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.690
height.

197
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:41.070
So I will try shifting it down by making this basically just 0 so start.

198
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.180
Well it's going to say 0.1 here start at 0.1 5.

199
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:53.060
So a little off the bottom of this insert here of Axis 1 will go ahead and run this.

200
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.700
And there I was able to move it more towards the bottom remember this second one is the bottom.

201
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.670
And now we want to move more towards the right which means from the left a 1 or 2 percent.

202
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.690
Wise move this bottom corner more over from the left.

203
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:13.790
Let's go to set this as 8 and now looks like shifted it a little too much so let's go in and shift that

204
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:19.790
back to maybe 5 and there we can see we have it now in the bottom.

205
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.720
All right go ahead and play around of that.

206
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.400
If these figures are these numbers are still a little unclear.

207
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:31.640
Remember they're basically just denoting the left bottom and the width and height from range 0 to 1

208
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.820
relation to the blank canvas.

209
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:42.540
We're going to go ahead and reset these to what we have in that originally 0.2 and 0.5.

210
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.920
So we have our little insert there.

211
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.140
And then what I'm going to do is go ahead and plot on these axes.

212
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:59.640
So I'm going to say axes 1 plots and I will say X come a Y and then I will say xes to that plot will

213
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:07.320
go and say why come x Let's go out and run this in here I can see now I have my little insur and my

214
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:15.420
outer plot and then I can keep adding stuff on each set of axes if I want my inserts have a title for

215
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:25.910
instance axes 2 I can say axes two set title and we'll go and say insert it.

216
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:32.120
It's going to make it very clear we'll say smaller plots and then on axes 1.

217
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.700
Let's go ahead and set a title

218
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:44.940
and we will set this title as larger plots going and run that so noticed what happened here actually

219
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.530
got an error because I didn't actually see smaller plot because I forgot to put a 2.

220
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.220
Here let's run this one more time.

221
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.510
OK now we are getting what we're supposed to get.

222
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.120
We have larger plot and smaller plot.

223
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.100
And basically that's the idea behind object oriented programming that plotted you create a figure.

224
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.240
And that's essentially just an empty canvas.

225
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.740
So let me go in and show that one more time just by putting this in a cell by itself.

226
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.920
We create this empty figure there's nothing to show.

227
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.050
And then you add a set of axes to it.

228
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:23.750
By saying axes whatever one or two etc. equals fig thought at underscore axes and you pass and this

229
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:29.990
list that goes from left bottom and then the width and the height in relation to this empty canvas.

230
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.790
So if we run this then we have our anti-acid of axes and then you can plot off those axes.

231
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.300
You can say axes one plot and then x comma Y.

232
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.200
All right.

233
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.840
This is the sort of methodology we're going to be working with from that public as far as the very basic

234
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.010
way of working that plotless which is the functional method.

235
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.150
You can just say appeal to that plot or appeal that subplot.

236
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.660
We're going to learn how to create subplots using this object oriented method which is going to be a

237
00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.440
lot more efficient and grant us a lot more control.

238
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.740
OK.

239
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.490
Go ahead and review this section of the map Cutlip concepts lecture notebook.

240
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.700
There's a lot more notes and a lot more comments in the note book in case any of this confused you but

241
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.410
hopefully by now you have a full understanding of basically this.

242
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.670
These lines of code right here if you understand what's going on in the cell then you're pretty much

243
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.590
good to go.

244
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:28.990
We just create a figure we add and axes to that figure you find the location of that set of axes with

245
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:35.430
this list and then you can plot on that sort of axes you can set the titles at the X label y label etc..

246
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.010
All right.

247
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.290
Thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture or we're going to continue this discussion off

248
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.210
of the same Jupiter notebook.

249
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.680
Thanks and I'll see the next lecture.
