1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,500
Welcome back everyone as you mentioned the last lecture and this lecture we're going to actually look

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,330
more into the effects of hedging.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,820
So to start off we're going to try to make a function in order to fictionalize essentially taking the

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,070
benchmark return and the stock we're looking at.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,760
In our case Apple and then returning back an alpha and beta value.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,660
So we're essentially going to just create a function called alpha beta.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:33,470
It takes in some let's say benchmark return so say benchmark underscore or a T and it takes the stock

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,720
and what it's going to do it's going to run the linear regression that we did above previously.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:48,300
So a benchmark is equal to S-M at constant to that benchmark return and then we're going to create a

10
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,680
model regression linear model.

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,900
Well yes and it's going to be run on the stock with that benchmark.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,330
So note here that this benchmark is the one of the constant which is the one I'm putting in here.

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,090
Transform from the input benchmark return and then we'll see that fit.

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,770
And then what I'm going to return is modeled perhaps.

15
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,000
And I'm just going to kind of return as a tuple so say model that pro-ams 0 and modeled that programs

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,390
1.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,750
So now essentially made a function out of what we previously did defer the linear regression and we're

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,090
going to do here is start off by getting the Alpha and Beta estimates for the last year.

19
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,970
So going to come up here and copy and paste some code that we previously did and you can copy and paste

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,720
this from the notebook as well but essentially I want these few lines of code here.

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:45,930
As well as the benchmark ups and then I'm going to copy and paste this CELSS come all the way back down

22
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,070
here and I'm going to copy and paste this.

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,660
So we're going to call this cell.

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,200
Essentially my pops 20:16 itself.

25
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,280
So here's my data for 2016.

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,180
I have an asset I have my benchmark and mislabelled these assett 2016 and benchmark 2016 because later

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,200
on we're going to end up using this for 2017 as well.

28
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:20,130
So then I'm going to set my asset return 2016 to be equal to the asset of 2016.

29
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,200
Percent change one.

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,010
And then we're going to grab everything from index 1 and beyond and we're going to essentially copy

31
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,810
and paste this well actually just rewrite it a little be a little faster we'll say benchmark return

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,090
or benchmark return.

33
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:54,690
2016 is equal to benchmark 2016 percent change one and then grab one on where it's and then we're going

34
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,250
to do here just a couple more steps.

35
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,590
We're going to get the asset return values so we can end up plotting some of this stuff and actually

36
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,600
end up passing this to the alpha beta function.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:11,220
So we'll say values is equal to asset return 2016 the values essentially everything we've done before

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,260
and then we'll say benchmark return values is equal to benchmark returns 2016 dot values.

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,490
So I can use this information for plotting and this information of passen the alpha beta function so

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:35,440
I will say Alpha 2016 beta 2016 is equal to the function call alpha beta passing in my.

41
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,150
I believe it takes benchmark returns first.

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,980
Yes.

43
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,350
So benchmark return values and then the asah return values.

44
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,430
And let's have a couple of print statements at the others will say print something like 20:16 values.

45
00:03:51,020 --> 00:04:01,780
That I'm going to print alpha and then I'll just concatenate this string of 2016 that I'm going to print

46
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:09,300
beta and I will concatenate a string of the 2016.

47
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,970
OK so let that run and this should give us all the information for 2016.

48
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,260
So we have our Alphaville you one point six seven times since the Barnette five and our beta value.

49
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,880
And this is for Apple stock.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,370
So we're going to do now is essentially create a hedged portfolio in compute alpha beta from there.

51
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,060
So what you actually mean by that.

52
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,310
Well I'll create a portfolio object and do exactly what we did last time.

53
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,630
Multiply by negative 1 beta of 20:16 and then I'm going to multiply that by my benchmark returns of

54
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:48,270
2016 and I'm going to add my Assar returns of 2016 and don't be too confused by the fact that I have

55
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,930
asked 2016 and acet returns 2016 and asset return values.

56
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,500
The only difference between all these is acet.

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,810
That's just the actual price values asset returns.

58
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,660
That is the daily return value minus that first row and then asset return values is the same as asset

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,600
return except it doesn't have the time stamp information.

60
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:16,440
So we're going to run our portfolio and then we're going to do the following we'll say alpha beta equal

61
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:24,360
to alpha beta and then we're going to pass and the same thing we did last time I will say actually will

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,600
say benchmark returns 2016 and then I'm going to pass in my portfolio.

63
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:40,810
So then I'm going to say Prince portfolio alpha and beta and I'm going to print a couple more things

64
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,550
here and then we'll explain what's actually going on.

65
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,490
So then I will say Alpha here kind of the same as last time and they will say print beta here plus the

66
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,110
string representation of beta OK.

67
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,130
So what is actually going on here.

68
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,980
Well we first calculated based off 2016 the Alpha and Beta values for Apple versus the market and those

69
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,880
were alpha of 1.6 times Tensen negative 5 and a beta of 1.0 or 2.

70
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,190
So you can see it does have some behavior in Apple moves along the market which makes sense because

71
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,090
Apple actually is a huge proponent of the market.

72
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,990
So then here we said Okay I just want to trade on Alpha itself.

73
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:31,000
So I'll say portfolio minus one times that beta value between 16 times the benchmark returns in 16.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,960
So this first beta term plus Alpha term which is the assassin.

75
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:41,200
So then we ran this into alpha beta to get back those actual Alpha terms alpha beta and benchmark returns

76
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,960
16 and this portfolio the hedged version and now we can see that we have some alpha value that essentially

77
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,200
is the same but our beta is almost zero.

78
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
This is 1.3 six times ten to the negative 16.

79
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,510
So weve essentially completely eliminated beta.

80
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,180
So what we have here is now were trading completely on Alpha that is Apple itself.

81
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,530
So I can plot this out.

82
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:12,280
So maybe its a little more clear to you so we can say portfolio plot's and lets give this.

83
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:19,200
And not to get confused by Alpha terms this is just the alpha for how C-3 or how transparent the color

84
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,530
is.

85
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:28,240
Don't get too confused there and it will give a label of Apple with the hedge and then I'm going to

86
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:39,040
say my asset returns for 2016 plot those out and let's give this an alpha value of 0.5 and then my benchmark

87
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,160
returns of 2016.

88
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:52,620
I'm going to plot those out with an alphabet of 0.5 and say p t y label they return.

89
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,650
Let's get this election.

90
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,900
PULTE the legend.

91
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,180
Remember you can always copy and paste this from the provided notebooks.

92
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,880
So we run this and we end up getting a chart that looks like this.

93
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,470
So again you can see here at clear points.

94
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,470
This is essentially what we just did last time.

95
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,650
Exit now it kind of functional eyes that we see Apple with hedge.

96
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,340
And if there's a big dip in the market such as in the middle of July apple of the head doesn't really

97
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,710
respond to that behavior.

98
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,320
So we can see that while regular apple does go down that market when we're focusing on that pure Alpha

99
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,390
term we don't kind of follow the market there but it does mean for big drops where the market was pretty

100
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,050
steady and big peaks where the market is relatively flat.

101
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,520
We also get those as well.

102
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,530
OK.

103
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,620
So what does it actually mean in terms of kind of the average returns.

104
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:46,120
Well if we take a look at Foleo the mean value of this these are our average daily returns 1.6 seven

105
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,870
times since the power of 5.

106
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,490
And if we took out the asset by itself so asset returns of 20:16 and get the mean value here we end

107
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,370
up getting 0.00 5.

108
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,820
So the general idea here being is that we greatly reduced or sometimes not greatly in our case it's

109
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,560
greatly just because Apple is a huge part of the S&amp;P 500 it makes up a large proponent as far as total

110
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,790
market capitalization.

111
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,300
So I would definitely suggest that you experiment with everything we've done here.

112
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,560
Replace Apple stock with a smaller market cap.

113
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,370
But in our case because we ended up kind of hedging against the market we've reduced our actual average

114
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,270
return.

115
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:32,870
But if we take a look at our volatility we'll see portfolio SDD that's going to calculate at two point

116
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,790
zero one two.

117
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,970
Let's take a look at just the asset by itself that is Apple's Steria deviation.

118
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,480
We can see here we reduced our volatility or standard deviation not by a whole lot by point 0 0 2.

119
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,790
But yes by around I would say let's looks like around 10 percent reduction in volatility.

120
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,990
Now was that worth the huge reduction in average terms.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,890
Probably not.

122
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,390
Now again Apple's kind of a special case so I would again suggest using another stock besides Apple

123
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,080
to kind of explore and play with this hedging idea yourself.

124
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,560
The reason we kind of get this extreme behavior and Apple is because again Apple has such a huge market

125
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,490
cap that its own movements really affect the market by itself.

126
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,010
So what we can do if we wanted to kind of play around with this some more we could copy and paste what

127
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:23,270
we did appear except change this to be from 2016 2017 to just be kind of the first half of 2017.

128
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,070
So I'm actually going to copy and paste this from the provided notes.

129
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,870
It's essentially everything that we just did here except instead of 2016 it's for 2017.

130
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,010
So we'll come down scroll down and I'm going to paste that here and note here my start date and end

131
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,380
date.

132
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,040
Everything else is essentially the same.

133
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,050
And the fact that it's all 20:17 and let me change is to be 20:17 based figures.

134
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,580
So I'm going to run that and that's going to tell me the value and the value for 20:17 at least kind

135
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,640
of the first half of 2016 for Apple stock by stock.

136
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:01,770
And you'll notice if we take a look at Alpha 2016 and Alpha looks better 2016

137
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,950
that there is definitely some change especially for this stock that became more and more in line as

138
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,870
the market cap for Apple grows larger and larger.

139
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,250
It's going to get stronger and stronger because it represents more of the market.

140
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,870
So a move in Apple is going to affect the market more and more so we can see here as time goes on that

141
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,560
basic term gets stronger.

142
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,160
So that means that unfortunately if you're trying to hedge based off historical information such as

143
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,830
trying to hedge your 2017 trades based off the 2016 beta value you're going to eventually get a little

144
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,850
bit more of a larger and larger error term.

145
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,490
So to kind of show what's going on here.

146
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,760
We'll go ahead and create a portfolio based off the 2016 beta estimate so we can say something like

147
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,910
portfolio is equal to minus one times.

148
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,190
And previously we use the perfect beta value.

149
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:57,530
So if we come back over here we use the perfect value that is beta 20:16 against benchmark returns 2016.

150
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:02,750
But we're going to pretend that we didn't have access to 20:17 information and we had to use some historically

151
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,770
calculated value.

152
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,720
It's kind of called out of sample because we're going to run this on data that we weren't able to sample.

153
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,430
So we'll say multiply negative 1 by the beta of 2016 and we're going to attempt to hedge based off historical

154
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,790
information and it is not going to be as effective as hedging against the most recent information.

155
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,100
But you're not always going to have access to kind of knowledge of the future.

156
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,220
So now we've created a portfolio that uses the previous year's beta on today's information.

157
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:42,040
So say Alpha Beta is equal to Alpha Beta and then I'm going to pass in benchmark returns for 2017.

158
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,940
And then my portfolio itself which is this new portfolio value here.

159
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,140
And then what we can end up doing is pasan or just kind of show you Alfas now.

160
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:58,310
And what it is now and you can compare these to see how well they actually work against the figures

161
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,680
we previously calculated 2016 2017.

162
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,750
And then we can also see here the Alpha and Beta values that we calculated were there as far as our

163
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,990
portfolio is concerned.

164
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,850
So our beta is not zero and that's because we're using beta 2016.

165
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,970
So let's go ahead and plot out what this actually looks like and see the returns.

166
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,840
So I can say something like my portfolio

167
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:28,990
the mean is point zero or a one to one versus my actual asset returns for 2017.

168
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,720
If I take a look at that mean ends up being greater.

169
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,440
So you can see here we've reduced our average return but hopefully we were able to also reduce the volatility

170
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
your standard deviation.

171
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,520
So for fully Osteria deviation points there are a 9.

172
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,610
Let's take a look at asset returns.

173
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,420
SiRNA deviation that's point 0 1.

174
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,050
So again kind of dropping it by 10 percent again.

175
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:58,780
So the most common tradeoff here is that you're typically sacrificing average returns for less volatility.

176
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,060
Again this is highly dependent on the security securities that have or that make up a large percentage

177
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,310
of the total market cap for this 500 like Apple are going to have much stronger beta values because

178
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,470
they themselves the find the beta or the way the market moves I should say but we can see here that

179
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,540
in general even if we're using historical information for data values which is kind of the most realistic

180
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,350
representation you can't calculate beta at that exact point in time.

181
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,960
But we can calculate some historical data we could say like Beta's like a week off or a day off et cetera

182
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,680
here are kind of an extreme example as a whole year off but it still does what we expect to do.

183
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,770
It lowers the mean and lowers histeria deviation.

184
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,270
Okay.

185
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,960
So that's the basic idea of hedging against the market.

186
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,540
I hope you understood the general concept.

187
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,400
It's basically just cackling in that beta value and then multiply it by negative 1 to essentially cancel

188
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,040
out any benchmark returns.

189
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,780
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
