Hello everyone and welcome to the introduction to pi.

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.020
So it's now time to learn about one of the most fundamental libraries of using Python for quantitative

3
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.320
analysis and that is pie or numerical Python non-place already included in the environment file provided.

4
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.610
But just in case you don't already have it you can always install it at your command prompt or a terminal

5
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.100
by typing out the install non-pay Type-I it's a numerical library for Python that allows for extremely

6
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.710
fast data generation and handling that utilizes a structure known as an array which can efficiently

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.600
store data and broadcast functions to that data.

8
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.820
It's actually much better than the built in normal Python list.

9
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.660
It operates a lot faster and can efficiently store data more than just what a regular Python list can

10
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.960
actually do on its own.

11
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.000
Now we won't dive into every single feature of non-pay in this course.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910
It is a humungous library.

13
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.000
Instead we're going to do just teach you the functions and methods you're going to be using most often

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.650
when working in a quantitative data.

15
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.130
Once we understand the basics of Pi we'll be ready to move on to working with pandas which is a data

16
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.680
analysis library built directly off numpad where panda stands for panel data will be working directly

17
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.330
upon those more often than with some pie in later sections of the course.

18
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.600
But understanding them pie is crucial to truly mastering pandas which is why we're going to focus on

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.310
it for this beginning section.

20
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.430
So this section is going to cover the following topics raised by indexing and selection.

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.480
PI operations.

22
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.550
And then we'll have a pie exercise and a solution lecture for it.

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.630
All right let's get started.

24
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.650
I'll see at the next lecture.
