Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on time series basics.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.300
So we're going to begin by having a pretty brief discussion on some important time series concepts mainly

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.490
just so we know some keywords that will be using throughout this section of the Course time series data

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.890
has particular properties.

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.660
So we're going to take a look at just the few plots and discuss some of these important terms.

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.020
The first term we're going to discuss is trends.

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.410
So time series can have a trend to them.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.250
And here we see just a general time series with three major trends.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.840
We have an upward trend that the beginning a horizontal or stationary trend in the middle and then a

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.170
downward trend at the end.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.400
And basically what the trend is describing on average what is the value doing for this time series is

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.800
it moving upwards on average is increasing.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.810
So that's the very first part of our time series we can see that on average the value tends to be decreasing

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.180
or increasing excuse me than in the middle.

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.580
We have a horizontal or stationary trend where the value on average tends to be flat even though there's

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.280
variations overall on average in the middle.

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.250
It tends to be flat and then towards the tail end of this time series we see on average the mean tends

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.740
to be decreasing or we have a downward trend.

19
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.780
So again the trend is just what is happening to the mean value in this time series.

20
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.450
We do see variance for fluctuations if we look at a closer unit of time.

21
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.660
But overall on these larger time periods what is the average doing is a moving upwards is a horizontal

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.380
or stationary.

23
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.830
Or is it moving downwards.

24
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.730
The next key term we want to discuss is seasonality.

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.250
And basically the seasonality is it's a repeating trend.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.570
So a really common example of this are things that have to do with the actual seasons of a year.

27
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.310
So seasonality often falls upon some sort of yearly cycle or a yearly period.

28
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.570
So here we can see Google Trends if you search for snowboarding you'll see some sort of seasonality

29
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.950
here.

30
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.980
So the general trend tends to be going decreasing.

31
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.850
So we see a little bit of a downward trend.

32
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.360
But if we take a look at the seasonality of this we can see that it's clearly related to the winter

33
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.890
months.

34
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.580
So during the winter months we see a big increase in searches for snowboarding and then during the summer

35
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.890
months we see a large decrease.

36
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.420
Now the general trend here is going down.

37
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.340
But in order to describe these peaks and valleys we use that term seasonality.

38
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.520
So that's what seasonality is and how it's different than just a trend.

39
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.210
So on average there's a very slight decrease there.

40
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.550
So the trending is a little bit downward here because it decreasing but the seasonality is allowing

41
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.200
us to analyze this repetitive trend of during the winter months we see a large increase during the summer

42
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.310
months we see a large decrease.

43
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.480
Then the final term we want to discuss is the cyclical term and cyclical basically just means that there's

44
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.600
trends with no set repetition.

45
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.680
So what that actually means is you can still have trends such as an upward trend or the horizontal trend

46
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.040
or a downward trend.

47
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.300
But it can be a non-repetitive trend.

48
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.690
So previously we saw that snowboarding data that pretty much every year we saw the increase during the

49
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.600
winter decrease during the summer.

50
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.680
But if we look at some stock data such as the S&amp;P 500 here we can see that there's definitely trends

51
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.200
but there's no actual seasonality to them.

52
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.990
It's not like every 10 years we can decide that the stock market will go down sometimes the cycle goes

53
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.580
up sometimes the cycle goes down.

54
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.580
So we can see it there's clearly a trend here but we can't actually pinpoint the season itself.

55
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.910
So we can see from 1995 to 2000 there was a big trend upwards then from 2000 to kind of 2002 ish.

56
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.140
There's that trend downward.

57
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.540
Then it starts going back up.

58
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.750
Then another trend back down as it reaches 2010 but 2008 financial crisis.

59
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.720
Then it goes back up for the next five years or so.

60
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.970
And there's no actual seasonality here.

61
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.820
You can't actually pinpoint where the repetition is happening.

62
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.020
So this is not seasonality.

63
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.610
It's more of a cyclical cycle.

64
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.410
OK.

65
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.260
So we are seeing a few of these key terms we're going to begin to learn about one of the most popular

66
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.880
libraries in Python for handling time series data and it's called stat's models.

67
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.170
So let's go to the next lecture where we discuss and show you some basics of stat's models.
