00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,780
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on a pipeline example we've already learned how pipeline works.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,650
In the last section but we haven't really explored any deeper examples specifically actually implementing

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,960
a pipeline in the ID.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,820
Remember that our main approach will be to select some sort of universe of stocks to trade from and

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,860
then either go long or short depending on some sort of factor or filter from the pipeline we'll go ahead

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,290
and start in the research note environment and then switch over to I-T and Quanto open for implementation.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,550
So I'll have two tabs open one with a new research notebook and one of a new algorithm in the ID.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,410
OK let's hop over to the browser now.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,550
OK.

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,950
Here we have a research notebook open called pipelined example.

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,160
And then in another tab I have an.

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,200
Ready to go but we're going to start off just with the notebook itself.

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:00,950
Let's go ahead and review the main imports for a pipeline we'll say from Quanto in the pipeline import

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:13,520
pipeline and then we'll also say from Quanto in research in poor run pipeline and from Quanto in the

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,500
pipeline data built in will import the U.S. equity pricing.

16
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,260
So those are some really common imports.

17
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,240
When you're using pipelines Now the next thing I want to introduce to you which you'll see used a lot

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,870
in Quanto in examples as you see other people's algorithms are the Q and US or Q 15:00.

19
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,310
Q Three thousand or Q 500 US filters that Quanto provides for you.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,160
Our first show you how to import them and they will discuss what they actually are.

21
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,680
Say from Quanto up in pipeline that filter's import.

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,360
And if you type q here and then hit TAB notice here.

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,870
Q 15:00 Q Three thousand and q 500.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,140
So typically Q Fifteen hundred US is the most common one.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,770
But it really depends on your algorithm.

26
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,970
But first let me describe what these fifteen hundred three thousand five hundred universes of stocks

27
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,560
are actually doing.

28
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,100
The point of this sort of universe of stocks is to try to avoid that sort of not traded error that you

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,080
sometimes get maybe your trades aren't being fulfilled and that may mess around your algorithm.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,810
So these are default universes that contain respectively either 50 100 U.S. stocks 500 U.S. stocks or

31
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,360
three thousand U.S. stocks and the constituents of the actual group of stocks are chosen at the start

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,780
of each month by selecting what they call the top 1100 tradable stocks and they're the most tradeable

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,470
based off their 200 day average dollar volume that is.

34
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,900
What are the top 50 100 stocks that are being traded around based on how much money is being traded

35
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,010
up these stocks.

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,730
And they're also capped at 30 percent of equities allocated to any single sector.

37
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,810
So there's a bunch of other factors that go into choosing these 15 stocks.

38
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,330
Things like the stock must be the primary share class for its company.

39
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:03,040
So really large companies such as for instance alphabet sometimes they have multiple shares of stock

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,710
so they have like a class A share a class B share etc..

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,100
So to make sure that your algorithm is not getting confused by these multiple classes.

42
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,210
Each company has a primary share and.

43
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,340
Q Fifteen hundred US has already done the work for you of figuring out what's the primary share for

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,420
that company.

45
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,880
There's also other factors such as the stock must not be the positive receipt.

46
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,040
It can't be traded what's known as over-the-counter TC.

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,250
It can't be part of a limited partnership.

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,750
It must have a known previous day close price and it must have a non-zero volume on the previous trading

49
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,460
day.

50
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,570
So basically these are the kind of top fifteen hundred stocks and Quanto Open's already done a lot of

51
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,290
the filtering work that you would normally do to make sure you don't get any errors.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,360
As far as not being able to trade the stocks so check out the resource link would actually Shoji all

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,110
the filters that are being used here.

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,210
But you're going to see this used a lot in algorithms especially that are used in the pipeline.

55
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,340
So we'll go ahead and import that and then move onto the next step.

56
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,990
So again the two main benefits of using either 15:00 us or five US or three thousand us is that they

57
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,730
really greatly reduce the risk of an order not being filled and they also allow for more meaningful

58
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,860
comparisons between strategies as now that can be used as standard universes for various algorithms

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,040
so it makes a lot easier to compare two different strategies on the same universe of stocks so now as

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,950
we continue let me just collapse this header click on that little icon and other we have basically our

61
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,720
basic universe of stocks inside our make a pipeline.

62
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,980
We're going to have something that looks like this will say universe is equal to chips.

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,630
Q Fifteen hundred U.S. executed.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,450
So that will basically show you the actual filter.

65
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,890
Again this will actually go inside or make pipelined But this is essentially what it's going to look

66
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,700
like.

67
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,200
Now let's go ahead and quickly review how to filter the universe further with classifiers such as those

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,050
Morningstar classifiers So we went over last time.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,090
So let's go ahead and try to grab stocks that are only in the energy sector and there's a link in the

70
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,870
notebook provided as far as how to actually get these sector codes.

71
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:09,060
But the way we do this is the following method will say from Quanto in pipeline that data import.

72
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:16,530
And we're gonna import Morningstar and then off of Morningstar this is really similar to the get fundamentals

73
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,300
so we covered a lot earlier.

74
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:26,080
The basic idea being that if you hit tab here you have basically 13 types of fundamental data.

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,410
So let's go ahead and grab assett classification and then we'll say here and then there's the various

76
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,230
things that are kind of sub sections of asset classification as well as just some methods that are more

77
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,310
Python related.

78
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,060
But we're going to go ahead and grab Morningstar sector code and then we're off of this.

79
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,560
We'll say latest and we can set that equal to sector.

80
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,280
Now if you remember back to our previous lectures on pipeline we actually showed you kind of a quick

81
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,110
shortcut to doing this sector because it's such a common classifier and the way you did that is you

82
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,810
just did these two lines you could say from Quanto opened up pipeline that classifiers Morningstar import

83
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,120
sector and then you would say Morningstar sector or sector is equal to actually implementing or ex-king

84
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
sector.

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,590
This is the exact same thing as what we appear.

86
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,900
Now while this code is actually probably more efficient.

87
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,730
My personal preference is to actually go through the full steps of choosing the category and then choosing

88
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,760
the subcategory and then calling the latest.

89
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,370
Because here I can see where I am actually grabbing sector code from what actual 13 Group classing is

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,100
in.

91
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
So I prefer this method.

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,810
This method is a little more efficient but just kind of personal preference there.

93
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,720
So I'm going to delete that because we essentially already have that here.

94
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,560
And then the sector we want is the energy sector.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,010
So again check out the link in the notebook to see the different sector codes.

96
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:59,480
But the way you would do this is if you want the energy sector you would call sector and then do that.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,600
Q So basically asking where the sector is equal to and you type in the sector code which is a numerical

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,390
code and for the energy sector is 3 or 9.

99
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,450
Again there's a link for the different sector codes in the notebook.

100
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,260
So now this is a classifier because it's going to classify the assets into their sectors.

101
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:23,700
And from this classifier using the stock ECU for equals I made a filter filtering for the energy sector.

102
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,240
So now essentially I have two filters.

103
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,960
One is this giant filter already provided from Quanto in which gives me the top fifteen hundred tradable

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
stocks.

105
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,210
And then this filter from a classifier that gives back stocks that are only in the energy sector.

106
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,630
So let's quickly review masking filters so masks can be applied to methods that return filters like

107
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,330
top bottom and percentile between.

108
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,600
And masks are most useful when we want to apply a filter in the earlier steps of a combined computation.

109
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,790
Remember what we discussed that masking can really help make your code a lot more efficient.

110
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,050
So for example suppose we want to get the I don't know 50 securities with the highest open price that

111
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,660
are also in the top 10 percent of dollar volume.

112
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,190
Masking is a good way to do that.

113
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,130
And then we can also do things like Rab's stocks that are in the 19th to 100 percentile based on close

114
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,540
price.

115
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,330
So let's go ahead and import some factors and show you how we can actually execute those we'll say from

116
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,240
Quanto in the pipeline.

117
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,260
Factors import.

118
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,960
And we've done these imports before.

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,100
Things like simple moving average and then there's another one average dollar volume.

120
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,760
So we're going to zoom out just a little bit so we can see it simply moving average average dollar volume.

121
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,240
Those are two really common factors you'll see all the time.

122
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,160
So let's go ahead and kind of create instances of these factors.

123
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,270
So the way that would look is essentially just a bunch of steps and these steps would be implemented

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,490
inside your make pipeline function.

125
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,740
So a lot of these things that we're doing such as the cell number three and the cell number 6 as well

126
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,400
as all the imports related to them.

127
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,890
Those would actually go in relation to that make pipeline function right now since we're in the research

128
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,050
now but we're doing it sell by so but later on when you actually go to the idea we'll have a giant function

129
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,260
that does all this.

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,380
As far as grabbing the sort of masking filters the way this will work is we'll create something called

131
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,460
dollar volume and set that equal to the average dollar volume.

132
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,330
And then this is going to take some sort of window length so you can see it takes a bunch of other arguments

133
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:28,200
but really it's is when the length so I'll say window length window underscore length is equal to 30

134
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,110
days.

135
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,150
So this gives me back.

136
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,030
Hey what was the average dollar volume for the past 30 days.

137
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:41,540
Then once you have dollar volume what you can do is well let me just run this so we can see this ourselves.

138
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,570
Once you have dollar volume you can say dots and you notice there's a bunch of different methods some

139
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,210
of them basically kind of totally useless to us.

140
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,830
But the really common ones that you'll be using are things like top.

141
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,550
So this returns wups sort of turns back essentially the top and asset values of self.

142
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,950
So if I wanted the top five based off average dollar volumes the top five securities based on the average

143
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,260
dollar volume traded for the past 30 days I can say top and then pass five.

144
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,050
So that's a really common one to use if you want the bottom.

145
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,770
Then you just do that bottom.

146
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,260
And if you look at this it's going to construct a filter matching the bottom and assets values for each

147
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,430
self day.

148
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,030
And then finally the last really common one is percentile between.

149
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,370
So if you don't want the top 10 or the top let's say you don't want to top 10 or the bottom 10 Instead

150
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,670
you want the top 15 percent.

151
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,100
So you actually want to do as a percentage base instead of just an actual number of securities based

152
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,780
you can just use percentile between the past and two arguments.

153
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,400
So if you want the top 10 percent of stocks based on average dollar volume you're going to say give

154
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,610
me between the top 90th percentile and the 100 percent tile.

155
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,930
So you would call this something like dollar volume.

156
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,800
So again all we're doing here is we're asking hey give me the average dollar volume factor and then

157
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,960
based on the past 30 days that's the volume of dollars traded based in the past three days.

158
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,390
And give me the top 10 percent of stocks.

159
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,040
So that's those are high dollar volume stocks basically stocks that are being traded a lot.

160
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,570
So since these are high dollar volume stocks we know that we're always going to be able to execute our

161
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,870
trades and we also know implicitly that these are very popular stocks.

162
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,450
So there are a lot more liquid than other stocks.

163
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,730
And then another thing we can do is actually combine these sort of mass skiing's with filters.

164
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:38,530
So for example we want a top open price filter so we can do something like U.S. equity pricing the open

165
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,850
price.

166
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:48,840
Give me the latest open price and then ask for the top 50 and I will say these are the top open prices

167
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,420
but what I'm going to also add onto this is a mask based off of this filter this high dollar volume

168
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,120
filter.

169
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,620
So basically kind of combining these and I'll say umask is equal to high dollar volume.

170
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,090
So now what is actually going on.

171
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,420
Well I'm basically saying go ahead and grab the top 10 percent of securities based off their dollar

172
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,660
volume traded over the past 30 days and then from that only giving back the top 50 based off the open

173
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
price.

174
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,680
So I'm kind of doing the top 50.

175
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,390
But before that I'm applying this mask.

176
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,020
So now I have this kind of top open prices.

177
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,480
Another example of doing this would be something like let's say high close price.

178
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,750
I could say grab U.S. equity pricing the latest close price for that and then maybe something like percentile

179
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,830
between where.

180
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,240
Give me the top 10 percent off the close price.

181
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,290
And then I could do something like another mask and I can actually then apply this mask to it so I can

182
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,540
kind of keep piling these on top of each other and then say top open prices.

183
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,130
So now essentially what I'm doing is saying OK every dollar volume past three days top 10 percent of

184
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:03,610
that the top 50 of those softer open price and then off those top 10 percent based off their clothes

185
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,830
price.

186
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,430
So you can see how we can kind of continually filter these and applying these factors as filters and

187
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,690
masks.

188
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,180
So that's all we're going to do for now.

189
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,570
Well we're going to do it in the next lecture is actually put all of these things to work inside of

190
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:22,000
a nice make pipeline function then off of that and then lecture after that we're going to go ahead and

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,860
show you how you can implement that in the ID.

192
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,330
OK.

193
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,790
Do you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

194
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,030
But definitely check out the notebook.

195
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,130
There's a lot more explanatory text and helpful links there.

196
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,870
Thanks everyone.

197
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,730
I'll see you at the next lecture.
