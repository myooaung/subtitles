00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.030
Hi everyone welcome to the exercise solution's lecture for pandas visualization problems.

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.910
Let's go ahead and jump to Jupiter notebook and get started.

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.830
All right here at the notebook I'm going to go ahead and run the first few cells of code to read the

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.880
D3 CACP file set up all the imports correctly and check out the head.

5
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.190
All right.

6
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.810
Next thing I wanted to do was to recreate a scatterplot of B versus a.

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.560
So just those two columns.

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:43.130
Let's go ahead and do that by saying D-3 dot plot scatter and then I'm going to go out and specify that

9
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.000
I want my x axis a column on my y axis I want the B column.

10
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.810
Let's just see what that looks like.

11
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.680
And this should be the EF 3.

12
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.600
There we go.

13
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.340
So I'm getting a similar plot except something to know was.

14
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.290
See if you can figure out how to stretch it in a similar fashion to this plot.

15
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.700
And as we went over in the lecture you can actually just passen fig sized directly into this argument

16
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.000
as a parameter and we can stretch it out.

17
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.050
So and then another thing to note here is that the size of these points is a little bigger.

18
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.120
So you can actually specify that as we saw in the lecture either by another column or just by passing

19
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.710
in S for size.

20
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.250
And I'm going to specify the size to be 50.

21
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.990
Here we have the points are a little larger and for the color it was c we saw in the lecture how we

22
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.810
can specify color by another column.

23
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.970
But you can also just pass on a string as you could for map plot lib.

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.680
And here now we have a recreation of that plot.

25
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.120
Exactly.

26
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.860
OK.

27
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.080
The main thing I wanted you to get out of this particular question was just the step of plot that scatter

28
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.960
a Versus be so x and y.

29
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.150
Don't worry too much if you were able to get the sizing or the coloring size.

30
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.360
Hopefully you are able to get that OK.

31
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.150
Moving on now I want to create a histogram of the A column.

32
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.900
This is actually quite simple.

33
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:17.250
Just call the column itself and then say either just to see the histogram or you can also say plot dot

34
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.590
just they'll return the same histogram.

35
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.490
And this is the default number of bins.

36
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.010
But you can also pass in an argument if you want it more bins.

37
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.350
All right.

38
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.190
The next issue was that these plots are OK but they don't look very polished and the instructions said

39
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.920
use style sheets to set the style to GZ plot and redo the histogram from above and also figure out how

40
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.650
to add more bits to it.

41
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.610
This is a topic that we actually didn't cover in the video lecture but it is covered in the notebook

42
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.880
so hopefully had either two paths one you rechecked the notebook to figure out what style sheets was

43
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.850
referring to or do google search.

44
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.470
Matt Cutlip stylesheets.

45
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.800
If not it could have also posted to the Q and A forum to get to what I was referencing there.

46
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.460
If you go ahead and check out the note book lecture for pandas built in data visualization there's a

47
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.260
stylesheet section and this is kind of just to get you in the mood of trying to discover aspects on

48
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.380
your own.

49
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.620
You can see that map Cutlip has a stylesheets and there's a little reference link there.

50
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.750
And if you google search this you probably would have also gone to this page and this is the gallery

51
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.080
and there's a stylesheet section in the gallery and the basic premise or idea is that you can use Piel

52
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.970
t that style that use pass any string of a style and it will automatically change the aesthetics to

53
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.730
a particular style that looks like this.

54
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.510
You say peel T-Dog style that use G-G plot.

55
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.210
So I'm going to just copy this line of code come over here and paste it.

56
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.370
And now since this has been run you'll notice that if we go ahead and copy and paste the exact line

57
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.650
of code here.

58
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.260
And pasted in here we get a much better looking plot.

59
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.360
And you'll also notice that here this red is a little more see through.

60
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.890
So you can also pass in an alpha to make it a little more transparent.

61
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.960
And here you can begin to start matching these histograms together.

62
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.830
Hopefully that wasn't too challenging for you but there is that aspect of kind of discovering things

63
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.770
on your own which is probably the most important part of learning data science and learning programming.

64
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.300
The ability to search for an answer on your own without being given the full context of information

65
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.640
however you can always feel free to post on the Q&amp;A forums if anything's ever confusing to you.

66
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.820
All right let's go ahead and move on to the box plots we wanted to create a box plot comparing the A

67
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.760
and B columns.

68
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.190
We take a look at what's the on that we take a look at just the data frame itself.

69
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.650
Notice we have a b c and d columns so I don't want to get a box plot of all the columns.

70
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.060
I just want a B.

71
00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.820
So I'm actually just going to grab those columns by passing and a list of those column names A and B

72
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:09.100
and then I can call plot box or create a box plot that looks the same as this one.

73
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.180
OK Next I wanted to create a plot of the D column.

74
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.010
Again that's actually pretty straightforward.

75
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.740
You just pass in the D column say plot and then say Katie and I'll return this plot.

76
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.510
And then finally we have a we're here to figure out how to increase line with and make the line styled

77
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.220
dash and no you would usually not dash a KDE plotline.

78
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.940
All right.

79
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:40.950
So the way you can do this is actually just take this same plot Katie or density.

80
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.690
And then you can go ahead and passen arguments from that plot live.

81
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.500
Such as line style and line with.

82
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.870
And here we get the same plot.

83
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.340
And you can also do this with density if you want it to.

84
00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.430
That's the same command that we wanted to create an area a plot of all the columns for just the rules

85
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.780
up to 30 and then it said Hintz use x.

86
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:13.320
So hopefully you can discover by calling X D-3 I X you can see that this is a property and it's a primarily

87
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.870
a label location based in indexer with integer position fallback.

88
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.120
And so what you can do is actually just use this for slicing.

89
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.200
And again that's kind of a thing I want you to discover as you go along on your own.

90
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.740
So you can passen 0 through 30 here and this will return just the first 30 rows or whatever is slicing

91
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.910
notation you wanted.

92
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.590
And then off of that call plot area and you get a plot that looks like this.

93
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.040
And if you wanted it to look like the plot below you could actually put it in Alpha value there all

94
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.670
right.

95
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.020
There was a bonus challenge and note you may find this really hard.

96
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.540
References solutions you can't figure it out but notice how.

97
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.310
Up here the legend was actually overlapping some of the actual diagram.

98
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.070
They usually wouldn't want that and I wanted you to figure out how you can display the legend outside

99
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:08.190
of the plot as shown below over here and again back on that theme of trying to discover things on your

100
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.740
own.

101
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.550
I wanted to for you to try google searching for a good stack overflow link and if you can find it on

102
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.450
your own.

103
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.120
There was a link to a stack overflow question.

104
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.940
So if we take a look at this link on Stack Overflow someone is asking how to put the legend outside

105
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.330
the plot with Pandurs.

106
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.940
And if we kind of scroll over here and take a look at this you'll notice that someone actually answer

107
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.490
this question correctly and they said right here the appeal to that legend location center left and

108
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.530
then this beby box to anchor.

109
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.710
That's the key here.

110
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.830
And you can actually just copy this code and paste it here and then take the other code of this area

111
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.260
A-plot

112
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.870
and paste it here and then when we want to do is create a thicker

113
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.540
for these to be all called and then we'll say puberty that show and this will create a figure with the

114
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.330
legend outside.

115
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.430
This would also work if you actually remove the first line and the last line in Jupiter note book.

116
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.500
In other situations such as other ID errors you may have to actually find a figure and show the figure

117
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:26.050
but since you bring it up you actually just run these two lines and it will remove the legend and place

118
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.520
it on the outside.

119
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.870
So the basic idea here is hopefully you can discover on your own how to grab these sort of lines of

120
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.200
code and put them into your own code.

121
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.440
And that's actually a very common thing to do.

122
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.110
You check on Stack Overflow see what lines of code are relevant to you and then fit them into your own

123
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.040
work OK.

124
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:43.910
That's it.

125
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.450
Great job everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.

126
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.270
Feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums if anything was confusing here for you.
