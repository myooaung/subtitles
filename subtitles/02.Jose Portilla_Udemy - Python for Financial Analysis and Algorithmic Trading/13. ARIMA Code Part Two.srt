1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,100
Welcome back everyone to part two of the Arema code along we finished visualizing the data.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,190
And we also then eat the composition plot on the data.

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,400
Now it's time to actually test the data is stationary or not.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,640
It's pretty obvious that it is not stationary just from viewing the data.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,140
There is some clear seasonality to it but let's show you how you can test this mathematically using

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,950
stat's models specifically.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,190
We'll be using the decie fuller test.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,030
Let's go ahead and hop over to Jupiter notebook and continue on.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,620
All right back to the Jupiter No but we're going to scroll down here and let's check out what our data

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,620
looks like just so we can remind ourselves.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,040
We have this daytime index that we've called month and then we have milk in pounds per cow.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,560
But we actually want to do is see if we can mathematically show that this data is either stationary

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,060
or non stationary.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,830
And to do that we can use the augmented decie fuller unit root test.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,930
Essentially what it is it's a statistical test that has a null hypothesis and the null hypothesis is

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,670
that it is a non stationary time series.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,070
And the alternative hypothesis is that the series has no unit and actually is stationary.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,960
And we're going to decide on this based off a p value returned a small p value typically less than point

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,190
0 5 indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,500
So you then reject the null hypothesis remember that our null hypothesis here is that the time series

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,390
is non stationary.

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:33,020
A large p value if we get back a p value greater than points or 5 that indicates weak evidence against

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,140
the null hypothesis.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,940
So you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,080
Don't use the word accept the null hypothesis.

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,210
You just fail to reject it because you don't really know if the null hypothesis is 100 percent true.

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,610
You just don't have enough evidence here that will allow you to reject that completely.

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,620
So let's show you how you can use that models to actually run the augmented Dicky for tests on our data.

29
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:06,920
We're going to do is say from SATs models the TSA stat tools we're going to import 80 fooler and this

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,950
little function Eighty-Four has everything inside of it that we need.

31
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:19,000
So all we end up doing is we just create a result variable and call the fooler on our actual time series.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,090
In this case just the DFA milk pounds per cow.

33
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,060
And if you take a look at shift tab here it kind of explains the decie for unit test.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,370
There are some other things you can add in as parameters.

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,950
We won't get too fancy if it will just leave everything default and then it also will explain what it

36
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,030
actually returns so returns this ATF test to stick it returns the P-value that's that we're going to

37
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,280
be most concerned with.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,990
They'll also tell you the number of lags used and then number of observations critical values etc..

39
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:52,300
So let's run this and then we're going to create a little function here called ADF check that takes

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,260
in time series and then we're going to perform the following so we're actually going to kind of function

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,820
size the way we actually check out the result because if you look at the result right now it's just

42
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,370
the tuple here and it's not really nicely formatted.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,200
So we're going to create a function that kind of nicely formats this for us.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,640
So we'll say the following.

45
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,870
Zoom out one little level here so I can see the whole function as I program it.

46
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:23,910
We're going to do is define a function f check inside this function we're going to say result is equal

47
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,920
to the fooler the time series so we'll actually just pass a time series into the function itself.

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,350
This will allow us to kind of repeatedly do it the check in case we need to do it later on once or then

49
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,120
that we're going to print out just the name of the test we just ran.

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:50,380
Augmented decie full or test then I'll create a list of labels and labels are going to correspond to

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,970
what that result actually has in its order or the tuple.

52
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,520
So we have an ADF test statistics statistic that was the first one.

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,430
The next one is that P-value lips start a the line there will have a p value.

54
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,090
Next thing then the next thing is the number of lags.

55
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,970
You saw a number of lags and then what we're going to end up doing is basically kind of nicely print

56
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,370
these out.

57
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:25,200
So less what we want to come here is of observations.

58
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,260
So if you knows we have the ADF testers to stick the P-value number of lags in number of observations

59
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,050
we don't really concern ourselves with these other values here.

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,210
These are the only ones who want to care about the labels.

61
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,910
So let's go ahead and we're going to end up doing the following.

62
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:52,570
We'll say for value label in that it will zip together the result to tuple with my labels list but just

63
00:04:52,570 --> 00:05:03,530
going to print my label plus we'll just have some space there then plus the string of my value so cases

64
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,040
number just make into a string that way prints out nicely.

65
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:14,960
And then after this once that's done I'm going to say if results 1 and remember that is my P-value right

66
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,170
here.

67
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,100
The second one.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,670
So 0 1.

69
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:29,270
So if this p value is less than or equal to 0.05 I'm going to print the following statement strong evidence

70
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,700
against null hypothesis.

71
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:40,700
So there's strong evidence against the null hypothesis which means I'm going to reject the null hypothesis

72
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,260
so I'll print another line.

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,060
Reject all hypothesis

74
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:58,670
which then I'm going to say data has no unit root and if it ends up rejecting an all hypothesis it has

75
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,700
no root.

76
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:09,700
I will say and is stationary else it's going to be the exact opposite sign going to essentially fail

77
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,030
to reject the null hypothesis.

78
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,710
So I ain't going to do the following.

79
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:24,280
So Otherwise if that p value is greater than 0.05 I'm going to say strong evidence.

80
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,980
Whoops I mean weak evidence sorry.

81
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:40,360
Weak evidence against null hypothesis that I'm going to present fail to reject null hypothesis

82
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:51,490
and then after that I'm finally going to Prince since we reject the hypothesis we're going to assume

83
00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:00,720
that time series has een in the kitting it is not stationary data has a unique root.

84
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,570
It is non stationary.

85
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,210
OK so now we have this Niceville function here that basically is going to print out everything nicely

86
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,340
for us and only have to do is pass in the state of frame or that column of the data frame.

87
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,430
So let's try that out.

88
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,170
Let's call it the check on our time series.

89
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,380
In this case it was just m. Compounce pako.

90
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,180
Well run it and we get back to falling.

91
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,270
OK we have the tests to stick the p value is 0.6 to number of observations etc. so it says weak evidence

92
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,880
against the null hypothesis failed to reject null hypothesis data has a unique root.

93
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,970
It is not stationary and that is actually what we expected remember when we plotted out this data.

94
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,390
Clearly it is not stationary.

95
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,950
There are some serious seasonality to this and there is even a trend there.

96
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,580
So it is not stationary for sure.

97
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,460
So given that doing is differencing So remember that we can take the first difference of a time series

98
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,030
which is just a change from one period to the next so we can easily calculate this with pantless.

99
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,600
So I'm going to take the difference.

100
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,120
I'll take the first difference.

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll take the second difference and then also show you how you can take a seasonal difference so will

102
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,140
show you all those different CG techniques and it will pass those in to the ADF check function that

103
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,140
we just did and will check which one of them provides a stationary dataset for us to work with

104
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,850
so I'll say the familiar pounds per cow then I'm going to say.

105
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,520
Well let me actually save this to some sort of value.

106
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:43,390
Will say well ADF and let's make a new column called first difference.

107
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,410
So say.

108
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:53,580
Milk in pounds per cow and then we're going to do is we're going to subtract DMF milk pounds per cow.

109
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,980
Then I will shift one over.

110
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,730
So we're basically subtracting everything shifted over one time series or one type step excuse me.

111
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,820
And now if I take a look at my first difference if I just plot this you'll notice the effect is kind

112
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,960
of drastic here.

113
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,990
This is the first difference so it's definitely been flattened out.

114
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,480
You kind of removed that trend and the variance looks pretty average So we'll see if this is enough.

115
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,330
Let's actually end up calling the fact check on our first difference

116
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,260
and make sure that's correct.

117
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,290
But I need to do is drop the N.A. values because we took the first difference we're missing one value

118
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,910
here at the very beginning so that messes up the ATF function.

119
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,710
So try it again.

120
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,750
And there we have it.

121
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,420
So check first different stripe and a we can see here we have a p value of 0.03.

122
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,210
It says strong evidence against null hypothesis reject the null hypothesis data has no unit and is stationary.

123
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,950
And if I look at this visualization It does look pretty stationary but let's say this still wasn't enough

124
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,950
to make a stationary.

125
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,460
You had kind of this weird time series The first difference wasn't enough.

126
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,110
You never know.

127
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,750
Different time series that did more than one difference you can do.

128
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,770
A second difference.

129
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,820
So I'll show you how to do that.

130
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,380
In case you ever find the need for it to take a second difference what you just do is say create new

131
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:22,640
column milk second difference and what that it's going to be equal to is milk first difference.

132
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:30,510
Make sure it's called just first difference excuse me first difference minus DMF first difference shifted

133
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,490
over by one and then we can do or eat the check against that second difference.

134
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,440
So say the check against the milk second difference run that again.

135
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,930
We have to drop the any values.

136
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,310
Sorry I forgot that now are missing 2 on the second difference here and there we have it.

137
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,110
So then we get I went to Turkey for a test P-value point 0 3.

138
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,340
You can see that not much has changed.

139
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:06,070
And in fact if we just plot this out the milk second difference dot plot you can see here it looks almost

140
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,940
the same on the second.

141
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,230
Different.

142
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,950
So really it was the first difference that did most of the elimination of the trend.

143
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,050
OK what else want to discuss is because we have seasonal data and we will do a seasonal Arema at the

144
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,800
end of this.

145
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,780
You can also take a seasonal difference.

146
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,910
So the way you can do that is the following.

147
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,080
You can say DMF

148
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,880
seasonal difference is equal to the.

149
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,830
And we'll take our original call a million pounds per cow.

150
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:40,250
Now I'm going to subtract it from 15 pounds per cow but I'm gonna shift this over by an entire season

151
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:48,750
that is by 12 and then if we take a look at our seasonal difference and plot that out we get something

152
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,520
like this.

153
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,560
So this may or may not be enough to pass our tests.

154
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,620
Let's go ahead and copy this and actually pass it into our check.

155
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,260
And again sorry I keep forgetting I dropped in lvalues

156
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:05,980
and there we go.

157
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,840
We are P-value point 1:06 that's actually not enough.

158
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,700
This is still considered a non stationary dataset and you can see it's definitely not stationary because

159
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,750
it looks like as you get further in time the variance begins to increase.

160
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,420
We can kind of see that visually here.

161
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,650
So sometimes though people like to do is when they want to take into account a seasonal difference but

162
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,870
it's not enough like this.

163
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,780
You can do a seasonal first difference so the way that works is you create in your column we'll call

164
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:41,110
it seasonal ferse difference and then you said equal to T.F. the milk first difference or I believe

165
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:50,150
wasn't milk it was just the first difference of this and then you're going to subtract the first difference

166
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,270
and for the second difference we shifted by one but the seasonal first difference so shifted by an entire

167
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,500
season.

168
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,520
And there you have it.

169
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,220
And check out these seasonal first difference.

170
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,730
Plot it out see what it looks like.

171
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:12,710
OK this looks pretty stationary but let's actually confirm with mathematics for EDF check.

172
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,030
We'll get our seasonal first difference here.

173
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,320
And you do think I remember it by now but I guess not.

174
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,650
We have to drop it.

175
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,170
And there we have it.

176
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,020
So it looks like strong evidence against the hypothesis reject the null hypothesis.

177
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,800
Data has no unit and is stationary and you can see here the P-value says 1.9 1.

178
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,830
But notice it's either negative 5 so that's one point nine times ten to the power of negative 5.

179
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,710
So definitely a very low P value there.

180
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,510
So strong evidence that it's stationary.

181
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,000
OK.

182
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,900
Now that we learned how to do a first difference a second difference and then also explored seasonal

183
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,250
differences as well as seasonal first differences.

184
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,170
The next step would be actually plot out the autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation of plots

185
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,100
will go ahead and do that in part three in the next lecture.

186
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,760
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
