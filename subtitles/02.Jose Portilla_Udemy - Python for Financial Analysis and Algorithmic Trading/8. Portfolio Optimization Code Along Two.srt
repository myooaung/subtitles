00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,770
Welcome back everyone here we are at the same notebook where we left off last time and this lecture

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,740
we're going to take this process and go ahead and repeat it thousands of times.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,180
So to do this we're going to do the following first.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,560
We're going to get rid of all these print statements since we weren't really technically need them because

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,060
we don't want thousands of print statements.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,050
So let's go ahead and get rid of those.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,880
But the actual code we're going to go ahead and keep.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,230
So let's do the following have this and then have the weights attached.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,240
We'll call this just weights.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,680
So we're going to do here is all of this inside a for loop.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,950
But what we also need to do is we want to save a lot of these results so we can plot them out later.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,030
So let's create a couple of variables.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:56,030
We're going say the number of possible positions we're going to do or number of actual portfolios is

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,560
going to be let's say 5000 and you can increase this depending on how fast your computer is or you can

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,900
decrease it also if you have a slower computer.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,630
We're going to create an array to hold all the weights so we can save them and it's going to be the

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,850
number of ports by the length of the actual stocks column so I could just put four there.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,820
But that way if I say length stocks columns then this is a little more expandable to different portfolios

19
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,910
that have more than just the four stocks.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,290
We're concerned with then I'm going to create an array to hold the returns we'll say zeros and passing

21
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,430
the number of portfolios we want to apply and to create an array that holds the number of volatility

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,450
measurements we take.

23
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,100
Again pasand number of ports.

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:48,400
And then finally an array of the sharp ratios of cockily now again will be zero.

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,370
Let's make sure this one says zeros.

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,530
And then finally again a number of ports great.

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,580
And we're going to do is say for index in that range.

28
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,880
Number of ports will do the following.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,530
We'll create the random weights and then rebalance them.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,500
So that's a first step and we can do shift tab here or excuse me just tab to tab everything over.

31
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,250
So we want to rebalance the weights after we make them.

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,930
And then let's go ahead and save the weights.

33
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:25,700
So we're going to save the weights and we're going to take all the weights that variable we just made.

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,320
And at the particular index we're on for all those values we'll set it equal to weights basically just

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,230
using non-pay broadcasting here.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,050
So that saves the weights then we get the expected return.

37
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:45,500
And instead of saving it as a variable here we're going to do is get our return or a and set that particular

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,450
index equal to the results of this and we're going to the same thing here for the volatility instead

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,670
of saving it to just a single variable.

40
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,610
We'll say the volatility array at that index is equal to this results.

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,030
And then finally for the Sharpe ratio will do the same thing take the sharper way we just made.

42
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,020
And at that particular index we'll sit this equal to these results.

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,820
But notice here I'm using the same variables from before.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,430
So we actually want to replace those.

45
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:20,240
We're going to say the value return array at this index divided by the volatility or a value at this

46
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,740
index so we're going to run this and make sure we don't make bucks here so for and looks like I misspelled

47
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,450
the range let's fix that real quick.

48
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,710
OK.

49
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,180
So we are going to run this now the pending how fast your computer is.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,280
This may take some time.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,860
In the notebook provided for you.

52
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,390
I ran it twenty five thousand times five times longer than what I just had here.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,180
But 5000 should be enough for us to actually see the bullet shape.

54
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,080
So let's kind of explore it just a little bit.

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:55,060
And delete this and let's check out the sharp array and we're going to do is ask for the max.

56
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,950
So looks like the maximum Sharpe ratio we got was one point zero three years maybe a little different

57
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,650
remember depending if you have this random seed number inside the same cell you may get different results

58
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:05,910
here.

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,420
But if you actually set the random seed in the same cell and have all these same coat here you should

60
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,500
have actually gotten the exact same result I did.

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,140
Or something extremely similar.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,100
So if one of another location of this sharper.

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:26,580
We can just say Max and returns back the location of the best SERP ratio so I can take the index location

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,540
and do the following.

65
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,980
I can say okay for all the weights go ahead and pass it in the index location 14:20 and then grabbing

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,750
the allocations.

67
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,490
And here we can see the optimal allocation out of these 5000 random allocations.

68
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
So moving along here.

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,980
Let's go ahead and plot out the data.

70
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,150
So we're going to say peel t figure and the Sorge is going to set the fix.

71
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,370
Real quick.

72
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:59,430
Say create a 12 by 8 and then I'm going to call that plot lives scatter functionality and we're going

73
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,450
to pass in the volatility array the return array for the returns and then I'm going to color this by

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,730
the sharp re-issue array and I personally like for this plot the plasma color mapping that you can in

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
whatever color mapping you want or just use that default.

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,980
Don't even bother if a color mapping here kind of up to you and then to actually see something on the

77
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:32,340
color bar you can give a label Sharpe ratio and let's give some labels to the x and y axis so say peel

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,030
T X label that's going to be our volatility.

79
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,760
And then the peel t y label that's going to be your actual return.

80
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,590
And before we run this cell let's make sure we spell color bar correctly.

81
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,670
Let's run this make sure it works.

82
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:57,370
And here we have that bullet shape so we can do is see the volatility and the return colored by the

83
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,140
Sharpe ratio and depending on how many points you did this may be less or more filled out here.

84
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,930
But we're counting or we're going to do now is go ahead and put a red dot for the max Sharpe ratio we're

85
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,420
going to be somewhere around here based off the color bar scheme.

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,160
Let's go ahead and do that.

87
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,110
We're just going to basically do another scatterplot except this time with just one point.

88
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,150
We're going to say grab that.

89
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,760
Max Sharpe ratio.

90
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,090
So let's go ahead and show you how he can grab that.

91
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,410
So remember we have this all Waite's 14:20 going to do the following.

92
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:37,110
We'll say Max as our return is equal to return array at that particular index 14:20 and then the max

93
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:47,490
Sharpe ratio volatility is equal to volatility array at that index 14:20.

94
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,100
So we run that and then we're going to scatterplot those two points.

95
00:06:51,150 --> 00:07:03,020
So say Max as our volatility and then Max as our return we'll give the color to be red and then let's

96
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,070
go ahead to make the size much larger.

97
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,640
So it's like really obvious.

98
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,490
And then let's also even give it an edge color.

99
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,530
So that's also obvious we'll say it's colors or just black.

100
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,800
OK so give us a nice little red circle here.

101
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:21,480
And as far as our 5000 random allocations it looks like the best only got was overy around here.

102
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,080
Well if I can point to one volatility and around a point two in the return.

103
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,030
OK.

104
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,200
So that's the way we can do this randomly in the next lecture we're going to do is actually optimize

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,730
this mathematically and show you how you can calculate the efficient frontier which is essentially going

106
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:43,360
to be this borderline which points out the max return per volatility.

107
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,140
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
