00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,310
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on portfolio analysis with PI Fulvio so Quanto it has a built

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,760
in library called pi Foleo and PI ff..

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,250
Also open source you can check out its own page and has great documentation on its own Web site which

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,750
I would definitely encourage you to check out.

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,550
There's a link in the resources for you to check that out and what it basically does is it creates tear

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,530
sheets which are just sheets with a bunch of information on them and then it also has a bunch of informative

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,170
plots that can easily create with one liners.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,790
So we're going to explore this.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,780
The main things we're going to do this lecture is just set up two algorithms for us to get back to us

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,240
on.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,540
And then we'll do a bunch of full calls and see all the plots that are available to us.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,810
So let's head over to Quanto up in.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,980
I don't have a notebook and an ID open.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,530
OK so here I am at the research notebook and I'm going to do a couple of imports.

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,740
I will say import let me just zoom in here by Fulvio as P.F. and then I'm going to import that plot

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,670
lived up pipe plots as Piazzi and I'll import another library that's built in here that we're going

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,000
to be using later on called empirical OK.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,150
Then the next thing I want to do is get some actual algorithmic returns.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,560
So he wants algo returns and we're going to use the same algorithm we use in our leverage lecture.

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:26,590
So remember if you come back to the IEEE slimmy go back to this algorithm we had our leverage example

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,420
and the leverage example is really simple.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,990
It just said send half her portfolio to go long on Amazon and half your portfolio to short IBM and then

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,580
we also set some set max leverage.

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,660
You can also just hashtag that out.

25
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,320
Really what I want to do is just have this really symbolic rhythm that every day it essentially goes

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,640
long on Amazon and goes short on IBM.

27
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,980
So we're going to back test this let's say for two years.

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,260
So from January 2015 to January 2017 and then I'm going to run the full back test in order to actually

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,790
get the hash code for the test so I can remember GRABBE up here from the L.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,790
That second half after the forward slash that is the back test Tasche.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,200
So we're going to copy and paste that you can see here we have pretty good returns makes sense because

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,830
we essentially knew the future when we designed the algorithm.

33
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,780
So we're going to come back here and we'll say the following.

34
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,150
We're going to say BT is equal to get back test.

35
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,290
And then I'm going to in that hash.

36
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,010
It's going to get the back test for me and then I'm going to grab some information that we're going

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,380
to be using from this.

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,200
So we're going to say Beati returns is equal to BT dots and if you look at all the things that are available

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,930
here as far as attributes one of them is called daily performance and you can go ahead and grab return's

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,120
off of that.

41
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,870
So within that back test we have daily performance information which if you come up here you can see

42
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,520
there's daily positions and gains.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,890
So that's the information we're kind of grabbing in a different format.

44
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,590
So we have our back tax returns.

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,800
And I'm also going to do a couple more things here.

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:06,000
We're going to create an object called back test positions and set that equal to back test PI Foleo

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,270
positions which is another attribute we're going to be using.

48
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:18,670
And then we're going to say BT transactions is equal to BT The PI Foleo transactions.

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,120
So you can already see the Quanto IP and has a lot of these things built in mind that you're going to

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,070
be using by Fulvio as part of the analysis kind of aspect of this whole platform.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,870
She'll be getting back to us from whatever algorithms you're messing around with grabbing the returns

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,130
grabbing the positions and grabbing the transactions with these three key things we can do a lot of

53
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,490
plots with by Foleo and get a lot of informative information out.

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,160
So whatever algorithmic returns what we also need in order to do a lot of these comparison plot's is

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,720
actually get benchmark returns.

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,010
So the way we're going to do that is we're going to create a really simple algorithm and I encourage

57
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,630
you just to copy and paste this.

58
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,310
So we're going to come back here to the algorithm itself and I'm going to delete everything we have

59
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,030
here and I'm going to copy and paste the algorithm that's available to you.

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,860
And you know book and if you want you can do this yourself.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,850
But basically the main idea is I'm going to end.

62
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,290
We don't really need this Max leverage but that's ok.

63
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,710
I will set spy as the security and I'm going to say 100 percent of my for Foleo to go long on Spy Maurice

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,020
spiciest be five hundred.

65
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,110
So this is essentially going to mimic the benchmark.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,370
So I'm going to now run a fallback test on this same time period and that's kind of important.

67
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,580
It needs to be at the same time period as you did for the other one otherwise you have kind of mismatch

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,140
data.

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,080
And you know decir that our red line and Blue Line are almost the same thing.

70
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,330
Basically we just have some tiny bit of losses due to commission and trading or slipping etc. but that's

71
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,990
kind of a quick and dirty way to essentially get the benchmark.

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:54,600
So we're going to do here is grab this back test hash code and then this is for benchmark so will say

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,700
a benchmark and then I'm going to do the following.

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:07,710
I'll say benchmark returns is equal to get the back test my benchmark and then we're going to do the

75
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:07,980
following.

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,580
We'll say B-M returns is equal to benchmark returns.

77
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,140
Whoops.

78
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,170
Some other stuff here so let's say.

79
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,110
Bench mark Retz that and the same thing as last time we'll say daily performance.

80
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,110
Give me the returns.

81
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,000
And this is probably not a good choice I should call this like benchmark or something.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,480
But essentially we're doing the exact same four steps that we did earlier.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:43,430
So we grabbed the returns and then we're going to say benchmark positions is equal to benchmark Rhett's

84
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:55,020
portfolio positions and then we're going to say B.M. transactions is equal to benchmark on the score.

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,130
Yes the PI Foleo underscore and we want transactions.

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,510
So we're going to run those two things.

87
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,510
And now we have all the information we need in order to use phileo.

88
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,800
So let's go ahead and check it out.

89
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,680
So there's also empirical which kind of gives you a bunch of information.

90
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,140
So if you want you can use empirical and you'll notice it has kind of alpha beta and all of volatility

91
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,410
Daily's the ability of time series etc. Sharpe ratio.

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,590
So it allows you to quickly grab information off a back test object or some returns.

93
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,970
So for instance if you look at the Sharpe ratio do shift happier what it expects.

94
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,920
If you provide the returns report back the Sharpe ratio of the strategy.

95
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,680
So for example we can pass in our back test returns I mean zoom in one more level.

96
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,880
Kind of these little clear and reports back that the sharper issue for our initial leverage algorithm

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,670
was 1.3 to you can compare that with the sharp ratio for just the benchmark itself saying empirical

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,430
Sharper's show and I will say be Emirates Hearn's run that and it's 0.4 7.

99
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,960
So you can see is a lot more volatility in the actual market itself versus kind of your own trading

100
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,770
strategy.

101
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,720
And it also has a bunch of other things to it.

102
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,710
You can play around with this library a lot but let's say you wanted to get your beta where you can

103
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,790
end up doing is you passen your returns versus the benchmark returns.

104
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,120
So that would look something like this.

105
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:22,890
You'll see your back to us returns versus the benchmark returns and it reports back your actual of value.

106
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,340
Okay.

107
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,750
So we have that information.

108
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,940
Let's go ahead and create some pie Fulvio plots.

109
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,260
Now if you're using a different time frame or a different algorithm your plots may look slightly different

110
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,280
than mine but it's okay as long as you actually get the plots and we're essentially just going to be

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,180
copy and pasting from the notes so keep that in mind.

112
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,980
The first thing to do is the following I'm going to make sure I don't accidentally call this benchmark

113
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,440
returns object by accident so I'm going to say benchmark rets is equal to be returned just to make sure

114
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,620
that they're now the same thing.

115
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,520
So let's start off with cumulative returns and then daily non cumulative returns and those are really

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,660
easy with Foleo.

117
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,570
So again I just copy and pasting from the notes here because a lot of this is just calling a single

118
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,450
line to plot.

119
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,430
So you can see here I calling PI Foleo P.F. plotting dots.

120
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,560
And then there's a ton of plots you can do.

121
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,460
So just to make that really clear be called for pi Foleo and then call P.L..

122
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,140
You can see all the different plots that are available for you.

123
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,430
You won't show all of these will just show the most useful ones that you can not do plotting dots and

124
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,270
you'll see a bunch of other stuff you can plot.

125
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,110
So a ton a ton of plots here and PI Foleo we're going to show you the most useful ones.

126
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,630
So if you run this you'll end up seeing a plot for Kulemin of returns and then daily noncommutative

127
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,180
returns.

128
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,600
And usually you want to compare it to a back test so you can see our returns versus the back test returns.

129
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,100
So our return is a lot flatter than the back itself.

130
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,070
So that's the actual trading algorithm performing a lot better than the S&amp;P 500.

131
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,030
And you can see here using plotting that plot returns.

132
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,730
It also has an automated plot for the returns themselves.

133
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,690
So that's one way of putting out your returns comparing it kind of on a cumulative return basis and

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,020
our returns themselves now we're able to actually do all this with pantless.

135
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,910
So let's go in and show you a couple of more plots again.

136
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,400
Copy and pasting from the notes pasted in here.

137
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Run this and you can see here we have three different plots.

138
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:25,260
We have the annual returns for our back test the monthly return distribution and then the monthly returns

139
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,920
heat map.

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,150
So what does this actually mean.

141
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,320
Well we have three plots.

142
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,770
We have annual returns.

143
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,510
So we can see here what our returns on average in excuse me are returns for 2015.

144
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,560
You can see we have around 60 percent returns.

145
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,060
And you can see for 2016 we actually had negative returns and the average between those two.

146
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,310
Is this dotted line here.

147
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,110
So that's the annual returns.

148
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,610
Here we can see the distribution of monthly returns and you can see kind of like the sister gram and

149
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:58,180
then the average marked by this dotted line and then that black line just represents or 0 percent returns.

150
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,740
And here is the number of months that had that particular amount of returns.

151
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,130
And finally over here on the right.

152
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,460
We have a heat map where it tells you the actual monthly returns and percentage.

153
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,550
So this allows you to tell that this basically allows you to quickly see what were your good months

154
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,370
and what were your bad months so you can quickly see our worst months were February 2016 and then kind

155
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,970
of our best months were the seventh month of 2015 and the 10th month of 2015.

156
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,940
So that kind of shows you early 2016 wasn't that great for us and kind of later 2015 was pretty good

157
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,750
for us.

158
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,420
Okay.

159
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,440
There's a bunch of other plots you can do you can also return the Quon tiles so we can run this and

160
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,780
this essentially gives you a box plot showing you the distribution for the returns distribution for

161
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,390
daily returns for weekly returns and then for monthly returns and it makes sense that you know a larger

162
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,210
timeframe your distribution of returns goes wider.

163
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,570
There's also a rolling beta plot.

164
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,440
So again just copy and pasting from the notes here.

165
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,570
So if you run this you're going to need to pass in your own bench your back tax returns versus the benchmark

166
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,230
returns.

167
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,000
Remember Bayda is calculated against some sort of benchmark.

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,390
So here we can see the six month and 12 month rolling beta.

169
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,900
So you can see how Bayda changes the pendant on the market conditions.

170
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,840
So then we have our average Bayda this kind of dotted line here.

171
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,130
So that's another thing to check out.

172
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,190
You can also see a rolling Sharpe ratio which is kind of fun.

173
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,370
So I'm going to pass that one in its plot underscore rolling sharp and that's when you just pass and

174
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,720
you're back to us because it's just telling you what was the ratio of your particular back test over

175
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,540
time.

176
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
So this is the ruling Sharpe ratio.

177
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,330
And by default it's a six month rolling Sharpe ratio.

178
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:44,750
But if Cziko shift tab here you can affect the window to whatever you want but here rolling six months

179
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,760
of operation and then it shows the average and then hear that black line is just zero.

180
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,050
Then there's also a bunch of other factors you can plot out something you can do like draw down so you

181
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,390
can say P.F. plot.

182
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,960
Draw them periods again.

183
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,120
Remember to check it those resource links back and rediscuss draw down.

184
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,320
So this will show you the top 10 10 draw down periods and it kind of colors them for you.

185
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,810
But what's also nice about this is sometimes people like to do what's known as an underwater plot which

186
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,670
is kind of almost like an inverse of what's going on here.

187
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,190
So if we run this it will show you the draw down underwater plot.

188
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,570
So here you can kind of clearly see the actual percentage draw downs as a factor of time here.

189
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,390
It will just color them for you and kind of show you the difference I mean like the peak in the troughs.

190
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:30,930
OK.

191
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,650
So again check out the research links for more information on that.

192
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,510
You can also do things like plot the gross leverage.

193
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,690
So I'm going to copy and paste that from the notes.

194
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:45,740
So this one again you're comparing it to the back test returns versus back test positions.

195
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,760
So it needs those two arguments here and then we'll show your gross leverage throughout time.

196
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,770
Then there's also things like tear sheets that you can do.

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,970
So it's going to copy and paste this from the notes but if you have a bunch of securities in your algorithm

198
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,100
it'll show you things like what were your top ten long positions of all time top ten short positions

199
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,690
etc. all positions ever held the maximum amount of time you were holding them etc. so you can see here.

200
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,280
In our case we were always shorting IBM and always long on Amazon.

201
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,990
So it didn't really change for our case but for more complex strategies where you're holding hundreds

202
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,210
of securities this will be a much more useful term sheet.

203
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,770
And if you're really interested in a full tear sheet that means just a bunch of information about your

204
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,880
portfolio you can say P.F. dot create roundtrip tear sheet.

205
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,210
So does create roundtrip tear sheet and it takes in the returns the positions and the transactions and

206
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:43,350
it basically gives you a huge Well just a bunch of data frames with a bunch of information.

207
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,590
So surgey the summaries that's so all the trades all your shorts all your longs what time are the percentage

208
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,560
really profitable.

209
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,970
How many winning trips how many losing round trips how many times.

210
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,620
Even the total profit gross profit center average trade net profit a lot of useful information here

211
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,570
on returns that successor.

212
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,430
And then if you keep scrolling down it will also show you the sort of like mapping plot for two positions

213
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,810
that are short and long.

214
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,010
It won't be super useful but definitely check out the examples in the documentation for what this would

215
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,000
normally look like.

216
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,230
But essentially it's just going to go blue when your long and then go red when you're short.

217
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,500
So in our case this entire time period we were short on IBM the entire time and long on Amazon the entire

218
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,130
time.

219
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,390
But if you have a much more securities and you kept jumping in and out of long and short positions you

220
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:33,040
kind of see what not what's not exactly heat map but it looks like a bunch of scattered red points and

221
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,760
blue points.

222
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,350
So it's kind of useful in here.

223
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,140
You can also see the probability of making a profitable decision.

224
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,070
The better algorithm that means higher probability you have.

225
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,420
And then also here holding time and days for the stock on average histogram of that information round

226
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,630
trip returns and percentage per round trip etc..

227
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,690
So lots of useful information there.

228
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,000
And that's basically what pipeful is therefore to make your life a lot easier.

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,810
Previously when we had a plot all this we had to do it manually if pandas but you can check of that

230
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,450
documentation for portfolio.

231
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,950
It has more explanations on what each of these charts means.

232
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,380
We didn't go through every single plot type but as your algorithms get more and more complex by Foleo

233
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,860
it's going to become a large and larger part of your ability to analyze your portfolio strategy.

234
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,660
OK.

235
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,970
That's it for this lecture.

236
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,750
Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next one.
