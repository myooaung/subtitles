00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.670
Welcome back everyone to the lecture on mask and classifiers with Quanto open pipeline's masking allows

2
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.190
us to tell our pipeline to ignore assets altogether before the factors are filter's even really take

3
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.940
place.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.780
We can pass in the mask parameter to both factors and filters.

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.240
Now previously we went ahead and applied filters through the screen mechanism at the very end of the

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240
pipeline.

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.670
That means that we still had to calculate things like the simple moving average for each individual

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.440
asset.

9
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.270
Using masking allows us to save a lot of computational work by actually applying that mask during that

10
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.290
factor step classifiers which we discussed earlier but haven't actually seen yet taken Assa and the

11
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.940
time stamp in return a categorical values such as a sector or an exchange.

12
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.650
Let's go out and see a few quick examples of both masking and classifiers and then we'll see how we

13
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.370
can use classifiers as filters themselves.

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.130
Hop over to the notebook now OK.

15
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.730
Here we have the make pipe line function from earlier and remember we have the 10 day simple moving

16
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.070
average as well as the 30 day simple moving average and the latest close price than we calculated a

17
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.000
percent difference.

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.620
And we also have two filters here which we combine to create a final filter.

19
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.390
Notice that this final filter it doesn't actually take place until we actually screen for it.

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.260
That means we had to calculate the simple moving averages for everything.

21
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.330
Let's go ahead and show you how you can kind of pasan a filter to be a mask for these factors right

22
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.380
here to save yourself some computational effort.

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.270
The first are going to do as little bit or refractory will grab the latest clothes and calculate that

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.000
first in our pipeline here so will first calculate the latest closing price and then we're going to

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.790
say this small price filter be created where the latest clothes is less than 5.

26
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.600
The reason we do that is because we're going to need this filter to exist.

27
00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.090
By the time we actually do our factors are simple moving averages and the way we do this is for masking.

28
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.410
We're going to just pass a parameter mask and said equal to small price and we'll do the exact same

29
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.630
thing over here.

30
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:19.740
We'll say a mask is equal to is equal to small price and what that actually does is it applies that

31
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.290
filter first before actually calculating these simple moving averages versus actually just doing it

32
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.860
at the very end through a screen.

33
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300
So that's going to save you a lot of computational effort.

34
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.680
Now simple moving averages are pretty easy computationally speaking but for other more complex computations

35
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.160
that are more involved for a factor you definitely want to use a mask and it's easy enough.

36
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.250
You just Pessin the mass parameter into your actual factor.

37
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.560
So let's go ahead and run this and that is what we get.

38
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.100
So we basically get the same result.

39
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.230
All the latest clothes prices happened to be less than $5 and we have the three they mean close as well

40
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.700
as the percent difference and we have this filter column which you can kind of get rid of if you want

41
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.600
to.

42
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.370
Now let's go ahead and move on and show you how to use classifiers.

43
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.640
I remember classifiers a function that takes in an asset and a moment in time or a time stamp and then

44
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.400
provide some sort of categorical output.

45
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.920
So it's going to feel really familiar.

46
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.340
If you remember the get fundamentals so the fundamentals used at Morningstar.

47
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.140
So I'll do a couple of imports here.

48
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.760
Let me zoom in one more level so we can see these imports.

49
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.620
We'll say from Quanto in the pipeline.

50
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.210
Data Import Morningstar.

51
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.220
And then we'll also save from Quanto in the pipeline.

52
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.160
Classifiers thoughts.

53
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.010
And you notice there's several classifiers here.

54
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.030
We're going to use Morningstar because that's something we kind of reviewed back in the fundamentals

55
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.940
although you can always check the documentation for the other sets.

56
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.480
We'll see.

57
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.270
Import.

58
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.240
If you hit tab here you can get sector so let's show you an example of what a really simple classifier

59
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.920
looks like.

60
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:08.880
We can say Morningstar underscore sector is equal to an instance of sector.

61
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.420
And then if you actually check out what Morningstar sector is you'll notice it's this asset class cations

62
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.230
that Morningstar sector code.

63
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.490
So this should feel familiar from get fundamentals or get fundamentals basically had the 13 categories

64
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.170
and then those fundamental values.

65
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.240
So you can use those.

66
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.110
A lot of them at least as classifiers things are return back some sort of categorical output.

67
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.610
So you can use this morning story here to kind of filter out these manually.

68
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:45.180
So what I mean by that if you say Morningstar dot and then hit tab you'll notice you have those 13 categories

69
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.420
from fundamentals.

70
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.980
So you can do something like Come over here type share class preference hit dot and then you'll see

71
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.600
the fundamental data that's available to you off share class reference.

72
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.210
So something that's a categorical value maybe something like the exchange ID and then offer that you

73
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.030
can actually call latest.

74
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.880
So if we make this equal to exchange and then we type in exchange we notice that it's sort of the latest

75
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.950
subject but this is actually a classifier now classifiers by themselves like this at least aren't super

76
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.520
useful.

77
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.540
Instead we usually want to do is maybe build a filter from a classifier.

78
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.230
So since classifiers are typically going to output categorical output in the form of a string it's really

79
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.710
common to use three particular methods of clawfoot classifiers.

80
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.890
And that is the EQM method so that each Q And that stands for equals.

81
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.460
The is no method to check something is null.

82
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.080
And then finally the starts with method that is starts with.

83
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.810
Similar to a strings on method for starts with.

84
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.460
So commonly you're going to be using equals because you want to check something's equal or maybe not

85
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.160
equal to a particular category.

86
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.830
So let's go ahead and we'll grab our exchange on it and we'll say offer this.

87
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.630
And then you notice since it's essentially a string ends with etc..

88
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.260
But the most common ones are equals is null starts with.

89
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.460
You can always experiment depending on your needs.

90
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.610
But we're going to say is equal to the string and waits for the New York Stock Exchange and we'll call

91
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.270
this The New York Stock Exchange filter.

92
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.020
So we have this sort of filter object and let's go ahead and pass this sort of filter in this categorical

93
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.550
filter a classifier filter back into our pipeline function.

94
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.840
So I'm going to select everything and say this make pipelined Let's zoom back out a level so can get

95
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:49.190
a bigger picture here going to copy this bring this back down and then show you how you can get this

96
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.500
classified filter.

97
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.760
So we're going to copy this filter that we just created put it in here and we'll call this the classifier

98
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.040
and then we're going to do is pass that in.

99
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.160
So over here we're already checking for a small price in the masks.

100
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.690
So instead of that we're going to say and for our final filter pass in the New York Stock Exchange filter

101
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.750
so that you can use a classifier for a filter.

102
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.160
So essentially the main idea is you're going to say from plant up in that pipeline that classifiers

103
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.340
you can hit tab here and see the various options and then you can decide on Morningstar and so that's

104
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.820
what we're really most used to from get fundamentals.

105
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:39.180
And then you can grab those essentially 13 attributes and more attributes from those sub selections.

106
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.400
Once you've done that you can call different string methods such as equal starts with ends with is null

107
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.100
et cetera.

108
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.070
And then you can create a filter.

109
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.640
Don't you have a filter based off of this.

110
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.080
You essentially use it just as we've done before.

111
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.170
So I'm going to run this and then I'll go ahead and take our results pipeline

112
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.870
copy that.

113
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.930
Bring that back down.

114
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.010
Run that as well.

115
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.790
Let's check out the results at least the head of it.

116
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.330
So you know we have equities 2 5 8 6 3 2 6 5 3 6 4 5 etc..

117
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.520
So let's just see the info on this and wups.

118
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.450
There we go.

119
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.710
So we get back sixty seven entries.

120
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.860
Now let's go ahead and run this one right here.

121
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.800
This is before we actually added in that crossfire and see how many entries we got with this.

122
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:38.090
So instead of saying head here going say info and Lotusphere 391 injuries so it's clearly being filtered

123
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.130
by things that are only on the New York Stock Exchange so we can see that our classifier filter is working.

124
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.900
So again we come back down here notice that we got only six or seven entries and that's because these

125
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.340
are only the ones that are in the New York Stock Exchange.

126
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.330
Okay.

127
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.260
So there's definitely a lot more to talk about as far as pipelines are concerned.

128
00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.500
There's a lot more detail we could jump into but we know enough now to actually implement our own trading

129
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.170
algorithms using pipelines.

130
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.310
So the very last step to all of this discussion is just to show you a little more of a realistic example

131
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:13.680
kind of tagging and putting everything together to create a pipeline using Quanto paeans ID.

132
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.920
So let's go ahead and do that in the next lecture.

133
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.170
Thanks and I'll see you there.
