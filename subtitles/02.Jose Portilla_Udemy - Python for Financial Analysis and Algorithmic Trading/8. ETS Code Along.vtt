Hello everyone and welcome to this quick lecture on decomposition code along.

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
So we have already discussed theoretically what the competition is.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.380
When you take a time series and separate its air its trend than seasonality components.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.660
Now we're going to show you how you can quickly use stat's models to actually perform this python.

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.250
Let's open up into Jupiter notebook and get started.

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.090
OK here I am in my Jupiter notebook and I zoom in one more level here and then we'll start off with

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.930
a couple of imports will import Pansy's PD and then also import that plot live thought pipe plot as

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.760
Piazzi.

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.820
And then I will set my plot lib in line great.

10
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.670
So we're going to be working at that same airline data we had earlier.

11
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.430
We're going to read the C S V n we'll say airline passengers at cxxviii and I will specify that the

12
00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:02.220
next column is going to be the month and whips and make sure it's read cxxviii not read c.a.p.

13
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.950
There we go.

14
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.450
And if we take a look at the head of the airline data again we have something that looks like this.

15
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.490
So we're going to do now is use it us so we can actually use some sort of additive model when it seems

16
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.530
that the trend is more linear and the seasonality and trend components seem to be constant over time.

17
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.090
So if we actually take a look at this plot

18
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.030
airline plot it out I can see that there's looks like there are some seasonality to it.

19
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.620
And then there's also a general trend in the opposite direction.

20
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.750
So based on this chart it looks like the trend in these earlier days is slightly increasing at a higher

21
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.500
rate than just linear.

22
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.200
So I'm trying to figure out is is this just a linear trend or maybe it's like the exponential trend.

23
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.990
It's a little hard to tell from this plot.

24
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.630
So it would be nice if we can use it to decompose this that way can analyze just the trend part itself

25
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.180
and then analyze just the seasonal part itself.

26
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.990
So we're going to do is get this in the correct format first we'll say airline we're going to drop any

27
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.520
missing values here.

28
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.220
Say in places equal to true.

29
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.340
And I'm also going to reset the index to be a time series index or say PD to date time and we actually

30
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.190
did this in the very previous lecture an average checkout my airline the head of it I see that I have

31
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.840
the day there.

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820
So it's clearly a day time index.

33
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.670
So in order to actually do that decomposition it's actually quite simple.

34
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:40.910
You'll say from stats models the TSA seasonal import seasonal decompose.

35
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.240
Then once you've imported that all you have to do is say result is equal to seasonal underscore.

36
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.430
Decompose the function we just imported and we end up doing as you passen the column that you or series

37
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.880
really that you want to decompose in this case is thousands of passengers.

38
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.740
And if we take a look at this function seasonally compose there's different models we can use we can

39
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.560
use an additive model or a multiplicative model.

40
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.390
So you come down here and it says model what type of seasonal component do you want.

41
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.350
So the different ones you can use are either multiplicative or an additive model in order to choose

42
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.400
the correct one.

43
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.370
You may need to kind of guess and check here.

44
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.000
But hopefully you can kind of tell from here that this looks to be more than just linear so a linear

45
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.280
line would probably be a little flatter than this towards the high end.

46
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.900
And one simple way to do this is if you kind of with your eyes look at the peaks of the actual seasonality

47
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.880
points you can see that this seems to be more than just linear.

48
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.940
It seems to be almost like some sort of exponential or some sort of multiplicative growth here so it's

49
00:03:48.940 --> 00:04:00.230
more than just linear growth in which case will end up saying that the model we want using here is multiplicative.

50
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.490
If the trend looks more linear then you can add the additive model.

51
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.510
So if we take a look at the result what we have here we have this decompose result.

52
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.490
Then if you hit tab there's a few methods you can do off of it so you can actually get back something

53
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.020
like the seasonal component and will give you the seasonal component itself which you can then plot

54
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.140
and you can see just the seasonal component of the data.

55
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.400
If you want to just the trend you can plot out the trend and that gives you just the trend portion of

56
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.360
the data and you can see here that since the data is pretty early.

57
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.570
If we did an additive model and ran that and checked that the trend it's pretty much is going to give

58
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.060
you the exact same thing.

59
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.580
So in our case switching the trend are additive and have that can actually make a big difference because

60
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.410
it's kind of on the verge of both of them.

61
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.770
You could see it kind of either way whether it's linear or some sort of a higher growth.

62
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.960
In other cases it's going to be a lot more obvious if it's kind of exponential growth or if it's straight

63
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.610
linear earth here it's almost in the middle between both really either one would probably work fine

64
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.910
as you can see kind of almost the exact same results when we were plotting these out.

65
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.330
So then we we're going to do is if you want to see everything compare together you just say that plot

66
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.110
and you end up seeing the results.

67
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.290
Now a quick note here.

68
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.170
If you just say result of plot you Jupiter notebook sometimes only in the notebook you get these dual

69
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.680
plots.

70
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.880
These are the exact same thing.

71
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.640
In order to not have that you can just set this equal to something like Fig is equal to result that

72
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.010
plot and then you only see one plot here.

73
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.840
So this is the way we can use it as the composition.

74
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.060
This allows us to kind of learn more about our data what the observed values are what the general trend

75
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.900
looks like.

76
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.230
You can kind of mess around with an additive model over some old model.

77
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.600
In our case it's kind of the same way for either of these methods.

78
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.390
And then we have the seasonal portion which is nice we can break that down.

79
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.800
Analyze the seasonality of it and then we can also get the residual which is basically the part that's

80
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.920
not explained by the trend or the seasonal components.

81
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.910
That's our remaining error here.

82
00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.350
OK.

83
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.260
That's the very basics of how to use it.

84
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.530
Yes with Python.

85
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.900
We're going to be diving into this whole analysis of a time series and a lot more detail when we talk

86
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.270
about Arema models and seasonal Arema models.

87
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.420
But before we actually dive into coding those we explain what they are how they work and why they may

88
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.450
or may not be a good choice for financial datasets.

89
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.440
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture where we begin our discussion on ARIMA models.
