Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on cap the capital assets pricing model or cap M is one of

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,420
the most fundamental topics in investing.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,020
It is a model that helps us drive risk and it helps separate market return versus your portfolio strategies

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,030
return.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,680
Let's go ahead and review a few things so he can really understand a cap.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,190
Remember that a portfolio is a set of weighted securities.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,130
We can define the returns as the following in this equation will have on the left hand side of the equal

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,350
sign we'll say returns of our portfolio at some time t is equal to the sum from eye to the end number

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,320
of securities or stocks in your portfolio where we take the weights of a particular security.

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,390
Multiply it by the return of time.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,460
So again it's basically just a wait times a return for each specific stock and then you some of them

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,000
all up.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,220
And that gives you the return of your entire portfolio.

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,390
Well we can also do is imagine the entire market as a portfolio.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,600
For example the S&amp;P 500.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,030
So how do we actually get waits for each company in an entire market.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,050
Well what we can do is use the market cap where the market cap is the number of shares of a company

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,280
multiplied by the price.

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,490
And that equation looks like the falling will say the weights of a particular company in the market

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,490
is equal to the market cap of that company divided by the sum of all other market caps.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,930
Now the cap and or capital assets pricing model equation states the following.

22
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:44,480
We say the return of buy at time t is equal to some Bayda term multiplied by return of them at time

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,420
T plus some alpha term a time T So notice that there's two terms here.

24
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,900
There's a beta term and an alpha term and we'll be visiting these later on when we learn about the Quanto

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,220
IPN platform.

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,080
And you should know how this model is almost like a simple regression line like Wells and mix plus B

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,030
where we have y being the actual return is equal to a beta term or M multiplied by X the return of time

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:18,130
T plus some other factor intercept we'll call it the alpha term the cap m equation describes a return

29
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,600
of some individual stock.

30
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,520
I and again comprise of two terms this Bayda term and the self term the beta term implies that the return

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,400
of a stock is equivalent to the return of the market multiplied by this beta factor plus some residual

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,060
Alpha term.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,360
So what does it actually mean.

34
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,110
Well if we look on the left hand side of the equal sign we're seeing some return for a particular stock

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,150
at time t is equal to a specific beta value for this stock of-I multiplied by the return of the entire

36
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,460
market at time t.

37
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,730
So for example the return of the entire S&amp;P 500 plus some residual Alpha term.

38
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,640
So you can imagine that if bedo was equal to one then this stock moves in line with the market if Bayt

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,850
is equal to 2 then the stock moves up and down twice as much as the general market.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,920
Since the return first thought is not going to match exactly the beta term we need to add some sort

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,840
of alpha term and cap em states that you expect this alpha term to be zero and essentially a cap is

42
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,800
stating is that the return of any individual stock is just a weight multiplied by the return of the

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,740
entire market.

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,700
And then there's some sort of residual Alpha term that will end up being very close or go to zero.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,420
And so if cap and stating that the alpha should be expected to be zero it basically implies that you

46
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,580
cannot actually beat the general market.

47
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,890
So again Cap and also says that Alpha is random and cannot be predicted.

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,030
And this basically creates the argument of passive versus active investment.

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
Now we're behaving as active investors and we believe that we can actually predict Alpha to some sort

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,160
of degree.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,580
And remember that we actually need to be 100 percent correct on Alpha.

52
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,170
We should just be able to predict it correctly more than 50 percent of the time for our portfolio and

53
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,770
theoretically we should get some sort of profit out of that.

54
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,810
Since we believe we can actually have a good idea for values of Alpha what we can do is break it up

55
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:25,580
per security so we can see the return of our portfolio at time t is equal to some beta term of our portfolio

56
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:33,440
multiplied by the entire market plus the sum of those Waite's times in Alpha term at time t for each

57
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,640
individual security in our portfolio.

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,480
Now the overall main point here that we want to get across of the cap and model is that there will be

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,780
some relationship between our portfolio return and the overall market return.

60
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,080
And that's the beta term.

61
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,180
Now remember that cap says that this alpha term cannot be predicted.

62
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,150
However we're going to fundamentally disagree with that model of thinking.

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,460
Instead we're going to see if we can create strategies using algorithmic trading that allows us to have

64
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,980
significant Alpha terms meaning our strategy beats the market.

65
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,370
These two terms beta and Alpha will come up again once we learn how to use Quanto platform.

66
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,640
For now let's go ahead and quickly use Python and create an example of cap em in the next lecture.

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,290
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
