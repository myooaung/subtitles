Hello everyone and welcome to the section on pandas and this lecture will give you an introduction to

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.520
the pantless library.

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.860
So as I mentioned we'll get a quick introduction to pand this in this lecture.

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.150
We'll learn a bit about pand this history and then later on in this section we'll dive straight into

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.970
coding and learning how to use pandas in our Jupiter notebooks.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.950
Afterwards at the end the section you'll get some example exercise to test your new skills.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.020
So now that we understand the basics of python and umpire we can learn about the pandas library.

8
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.400
So it is pandas.

9
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.400
It's named after panel data and it was created by was MACKINNEY pandas was first created to help work

10
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.880
with data sets in Python for McKee's work in finance.

11
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.240
His place of employment.

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.360
So ever since the beginning pandas was created with financial data sets in mind which is perfect for

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.080
our use case.

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.210
In this course luckily Panas is now a large and popular open source library that's freely available

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.620
for all to use and contribute to.

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.450
Let's go through some of its main features.

17
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.670
As pointed out by the official Web site pantless has a fast and efficient data frame object for data

18
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730
manipulation with integrated indexing.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640
And we'll be working on the difference a lot throughout the course.

20
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.480
We'll start off by learning about series and then we'll learn about data frames and data frames.

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.060
It's going to be our main workhorse when dealing with financial data sets.

22
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
Pand This also includes tools for reading and writing between in-memory data structures in different

23
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.990
formats.

24
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.710
It can read from CSP files text files Excel files sequel databases and even the fast HGF file format

25
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.620
and many more.

26
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.680
We'll also show you how you can use additional libraries such as the Panas data reader or QUANTRILL

27
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.270
to actually directly connect with financial data sets over the Internet.

28
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.580
We'll cover that in a feature section pandas also has great interaction with Python data visualization

29
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.380
libraries such as Matt Plup lib and we'll also discuss that in a future section when we talk about actually

30
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.910
visualizing her data.

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.370
More importantly pandas is highly optimized for performance with critical code paths written in C or

32
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.990
C so it's blazingly fast.

33
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.270
It also has the ability to Adoree or transform data with a powerful group by engine learning Pandurs

34
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.640
is fundamental to being able to easily work with the financial data sets that we will be using in this

35
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.600
course.

36
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.700
We'll first focus on learning about general Pandurs and then in a future section will focus on working

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.460
of time series data with pandas as well as working with visualization and Pandurs.

38
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.610
At the end of the section we'll have a quick exercise for you to test your skills.

39
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.990
All right let's get started.

40
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.240
I'll see you at the next lecture.
