00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.240
Welcome back everyone to part three of the stock market analysis data capstone project Let's hop over

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.330
back to the Jupiter note book and continue with the final part.

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.690
All right so if scroll down to the notebook where it says Part three basic financial analysis so really

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.290
going to focus here on a few key financial calculations that we'll be using throughout the rest of the

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.210
course and this is mainly going to serve as a transition to the second half of the course.

6
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.470
We've learned about the different libraries.

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.790
Now it's time to actually dive in to some key financial calculations.

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.090
So the first thing we're going to talk about is daily percent change.

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.260
So daily percent change.

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.850
Otherwise known as returns daily returns that is defined by this following formula.

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.010
We have our teeth that is the return at time t is equal to the price at time t divided by the price

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.530
at time T minus one and then minus one from that.

13
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.190
Result.

14
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.330
So what this basically informs you of is YOUR percent gain or loss.

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.670
So if you bought the stock on day number one and then sold it on day number two that is the very next

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.830
day and then divided the difference and then subtract that one you'd essentially get your percent gain

17
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.950
or percent loss.

18
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.410
So you can imagine that if you have a very stable stock that is the price.

19
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.940
Day to Day doesn't change that much.

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.990
Then your volatility is low and your return tends to be close to zero.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.750
So you can imagine that a stock that never changes price such as price that they want was 100 price

22
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.900
they too was 100 price on day three was 100 the most stable it could ever be.

23
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.580
That means that this return is going to be zero because you'd have a hundred divided by a hundred would

24
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.980
be one and then one minus one is zero.

25
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.390
So your daily return would be zero if you had a completely flat line stable stock.

26
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.540
You can imagine though if your price fluctuates wildly then this value is going to get larger whether

27
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.310
it's a large negative number or a large positive number depending on whether you're gaining or losing.

28
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.190
So if you were to plot this out with a histogram and you had a really wide distribution that is the

29
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.310
x axis went really low and really high then your stock is more volatile from one day to the next.

30
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.560
If you have a very narrow distribution that is centered in close around zero that means you have a relatively

31
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.440
stable stock.

32
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.630
So the more volatile the stock is the higher risk it is.

33
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.300
But also the higher reward and the narrower it is that means the more stable it is and the lower risk

34
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.150
and lower award a possibility.

35
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.970
OK.

36
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.010
So we're going to create a new column for each data frame called the returns column and this column

37
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.100
is going to be calculated from the close price column and there's two ways to do this.

38
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.060
One is a simple calculation using the shift method that follows this formula right here.

39
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.540
Or you can use the bandas built or excuse me panderers built 10 percent change method.

40
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.560
So we'll show you how to do both right now.

41
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.840
Let's start off by actually converting this formula right here into pand this code.

42
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.570
So the first thing going to do is actually create.

43
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.070
We'll start off for Tesla will say Tesla returns and I'm going to set that equal to me zoom in one more

44
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.150
level here.

45
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.480
I'm going to set that equal to the closing price that is my price at time t.

46
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.020
So I'll say Tesla close.

47
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:26.310
And then when I'm going to do is divide it by Tesla clothes and then I'm going to shift it over one

48
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:35.800
Ford and then I'm going to take that whole thing and then divide it or excuse me subtract one from it.

49
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.020
So somebody that may confuse people is the shift forward one you may think that because says Price at

50
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.600
time T minus one they would shift negative one.

51
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.570
But let me actually show you why we shift forward 1 instead of minus one.

52
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:58.510
If I ask for the clothes column right here the series I get the price of January 3rd is $28 if I actually

53
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:10.750
shift this over one then I get $28 over here on January 4th which if you think about what January 4th

54
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.460
originally looked like if we look at this January 4th was originally twenty seven point seven with its

55
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.970
previous day price that is price at T-minus 1 equal to 28.

56
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.850
So the shift of 4 to 1 basically shifts all the prices forward one so that the index still stays the

57
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.120
same but the price is now reflective of what we wanted.

58
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.990
Price at T minus 1 which is why we used shift 1 here.

59
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.130
So that's the actual calculation using the formula itself.

60
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.440
Now fortunately there is a percent change or PCTs underscore change method built into pantless that

61
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.610
essentially does this for you.

62
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.920
And if you kind of master off tutorials online you may have seen this already.

63
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.460
So we're going to say Tesler returns is equal to Tesla.

64
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.300
And I will say the closing price thought PCTs underscore change and you can do shift tab here to read

65
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.800
more about it.

66
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.980
But basically it's exactly what we're trying to calculate the percent change over a given number of

67
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.620
periods so our periods in our case is just one time period or one day.

68
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.760
So that's all we have to do.

69
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.940
And that's going to return the exact same results so if we take a look at the returns it's the exact

70
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.440
same result here as if you had done it with this method so willing to take a look at my number here

71
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.580
I'll say 59 I will skip running this one and then take a look at returns again and you'll see it's the

72
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.630
exact same result.

73
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.330
So you can either use PCTs underscore change or rate here this shift position.

74
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.650
So they're both the exact same thing probably percent change a little easier to use.

75
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.400
So that's what we're going to do for the other two stocks.

76
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.880
You can see here we have to return.

77
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.000
So that's the percent change.

78
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.990
So if you're losing money it's going to be negative if you're gaining money it's going to be positive.

79
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.450
And in general there are going to be small movements because we're doing day to day.

80
00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:05.690
So now let's copy and paste this and fill in for forward and GM and then also want to change the score

81
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:12.310
here GM and change this one to Ford.

82
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.850
OK so now we have all the returns for are they different.

83
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.260
So if we take a look at just one of these data frames for example the head of Ford is here the open

84
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.740
high low close volume total traded and then returns with the first one being a null value.

85
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.680
All right so now we're going to do is plot a histogram of each of the companies returns that returns

86
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.490
column and you can either do them separately or stack them on top of each other.

87
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.780
We'll show you how to do both.

88
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.280
And then the question is which stock is the most volatile and you're going to judge the volatility by

89
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.270
the variance or how wide the distribution is when you actually do the histogram.

90
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.740
And later on we'll actually do a kernel density estimation plot to kind of visualize that distribution

91
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.570
aspect a little more.

92
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.850
So as far as the actual histograms go it's essentially really easy of pandas hopefully remember that

93
00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.790
all you have to do is say Ford returns that hissed and that's essentially it.

94
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.090
Now there's there's not that many bands here.

95
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.620
So if you take a look at the length of our actual data frame So for example the length of Ford returns

96
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.930
it's over 1000 data points in here.

97
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.410
By default.

98
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.070
I believe it's like 10 bins.

99
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.760
So we probably want to increase the size so we'll say bins is 10 by default.

100
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.080
I'm going to increase this lusciously tenfold to 100.

101
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.240
And know we can get a better idea of this distribution so you can kind of see a lot of it centered around

102
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:34.660
zero and it goes up to a minimum of like negative point 0 8 and up to maximum around point 0 8.

103
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.910
So we're going to repeat this for the other stocks.

104
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:47.060
Say GM and here we see General Motors and General Motors tends to be again centered at zero which makes

105
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.610
sense.

106
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.040
Pretty much every stocks me since around zero.

107
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.750
They're stable to some degree and we can see negative wise minimum round point 0 6 and then Max.

108
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.470
There's a couple of key days here.

109
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:05.460
Four or five days where I had a big gain then finally we'll do Tesla Tesla returns here.

110
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.670
And let's say bin's equal to 100.

111
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.790
Now Tesla what's interesting to note here is that the X-axis actually goes much wider than the other

112
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.300
two.

113
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.200
So Tesla can actually go up to around negative point to and beyond positive point to.

114
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.510
Now that's a total different scale than what we saw here.

115
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.100
So what would be nice is if we actually stacked these histograms on top of each other to really see

116
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.910
that closely.

117
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.360
So that's exactly we're going to do now we're going to say Tesla returns his one 100.

118
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:42.390
And let's not give this a label of Tesla and then we'll give it a larger size because we're at three

119
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:51.540
on top of each other we'll say 10 com 8s and then we're going to copy and paste this and instead of

120
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:58.340
Tesla we'll have General Motors and we'll have Ford here and let's fix these labels as well.

121
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.270
This will be GM

122
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:10.060
This will be Ford and then we're going to do is just say Pulte a legend so he can see the legend.

123
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.540
Right.

124
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.810
And here's our history stacked on top of each other.

125
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.590
And it's quick Now usually when you're stuck on top of each other you want to introduce some sort of

126
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.160
alpha so you can see through them a little bit.

127
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.850
So that's exactly what we do now.

128
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.120
We will add an alpha to these we'll see Alpha and it's really up to you what values you do.

129
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.700
You can kind of play around with it.

130
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:34.730
Well just put 0.4 0.5 for all of them round this again.

131
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.450
Now we can kind of see them stacked on top of each other a little more clearly.

132
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.490
Let me zoom in one level out.

133
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.260
So now this visualization we actually get a lot of information about the general volatility on a day

134
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.010
to day basis.

135
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:51.880
We can see that General Motors and Ford tend to be more stable and it looks like Ford tends to be a

136
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.080
little more stable and can see has these two really high peaks very close to zero.

137
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.770
Now Tesla is kind of a totally different animal here.

138
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:04.840
It's has quite a bit more volatility because you can see that it has a much larger or much wider distribution

139
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.410
here versus General Motors and Ford are kind of basically stacked right on top of each other.

140
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.350
And if you scroll back up and check out some of the other plots we did that's also reflective in the

141
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.150
other plots so when you plot of them all out here for instance on this plot let's make this figures

142
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.010
a little bigger here let's say Tovah 8.

143
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.750
We can see here that Tesla has a lot more volatility versus General Motors and Ford pretty flat in comparison.

144
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.040
Now if he zoomed in on General Motors and Ford You can see that they do have their own volatility.

145
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.160
When you focus in on just one of their stocks in comparison to Tesla it's really not even close.

146
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.980
And if you read anything about financial news regarding Tesla anyon Musk you kind of already knew that.

147
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.700
So we're going to scroll all the way back down to part 3.

148
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.520
And we created our histograms are looking good.

149
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:53.020
We have stacked histogram and now we're also going to do is try putting a kernel density estimation

150
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.730
plot to get another viewpoint.

151
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.940
So do that.

152
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:06.080
We're going to say Tesla returns the plot kind the sequel to the kernel that's estimation will give

153
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:14.030
him the label of Tesla and let's make the fix size really whatever we want say 10 by eight that is going

154
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:19.460
to just copy and paste this two more times and will do the same thing for General Motors.

155
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.600
And Ford and then we also want to make sure that those labels are changed as well.

156
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:36.380
Let's say Ford General Motors thing called the legend Kilty Luchon.

157
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.590
And when we run this we should see the kernel density estimation plots and here the actual distributions

158
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.090
come a lot more clear.

159
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.950
You can see Ford clearly peaking much more stable than any of the stocks really.

160
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:53.120
It's way more stable and Tesla a little more stable than General Motors So Ford with the highest peak

161
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.740
centered around Sury can see a lot of the daily returns tend to be the same.

162
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:02.380
It's a relatively flat stock in comparison to something like Tesla and Tesla You can see here it's a

163
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.760
little wider meaning a little more volatility and it goes kind of all the way to the ends here.

164
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.360
All right.

165
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.960
The next thing we're asked was to also try creating some box plots for comparing the returns.

166
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.140
Now when you're using Box plots with pandas you actually need all the columns in the same data frame.

167
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:24.390
So you'll start off by doing the same box if you zoom in that one more level here box the physical to

168
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.300
PD the concatenate.

169
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.770
And we're going to concatenate the three columns together.

170
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:37.220
The returns will concatenate Teslas returns will concatenate forward returns.

171
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.230
And then we'll concatenate General Motor returns

172
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.130
and then we'll need to set the access equal to one here.

173
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:57.550
And then let's also set the column names will say POCs the columns is equal to Tesla.

174
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.530
I'll say it just right for returns.

175
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.530
Then next on up was Ford returns.

176
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.880
And then finally we have General Motors returns

177
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:14.910
and now we're ready to actually do the box plot off of this or say box the F plot I'll specify that

178
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.840
kind is equal to box.

179
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.620
And if we just do this we should see this little box play here.

180
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.860
The sizing isn't so great.

181
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:32.190
So let's actually change that we'll say think size equal to the eight 11 now we get this figure here

182
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.110
so we can see here again.

183
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.470
Clearly Tesla returns quite a bit more of a wide distribution a lot more outliers.

184
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.230
And then we can see Ford and General Motors relatively similar maybe Ford's a little more stable which

185
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:49.220
is kind of telling the same story that we saw appear before it being the highest peak on the Katy plot.

186
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.620
All right.

187
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:54.360
So just different ways you can analyze volatility just based off the daily returns.

188
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.710
So now we're going to compare the return between the stocks so we already did it one way but now we're

189
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.830
going to directly plot them against each other.

190
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.250
So in order to do this we're going to just simply create a scatter matrix plot to see the correlation

191
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.560
between the daily returns.

192
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:14.640
So all we need to do is say scatter matrix remember we already imported it earlier from the panel's

193
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:23.420
plotting and we'll say box the f. we'll call whip's fig size equal to something reasonable like eight

194
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.780
by eight also set an alpha here because we have lots of points.

195
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.940
And then as we did before we can set up histogram keywords arguments as a dictionary and let's just

196
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.650
make the bins something like 100 bins or something like that.

197
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.940
See what your bins.

198
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.130
And we should get a little looks.

199
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:49.930
Make sure that you actually have it here on and property just needs to be in s there k d s.

200
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:55.860
There we go and let's actually get a semi-colon so we don't see that large array output right.

201
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.900
So we can see here as far as daily returns.

202
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.230
Very similar behavior to the actual prices.

203
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.680
Ford and General Motors tend to be correlated together.

204
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.600
And then Tesla not so much between the other two.

205
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.520
All right.

206
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.690
So it looks like Ford and GM do have some sort of possible relationship.

207
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.950
So we're going to plot these two just these two against each other to view that more closely.

208
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:27.020
So let's actually create that scatterplot will say box the F that plot kind to scatter all say X is

209
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.580
well let's make sure we actually write the column names correctly.

210
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.120
I believe it's called name here.

211
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.050
Ford and GM right.

212
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.640
So we're going to copy those and bring them down here.

213
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.820
So I'll say x is equal to the column.

214
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.180
Ford returns and Y is equal to the column.

215
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.470
General Motors returns.

216
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:56.460
Let's give this a little bit of an alpha 0.5 and let's give this nice fix size let's say eight by so

217
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.790
many that I can see the scatterplot of the General Motors returns and the Ford returns and we can see

218
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:07.340
here you're maybe thinking this is almost like a linear regression task where you can just draw a line

219
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.170
and have some sort of linear relationship that is for returns get higher General Motor returns tend

220
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.790
to go higher.

221
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.220
And it's for returns go negative General Motors returns tend to go negative.

222
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.540
And this is one of the very first things we're gonna discover as we begin to do basic algorithmic trading.

223
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:26.210
Finding two stocks that tend to be correlated to each other and a classic example something like Coca-Cola

224
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.860
and Pepsi.

225
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.040
But we can see here there's clearly some sort of relationship between these two car companies versus

226
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.890
If we plot this against Tesla we didn't really see that sort of relationship OK.

227
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:42.170
The very last topic we'll discuss is cumulative daily returns instances a little bit of a wider topic.

228
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.570
We're going to leave it to Part 4 of the solutions.

229
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.870
So we'll end part three here just kind of tackling these elite returns.

230
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.850
Coming up next we'll talk about cumulative daily returns.

231
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.410
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
