Welcome everyone to this quick lecture on the efficient market hypothesis EMH or the efficient market

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,690
hypothesis is an investment theory that states it's impossible to beat the market essentially because

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,000
the stock market efficiency causes existing share prices to always incorporate and reflect all relevant

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,990
information.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,900
So according to the EMH stocks always trade at their fair value on stock exchanges making it impossible

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,170
for investors either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices.

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,740
As such it should be impossible to outperform the overall market.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,630
Their expert stock selection or market timing and the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,450
returns is by purchasing riskier investments.

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,500
So now the question arises is the efficient market hypothesis true.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,650
Well if the efficient market hypothesis was true then a lot of what we're going to learn in this course

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,950
doesn't really have a point to it.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,940
So hopefully it's not true just for that aspect but it would also imply that many hedge funds are just

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,830
extremely lucky hedge funds with continued success of picking securities and beating the market have

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,210
just been extremely lucky if the efficient market hypothesis is true which is unlikely.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,350
So the success of different strategies and hedge funds implies that the strongest interpretation of

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,500
the efficient market prothesis is probably not true.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,490
There are also events that have shown the market to be overvalued at certain points in history such

19
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,930
as the financial crisis and the com bubble.

20
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,020
So while some aspects of the efficient market paths certainly are true especially as information is

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,640
more widely accessible we're going to continue on the assumption that the market is not a 100 percent

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,280
efficiencies there are any efficiencies that we can exploit using our trading strategies and even things

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,830
like insider trading which is illegal are also strong indicators that the market is not 100 percent

24
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,140
of where of all information.

25
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,690
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
