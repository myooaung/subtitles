00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,660
Welcome back everyone and welcome to the trading algorithm exercise solutions lecture and this lecture

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,770
we're just going to code out the actual kind of simple Bollinger Band strategy on the Quanto platform.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,130
So it's up over Quanto up in ID and get started.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,840
All right.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,580
So I've already opened up the idea.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,190
A new algorithm.

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:31,600
The first thing I need to do is set up initialize and remember this takes in context and then we're

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,820
going to do here is set the actual security we're going to be using.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,090
I said to use Johnson and Johnson although you definitely could have played around with other securities.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,420
So you can just kind of began typing out Johnson you'll end up saying Johnson and Johnson.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,830
So 4 1 5 1 is the idea and then the other thing we're going to have in here is schedule function.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,010
So we're going to schedule some functions to operate.

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,770
Remember we want it to only happen centrally once per day so it will create a function called check

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:11,350
bands and then the date rule puts the rules is going to be every day and that's all I'm going to specify.

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,670
You could also specify whether you're going to do it 30 minutes before market close or after market

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,800
opens et cetera.

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,450
But for simplicity we just want to schedule this check bands function every day and this check bands

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,900
function which we actually haven't created yet is going to be the function that has all the logic of

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,420
our trading strategy.

20
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,990
So let's go ahead and try it out.

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:38,790
We're going to see if Czech bands and it's going to take in context and data and we'll do the following.

22
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,560
The first thing actually to get is the current price.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,910
So set the current price as a variable.

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,970
And remember we can use data that current to grab this and we're going to grab it directly off the context

25
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,970
so we need to pass in the asset and the field I'm looking for is price.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,740
And you can always click here on learn more to check the documentation for all the supported fields

27
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,110
Okay.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,280
So so far I've been able to grab the current price so as I'm backtesting the current price is going

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,190
to be that day's price.

30
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,080
Now what I need is historical data.

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,310
So we can make something called prices and it's kind of up to you what variable name you want to choose

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,240
here but I'll kind of show prices for the historical data and we'll have data that history.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,630
Remember this takes in an asset fields Parkhouse count frequency.

34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,830
So we want the same asset so that Johnson Johnson then the next thing I want to do is say hey give me

35
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:41,860
the price for Johnson and Johnson and I'm going to wants a frequency of 20 days or excuse me a history

36
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,380
of 20 days and I want the frequency to be daily.

37
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,370
So one day.

38
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:54,060
So what prices actually is then is just the 20 days of history for this particular security stock price.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,010
Once we have that all I need to do is create a couple of variables here to calculate my bandwidth.

40
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,390
So I'll say the average is just prices not mean and essentially these are just Pandurs codes because

41
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,320
I only have one contex there that Johnson and Johnson.

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,350
This is essentially just a series.

43
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:19,100
So it's a series of the last 20 days of price data for the daily price so they will say prices and say

44
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,060
Steria deviation and then let's create our lower bands and our lower band is going to be the average

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,820
minus two times the second deviation that our upper band is going to be the average plus two times Asturian

46
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,660
deviation.

47
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,040
So this sort of calculation should feel really familiar to you especially if you went through the Panthers

48
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,660
time series because we actually showed exactly how to do it.

49
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,450
There was a little tricky is actually realizing that stated that history when you just pass in one single

50
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,540
asset is going to be essentially a time series but you can always print out anything and then do kind

51
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:02,710
of a one day full back test and see the logs and see what's actually being used here or returned here.

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,690
Now it's time to actually implement the logic.

53
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,640
So it's going to create a couple more lines here.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,210
And the first thing to check is if the current price

55
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,720
is less than or equal to the lower band

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,490
I will do the following.

57
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,980
I'm going to call order target percents and remember this kind of an extreme strategy but we're going

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,600
to say context JJ 1.0.

59
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,850
So what I'm actually saying.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,630
If the current price as we're back testing the current price for today if it's actually going to be

61
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,310
less than or equal to the lower band so that's kind of that dip.

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,990
So remember lower band is average minus two times turned deviation then I expect the price to go back

63
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,440
up according to my strategy.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,840
So I'm going to buy it and then we can actually print something out saying that we were buying it

65
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,300
elif.

66
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:12,140
Else if the current price is greater than or equal to the upper band that means we're kind of in a short

67
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,740
situation.

68
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,240
Remember back to that visualization where the current price has gone over the band.

69
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,240
Then we want to actually short it.

70
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,460
So again a pretty extreme example but for our strategy it's kind of really simple to implement.

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,870
So will say Order target percent's and same stock context JJ and then we'll say minus one point zero.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
And that basically says Okay allocate all my money to short the stock.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,610
Now there are some issues with this.

74
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,370
After all we haven't really talked about leverage yet.

75
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,720
So whether or not this is realistic or even if you're going to have enough money to pay it back that

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,370
will definitely affect this as far as a realistic implementation of a strategy that shorts your entire

77
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,930
portfolio.

78
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,700
But for actual implementation it's going to be fine.

79
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:04,940
So then I'll say shorting so kind of we'll see little reports in the law when I'm buying when I'm shorting

80
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,950
and if that's not the case when I'm going to do just pass and my strategy is really really simple here

81
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,750
because I'm only detecting the lower band and upper bands.

82
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,820
I don't really have any sort of other exit strategy which kind of makes us reckless.

83
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,900
But again pretty simple to implement just as a review I take the current price.

84
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,750
I grab the historical price for last 20 days calculate the average the standard deviation from those

85
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,070
two I can grab the lower band and the upper band then I just compare my current price to the lower bands

86
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,150
go along.

87
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,150
This happens to be less than the lower band.

88
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,150
Otherwise if the current price is greater than the upper band short it because I think it's going to

89
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,430
come back them else just pass again pretty reckless pretty risky but really simple to implement.

90
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,490
And finally let's go ahead and record some stuff.

91
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,560
So I'm going to call the record function and I remember the record function essentially just works with

92
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,180
the name of whatever you want to call the little symbol here that you're recording.

93
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,180
And then the actual value you're going to record.

94
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:13,370
So we'll say record the upper bands recall record the lower bands then we'll say we can go ahead and

95
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:20,030
grab the moving average so same moving average 20 day moving average at least is equal to the average

96
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:27,590
which is equal to the average and then we'll also log the price say current price so that will give

97
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,560
us a nice little plot that kind of shows the error bands the lower bands.

98
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Now we should be able to see the average as well.

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,600
OK.

100
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,820
So that's really all we had to do.

101
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,070
And the solutions there's a couple more print statements to try to make it a little clearer to you but

102
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,140
hopefully you were able to get the key assets of this and the main parts that I really want you to get

103
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,210
if you're coding along is schedule a function the ability to schedule functions to happen every day

104
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,760
every minute etc..

105
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,340
The current price of using data current getting historical information using data history and realizing

106
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,140
that essentially data that history either returns a single series for an asset or an entire data frame

107
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,750
and using your panel's knowledge you can actually just calculate statistical information off that data

108
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,880
frame or time series then using that you can implement some sort of strategy here like this kind of

109
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,420
really crude Bullinger band strategy.

110
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,410
So let's go ahead and build this algorithm and test it out see how we did so could build the algorithm

111
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,100
here.

112
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,440
And I'm testing it.

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,620
Well looks like we got an error global named Price is not defined in check bands.

114
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,490
So let's make sure that we check that out.

115
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,400
OK so line 12 here prices.

116
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,660
Looks like I messed that up and a quick note in case you ever want to debug something that's a little

117
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,160
more complicated than that.

118
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,710
You can actually highlight one of the lines here and then when you hit save and build algorithm it will

119
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:51,800
only execute the code up to this highlighted line and then we'll have a little debugger here.

120
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,190
So this debugger can then actually take in things you can input variables to check what they are.

121
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,400
So they'll say something like Hey average is not fine because it's only going to execute up to but not

122
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,610
including that line.

123
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,710
However prices should be defined.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,230
So you see prices hey it's a series and then you can kind of expand this and see a time stamp with a

125
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,490
particular price.

126
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,050
So if you don't want to do a bunch of print statements in the log to figure out what's actually being

127
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,120
returned you can always use the helpful debugger to kind of play around the variables inside a little

128
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,290
console environment.

129
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,270
Once you're done with this you can do is just say like finish back test that will drop this and then

130
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,530
you can say either cancel or let it continue the back test.

131
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,080
So I hit cancel here cancel the back test say less and let me build this algorithm one more time and

132
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,380
whoops cancel this mixture.

133
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,840
I don't have this highlighted now save.

134
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,970
Now Bill the algorithm and this should run relatively fast given how simple the actual test is or strategy

135
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,840
and it looks like it performed really well.

136
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,970
So you'll notice that we got fifty nine point six returns alpha point 1 9 beta negative point 1 6 sharp

137
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,050
ratio point nine to that's all right.

138
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,570
But what's really nice here is I can see the upper and lower bounds.

139
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,570
The price in the movie average and you kind of see when it dipped below.

140
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,780
And we can see how many times we shorted it how many times we bought.

141
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,500
So shorting buying etc..

142
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,790
And you can see here the dates.

143
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,050
Sometimes it's the day after Sometimes it's weeks after we're actually buying and shorting stock kind

144
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,380
of an issue of strategies to play around with.

145
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,710
Once you're able to get this really basic Bolinger strategy down what I would really encourage you to

146
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,260
do is play around with it see if you can play around add an extra exit conditions.

147
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,790
Maybe if the price ever comes back to the mean average or it gets around a certain percent of the mean

148
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,180
you could exit out of the positions instead of just holding it until the next Bolinger Bancroft's.

149
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,050
So maybe have something that says hey if the current price is within some sort of limit of the average

150
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,600
go ahead and say Order target percent context thought J.J zero and just exit out of that position that

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,990
might make your strategy a little more stable once you've kind of played around the check bands function.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,140
What I would encourage you to do is play around and and another security we can see we did really well

153
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,020
for Johnson and Johnson but is that just a general strategy or is it only working for Johnson and Johnson

154
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,640
so maybe passen another security here.

155
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,260
Really whatever you want so what.

156
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,340
I don't know we can play around with this.

157
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,730
Let's try something like Apple stock.

158
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,040
So I will say Apple Apple Inc.

159
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,810
24.

160
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,950
Let's save this.

161
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,200
Build the algorithm and see how well it performs against this.

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,130
So again this is the really simple version and you can see here it should probably not perform that

163
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,430
well against this yes.

164
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,290
You can see here towards the end of we basically started progressing towards the actual benchmark but

165
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,630
we're still able to get pretty good returns.

166
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,270
So let's try another tech stock maybe try Amazon.

167
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,580
So will try that as well save it build the algorithm

168
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,270
and you can see after running the algorithm Amazon stock we did horribly we got minus for a 3.8 percent

169
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,770
return so we did.

170
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,480
Way way worse than the actual benchmark.

171
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,730
In fact we lost almost half our money.

172
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,290
Definitely something to keep in mind here and you can see the bands are much closer to the means here.

173
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,200
So the actual standard deviation may not have been such an extreme signal.

174
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,200
All right I hope you are able to get us out of this exercise.

175
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,550
Remember the main thing here is focusing on how to use Quanto Appian platform is actual Bollinger Band

176
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,240
strategy is way too simple to actually execute.

177
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,560
As you can see depending on what stock you choose it could fail horribly.

178
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,900
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you the next lecture.
