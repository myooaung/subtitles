00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.710
Will come back everyone in this lecture will walk you through how to use the pandas data reader.

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.030
Let's open up and you put a notebook and get started.

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.960
OK here I am at a new Jupiter notebook now.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.030
Panda's data reader actually supports a wide array of API is used to support the Yahoo Finance API.

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.610
But since Yahoo got bought by Verizon they've seemed to close their API or disabled it or at least disable

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.030
Panas ability to read it.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.550
However the Google Finance API is still open and readable as well as other API.

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.880
You can check out the documentation of Panas data reader linked in the resource notes in case you want

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.260
more information on that.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.790
But let's go ahead and show you how you can actually use Panas data reader will say import pantless

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:53.340
underscore data reader you can do tab's autocomplete this and you'll say that data as web and then will

12
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.590
also typically do work in a Panas data reader is import the date time library.

13
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.890
That way we can actually pasand date time objects to Panas data reader.

14
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.520
So we'll do is we'll specify a start date.

15
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:15.100
So say date time date time and then all we're gonna do is say let's just say 2015 and then we'll set

16
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.360
an end date to be date time date time and we'll set this to be 2017 January 1st.

17
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.730
So I'm just going to get two years for data from the 1st of 2015 the 1st of 2017 and let's go ahead

18
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.580
and use Facebook as our stock.

19
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.660
So you create a variable that you want to be your data frame and then you call Web dots and you're going

20
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.660
to call the data reader Methot off of this and then the data either method is going to take a few things

21
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.460
it's going to take a name the data source and then a start date and an end date.

22
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.630
So it's going to do this.

23
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.770
The what's the name of this is just going to be the ticker for the stock which you can just look up

24
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.360
online.

25
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.380
For Facebook it's capital F and capital B.

26
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.100
And then we're going to connect using Google and then we passen that start variable that we created

27
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.800
and then that end variable and you run this.

28
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.890
And this may get blocked if you have a firewall but typically it works pretty well.

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.770
Now what you can do is just say Facebook head then when you run that you have this nice little data

30
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.530
frame here.

31
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.370
So this data frame starts of a date time index where you just have daily data points for the stock and

32
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.680
you have the opening price.

33
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.020
The high price for that day.

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.810
The low price for that day in the closing price for that day as well as the volume of stock actually

35
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.800
traded.

36
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.890
Now keep in mind this closing price is going to represent the Google API the adjusted closing price.

37
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.520
So that can take things into account like a stock split.

38
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.840
So that's really all you need to know about web data reader as far as what we're going to use it for

39
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.670
this course continuing on.

40
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.910
But I want to show you some experimental options.

41
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.050
So if you've done the reading and the extra resources learning about what are our options why to use

42
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.220
options how options work and how to read and options table.

43
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.010
You can actually get an options table using Panas data reader.

44
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.140
Now keep in mind this is still technically experimental so it doesn't always work but typically for

45
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.110
people based in the United States it tends to work as long as you don't have a firewall blocking it.

46
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.980
But in order to get the options table you can say from Panas data reader that data import options and

47
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.680
then we'll say FBA options equals options B Google.

48
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.650
And then we're going to go ahead and do is we're going to get our data frames or say options.

49
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.900
ZF is equal to and you grab the options that you just created and then say get and we can do is you

50
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.300
can actually get called data for data et cetera put data but just get the options data itself.

51
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.170
And will say an argument or parameter expiry.

52
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.670
And then we're going to say for the expiration if the options call expiry dates and then grab index

53
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.810
0 here.

54
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.550
So if you run this you should be able to get out in option's data frame.

55
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.300
So if you check the options the app will just stick the head of it you get something that looks like

56
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.570
this where we have the bid prices the gas prices et cetera underlying price and then that quote time.

57
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.550
So if you want to learn more about how to actually read these options tables we still haven't really

58
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.350
dived into finance in general so we'll leave this for a later topic.

59
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.820
But you can go ahead and check out the resource links now in case you want to read up on how to actually

60
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.760
interpret the options table for now.

61
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.330
Just wanted to present it to you that Panas data reader is capable of reading these options.

62
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.910
Okay.

63
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.910
Thanks everyone.

64
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.390
And I will see at the next lecture.
