Welcome to this course some Python for finance and algorithmic trading.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.520
My name is Jose Portsea and I'll be your instructor for the course I teach over 200000 students here

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.540
on to me on topics such as programming data science and machine learning.

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.190
And they also work as a corporate technical trainer for some of the world's largest banks and financial

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.640
institutions.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.440
I'm excited to present this course to you.

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.870
It's based off the same technical training material I've personally delivered at some of the world's

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.460
top financial institutions will be teaching him how to use the powerful Python programming language

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.260
for financial applications and algorithmic trading.

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.220
Let's get a quick overview of the curriculum.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.340
We'll start off a basic crash course in Python for a quick review of the programming language.

12
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.930
Afterwards we'll cover key libraries that we're going to be using in our analysis including some pie

13
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.790
pandas and Matt plotless.

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.900
Once you've learned the core libraries will jump to learning how to work with time series data with

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.170
Python including working on the stats models library.

16
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.630
We will also cover how to use Python to obtain financial security data including panda data reader and

17
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.540
the quando Python API.

18
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.970
Once you've mastered all these libraries will continue.

19
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.020
By learning about Quanto in one of the best platforms online for conducting algorithmic trading with

20
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.530
Python

21
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.350
with this course you get a variety of content including high definition video explanatory code notebooks

22
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.520
as well as links to complete slide decks for each major topic.

23
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.000
Not only do you get great content you also get access to our online question answer forms inside the

24
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.460
course as well as her own.
