00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,490
Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on the Clintonian platform.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,080
So now that we understand the basics of finance Hammerfall is its time to learn how to use Quanto Appian

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,180
platform for algorithmic trading.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,690
This section is going to cover the following topics.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,900
We'll have a review of what totally it is.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,180
We'll talk about basic algorithm methods.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,720
Talk about building trading algorithms discuss trading algorithm exercises and then discuss Clintonian

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,160
pipeline's.

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,350
Before we begin if the more technical topics.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,620
Let's go ahead and jump to w w w that Quanto Appian dot com and explore the site a bit and explain what

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,200
it is.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,510
OK so here I am at Quanto dot com and the pinning on when you visit the site it may look slightly different

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,210
to you but the basic idea behind Quanto open is that it allows anyone who knows how to code in Python

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,210
to write in an investment algorithm and select authors can then license their algorithms to Quanto Appian

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,190
and get paid based off the performance of that algorithm.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,060
So you can write algorithm using Python in their interactive development environment or their idea which

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,260
will show you later on and you can also clone algorithms from the community as people share algorithms

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,550
so you can start off an idea customize the code beyond that and then what's really nice it has a whole

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,420
backtesting library so you can then backtesting algorithm against 14 years of U.S. stock price data.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,140
And they also provide free fundamental data things like price earnings ratios that you can use in your

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,290
strategy where you can also do is ploy to live trading so you can either enter into their monthly contest

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,940
or you can also connect it to your interactive brokers account and they also support Robinhood accounts

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,580
in the United States.

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,550
So if you kind of scroll through this Web site it tells you what they're all about.

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,130
They have a research environment which is kind of like a Jupiter notebook environment where you're going

26
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,630
to be exploring later on and they also have an idea or development environment so you can test stuff

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,800
on U.S. equities data.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,520
And then also coming soon.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,410
U.S. futures so show how to do that as well.

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,350
Then you can compete.

31
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,840
So every month they award prizes the winning algorithms and if you win you earn $5000 and if your algorithm

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,540
is really good it's one of the best.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,340
What happens is they may be selected to receive capital allocations from Quanto up in and then if your

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,460
algorithm is selected for an allocation you get a share of your algorithms net profits and then here's

35
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,750
just some various perks like intellectual property you're going to own your own algorithms and they're

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,680
kept the secret unless you want to share them.

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,910
There's backtesting you can do real money trading with your own money if you really want that.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,790
And there's also the race community there's researchers data sets et cetera.

39
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,810
So if you go ahead and join Quanto and you can just click here on the sign up page and you go when you

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,620
hit sign up you can sign up with your first name last name email and password.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,600
Let me show you what it looks like.

42
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,510
If you already have an account so you have an account to log in right now.

43
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,100
So once you log into the Web site you'll end up going to Quon topee and community where there's post

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,510
like interest seeing us and it's just a different post based off what people are interested in.

45
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,090
So basically kind of almost like a discussion forum here and they have a little cue here that means

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,110
they're officially part of Pantaleone but anyone can just post something here.

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,750
So if I really wanted to I could hit New posts.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,060
Now if we go ahead and check out some of the different things we're going to be exploring one of them

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,390
is research superhit and research and then go to notebook's select that it will load up some notebooks

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,210
and basically this is the super PAC environment hosted on Quanto Appian.

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,490
So you can do is you can check out different tutorials and documentation they have as well as different

52
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,530
data sets they have.

53
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,430
But on the plus side it will end up creating a new notebook.

54
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,880
And here we have a Jupiter in environment.

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,910
So there's various things you can do here but anything from like import Panthers as PD shift from shift

56
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,940
enter to run that cell.

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,320
And it all works just as we've been working with things locally.

58
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,600
So they have this notebook environment for research.

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,940
We'll be exploring that later on.

60
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,620
But I also want to show you that you have a I-T or interactive development environment that's a more

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,960
common environment to use when you're doing algorithmic trading on Quanto.

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,380
If you click on this little queue go ahead and leave this we don't care if it's being saved or not.

63
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,470
But it hit on the key.

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,160
I'll take you back to the home page click here which says start coding.

65
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,790
Select that and that will take you to the page and it's fills it up with a algorithm here.

66
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,530
So this is typically what the algorithms look like and then what you can do is you come back test.

67
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,770
So here's a sample mean reversion algorithm.

68
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,650
And the third copy of it.

69
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,510
So I'm going to go ahead and build that algorithm but I don't want to test it on so much we'll just

70
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,410
test it on let's say a couple months of data.

71
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,850
So if you hit build algorithm here it's going to run a back test.

72
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,960
So it's going to initialize the back test and it's going to show you how well this particular algorithm

73
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,090
performed.

74
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,430
Now Quanto ping has a very specific API.

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,660
So you have to build functions in a particular way.

76
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,530
And we'll be showing you how to do all of that.

77
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,590
But once you have your algorithm ready to go well you can see is logged so it will tell you kind of

78
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,620
like what purchases you did etc. anything to print out.

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,480
We have this record method to actually records our purchases and then we can see how well the algorithm

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,130
performed versus the benchmark.

81
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,740
And in this case we're using the S&amp;P 500 as our benchmark.

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,520
So right now it's back testing it against the data I provided.

83
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,200
And then once this back test is done running you can see how it performed against our actual benchmark.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,060
So here is the blue and then red is the benchmark and kind of CEO goes along.

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,680
And what's also really nice is it tells you the alpha and beta parameters as well as the sharp ratio

86
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,220
and we'll be discussing returns and draw down later on.

87
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,440
Now you can also run a full back test.

88
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,230
So let me make this just a little short of a time frame.

89
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,190
We'll just do let's say one week back to us things like since the 19th.

90
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,610
And then if you run a full back test it will take you to another page and then it runs a full back test.

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,620
And basically this is a back test that performs a lot more metrics so has things like benchmark returns

92
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,170
alpha beta sharp but also things like volatility max draw down daily positions and gains transaction

93
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,510
details etc..

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,290
So there's a lot more information than a typical Just quick back test.

95
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,950
So if you ever want a kind of final algorithm to be fully back tested you can run that back test.

96
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,320
But keep in mind that this takes a lot longer.

97
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,730
Even if I'm just doing like a week or so of data it takes it's taking it almost as much time as it did

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,460
to do that several months beforehand because it is calculating the daily returns that different transactions

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,430
etc..

100
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,030
So just keep that in mind that if you hit that fool back to us it's going to be a lot longer process.

101
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,000
Typically it's just something you set and then maybe go for lunch.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,530
All right so if click back here and then cut back one more time you can see it.

103
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,520
It saves the accessory algorithm.

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
It also has a bunch of different names that we are testing algorithms.

105
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,390
The number of back tests you ran on it and for instance this first I'll go I can click on it.

106
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,980
Take me here and then I can check out different things for it.

107
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,720
And then I also collaborate has an API reference I can get back to us here and it shows me the different

108
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,950
back tests I ran and what they I ran them as well as the different returns so you can see some are canceled

109
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,220
some are completed etc..

110
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,340
And then if you click on it they'll take you to that particular test or you can rerun it again.

111
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,330
So I'm going to go back here and there's community there's forums events contests capital etc..

112
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,860
Well it's also really important to understand about Quanto open.

113
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,840
Is that a lot of these libraries that run the back test do the algorithmic trading.

114
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,690
They're all a lot of them at least are open source so I'm going to show you Quanto paeans get hub now

115
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,330
so you can check out the open source libraries.

116
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:19,120
OK so here I am at a dot com slash Quanto Appian and this Quanto up in public Hub's the open source.

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,340
A lot of technology that runs Quanto PIENSO zip line is one of their most popular libraries and it's

118
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,140
basically an algorithmic trading library but most importantly it's the backtesting portion of what their

119
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,050
platform runs off.

120
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,300
So if we go ahead and check it out click on that link.

121
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,730
Quanto pansit blind tickey the zip line the I.O. where basically describes everything that you can install

122
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,530
it.

123
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,890
Typically it's a little more difficult to install than just Pipp install and you can see the various

124
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,390
installation instructions here.

125
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,210
That's because it depends on Champine several C extensions.

126
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,540
You can also try installing it through Khanda because of the more complicated installation for zip line.

127
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,170
We are just going to use Quanto Appian platform so we don't have to worry about all that stuff but all

128
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,950
the functions we do in case you ever want to run them locally if you don't want your stuff on the Antoninus

129
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,600
platform.

130
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:09,400
You can just use ziplining to do the backtesting the exact same way that we show in the lecturer's now

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,740
says things like Alpha lens which is a performance analysis and that has Pamphylia which is risk analytics

132
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,640
in Python.

133
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,510
You can check these out.

134
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,850
They all have kind of links to what they end up doing.

135
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,790
So Alpha lends Python library for performance analysis predictive or alpha stock factors number we discuss

136
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,510
that cap and model and then they have pie Foleo which kind of discusses risk analytics risk analysis

137
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,010
of financial portfolios and you could see kind of gives you the tear sheet of information as well as

138
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,270
cumulative returns.

139
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,180
The Rolling portfolio Bayda as in regards to spy or S&amp;P 500 the rolling Sharpe ratio as time goes on

140
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,660
and then things like under-water plots or the draw down exposure etc. so there a lot of stuff here.

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Some of it we'll be discussing some of it we won't.

142
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,100
But keep in mind if you ever don't want to use Quanto APENAS platform a lot of their stuff that they

143
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,540
use is open source free access which is important to me as an instructor choosing them.

144
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,220
The fact that in case anything happens Quanto up in all the code is still open source and we can still

145
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,890
use everything we learn on our own computers.

146
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,360
OK.

147
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,900
So that's it for Quanto openness was as far as the overview is concerned.

148
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,210
Later on in future lectures would definitely be using it a lot.

149
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,650
So make sure that you have an account.

150
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,540
It's free to create an account on Quanto open.

151
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,740
So go ahead and create the account and the next lecture will show you the basics of using Quanto Appian

152
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,650
platform.

153
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,550
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
