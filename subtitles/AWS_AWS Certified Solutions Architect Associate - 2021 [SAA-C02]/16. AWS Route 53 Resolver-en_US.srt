00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,110
In this lab we're going to talk about one of the newer features of rat 53 called Rat 53 resolve.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,370
So this was released late in 2018 so it's been around for several months.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,050
Will probably start appearing on the exam soon if it hasn't done already.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:28,050
So Route 53 resolve aims to solve the problem of enabling seamless DNS resolution across hybrid cloud

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,000
environments.

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,960
So as in the diagram here some organizations will have their own private cloud or just a corporate data

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,660
center environment which they connect into a W S.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:48,360
And so this is termed a hybrid cloud and they may have DNS servers on premises and then there's obviously

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,670
a DNS service within your VPC and there's about 50 free.

10
00:00:52,830 --> 00:01:02,140
So what might happen is customers want to be able to resolve AWB specific records from machines within

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,020
their corporate datacenter.

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:10,330
And conversely they may be it needs to look up records that are hosted on the DNS server on premises

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,210
and you know the query might come from an easy to instance.

14
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:22,480
So this is done for around 50 free resolve using endpoints and they have outbound endpoints and inbound

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,720
endpoints.

16
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,350
So the way this works is you can figure this free Ralph 50 free.

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,950
You create an end point which creates an elastic network interface in each availability zone that you

18
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,280
place it in and then when you're easy to instance needs to query a record on the DNS server.

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,070
So let's say for instance your easy to instance might be an application that needs to send an email

20
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,220
and rather than using an AWP specific service it might want to use a mail server that's somewhere on

21
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,120
your on premise datacenter.

22
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,070
So it would then query the mail exchange Amex record.

23
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,270
Now that doesn't exist here because it's hosted on the DNS server on premises.

24
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:12,350
So what happens is the easy to instance connect around 50 free which says right we've got an outbound

25
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:22,250
endpoint and a rule which says that you can find the response to your query by going across the VPN.

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,080
And this could be a VPN or it could be a direct connect connection to the corporate data center DNS

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,260
server which will be able to respond to the query.

28
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,920
So that's how it works for outbound endpoints.

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,060
We then have the inbound endpoints.

30
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,620
So this is the reverse where you have a client or it could be a server or anything within your corporate

31
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:48,490
datacenter that needs to resolve a record that's hosted in the Amazon DNS or Ralph 53.

32
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,210
So in this case the client queries its own DNS server which has a forwarding role to say well for that

33
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:02,930
domain name you need to go to the IP address of the endpoint and that will then be routed across the

34
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:09,650
VPN or direct connect connection hit the inbound endpoint here which will then forward it's around 50

35
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,710
free for resolution so that's how that works.

36
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:21,220
Let's go back over to the console and we can search to find room 53 resolve.

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,020
Here it is

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:33,320
so if we come down in the console here it shows us some diagrams on how this works.

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,890
So it's a combination of the endpoints within the availability zones and then rules which determine

40
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,340
how traffic is forwarded for specific domain name spaces.

41
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,690
So let's go in and create a bit of a configuration.

42
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,750
We're not gonna be able to make a working configuration because we would need an on premise connect

43
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,180
on on premise environment that's connected via a VPN.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,570
I don't have that at this point.

45
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,590
So but we can just walk through and see what the configuration would be.

46
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:11,340
So for instance you can create this inbound endpoint so I'm just going to call it my inbound endpoint

47
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,040
and then you choose your VPC and then you can choose a security group and then you choose your Availability

48
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,800
Zones and Amazon recommend that you have at least two Availability Zones so choose the AC.

49
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm going to choose one of my private subnets allow NWS to choose the IP address themselves and then

50
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,440
have them to choose a different availability zone which also has a private subnet.

51
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,310
And I'm not going to tag at this point so I can just click submit and that's creating an inbound endpoint

52
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,040
and then we'll just do the same thing here.

53
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,800
I would just call this my outbound endpoint.

54
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,850
She's my BPC.

55
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,560
Just choose a security group.

56
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,980
Doesn't really matter because this isn't going to work.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,870
Anyway we're not going to have a fully working configuration and again I'm just going to choose the

58
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,310
same availability zones

59
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,470
and click submit and that's really it.

60
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:20,710
That would just create those endpoints within those DP CS or within those Availability Zones with elastic

61
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:28,240
network interfaces and then the last thing to do then is to create the rules so we can go into this

62
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,480
wizard and this just call this my rule 1 and types can be forward or system.

63
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,210
In this case we're going to use forward.

64
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:44,050
So in this case maybe we've got a domain called DCT private dot com and we want resolution for this

65
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,450
domain to happen within our VPC

66
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,230
and we want to choose our outbound endpoint and then we want to specify the target.

67
00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:02,940
So this could be your on premise DNS server and you can add to for redundancy or however many you want.

68
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,650
I'm not sure what the limit is but so you've added your on premise target IP addresses.

69
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,650
So what this is saying is it will forward traffic that's destined to DCT private dot com and it's going

70
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,350
to respond for queries that originate in the VPC and then it's going to send that traffic out via this

71
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,260
endpoint and the endpoint will forward using these IP addresses so these you are on premise DNS service

72
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,350
and click on submit and that's it.

73
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:37,230
And you know it's a very similar process for doing an inbound rule you.

74
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,020
This is very new so it may or may not be on the exam yet but just go through and have a play around

75
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,480
and try to understand what the use cases are for this.

76
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:54,410
So remember it's all about seamless integration of DNS between on premises and a W S environment.

77
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:01,260
So I think hybrid cloud and DNS and conditional forwarding those are the sorts of bits of language that

78
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,110
your hair when you read in your exam questions.

79
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:12,600
So yeah just read up on the service and hopefully you'll be fully prepared now I believe there is a

80
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,830
charge for using the service so you might want to go in and what you need to do is find you in your

81
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,050
rule you go to disassociate the VPC and just go to type disassociate.

82
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:32,910
Or I'm just going to copy it and submit and that can take a few minutes and then you can just go in

83
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,080
and delete your rule delete your inbound and outbound endpoints.
