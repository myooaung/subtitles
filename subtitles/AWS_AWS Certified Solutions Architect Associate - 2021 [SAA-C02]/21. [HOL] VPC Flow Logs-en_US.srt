00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,240
Hi, guys, in this lesson, you're going to learn about VPC flow logs, and then we're also going to

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,230
set a flow log up to see how it works and what data actually captures.

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:22,600
So VPC flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a

4
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,350
VPC.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,400
The data is stored using Cloud Watch or Amazon is free, and you can create the flow log at different

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,880
levels.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:38,470
So at the VPC level, at the subnet level or at the interface level surface, at the interface level,

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,000
it's associated with the Illinois that's attached to an easy to instance.

9
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,850
You can capture a lot of traffic, which is really useful for troubleshooting purposes and security

10
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,270
as well.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,980
So let's go and create a flow, log in, etc. I still have an instance running.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,790
If you don't have an instance running, just launch an instance, just as we have done before and put

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,380
it into your public one a subnet and it should have a public IP address.

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,830
Next, we're going to actually send our data to cloud watch logs.

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,090
So in the cloud watch service, I'm going to go to lot groups.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,120
Create law group and create myself a law group.

17
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm going to call it my subnet logs.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,560
I consider attention setting.

19
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,270
For me, let's put five days, so after five days, I don't need that data anymore.

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,010
And let's create the log creep.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,310
Next, we need to create a role so that the flow logs service has the permissions it needs in the Identity

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,600
and Access Management Service.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,590
We're going to create a role.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,030
So let's create a role.

25
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,380
Choose create role.

26
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,230
We're going to choose EC2 for now.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,800
We're going to modify that scene because that's not actually the service that's going to be assuming

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,280
the role.

29
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,980
We're going to go straight past policies because we're going to add an in-line policy and I'm going

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:57,680
to call my roll flow logs, cloud watch and I remove the description and create this role.

31
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,990
Now let's find the role and under permissions, we're going to add an inline policy.

32
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:11,960
We're going to go to Jason and we have this JSON code here in your code Amazon VPC Directory and it's

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,670
VPC Flow Logs, JSON.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,400
So we need to do is copy all of this.

35
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:23,780
As you can see, the service is going to be provided with the permissions to create a log group, create

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,250
a log stream, log events, described log groups and describe log streams.

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,720
So with that copied, that's come back over, right?

38
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,620
All of that code.

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Click on Review.

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,440
Give it a name.

41
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,490
I'll just call it cloud watch permissions and create the policy.

42
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,160
Now we do need to edit the trust relationship.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,250
It's not actually easy to that's going to assume this role.

44
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,700
So coming back here, the trust policy can be replaced.

45
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:57,530
We can literally just copy this piece of text here, and we're going to paste it over where it says

46
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,680
easy to do or Amazon US dot com.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,160
So now the service is able to assume this role is VPC flow logs.

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,270
Let's update that trust policy.

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,020
That's it.

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,200
We're now ready to go and create our flow log back in.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,890
Easy to do.

52
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,480
I've only got one instance running, so it's going to be easy to identify the network interface.

53
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,080
We're going to create the flow log here at the network interface level, so flick over to flow logs,

54
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,820
create flow log.

55
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,530
I'll just call it my flow log.

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,810
Let's put it for all traffic and a one man aggregation.

57
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,550
So we get some data nice and fast.

58
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,950
We'll delete it afterwards when we terminate our instance anyway, and we're going to send a cloud watch

59
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,310
logs.

60
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,160
So we've got our log creep and let's find our role, which is starts with flow.

61
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,170
So it's flow logs, cloud watch and we're going to leave the default formats.

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,420
And then just create that flow log.

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,060
So now let's try a couple of things.

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,700
We want to send some successful connections, so let's copy our public IP.

65
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,630
Go to a new window here and put that in.

66
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,000
And we've now generated some HTTP traffic and what refreshed out a couple of times.

67
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,720
And what about sending some traffic, which we're going to get rejected on?

68
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,150
That's another thing that we could do.

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,650
So let's come back to instances.

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,100
Check out what security creep this instance is in, and it's actually got two.

71
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,040
So let's go to the public web one, because I think that's the one that's got some rules which allow

72
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
certain protocols from the internet.

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,120
And yes, we can see the cessation HTP rules are in there.

74
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,550
So let's go and edit the inbound rules.

75
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,620
And I'm just going to temporarily delete my SSA rule and safe now from a command line.

76
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm simply going to try without any arguments to switch to that instance.

77
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,600
And that shouldn't work.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,220
It should just keep failing because we don't have the security group rules to allow this.

79
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,970
So that's basically it just generating a bit of traffic.

80
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,880
So what we can do now is go to cloud watch logs and see if some data is starting to be sent there.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,400
Back in the cloud watch logs, I'm going to select my log group and let's see if we've got a stream

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,470
and I do have a stream that's nice and fast.

83
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,120
Now, don't worry if it's not there yet, you might have to wait a few minutes and it will turn up.

84
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,520
So let's select my log stream and see what data we have in here.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,530
And you can see there's a few entries here we can see some rejects.

86
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,790
And associated with those is various information, including the Elastic Network interface, the source

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,890
and destination IP addresses.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,390
We've got port numbers.

89
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,860
We've got protocol numbers.

90
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,500
We've got various bits of information in there that could be useful in whatever analysis you're doing.

91
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,470
If you want to refresh, you can click on Resume and then you should see some more data coming in over

92
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:54,860
time.

93
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,240
So there we go, we've got quite a few more rejects coming in as well.

94
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,610
And just a couple of minutes later, I've refreshed my screen and we can see some accepts as well,

95
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,540
says quite a few.

96
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,800
We can see the port no.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,790
Airport 80.

98
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,220
So those are successful connections going to our web server.

99
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,950
So that's it.

100
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,620
There's lots of data there that you can use for various analysis, and it's really useful to understand

101
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,360
that different types of logs we've got in IWC, what data is included in them.

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,010
So you know which ones to use for your troubleshooting or your analysis.

103
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,960
So that's it for this lesson, and we have finished with our EC2 instance now so we can go ahead and

104
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,470
delete it.

105
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,440
Once you've terminated your instance, you're all cleaned up.
