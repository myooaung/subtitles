Hi, guys.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.850
Welcome to the end of the course.

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.680
I hope that you've been through the whole course by now and that you've really enjoyed it and learned

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.220
loads.

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.420
Now, in terms of some advice for taking the exam, try to make sure you don't push your exam too early.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.250
You need to go through the videos a couple of times each to make sure that you're really familiar with

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.970
the topics.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.700
Also, go over the cheat sheets on our website or the downloadable PDA file.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.230
Make sure you're familiar with those topics because they're all relevant for the exam.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.030
And it's a great way to really sort of cram some of that information and make sure you remember it.

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.570
You can also go and check out the A.W. SFA cues as well for services where you think you need some extra

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.990
study.

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.830
I also highly recommend using practice tests, find some high quality practice exams and make sure that

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.740
you're familiar with the style of the exam.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.530
You can go to a W.S. Doc training to book your exam and it will take you to Parametric or Pearson View

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.300
and you can book into a testing center or in some cases use an online proctored exam from there.

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.030
Now, always take your time on the exam.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.080
Don't rush through.

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.790
But my recommendation is that the way you should take the exam is to try and answer questions as best

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.260
you can.

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.340
But don't spend too long on one question.

22
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.140
Time management is really important.

23
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.970
So what I recommend is if you're having difficulty, give it your best answer.

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.370
Market for review and carry on.

25
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.980
And then by the time you get to the end of the exam, you should have enough time left over to go back

26
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.600
and review those tricky questions.

27
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.140
Another piece of advice if you are taken exam in English, but English isn't your first language, you

28
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.780
can actually apply for an extension in the time.

29
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.420
So check that out when you're booking your exam.

30
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.080
So finally, I just want to say thank you again for taking this course.

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.910
And I really hope you enjoyed it.

32
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.980
And I wish you all the best for your exam.

33
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.420
I can't wait to hear about your success.
