Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.740
In this lesson I want to discuss auto scaling health checks now by default.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.980
Easy to auto scaling uses the Amazon easy to status checks.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.710
Now you'll remember from the console that when you have a running instance there's a system status check

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.270
and an instant status check.

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.720
And we then also have the instant state which is running easy to auto scaling checks.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.780
Amazon easy to to check that the easy two instances in the running state if it is it's fine if it's

8
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.100
in any other state.

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.070
Auto scaling will terminate that instance and replace the instance.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.590
Now if you use Elastic Load Balancing as well and that elastic low balance was attached to your auto

11
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.520
scaling group you can configure L.B. B health checks so you'll remember the ECB does its own health

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.170
checking so the elastic load balancer is sending health check requests to each of your instances and

13
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.840
you specify the ping protocol and port that it uses and even a path.

14
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.990
What happens is if a health check fails then he'll be marks that instance as out of service.

15
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.370
Also scaling checks LP and if it finds an instance that's out of service it terminates an instance and

16
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.700
replaces it.

17
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.200
Now when you configure Ill be health checks both types are enabled as mentioned in the comment up here

18
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.550
so you can even have easy to state is checks only or you can figure ESB and it uses both.

19
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.580
Now if it uses both both need to pass.

20
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.880
In other words both need to report that the instance is healthy.

21
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.960
Otherwise auto scanning will terminate and replaced an instance.

22
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.740
Now the other thing to mention is that Amazon recommend that when you're using an LP that you choose

23
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.640
Elastic Load Balancing as the health check option and the reason being is if you only have two status

24
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.960
checks it's possible that Elastic Load Balancing can find that using its health checks and instances

25
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.460
unhealthy but it can't report that information to auto scaling.

26
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.620
So the instance will be taken out of service by Elastic Load Balancing but it won't be replaced by auto

27
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.170
scaling.

28
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.780
So it's definitely recommended when using it'll be that you use LP health checks.

29
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.550
Now let's just go back to the console and have a look where you can figure these options.

30
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.990
So I've got a auto scaling group running and if I just go down select my auto skating group and go to

31
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.520
edit and we come down here we can see the health check type and the options are easy to or LP so if

32
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.790
we have easy to it will only use the easy to status checks.

33
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.860
And if we have LP it will use the ill be health checks and the easy to status checks.

34
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.250
Now of course you'd have to attach a target group for application load balancing or network load balancing

35
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.640
or a classic load balancer.

36
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.440
So that's just a quick lap on auto scaling health checks.

37
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.870
Key things to remember are that by default ASG uses easy to status checks.

38
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.920
It's recommended that you use ERP health checks if you have an elastic low balance attached and that

39
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.160
means that both types will be used.

40
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.680
And remember both Elastic Load Balancing and easy to stay checks need to report that the instance is

41
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.220
healthy.

42
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.370
Otherwise auto scaling will terminate and replace that instance.
