00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,700
Welcome to the architecture patterns, the DNS caching and performance optimization.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,580
So let's have a look at the first requirement an elastic load balance must be resolvable using a company's

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,140
public domain name, around 50 free hosted zone already exists.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,710
Well, in this case, you can create an alias record that maps the domain name to the LP, and you must

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,080
use an alias here rather than the C name.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,660
Remember, C name can be used for a subdomain.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,010
But in this case, it's not a sub domain and it's mapping to an LP.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,390
A website runs across to AWG regions.

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,300
All traffic goes to one region and should be redirected only if the website is unavailable.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,330
Well, in that case, you can create a fail over routing policy and Route 53 and configure health checks

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,380
on the primary.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,420
Websites run in several countries and distribution rights require restricting access to content based

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,640
on the geographic source of the connection.

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,760
Well, in this case, you can use Route 53 geo location routing and restrict distribution based on geographic

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,360
location.

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,840
A cloud front distribution has multiple S3 origins.

17
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,030
Requests should be served from different regions based on file type being requested.

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,010
Well, here you can use a behavior and configure a path pattern that you do that within your distribution

19
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,600
content is accessed using an application and cloud front distribution.

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:40,280
You need to control access to multiple files on the distribution for this solution.

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,370
You can configure signed cookies and then update the application so it processes those cookies.

22
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,000
An application runs behind an application load balancer in multiple regions.

23
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,230
You need to intelligently route traffic based on latency as well as availability.

24
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,270
For this, you can create an IWC global accelerator and add the albee's and that's it for this lesson.
