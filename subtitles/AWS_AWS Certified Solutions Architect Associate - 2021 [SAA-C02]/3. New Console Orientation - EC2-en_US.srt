00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,970
Hello and welcome to this lesson.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:10,180
So you may have noticed that the AWB Management Council has been changing for a while now, so it's

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,440
an ongoing process.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,960
AWB are modifying the console for quite a lot of services, not all services yet.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,510
I presume that they'll roll out all services eventually, but they're making some ongoing changes.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,280
And these are happening all the time.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,970
In fact, as I'm recording courses, they're changing.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,480
So it's a bit of a moving goalpost at the moment.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,090
So what I'm doing is I'm recording some orientation videos to help you to get a feel for the new console.

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,870
And that's what I'm going to do here for the easy to management console.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,350
And in the next two videos in this section, I'll also provide some videos showing you how to create

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,930
and launch instances, how to connect to instances, all using the new management console.

13
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,580
The remainder of the videos in this section are still using the old console.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,160
But I'm going to help you to understand the differences.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,020
Really, it's mostly cosmetic.

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,750
Now, you might be wondering, why don't I rerecord all videos?

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,650
Well, partly it's because it's a big job.

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,690
And so I need to schedule that time in.

19
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,800
But also it's because at the moment the changes are ongoing.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,080
So I don't want to rerecord the course and then find that when I'm finished, students are asking me

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,690
why the console looks different to what they're experiencing.

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,390
So I'm going to wait until eight of us have got the vast majority of the most significant changes done.

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,040
And then I'm actually going to rerecord lots of videos throughout the course.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,110
So as I mentioned, the key thing to note is that mostly we're talking about cosmetic changes here.

25
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,030
So it's really the look and feel, the features and the settings are the same.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,050
It's just a better way of working with us.

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,240
So let's have a look.

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,300
So on my screen here, I have the new management console.

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:58,870
At this point in time, you can turn the new experience on or off by flicking the switch up on the top

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,700
left hand corner.

31
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,420
Now, on another screen here, I have the same HWC account in the same region using the old console.

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,640
So I've turned off the new easy to experience.

33
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,880
So let's have a look at some of the differences.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,340
Now, one of the first things to note is that up in the top here, we have different menu.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,040
So let's select one of these instances.

36
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:27,130
This is a Windows instance and you'll notice we've got a connect instance, state and actions, whereas

37
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,780
in the old console we only have the actions and the launch instance here.

38
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,750
So coming back over, if I go to instant state, this is where you stop, start, restart, hibernate

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,400
or terminate your instances.

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,020
And then we have a separate actions menu in the old menu, the instant state is here and actions.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,010
So they've just broken that out into a separate menu.

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,480
So coming back here, that's instant state covered.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,370
We've then got actions now.

44
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,080
A few things to note and actions.

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,390
Firstly, we have security here.

46
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,890
This is a new tab where you can change security groups, get the Windows password and modify the erm

47
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,240
roll.

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,510
Now, the key thing to note is that in the old console you would actually have to go into networking

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,750
to change security groups and instant settings to attach or replace an item roll.

50
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,230
So they've changed the layout a bit here.

51
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,910
So coming back onto the new menu, just note that security is where you go to change security groups

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,140
to modify your IAM role and also to get the Windows password for Windows XP instances.

53
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,200
The remainder of the settings are just as you would expect.

54
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,460
This is the networking.

55
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,820
We have the general to instant settings here.

56
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,880
We then have images and templates and there's some monitoring and troubleshooting tools.

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,190
The other thing to note is the connect menu has changed as well.

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,580
So when you go into the connect menu, if you're using a Windows instance, you can then either use

59
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,870
session manager to connect or you choose RTP clients.

60
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,730
If you want the Windows password, this is another place to get it.

61
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,560
You can download the settings for remote desktop and you can get a password here.

62
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,320
So this is again, slightly different to the old console.

63
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,850
Let's head back over there.

64
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,270
In this case, you just go to connect, get a password.

65
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,440
So the only real difference is you have to change to this IDP client menu.

66
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,030
So then let's have a look into the bottom part of the console.

67
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,220
I have one of my instances selected, and what we had in the old console was status checks, monitoring

68
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,000
and tags.

69
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,820
So you can see those here on the new menu.

70
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,570
They've also given us security, networking and storage.

71
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,510
So on the main details page, you get a lot of this information, but then you can get a bit of a drill

72
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,310
down on each of these tabs.

73
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,310
So that's slightly different.

74
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,970
Let's now have a look at security groups on the left hand side here.

75
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,560
So, again, this is just a slightly different look to the very same functionality.

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,450
Let's go into the old console.

77
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,590
Security groups and let's select this Web access security group now actually need to add an inbound

78
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,210
rule for my Windows instant's.

79
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,830
So let's see how you do that.

80
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:18,020
If you click on edit add rule and then you add a rule and you have to specify these particular settings.

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,400
Now those settings are the same on the new console.

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,530
Again, it's just a slightly different look.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,980
So let's add RTP into here, for instance, choose to allow it from anywhere and then save rules.

84
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,840
So really no different functionality.

85
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,740
Just looks a bit different, looks slightly better, if anything.

86
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,610
That's it for this orientation video on the new management console for two.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,780
The key takeaway is that overall it's mainly cosmetic changes.

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,150
It's really just about a different look and feel.

89
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,820
The settings are pretty much all the same, but you just need to work out where things are now.

90
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,320
It's slightly different when you work with the console.

91
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,760
I've also added some orientation videos for other services as well to help you work out the differences

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,620
between the old and the new console.
