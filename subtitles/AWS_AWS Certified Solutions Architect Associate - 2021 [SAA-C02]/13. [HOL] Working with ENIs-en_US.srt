00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,760
Welcome back to another hands on lesson.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,050
So this time we're going to have a look at working with Elastic Network interfaces.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,620
So let's head over to the console on the easy to management console.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,260
I'm going to launch an instance again.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,620
It's going to be the Linux two army to micro.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,060
I'm going to put this one in public, one A and then I'm going to click on next.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,330
Go free.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,340
We don't need to change any other settings.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,500
Just choose our web access security group and we're going to launch this instance.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,350
So the instance is launching now while that's happening.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:48,060
We're going to scroll down here to network interfaces and we can see we have an existing network interface.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,950
Let's just pull this box up from the bottom here and we can see a bit more information.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,550
You can see the interface I.D. We can say it's in use what VPC and Sublette it's in, and we can see

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,290
the address information here as well.

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,320
And you can say it's not an elastic fabric adaptor.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
We know what availability zone it's in.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,490
This is quite a bit of information here.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,850
You can also see the Mac address, so that's the layer to address associated with this particular in.I.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,930
What I want to do is create a new network interface.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,710
I'm going to call this F1 because it's essentially the second interface, for instance, and I need

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,420
to put it in the same subnet because I want to attach it to the instance we've just launched.

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,730
Now remember, you can attach an interface in a different subnet as long as the sublets in the same.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,830
So we're going to choose public one.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,210
We're going to leave the default settings for IP addresses and choose Web Access Security Group and

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,920
then create the network interface.

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,000
So that's done.

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,070
Let's select this interface.

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,600
We can say it's available, it's not in use, and we can see some information.

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,230
We can see that it has a V6 address, a V4 address and DNS names as well.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,230
So now let's go up to actions.

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,820
Choose Attach.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,240
And that's it's hatchets, for instance, there's only one instance available so we can see the ID and

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,720
attach.

34
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,470
So that is now attached to an instance so we can see it's in use if we go up two instances choose our

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:28,590
running instance go to networking and we can now see that we have multiple interfaces, select our running

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,770
instance, go to networking and we can see it now has multiple network interfaces.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,200
So that's how we can work with Illinois.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,940
So we could quite easily now detach that yanai and move it to a different instance.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,520
Now we only have one instance now, but if you want to play around, launch enough.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,220
For instance, you can detach this interface and then just attach it to another instance as long as

41
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,950
that instance is in the same availability zone.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,580
Now, alternatively, create another subnet in the same availability zone and practice moving between

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,790
different subnets as well.

44
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,450
So you can attach your instance to multiple subnet.

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,280
So those are options available to you.

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,170
Now I'm going to leave the lab here, and we're going to leave this instance running because we will

47
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,520
be using it in a future lab.
