Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.480
Now we're going to talk about latency based routing.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.330
So what latency based routing is is a way to ensure that users are connected to a service that has the

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.970
lowest latency.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
So if you for instance have the same service running on web servers in different parts of the world

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.200
and you want your users to access the resources in the region is closest to them.

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.660
Now you know there's other factors around latency but one of the main factors is the distance between

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.780
you and the resource.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.510
So if you have a user in Sydney the latency between Sydney and the AP se to a region is going to be

10
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.810
very low whereas going across the U.S. Each one is going to have higher licensee so the way this works

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:58.840
then is you create multiple records with the same name and then you specify the IP is all the load balancing

12
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.390
idea of your resources and then you specify the region which this record is responsible for.

13
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.480
And now what happens is when someone queries around 50 free from Sydney it looks through that less than

14
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.120
and knows that all of these are related and says Well which one of these corresponds to the lowest latency

15
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.380
for this user.

16
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.630
And it knows the AP SD 2 is the is the best answer.

17
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.460
So it would give the address of the load balancer.

18
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.690
Similarly for someone in New York it would give them USD 1 or Virginia and for London it would give

19
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.120
them new west to so that's how that works.

20
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.700
Let's now go and grab some addresses.

21
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.380
So I'm just going to copy my instance in Singapore and we're going to go to the console and we're going

22
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.840
to create these records.

23
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.910
So we're going to call this latency DST labs dot com.

24
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.360
I'm going to reduce the TTL I'm going to specify the value choose latency.

25
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.880
And so this one was for Singapore.

26
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.650
Yeah this one's for Singapore.

27
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.980
So I mean it already knows.

28
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.820
So look it's it's clever it already picks up there should be a Singapore address and then if we want

29
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.100
to we can specify our health check.

30
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.340
So what's in this.

31
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340
Give us a name.

32
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.210
So let's just call this latency.

33
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.520
Singapore.

34
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.450
So we've got that record.

35
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.830
Now we can create another one.

36
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.530
It's going to be the next in the lists.

37
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's just go back get the IP address of all North Virginia server

38
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.430
and I'm going to pass that one in put in lights and see.

39
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.670
Sure enough it finds its USD 1 and I can specify my health check hand I need to give it that name again.

40
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.610
So latency.

41
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.860
No Virginia click on Create and for the last one I don't need to go and copy anything because we know

42
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.880
this is the load balancer so latency that these that dot com common going to change too.

43
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.770
Yes for alias I'm going to specify my load balancer.

44
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.290
I'm going to put it latency and this time it doesn't come up with the region.

45
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.540
So I just need to go into AP SD to an associate this with a health check.

46
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.280
And sure enough I remember this time so I'm going to put it in a set of days so just call this licensee

47
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.950
Sidney and create that record

48
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.810
so we've got our free records now and we want to test them out.

49
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:56.730
So what I want to do is just go into a browser and type latency DCT lamps dot com and hit enter.

50
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.340
And sure enough I get AP SD to.

51
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.920
Now I'm actually in Sydney so that's not surprising.

52
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.620
That's that's the by far the closest I w s region to me.

53
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.070
Now what I want to do is let's just go to a command prompt here and we can have a look at this record.

54
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.440
So I'm going to do a dig on DCT labs dot com latency ADT and APS dot com and you can say I've got those

55
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.480
two IP addresses which we know from before these are the addresses that correspond to the load balancer

56
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:36.000
that's in the Sydney region and we just rerun it again because I think it's just about to renew we can

57
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.880
see that CCL expired.

58
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.790
We've got a new one.

59
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.090
Now before that expires what I'm gonna do is and you can't see this on your screen but I'm actually

60
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.200
just going to connect to a VPN now.

61
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.430
So on another screen I've just connected using a VPN client to Canada.

62
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.390
So my IP address is now a Canadian IP address and our TCO should have expired.

63
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.770
So let's just hit refresh and see.

64
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.530
Sure enough we get us e one D.

65
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.140
So we go to North Virginia now and if I come back and hit the latency sure enough we can see in their

66
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:20.800
IP address with two to four one that is definitely in Canada in the US excuse me that's our north Virginian

67
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.510
instance.

68
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:31.120
So the first thing to do now is I'm just going to disable my VPN again and I'm going to connect to Singapore.

69
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.960
So I now have an IP address in Singapore and I'm going to refresh my browser and sure enough we go to

70
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.000
se one a which is an availability zone in Singapore.

71
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.480
So just go back to the diagram and excuse me.

72
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.240
This is different we have EU here but I had Singapore instead.

73
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.890
But otherwise this is very much what we've just done.

74
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.590
We've shown that you can go from Sydney into the south east region.

75
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:07.360
We actually can exit from Canada into North Virginia and we connected also from Singapore and went into

76
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.410
the Singapore region.

77
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.300
So that's what licensee base routing is you can use low balances or easy two instances and it just assesses

78
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.790
the latency from the user to the Amazon region and then determines which record to route people to based

79
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.100
on the lowest latency for the user.
