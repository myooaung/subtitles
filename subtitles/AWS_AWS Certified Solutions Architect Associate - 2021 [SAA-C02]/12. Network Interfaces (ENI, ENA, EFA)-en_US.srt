Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,520
We've launched a few easy two instances so far, and they've always had a elastic network interface

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,820
attached, so when you launch an instance, it comes with a network interface attached to it and that

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,620
will have a private IP address.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,450
And then in some cases, it can also have a public IP address if it's in a public subnet.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,050
Now, an elastic network interface is one type of adapter.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,150
There's also something called an elastic network adapter and an elastic fabric adapter in this lesson.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,040
I'll go through the key information you need to know about these different adapters.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,090
So let's have a look at a example of an easy to instance.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,980
And when we launch, like two instances, we usually choose a subnet.

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,540
Now, when you do that, it will attach a interface in that subnet.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,420
But the actual AC instance itself isn't in the subnet.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,920
It's within the availability zone because remember, an AC is essentially a data center or one or more

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,730
data centers.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,360
Now that means the easy to instance can be attached to multiple subnet fruit different adapters.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:18,570
So here we have an easy to instance it has its EF zero adapter in the public subnet and that has a private

17
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,830
IP address assigned to it.

18
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,460
And it also has a public IP address as well.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,860
Now we could also have another network interface, which is in a private subnet, but it has to be within

20
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,660
the same availability zone.

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,590
So if one is in the private subnet.

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,830
But that private subnet is within the same availability zone as the public subnet, where if zero is

23
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,910
now, we could not attach an adapter from a subnet in another availability zone that just won't work.

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,490
So the key thing to remember is you can have multiple adapters connected to an instance.

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,500
They can be in different subnet.

26
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,470
But the subnets have to be in the same availability zone.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,020
Now, as I mentioned as Elastic Network interfaces, elastic network adapters and elastic fabric adapters.

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,590
So what's the difference between these?

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,640
Well, the Illinois is the basic adapter for when you don't have any specific high performance requirements

30
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,150
and you can use it with any EC2 instance type.

31
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,490
The Elastic Network adapter is for enhanced networking performance.

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,320
It has much higher bandwidth and lower, in instance, latency.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,620
You have to choose supported instance types.

34
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,170
You can't use any instance type with an Ayeni.

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,060
Lastly, we have the elastic fabric adapt, so this is for more specialized use cases.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,180
You use this for high performance computing, HPC and MPI and ML use cases.

37
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,240
So that's message passing interface and machine learning use cases so more specialized, it's more tightly

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,360
coupled applications.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,930
So those applications, which will typically be in low latency environments where they're very close

40
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,120
to each other and they have a lot of interconnectivity between them, lots of messaging happening between

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,590
components of the application.

42
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,050
You can use those with all instance types, but again, you'd only use them when you have a specific

43
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,650
use case.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,860
So that's it for the ferry will go into a hands on in the next lesson and have a look at how we can

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,040
assign additional adapters to our active instances.
