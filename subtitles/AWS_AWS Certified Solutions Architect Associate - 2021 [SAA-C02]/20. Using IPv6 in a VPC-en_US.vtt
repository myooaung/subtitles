Hello and welcome to this lesson.

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.280
I'm now going to talk about using the IPv6 protocol in an Amazon VPC.

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.270
So remember, I mentioned earlier in the course that there's two versions of IP, which are used extensively.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.740
One of them is IPv4.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.840
That's by far the most commonly used.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.490
It's been around for quite a long time.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.920
And then there's IPv6 now.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.340
IPv6 has also been around quite a few years, but it's not been used anywhere near as extensively.

9
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.120
But that needs to change over time because we are running short of IPv4 addresses, so we're going to

10
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.570
have a look at how you can use IPv6 and of APC.

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.360
So let's start by looking at the structure of the IPv4 address.

12
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.470
So you remember it's made up of four numbers separated by dots, and those numbers come from an octet.

13
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.640
So that's eight binary bits, which are either one or zero.

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.450
So an IPv4 address is 32 bits long.

15
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.750
Now let's have a look at how many addresses you get.

16
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.470
For that, you get four point three billion addresses, which sounds like a big number, and it's a

17
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.390
big number if it's dollars in your bank account.

18
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.300
But when it's addresses, that needs to be assigned to all sorts of different devices all over the world.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.550
In a world full of seven billion people, it's just not way anywhere near enough, and it might have

20
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.700
sounded like more than enough quite a few years ago, but it became apparent, even in the 90s, that

21
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.140
it was not going to suffice.

22
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.950
And it hasn't.

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.550
So we are close to exhausting these addresses, and Nat has to be used extensively.

24
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.660
So if you're in a company and your company has thousands of computers internally, then those computers

25
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.970
will most likely be using IPv4 addresses and those will be private addresses.

26
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.000
And when they access the internet, they go for a nets device of some sort, and that means that a public

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
IP address is used to represent many, many pieces.

28
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.340
So that's a workaround that we have to put in place with IPv4.

29
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.640
With IPv6, we don't have to worry about that.

30
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.630
So let's look at the structure of an IPv6 address.

31
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.930
So this is the structure of IPv6.

32
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.820
It also has a network part and a node part, but it's 128 bits long, so it's a much, much bigger number.

33
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.120
But also it uses hexadecimal, whereas IPv4 uses dotted decimal.

34
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.450
So that means there's a lot more potential values that you can use in hexadecimal versus decimal.

35
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.740
So that means the amount of addresses is much, much bigger.

36
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.880
And this is the number that's the number of addresses you can get out of IPv6, and it's absolutely

37
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.390
huge.

38
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.090
So put it into some kind of perspective.

39
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.550
And by the way, if you look on Google for analogies for the size of the IPv6 address space, there's

40
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.540
all sorts of fantastic analogies because it really is massive.

41
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.630
So one that I like is that you can get 100 IPv6 addresses for every atom on Earth.

42
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.530
So that is a huge, huge number, which means we never, ever have to worry about running out of IPv6

43
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.070
addresses.

44
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.410
So let's have a look at how we need to set up.

45
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.310
I'll be PC.

46
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.040
So we've got a VPC with a couple of subnets.

47
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.390
We need to have an IPv4 side, a block and then we need the individual subnet ranges for subnets.

48
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.480
Now we also need an IPv6 side, a block now, so we've allocated one to this account.

49
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.770
Now MWC will assign a slash 56 IPv6 address range to the VPC.

50
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.810
Then you can create your subnet ranges within that address space.

51
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.370
And those become 64 subnets now.

52
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.320
A Slash 64 subnet will allow 18 million trillion addresses.

53
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.930
So again, it's an example of why you really don't need to worry about how many addresses you're going

54
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.660
to have for your computers, because it's just huge.

55
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.390
Now you'll notice there's two numbers highlighted in red at the end of the IP address.

56
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.180
This is a hexadecimal path which has values from zero zero to FMF.

57
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.970
And this designates the individual subnet, so it has to be unique for each subnet.

58
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.280
And it means that you're going to have a possible 256 subnets with IPv6 blocks in them, and each of

59
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.840
those is a slash 64.

60
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.410
So each of those will support 18 million trillion addresses.

61
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.470
So lots of flexibility for your VPC.

62
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.220
Now let's look at the root table once we've enabled IPv6.

63
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:52.610
So we now have a local route for the IPv6 side block, and we need a route to the internet gateway for

64
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.420
everything that's outside of that range, just like we did for IPv4.

65
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:04.600
We have the colon code on slash zero for IPv6 pointing at the internet gateways IP, and that means

66
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.820
any.

67
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.880
Thing that's not an IPv6 address in this range.

68
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.070
We'll go to the internet gateway, so we'll make sure that we have that specified in our roundtable

69
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.900
when we enable IPv6.

70
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.370
Now all IPv6 addresses are publicly releasable.

71
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.010
That means there's no network address translation.

72
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.710
Now, if you want to, you can use something called an egress only internet gateway.

73
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:35.540
Now the purpose of this is when you want to allow outbound access only using IPv6.

74
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.340
So it's kind of like having a EC2 instance in a private subnet with IPv4 and then adding a NAT gateway

75
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.510
into a public subnet.

76
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.780
It means that that instance is protected from the internet.

77
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.730
No one can access it directly from the internet, but it does have internet access outbound.

78
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.940
So that's what an egress only internet gateway does.
