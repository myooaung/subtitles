1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,150
Guns covered DNS record types.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,660
Now the list on the left hand side of the slide is the list of supported DNS records in round free.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,410
So I'm not gonna cover all of these but a few of the key ones and a record just resolves the hostname

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:26,840
to an IP address and a record does the same but it returns an IP vs 6 address a C name is a canonical

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,370
name record and that returns.

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:34,250
That means that you resolve one domain name to another domain name and an alias is a similar is very

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,520
similar to a C name but it's around 50 free specific record that has some extra capabilities which we

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,830
will cover in more detail.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,240
So a few of the others say you'll recognize mail exchange records and pointers which basically the reverse.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:56,600
They resolve IP addresses back to host names and we all talk about the start of authority and just just

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,130
be familiar with this list of records for the exam because occasionally something might come up on the

12
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:08,570
exam that asks what are supported record type is or you might be us so eliminate an answer because you

13
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,330
know.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,570
So let's go in to see name and Alias and a bit more detail because this is definitely something that

15
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,610
comes up in exam questions.

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,640
There's more differences to see names and aliases than in this table but these are some of the key ones

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,950
that you need to know.

18
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:30,050
So one thing is round 53 charges you fancy name records whereas aliases.

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,150
There is no charge.

20
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,550
Another one is that you can't create a C name recall that the top note of a DNS namespace.

21
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,520
So this is also known as the zone Apex record.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,180
So if you take the domain example dot com example dot com is the DNS root namespace or the zone apex.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:57,620
So you can't create a C name record for example dot com but you can create one for apps dot example

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,910
dot com something like that.

25
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,640
So that's no longer the zone Apex because it's a subdomain with alias records you can do that so you

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,900
can say example dot com and you can resolve that using an alias record to a an easy to instance or a

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,590
load balancer or something like that so another one is see names can be used outside of around 50 free

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,390
so you can actually resolve to records that are hosted anywhere else.

29
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,540
So remember A C name resolves to another hostname so that it needs to in turn be resolved to an IP address

30
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,080
so that you can connect to that resource.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,430
So what it's saying is that with a C name you can point to another domain name that's in another DNS

32
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,750
server outside of around 50 free.

33
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,660
You can't do that with alias records which are actually designed to point to cloud front distributions

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,030
beanstalk environments low balances S3 Buckets and so on.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,120
So it's a bit more limited but it's also very powerful within a W.S. so let's just have a look in the

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,400
console and I'm going to go into my hosting zone.

37
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,760
And so this is what we're talking about and here we have named server records and start of authority

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,050
records by default.

39
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,180
And then we can go and create our own records.

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,110
And this is the dropdown where you can choose the type of record that you want to create a record for.

41
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:27,380
So for instance you can create an A record now an alias is another capability of record so you choose

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,650
a record and then you choose alias and then you find your target which could be a light balancer or

43
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,050
a cloud phone distribution.

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:44,360
You could also choose C name if you do that then you can use an alias but you have to resolve to another

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,370
C name the record type has to match.

46
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,910
So very simple.

47
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,670
You then just need to enter the value.

48
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,030
So in the case of an alias you choose your target.

49
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,410
In the case of a regular DNS record you choose the value.

50
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,580
So you'd put the IP address of the server in here.

51
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,330
You can then choose the TTL.

52
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,510
The default is five minutes free hundred seconds and you can change that.

53
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,230
So that's the time to live.

54
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,460
And that means that when you query around 50 free and it returns an answer the answer contains a TTL.

55
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,870
And that tells the cash on your machine how long to store that record for.

56
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,900
And so you can change that and if you change it to a lower value say 60 seconds it means you're going

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,430
to have to query Rhapsody free more regularly.

58
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,640
So once every minute rather than once every five minutes.

59
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:45,330
So that means more traffic but it also means if your records are changing then you pick up those changes

60
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,530
more quickly whereas if you have it set to a day then if you change your DNS record whoever is cached

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:59,640
the previous the old record in there or the response from the old record in their browser or on their

62
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,740
machine or in your application or wherever it's stored it's not going to change now for a day.

63
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,020
So they're not going to be able to connect to your service anymore.

64
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:18,530
So you definitely need to consider carefully what you set the TTL value to now you'll say down here

65
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,190
routing policies and we're going to cover each of these in detail in the section.

66
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,770
So you have these different types of routing policies where you can for instance file over between primary

67
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,380
and secondary records.

68
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,400
So lots of intelligence there so that's it for this lab.

69
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,860
Just wanted to cover DNS record types and as a reminder make sure you know the differences between C

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,310
name and Alias records and there are more differences than in this list.

71
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,480
So look it up there's some great information in the FAA Qs.
