00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.170
We're almost done now with access control in the S3 section of this course.

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.840
But before we move on I just wanted to show you a couple of tools that are really useful.

3
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.110
So under roles here I'm just going to select one of the roles we used earlier.

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.220
And we have a policy applied to this role.

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.170
And what I wanted to do is show you the simulate policy tool.

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:35.230
So if we click on simulate policy we can then choose our service choose our actions for instance LIST

7
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:45.790
BUCKET LIST jobs guess objects ACL and then we can configure this with the ARN of a bucket

8
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.120
or leave it as a wildcard and just run a simulation and see what happens and we can say for instance

9
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.450
here we have list bucket because as we know this policy allows list bucket of course with a simple policy

10
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.220
like this.

11
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.290
It's not too difficult but a good way to simulate and change variables and if you have a complex policy

12
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.490
you can work out what the permission will be.

13
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.400
So that's the policy simulator.

14
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.780
And as you could see that was that can be used for many different services as well.

15
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.620
Another tool actually back in I am is the access advisor so the access advisor shows you the access

16
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.780
which services you have access to.

17
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.980
So actually let's go to my account because I'm an administrative user and let's see access advisor here.

18
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.680
And in this case because I have I'm an administrator so it shows me lots of different services that

19
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.060
I have access to.

20
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.310
And it tells me which policy grants permissions to it very simple here because it's all one policy.

21
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.200
But in most environments you'll have complex policies groups and so on and this will help you to work

22
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.610
out where do your permissions come from.

23
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.890
And you can even see when you last used those permissions to access that service and then the third

24
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.120
tool that I wanted to show you is if we just go into a bucket here and head over to the bucket policy

25
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.940
and we can find the policy generator and this can be used for several services.

26
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.660
So what you can do here is you can put your bucket policy.

27
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.790
You could then go back and get ARN for a user.

28
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.770
You could put that principle in you can then choose you.

29
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.820
So in this case it it selects the service for you because we've we've S3 bucket policy up here

30
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.010
and then you can choose the actions that you want to provide to that user and then you can give the

31
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.790
resource name for the resource you want to grant access to.

32
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.530
So in this case let's say we want to create a policy to grant access to this bucket.

33
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.120
So I've copied the ARN for the bucket and I can put this in and you can even add conditions then as well

34
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.750
as such as we've seen before some of the conditions that you can apply string like if it exists or not

35
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.520
equals.

36
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.250
And so on so there's quite a bit a complexity you provide in there as well.

37
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.940
And then you click on Add statement and it creates this statement down here and then if you click generate

38
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.220
policy here's your policy.

39
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.600
Now you can then go back up and for instance let's just try and give something to a wild card and then

40
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.650
a different set of permissions and the wild card again an ad statement.

41
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.360
And now we have that statement added to this list.

42
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.460
And if we generate policy the code now includes both of those statements.

43
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.180
So these are some tools which you can use.

44
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.960
It's worth playing around and using this to generate some policies for us free and see how it works.

45
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.400
And as I said you can do that for other services as well.
