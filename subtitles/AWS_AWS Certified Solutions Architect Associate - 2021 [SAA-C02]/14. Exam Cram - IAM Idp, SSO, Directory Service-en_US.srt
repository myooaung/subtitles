1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,480
Continuing our exam crime with a single sign on, so, so, so makes it easy to centrally manage access

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,380
to multiple eyewitness accounts as well as business applications.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,800
This is single sign on access to applications as well as your AWB accounts.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,300
You can use AIDS organizations, so you can essentially create your organizations configuration and

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,290
attach that to us.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,550
So and then grant access for single sign on through those accounts.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,910
There's also lots of built in integration's to many business applications, including some of those

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,710
on the screen, and we saw in the lecture earlier in the section that there are many, many more as

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,010
well.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,580
So you can create and manage your user identities in Awassa identity store, so you can create your

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,730
user accounts within AYSO or you can connect to Active Directory or 018.

12
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,190
So Ezo is integrated with very obvious organizations and that means that you can select one or more

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,190
accounts from your organization and grant users access to these accounts.

14
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,000
So it's about granting single Sinon access to those accounts.

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,900
You still got to do the permissions somewhere else.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,890
So onto identity providers and federations.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,800
So this is when we're looking at IAM.

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,520
So Identity and access management and you can configure identity providers to federate external identity

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,120
sources.

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,230
And this means you can manage use your user identities outside of us and give these external user identities

21
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,460
permissions to AWEX resources in your account when you use Ayam identity provider.

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,590
You don't have to create a custom signing code or manage your own user identities.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,870
The ODP provides that for you.

24
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,030
External users then sign in through the IDP and in the case of Web Identity Federation, that can be

25
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,130
something like Amazon or Facebook or Google Iame identity providers help keep your account secure because

26
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,660
you don't have to distribute or embed long term security credentials.

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
So remember, you've got your identity source, maybe active directory.

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:11,470
You use Samal to connect to your active directory and then you're able to have those user accounts,

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,760
login and access resources in Adewusi.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,740
So to set it up, you create an Iame identity provider entity and that establishes a trust relationship

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,630
between your account, your account and the IDPs of the identity source, which could be active directory.

32
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,330
I supports IDPs that are compatible with either Open It Connects or Samal 2.0.

33
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:40,930
So moving on to the managed Microsoft Active Directory, this is a fully managed service on AYSO infrastructure.

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,030
You should use this when you have more than 5000 users or you have to set up a trust relationship.

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,350
It runs on windows.

36
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,740
You can perform schema extensions, works with many Microsoft applications, and you can set up trust

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,790
relationships to extend authentication from your own premises.

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:05,830
And so the actual managed back into your own premises so you can set up a trust relationship going between

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,070
those two entities on premise users and groups can then access resources in evea domain using single

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,540
sign on.

41
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,790
This requires a VPN or direct connect connection, and it can be used as a standalone active directly

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,510
in the cloud.

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,940
When used as a standalone active directory.

44
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:28,690
Users can also access third party applications such as Office 365 Free Federation, The Simple.

45
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,530
Now this is different to Microsoft and this is an inexpensive active directory compatible service.

46
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,510
So it's not Microsoft that's interaction, but it's compatible with it and has similar directory features.

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,750
It's a standalone, fully managed directory on the cloud, and it's generally the least expensive option

48
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,690
and best choice for less than five thousand users.

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,930
And if you don't need the advanced features of Microsoft, add it's actually powered by Sambor for Active

50
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,310
Directory compatible server.

51
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:03,370
And with this you can also create your own users and control access to applications on AWP, very similar

52
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,570
to the managed Microsoft ad, but it's sort of cheaper option.

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,180
And it provides only a subset of the features that you'll get with Microsoft active directory, but

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,330
that does include user accounts, groups, policies, Kerberos by single sign on and joining Linux and

55
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,750
Windows based instances.

56
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,110
So just a little more then we've got the ad connector.

57
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,900
This is a directory gateway for redirecting directory requests to your on premise.

58
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,760
It connects, eliminates the need for directory synchronization.

59
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,570
So it means that you don't have to have a domain controller from your active directory in the cloud,

60
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,050
which means you have to synchronize your credentials.

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,960
So the usernames and passwords into the cloud with add connect.

62
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,200
So you don't need to do that.

63
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,500
And it's also much simpler and cheaper than hosting a federation infrastructure.

64
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,980
So it connects to your on premise.

65
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,100
It's the best choice when you want to use an existing on premise active directory with services.

66
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,660
Now I say on premise, it could be also in SETI, but it's going to be a self managed Microsoft.

67
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,840
That territory comes in two sizes.

68
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,620
You've got the small four, up to five hundred users in the large four, up to five thousand.

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,830
And again, your VPC needs to be connected via VPN or direct connect when users log in to AYSO applications

70
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,410
and connected will then forward or proxy the sign in request to your on premise active every domain

71
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,990
controllers.

72
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,890
So just to go over these tables very quickly, remember HÃ©di Connector's, where you have an existing

73
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:41,030
active directory on premise and existing users need to be able to access resources in.

74
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,100
So ID Connector allows them to do that and it does support multifactor authentication.

75
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,990
And then simply this is the sort of cut down, cheaper version of Active Directory.

76
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,320
It does support user accounts, groups and policies and so on.

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,190
It does support Kerberos based single sign on.

78
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,010
You can also add your Linux or Windows machines to the domain.

79
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,400
But multifactor authentication is not supported.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,190
Trust relationships are not supported.

81
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,440
And then remember the free use cases here.

82
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,830
So we've got your AWG directory service for Microsoft AdÃ¨s, and that's when you have an enterprise

83
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,790
that once hosted Microsoft Active Directory in the cloud.

84
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,720
You then have add Kenexa for when your domain controller is on premises and then you have simplicity,

85
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,360
which is the sort of cutdown version of Active Directory, a sort of cheaper version that you can use

86
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
that has fewer features.
