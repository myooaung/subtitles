1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,420
Now you need to remember the three different types of IP address.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,430
So you've got the public IP address and that's what if you launch an instance into a public subnet This

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,160
is what you're going to get by default.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,780
It's lost when the instance stopped.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,230
So if you stop the instance and start it again you're going to get a new address is used in public subnets

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,230
there's no charge.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,270
And it's always associated with a private IP address.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,930
Can't move a public IP address between instances.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,380
You then have a private IP address.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,050
Every instance will have one of these.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,800
It's actually retained when the instance is stopped.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,090
And whether you're in a public or private subnet you always have a private IP.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,420
We then have elastic IP.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,850
So these are static public IP addresses and you're charged when they're allocated to your account but

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,050
not actually used.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,280
Now these can be moved between instances and elastic network adapters.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,580
So when I want to look at the different types of adapter first you've got the ENI.

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,850
And this is the logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,140
And it includes an IP address a security group can have a mac address a source destination check flag

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,910
and a description. You can create and configure its network interfaces in your account and then attach

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,700
them to instances in your VPC.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,580
And eth0 is the primary network interface and cannot be moved or detached and ENI is bound to an

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,390
availability zone and you can specify which subnet availability zone you want the ENI added in.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,180
We then have the elastic network adapter.

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,280
So this is used for enhanced networking which provides higher bandwidth higher packet per second and lower

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,170
latency.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,340
So watch out for exam questions where you need to have higher bandwidth or lower latency between instances.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,450
You have to launch this into a HVM AMI and it's only available for certain instance types.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,570
The last one is the elastic fabric adapter.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,240
So this is like an ENI but with extra capabilities and this enables customers to write applications

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,300
requiring high levels of Internode communications at scale.

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,080
Now you might see this associated with use cases such as high performance computing applications using

33
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,700
MPI and machine learning and applications using the NVIDIA collective communications library.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,700
You'll definitely see exam questions coming up around high performance computing especially in the SAA-C02

35
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,150
exam.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,190
So some of those questions or some of the answers might include different types of adapter and you've

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,040
got to make sure you know what type of adapter to use.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,500
So if high performance computing where you got tightly coupled applications that need Internode communication

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,180
that high bandwidth low latency might be the EFA that's the best choice there.

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,250
So just look at them again.

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,460
The ENI is the basic adapter for when you don't have any high performance requirements can use any instance

42
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,320
the ENA is good for use cases that require high bandwidth low inter-instance latency limited instance

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,810
types and then EFA for high performance computing, MPI and ML use cases, tightly coupled applications

44
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,230
as well.

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,520
So we also have placement groups.

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,880
And remember the three different types you got clustered where your instances are placed into a low latency

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,390
group within a single AZ. You got spread where the instances are spread across underlying hardware

48
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,140
and that can be across multiple AZs and you got the partition where the instances are grouped into

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,340
logical segments and they use distinct hardware, they're in separate racks.

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,510
You'll definitely need to remember which ones can support multiple Availability Zones.

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,740
So in this case the spread placement group can support multiple Availability Zones and the partition

52
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,920
placement group can also support multiple Availability Zones but the cluster cannot. So for IAM roles

53
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,550
in relation to EC2 instances remember these are a much better way.

54
00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:00,900
So clearly accessing services and granting permissions as opposed to storing access keys and secret

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,290
access IDs on the actual EC2 instances themselves. They're much easier to manage.

56
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,390
You can attach them at any time and you can modify them at any time.

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,800
You can only attach one IAM role to an EC2 instance at a time and remember they are universal and

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,020
can be used in any region.

59
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,850
So you only have to create the role once and you can use it in any region across AWS. For monitoring.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,280
we have the EC2 status checks and they're performed every minute and return a pass or fail status if

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,390
the checks pass the status is OK.

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,670
If one or more checks fail it's showing it's impaired the system status checks detect problems of your

63
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,780
instance that require AWS involvement to repair.

64
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,400
So that's not just something to remember that that can come up in an exam question instant status checks

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,900
detect problems that require your involvement to repair.

66
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,140
So just remember it has an instance status check it might be something that you can fix.

67
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,060
You might have to reboot an operating system you might have to stop and start your instance or you know

68
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,030
fix a network adapter problem or something like that whereas the system status checks are more likely

69
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,350
to be the underlying infrastructure that you have no control over.

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,760
You can also create cloudwatch alarms to monitor EC2 instances and automatically perform an action

71
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,650
if the status check fails.

72
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,920
And lastly we have NAT instances and NAT gateways.

73
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,950
So remember these are both a way to make sure that you can provide Internet access to instances that

74
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,750
have a private subnet.

75
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,660
The NAT instance is kind of the old way of doing it and NAT gateway's the new way of doing it.

76
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,490
The NAT instance is managed by you so you provision an EC2 instance and you have to manage it and

77
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,180
the NAT Gateway is managed by AWS.

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,880
So just to understand all of this information here in almost every case now I think NAT Gateway is

79
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,760
going to be the preference over NAT instance.

80
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,680
It's unlikely that are gonna see exam questions that push you to the NAT instance these days because

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,570
I think AWS would prefer to promote solutions that include the NAT gateway.

82
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,920
So that's it for our first exam cram.

83
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,340
I hope you learned some more information there.

84
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,610
Again remember the training notes and the ebook

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,760
we provide have even more info that you can go and review and use as last minute cramming resource.

86
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,470
This gave you some more information as well and you're now set up to answer a few questions in the quiz.
