1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,820
And the short lesson I just want to cover off a top U.S. managed and customer managed policies so you

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,900
understand the difference.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,600
So you've got the eight up U.S. managed policies.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,840
These are standalone policies that are created and administered by a W.S. so that already in your account

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,720
and pre configured standalone policy means that the policy has its own aiyah and includes the policy

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:23,950
name.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,960
Now, the managed policies are designed to provide permissions for common use cases and you can't change

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,920
those permissions.

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,620
So that defined for you and you can't modify them.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,970
The following is a list of policies that are A.W. managed.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,810
Now there's a lot of them in the console.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,610
You can see them if you go into.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,240
I am.

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,400
And look under policies and they'll have the type as a W.S. managed.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,930
So we've used quite a few of these to then add them to roles, for instance, or groups.

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,310
Some A.W. manage policies are designed for specific job functions.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,150
So you've got policies for these job functions.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,720
So administrators' data scientists, security auditors, system administrators and so on.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,270
We then have the customer managed policies.

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,500
So in this case, you create your own standalone policies that you administer in your own A.W. W.S.

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,930
account.

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,810
And these are referred to as customer managed policies.

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,780
So, again, standalone means they have their own ayran.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,040
It means that they're an entity that exists independent of what you attach them to.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,670
So you can then attach the policies to multiple principal entities in your A.W. account.

26
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,550
So both a W.S. managed and customer managed our standalone.

27
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,810
And again, that means that they exist independently.

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,640
So this is different to inline policies which only exist within the identity that you attached them

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,540
to when you attach a policy to a principal entity.

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,940
You then give that entity the permissions defined in the policy.

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,960
So this is just an example from the console on the left here.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,750
We can see from the ACTU management console.

33
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,280
We've created a policy.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,060
We've selected E.S. to all actions or resources and then as a condition in there that says that the

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,380
source IP address has to be a certain value and then that's on the right hand side.

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,060
What it would look like in Jason.

37
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,190
So those are the key things to understand.

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:17,690
And just remember that the use cases for managed policies are when you have job specific functions or

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,020
you need to use a policy for which the permissions defined in the managed policy are suitable for your

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,740
use case.

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,710
And then it might be an easy way to sort of apply that policy, and especially if you're using multiple

42
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,610
accounts so you can have some consistency between those accounts.

43
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,400
And at the end of the section, we actually cover all best practices.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,430
And you'll see the best practice in certain circumstances is to use an A.W. managed policy.
