00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,670
This is a lesson on auto scaling termination policies.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:13,820
Now the reason I have this slide up is I just wanted to set the scene so a termination policy applies

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:23,210
when auto scaling determines that it needs to terminate an instance in response to a scaling adjustment.

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:32,960
So let's say you have a step scaling policy which states that when your CPA goes over 60 or 70 percent

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,580
auto scaling should add an additional instance.

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,510
Now let's say what's happened is you your load on your application has decreased.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,270
And now auto scaling realizes that you've dropped beneath a certain threshold and it now needs to terminate

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,500
one of your instances because you don't need the capacity anymore.

10
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,670
So this is not in response to an instance becoming unhealthy.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:02,840
It's just in response to auto scaling scaling in your pool of instances to reduce cost running your

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,530
application.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,030
So the question is which instance does auto scaling terminate first.

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,870
And that's the subject of this lesson.

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,180
There are a number of policies that can be applied to determine which instance auto scaling terminates

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,870
first.

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,210
Now by default there's a default policy applied.

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,800
What that does is goes through a series of steps.

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,170
The first one is it determines which AC has the most instances.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,160
So in this case it would be simple easy to hear has free instances.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,440
So one of these will be terminated if that's not the case and you've got an even number of instances

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,420
and both your Availability Zones.

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,840
The next thing is step two auto scaling determines which instance to terminate.

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:53,720
So as to a line the remaining instances to the allocation strategy for the OnDemand or spot instance

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,870
that is terminating and your current selection of instance types.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,790
So that's quite a mouthful but what is essentially saying is it's trying to align the number of on demand

27
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,030
versus spot instances that you have.

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,370
Now this applies when you're using launch templates where you can specify a mixture of on demand or

29
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,030
spot instances doesn't apply to launch configurations.

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,410
If Step Two doesn't apply.

31
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,610
We move on to Step 3 auto scaling determines whether any of the instances use the oldest launch template.

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,440
So if there's multiple versions of launch templates auto scaling will terminate an instance that uses

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,940
the oldest launch template.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,220
If that doesn't apply Step Four says the auto scaling determines whether any of the instances use the

35
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,660
oldest launch configuration.

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,330
So if you're using launch configurations instead of launch templates it's going to look at which instances

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,220
use the oldest launch configuration.

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:54,560
Step five then applies and one step five says is after applying all of the criteria in steps 2 to 4

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,420
if there are multiple unprotected instances to terminate.

40
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,370
Determine which instances are closest to the next billing hour.

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,220
So for example if you had a situation where you had multiple launch configurations auto scaling would

42
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,460
select the instances with the oldest launch configuration and if there were multiple instances that

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,830
applies to within that launch configuration it would terminate the instance that's closest to the next

44
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,860
billing hour.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,180
Now just a note on unprotected instances.

46
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,740
This means they're not termination protected.

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,740
And we'll see this in the console in a second.

48
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,260
So I'm in the console now and I just want to show you where you can figure the termination policy.

49
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you edit the details of your auto screening group you'll find termination policies here and you

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,240
can see the default termination policy is applied.

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,400
You can then select from these different termination policies and you can actually look these up on

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,610
the Amazon website.

53
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,250
You can click learn more and find out about the configuration of these different launch configurations.

54
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,810
You won't need to know what all of these are for the exam but it's worth understanding the default termination

55
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:09,470
policy instance protection as I mentioned before is how you can protect an instance from Sky Lane.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,500
So if you select this option then new instances that are launched into the auto scanning group will

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,570
be protected from scale in events which means they can't be terminated while we're here I also want

58
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,760
to show you suspended processes.

59
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,670
This is something where you can configure auto scaling to not process certain events.

60
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:34,970
So for instance you can suspend the termination process and auto screening won't terminate instances.

61
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,510
You can suspend the replacement of unhealthy instances so it won't terminate and then replace an unhealthy

62
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,830
instance.

63
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:49,130
So if you select these options and you can select multiple at a time you can stop the auto scaling behaviour

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,530
from occurring and that might be good when you're trying to troubleshoot an unhealthy instance you might

65
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:01,060
want to go in there and terminate or shut down that instance reboot it whatever it might be and use

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,220
one auto scaling to replace it at this stage you're trying to find out what's going on.

67
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm just gonna cancel out of here and that's it for termination policies in the next lab.

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,480
We're going to cover cross zone load balancing.
