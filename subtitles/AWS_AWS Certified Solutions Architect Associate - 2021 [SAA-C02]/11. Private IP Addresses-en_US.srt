00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,970
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,020
So carrying on from the last lap.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,310
We're going to just have a quick look at private IP addresses.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,470
Now before we go on to learn about public ip addresses a bit more.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,890
So all I want to show you is I've launched an instance and the instance as we can see in the console

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,750
here has a public address but it has a private address here.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,280
So every instance will have a private address whether it's in a public subnet or a private subnet.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,570
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,880
It's always going to have one and the address is going to be from the range assigned to our VPC and

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,270
the subnet which we launched this one into.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:50,580
So if we head over to BPC and this subnet is assigned to availability zone AP SD to A and we can see

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,020
it has a site a block of 1 7 2 31 0 0 0 slash 20.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,890
And that's where our easy two instances.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,810
So we can see that this instance

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,880
is in AP southeast to A and therefore our addresses within that side to block range.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,660
You can also see there's a private DNS address which just like the public DNS address contains the actual

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,870
IP address within the first section here.

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:26,000
Now I've logged on to this instance and I just want to show you what the operating system sees.

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,100
Now remember this has a public IP address and a private IP address.

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,710
So I'm logged onto the console for the easy to instance and let's run the command.

21
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:43,360
I have config and this shows us our local interfaces and we only have one interface if zero and we can

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,500
see that it has an IP address and that's the private IP address.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,070
So there's absolutely no sign of the public IP address here.

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,160
That's because the operating system is not aware of it at all.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,120
So there's nothing about the public IP address on the instance the public IP address is external to

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,300
the operating system and NWS takes care of the association between that address and the private address

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,050
if we go back to our instance.

28
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,090
Let's just have a quick look at the behavior.

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,850
What I'm going to do is I'm going to shut down my instance.

30
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:23,720
And so just make sure you remember the address is 1 7 2 dot 31 dot for dot 1 9 2 and we'll stop our

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
instance.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,760
So the instance has stopped and in fact we didn't need to remember anything because we can see that

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,320
the private IP address is still here but the public IP address is gone.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,440
So when you stop the instance you do retain this private IP address but you lose your public address.

35
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,060
And if we start this instance back up again we're actually going to get a completely different public

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,980
IP address.

37
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,570
Just going back to the slide so that just reinforces what we knew here that we have private IP addresses

38
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,780
in public and private subnets and the private addresses are retained when the instance is stopped.

39
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,270
And this is all the operating system sees it doesn't see the public IP addresses and it doesn't see

40
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,250
the elastic IP addresses either.

41
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,220
So that's it for this lab in the next lab.

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,760
We're going to cover the public and elastic IP addresses in more detail.
