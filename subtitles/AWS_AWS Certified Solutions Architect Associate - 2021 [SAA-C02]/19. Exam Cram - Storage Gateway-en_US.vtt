00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.130
Continuing on, Sam Kram of Storage Gateway.

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.000
So first we have the file Gateway.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.100
Remember, this is about providing a virtual on premises file server, which enables you to store and

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.720
retrieve files as objects in Amazon as free.

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.300
Remember, and as free files are actually objects.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.830
But in this case, you want a file server.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.100
So that means you need a protocol like Neff's or SMB.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.920
It can be used for on premises applications and easy to resident applications that need file storage

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.810
and is free to use a flat Falsani stored directly on this free file.

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.150
Gateway offers SMB or interface NFC based access to data in Innisfree with local caching as well, and

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.130
a supports as free standard standard IÃ‰ and one zone i.e..

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.370
It supports Lynnette's clients, connects into the gateway using NSW version of three and four and Windows

13
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.390
clients connecting to the Gateway using SMB version two and three.

14
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.260
And as with anything honest free, the maximum file size is five terabytes.

15
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.500
So then we have the volume gateway.

16
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.340
So this is the block based solution.

17
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.560
So in this case, you have blocks rather than files similar to when you add a disk to a computer versus

18
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.900
connects into a file system on a computer.

19
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.080
So it's block storage using ice protocol.

20
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.700
And then we have the two modes.

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.830
So firstly we have the cash volume mode.

22
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.680
And in this case, the entire data set is stored on as free and a cache of the most frequently accessed

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.120
data is on site.

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.040
So remember, in cached volume mode, the cash is on premises.

25
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.360
We then have stored volume mode.

26
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.860
Now this means that the data is stored on premises, so the entire data set is stored on site and asynchronously

27
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.630
backed up to S3.

28
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.980
So in this case, it's taken Ebb's point in time snapshots.

29
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.090
You can have up to 32 volumes and some figures around the sort of maximums.

30
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.060
You probably don't need to know the maximum for the exam, but there they are.

31
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.770
If you want to read those, we then have to take Gateway.

32
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.550
So in this case, it's a virtual tape library that you can use with popular backup software is pre configured

33
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.810
with a media changer and tape drives and supported by lots of the well known popular backup software

34
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.980
you can choose from.

35
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.070
One of these different types for your tapes can have up to 1500 virtual tapes and a maximum aggregate

36
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.320
capacity of one petabytes.

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.250
So all data transfer between the gateway and storage is encrypted using SSL and all data stored by the

38
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.560
time Gateway Innisfree is encrypted.

39
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.640
Server side with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys.

40
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.780
So again, remember those two last points?

41
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.640
Those apply to all of the gateways.

42
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.400
So you always have SSL encryption for data in transit and then for data at rest, you're going to have

43
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.500
as free server side encryption.
