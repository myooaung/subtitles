Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,870
I just wanted to make a quick apology.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:11,050
The audio in this lab is not very good quality but I did actually record myself registering a DNS domain

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,240
name and I can't really redo that and we actually use that domain name in the labs for the rest of

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,010
the course.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,170
So I've left it in there.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,050
Hope you don't mind, see you in the lab guys. Hi guys.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,480
This is an optional lab in which we're going to register a DNS domain name using AWS Route 53 service

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,670
Route 53 is Amazon's DNS service and we're going to register this domain name so that we can use

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,170
it later on in some of the labs in the next section and other sections of the course.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,790
Now it's not essential but it is useful so if you can spare the cash then please follow along.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,340
So we're in the AWS management console.

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,170
I'm just gonna head up to services here.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:01:03,010
Click the down arrow go down to networking and content delivery and we can choose Route 53

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,890
So this is the welcome screen tells you a little bit about Route 53

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,850
So it does DNS management traffic management availability monitoring and domain registration.

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,410
And this is what we want to do right now so I'm going to click get started on the domain registration

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,180
so the moment I've got no domains I'm just gonna click up here on registered domain and you can now

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,020
search and you can choose where you want to use dot com or dot net

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,210
There are many others here.

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,490
I'm just gonna leave it on dot com and I'm going to choose dctlabs and then click on check

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,780
and it's available.

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:55,740
So I'm going to add to cart and that's going to be 12 year dollars for one year

24
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:07,210
so on this page I just need to fill out the registrant contact information and then click continue.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,760
One of the things to note is privacy protection hide some of your details and that's enabled by default.

26
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,560
I usually leave that on because you will need to put in some some details like your phone number and

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,790
your address so I filled out my contact information and I'm now on the verifying purchase screen.

28
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,350
One of the things that you'll know here is it asks if you want to automatically renew your domain.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,030
I'm just gonna leave this on enable for now.

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,440
But bear in mind after the first year you will be charged again to your NWS account when it renews and

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,550
I think you normally get an email to remind you before that happens as well.

32
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,130
So I'm just gonna click I have read and agreed to the domain name registration agreement and click on

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:58,340
complete purchase.

34
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,520
So now just says thank you and I can click on go to domains so we can now see that the domain registration

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,470
is in progress.

36
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,460
And once that's complete the domain will then appear under registered domains and that might take a

37
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,830
little while so I left there for 15 or maybe 20 minutes and I've just come back and I can see that the

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,850
dctlabs.com domain is now registered

39
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,390
You can see the expiration date and the auto renew if we come up to host in zones we can also see that

40
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,100
the hosting zone is being created

41
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,410
and if we have a look in the hosted zone we can see the name server records and the startup authority

42
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,750
records and we're now going to be at a create records we have been this hosting zone and connect them

43
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,790
to AWS resources later in the course.

44
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,850
Again don't worry if you don't want to spend the money on registering a domain you don't need it for

45
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,060
this course but it's pretty awesome if you can do it.
