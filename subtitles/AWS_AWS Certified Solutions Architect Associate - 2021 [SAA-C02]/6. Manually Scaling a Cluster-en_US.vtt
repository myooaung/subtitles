00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.670
I'm back in the ECS

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.270
management console now and what I want to do in this lab is show you a couple of ways that we can

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.230
scale our cluster.

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.250
So firstly I want to add an additional task so we have one task which has a container running in 

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.770
the WordPress container and mysql container and what I want to do is just run another instance

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.700
of WordPress so I can go into run tasks.

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.650
I'm going to choose easy to choose WordPress tool for my task definition and then we're just going to

8
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.830
choose one more task we can leave all the other defaults here and there's a whole bunch of advanced

9
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.010
options if you need to specify things like the task execution role. We don't need that for now.

10
00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.410
So we're just going to click runs task and we can see that the task has been added and it's in a pending

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.200
state.

12
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.870
So that didn't take long and it's now in a running state.

13
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.170
So we have two tasks in a running state and we can easily connect into this one and see the the WordPress

14
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.730
console.

15
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.880
But what I want to do now is actually show you how to do the same thing by the command line and I'm

16
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.550
going to clear this screen because it's getting a bit messy.

17
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.020
The command I'm going to use the AWS ECS commands.

18
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.900
Now we're using the AWS CLI and we just specify AWS ECS run task and then dash, cluster, we

19
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.660
give it the cluster name and then task definition, and we give it the task definition.

20
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.670
Now I know that I've got WordPress column for that was the most recent one I used.

21
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.520
So that's just a different revision of the same task.

22
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.680
And I just want to execute or launch one additional task so let's press enter

23
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.680
and straight away we get a failure and it says the reason is the resource memory

24
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:19.630
so if we head back to the console you remember we have to see two instances and there's insufficient

25
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.270
memory available in these in order to launch another task.

26
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.290
So what I want to do is add additional instances to this cluster.

27
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.130
So additional container instances and the way I'm going to do that is just to launch through the console.

28
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.920
So let's go to EC2 and we can see that we already have our existing ECS instances and what we

29
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.720
want to do now is add an additional container instance to our cluster we're going to go to the EC2

30
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.760
management console and we can see our existing instances.

31
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.110
Now what I want to do is capture the AMI I.D. from one of these instances and I'm going to copy that

32
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.220
to my clipboard and we now need to go to community AMI is now there's two ways to find an EMI you can

33
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.070
choose to type in ECS optimised and you'll find all these ECS optimised images.

34
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.430
So these are AMIs with the ECS agent installed or what I've just done to make sure I get exactly the

35
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.150
same version is use the AMI ID.

36
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.200
So I'm going to select we're going to configure a t2 micro.

37
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.440
I'm going to select my VPC and I'm going to choose a public subnet.

38
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.750
Now I want to use my ECS instance role here so make sure you select you.

39
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.590
I am row we're then going to specify some user data.

40
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:59.320
What we need to do to add an instance to a cluster is we need to add the ECS cluster equals and then

41
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.970
cluster name to the ECS config file which is in /etc/ecs.

42
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.160
So we just have an echo command to echo that end so make sure you modify your cluster names or whatever

43
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:22.710
you've used will then go to security groups and we can just choose web access and we can review

44
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.310
and launch

45
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.740
so that should add an additional instance to our cluster and it's going to take a few minutes for that

46
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.390
to come up.

47
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.700
I just gave that a couple of minutes and we can now see that we have three active container instances

48
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:49.510
in our cluster what I want to do is go over to our command line and I'm going to issue the commands

49
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.200
to have a look at what tasks are running so I can get the task I.D. and then we're going to start an

50
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.960
additional task using the command line.

51
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.960
Now before we do that I want to show you how you can stop a task so we can issue the command either

52
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.420
by ECS stop task, give it our cluster name, and then we need to give it the task I.D..

53
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.880
So let's take the ID of one of these tasks paste in and I think there is a space at the beginning

54
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.110
where

55
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.500
and so we should see that this has now stopped so you can see in the config here that the desired status

56
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.120
has changed to stopped by the last status was running.

57
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:50.530
If we go back and reissue our command to list the the tasks we can see that we've got a stopped and

58
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.010
an exit code.

59
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.430
What I want to do now is start an additional task.

60
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.150
What I want to do now is show you how to start a task from the command line.

61
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:10.440
So in this case we run the command AWS ECS run task and then we give it the cluster details we specify

62
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.630
our task definition and then how many tasks we want and we hit enter.

63
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.030
And so now we see that we have a desired status for this new task of running and a lsst status of pending.

64
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:31.500
And if we go back and we issue our command to view tasks we now have two running tasks each with a container

65
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.230
running WordPress in a container running mysql. Well that's it for this lab guys what we're going

66
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.060
to do now is just take down this cluster because in the next lab we're going to create a new cluster

67
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:51.950
using the AWS CLI and we're then going to attach an elastic load balancer to a service.

68
00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.040
So the command that we need to run is ecs cli down and then we do dash dash force and then cluster

69
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:07.580
config and we give it the name of our cluster and we should see now that the cloudformation stack is

70
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.010
being deleted and this will just take a few minutes and it should remove all your cluster resources.
