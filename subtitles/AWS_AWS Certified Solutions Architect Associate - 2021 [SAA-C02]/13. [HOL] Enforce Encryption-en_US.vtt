00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.410
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to have a look at the encryption behavior of Amazon that's

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.990
free and how we can use a policy to enforce encryption in the free management console.

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.240
I'm going to create a new pocket for this lesson.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.870
I'm going to call mine DCT Dash, test us encrypt.

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.420
It's going to be in us.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.040
One doesn't really matter which region now.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.640
We're not going to enable default encryption at this point in time.

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.910
We're just going to create the buckets with essentially the defaults.

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.650
Now, let's go into the buckets, and what I want to do is just prove that we can upload an object without

10
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.810
enabling encryption on the bucket, so I'll just show you how you can do that.

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.940
So we can click on Add File and then we can choose any file.

12
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.680
Maybe I'll choose this JPEG image.

13
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.360
So what I can do here is I can choose to encrypt it now.

14
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.070
We're not enforcing encryption.

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.640
We're not.

16
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.620
We haven't enabled default encryption.

17
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.230
But obviously I can specify an encryption key.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.010
So that's at the object level so we can define either through the API, the SEELYE or the management

19
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.700
console.

20
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.380
What we want to do, whether we want to encrypt our objects and if we do want to encrypt it, what do

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.500
we want to use for our server side encryption?

22
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.510
So let's say I just use the Amazon as free key and click on Upload.

23
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.530
So let's just close out of here and now if we click on the object and scroll down under the properties,

24
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.440
we can see server side encryption settings and default encryption is enabled for the object.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.480
Now, we haven't enabled it for the buckets yet.

26
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.730
So what happens instead?

27
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.530
If I go to the bucket level, let's go to properties, scroll down and let's enable default encryption.

28
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.500
So again, we get to choose the key.

29
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.650
Maybe we want to choose a CMS key and there is a default came as this one is the IWC managed key, or

30
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.730
you could choose your own.

31
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.860
Now I'm going to click on Save, and now I've enabled default encryption.

32
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.730
So this time, let's go back to objects, upload another object, and we're going to upload this beach

33
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.660
dot jpg.

34
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.840
Click on Upload so that files uploaded.

35
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.700
But we didn't specify encryption.

36
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.170
But if we go into the properties, what we should find is it is indeed encrypted and this one's encrypted

37
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.490
with SASE cams so we can set up default encryption.

38
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.920
And that's going to mean that even if we don't specify that we want to encrypt our object when we upload

39
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.840
it, it's going to get encrypted anyway.

40
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.200
Now there is another way that we can achieve that outcome.

41
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.640
So let's go back up to our bucket level ghost properties, and I'm going to edit the default encryption

42
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.050
and turn it off again.

43
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.740
So now we're not encrypting objects by default.

44
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.260
Now I'm going to need the name of my pocket, so I'm just going to copy this name and you'll find this

45
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.400
file in your course.

46
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.630
Download in the code.

47
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.070
Amazon has free directory.

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.500
Enforce encryption JSON.

49
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.380
Now, what you need to do is update your bucket name here, underresourced, and you should still have

50
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.020
the slash star at the end, so this policy will apply to objects that are uploaded to the bucket.

51
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.530
Now, this one doesn't specify which type of encryption we use, like the policy that I showed you in

52
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.460
the previous lesson.

53
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.290
All it does is just check that the X and Z server side encryption is set to true when the object is

54
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.860
uploaded.

55
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.540
So in other words, we have to encrypt.

56
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.360
The object doesn't matter which encryption we use, we must encrypt it with some kind of encryption.

57
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.670
So let's copy all of this code and back in our pocket, we'll go to permissions.

58
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.770
Scroll down to pocket policy.

59
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.820
Click on Edit.

60
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.620
Paste it in.

61
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.900
And then safe.

62
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.270
And what we're going to do now is we're going to run this command to test if we can upload without encryption.

63
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.050
So it's literally IWC as free copy for copy, the file name we want to upload and then every code on

64
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.550
signal and our bucket name.

65
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.570
So just copy my bucket name to my clipboard and type the rest out.

66
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.440
So I'm going to run IWC as free copy.

67
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.910
Give it a name.

68
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.230
I'm going to use this versioning that test dog and then I need to get my bucket name so as free colon

69
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.570
slash slash and then the bucket name.

70
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.090
So this is going to try and upload a file is going to copy this file to my buckets.

71
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.190
But we're not specifying encryption.

72
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.230
So let's see what happens.

73
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.180
We get an access denied.

74
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.730
Now the next command here we can run is an IWC free API command.

75
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.920
And this one is a put object.

76
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.420
So we're uploading an object.

77
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.450
And what we're doing is specifying the type of encryption we want to use at the end here.

78
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.310
So what would be the easiest way to fill this one out is just to copy your pocket name.

79
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.330
Put that in here and then take the file name, whatever file you're using, and you need to put it into

80
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.260
two places.

81
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.940
So where it says DashPass body and also Dash Dash key, so that command should be ready.

82
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.370
Now I'm going to copy that to my clipboard.

83
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.980
Paste it in and upload.

84
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.340
And that looks good, that looks like it has gone through.

85
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.170
Let's check on S-3.

86
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.170
So back in the management console, we've got objects.

87
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.100
Let's refresh.

88
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.130
There's a file we click on the file.

89
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.090
We can see server side encryption settings and we can see that default encryption is enabled.

90
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.780
So there's a couple of ways that you can enable encryption even at the bucket level using default encryption

91
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.610
or at the object level.

92
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.830
And then you can force that at the object level by using a policy.
