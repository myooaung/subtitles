00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.540
In this lab's about static Web sites on S3. So you can host a static Web site in a bucket

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.700
on S3.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.770
You can't use dynamic web sites or any kind of server side scripting.

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.930
Now let's look at how we do this so we're going to create a bucket called DCT static web site

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.190
and then I'm going to go into that bucket and I'm going to upload a couple of files.

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.040
Now you need an era and an index file and these are HTML documents.

7
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.420
These are very basic nothing fancy but just to show you how this works.

8
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:51.130
So then click on upload and then what we need to do is we need to enable public access for this bucket.

9
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.700
So I have the code here to do that.

10
00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.940
We're just gonna put a bucket policy in here to enable public access that enables public read forget

11
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.490
bucket objects.

12
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.840
Now if we hit save again Access Denied say you're a member you have to go to disable the local public

13
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.010
access.

14
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.750
So we're gonna go in here.

15
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.940
We're gonna disable and confirm

16
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.240
and then we can come back to our bucket policy and put it in and it's got the correct ARN and click

17
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.840
on Save

18
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:38.470
we then go to properties static web site hosting and we enable users buckets haste static web site and

19
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.830
you can see here the end point that we can use.

20
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.660
So it's the bucket name s3-Web site and then it's got the region name and we just need to

21
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.390
specify what our files are here.

22
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:04.590
So I'm just gonna confirm those names and I'm going to copy this year out in my browser so let's give

23
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.800
this guy we can open up a new tab and I'm going to paste the URL in and there we go.

24
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.990
That's what I was hoping to see.

25
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.270
So it just says "Hi this is a static Web site".

26
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.530
So that's the way you can do it.

27
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.020
And that's using the you URL you just saw which is an S3 URL.

28
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.770
You can also use a custom URL.

29
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.180
So let's do that now to do a custom your URL you actually need to name your bucket the name of your

30
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.390
domain names and mine and dctlabs.com.

31
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.010
So that's the bucket I'm going to create

32
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.440
and we're gonna go through the same procedure I'm gonna upload my index and my error file

33
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.830
I'm gonna go to block public access and switch that off.

34
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.740
Going to get a bucket bucket policy and just copy my code in again.

35
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.870
And this time I need to change the ARN so I'm going to copy the end of my bucket and paste that in

36
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.970
and we can click save

37
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.540
and we get the warning so they're very good.

38
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.740
Now making sure that it's very very obvious that you enabled public access to your bucket.

39
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.010
You know there are warnings all over the place.

40
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.840
So we've got properties and we're going to enable site at Web site again

41
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:46.420
to specify the name of your files and let's copy this URL and click on save.

42
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.160
So we should now be able to connect to this using the S3 URL and sure enough that works.

43
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.860
But what I want to do now is going to Route 53 and we're going to create a record set and it's

44
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.430
gonna be an alias and the alias is going to point towards the bucket so you can see here we have S3

45
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.280
website endpoints and it's actually found our dctlabs.com so we click on Create so let's head over

46
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.020
to a new tab now and type dctlabs.com and there we go we get the index file showing that this is

47
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.440
a static Web site.

48
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.850
So that's really yep it's very simple you just create an alias record for the alias target which in

49
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.540
this case is the Web site endpoint your bucket must be the same name as your domain.

50
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.930
So in this case dctlabs.com there's also a way of doing a redirect.

51
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.210
So if you have www.dctlabs.com as well as people coming directly to dctlabs.com

52
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.230
and there's an article on the AWS Web site which can walk you through that and I'll just put that one

53
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.430
up on the screen now

54
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.920
so if you want detailed instructions have a look for setting up a static web site using a custom domain

55
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.700
Maxwell buckets.

56
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.640
I've finished with these now so I can go in and delete the bucket and when you delete the bucket it

57
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.790
asks you to enter the name of the bucket so you have to enter it exactly as it is

58
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.990
now I'm going to do the same for the dctlabs.com bucket

59
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.820
and then the final thing for cleaning up is just to remove the record set so that's set for static web

60
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.370
sites.

61
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.590
Just one more thing to note.

62
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.640
You can also put a cloudfront distribution in front of S3 so that it can cache your content around the

63
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.510
world.

64
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.200
And that's something that we're going to cover in another lab when we get to the cloudfront section.
