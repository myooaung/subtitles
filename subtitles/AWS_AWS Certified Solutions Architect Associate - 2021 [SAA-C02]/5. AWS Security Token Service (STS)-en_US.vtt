Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.260
Another service you need to understand for the exam is the security token service S.T. Yes.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.560
So S.A.S. is a Web service that enables you to request temporary, limited privilege credentials for

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.280
IAM users or users that you will enter Kate.

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.790
So Federated Users.

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.400
So this means those users can have temporary credentials for accessing certain services.

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.540
Now, I'll show you a diagram shortly to help you to understand what that means.

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.030
A few more facts before we get to the diagram.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.610
A.W. SSD is a global service and requests go to a single endpoint.

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.550
So it's Estes's to Amazon A.W. s dot com.

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.610
And that's the HDTV PSM point.

12
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.910
Now all regions are enabled for SJS by default, but this can be disabled and the region in which temporary

13
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.340
credentials are requested must be enabled.

14
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.100
Credentials will always work globally.

15
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.440
So those are just a few facts you might need to know.

16
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.300
So let's look at an example.

17
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.770
So we have Andrea and she is in one A.W. s account.

18
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.280
Now, Andrea might need to access a resource in account B.

19
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.870
So in this case, that resource is the simple storage service.

20
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.240
So it's a storage will cover in this course.

21
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.270
And it basically means you can upload objects such as images and files to that service.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.090
So Andrea may need to access some of those files or images, but there aren't enough accounts.

23
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.080
How does she do that?

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.200
Well, one way is to use a roll.

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.360
So there's a role in Account B.

26
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.510
And Andrea is going to assume that role and gain whatever permissions are assigned to that role.

27
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.900
So that role will have a permissions policy that allows access to S3.

28
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.610
So, Andrew, Andrew attempts to assume the role, the role then talks to SD s and SD.

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.920
SDM provides limited privilege, temporary credentials to Andrea.

30
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.230
Andrea can then use those credentials to access the service.

31
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.420
So I know that's a little bit complex, but we'll be using roles quite a lot in this course.

32
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.900
So it's just good to understand what's happening behind the scenes using the security token service.

33
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.820
So I hope that makes sense.

34
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.390
And we finished with the theoretical part of this section now.

35
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.820
And the next thing is we're gonna go straight into trading our free to air account and we're going to

36
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.890
use some of the skills that you've just learned.
