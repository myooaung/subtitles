1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,860
Amazon FSx is a new storage service that provides fully managed third party file systems.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,360
Now you'll see this coming up on the SAA-C02 exam and I had a few questions on my exam when I did the

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,020
beta.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,440
Some of the design patterns that you'll associate FSx with are high performance computing, machine learning

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,030
and electronic design automation.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,070
There are two different types of file system that are available today.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,820
There's the FSx for windows file server and there's the FSx for Lustre for compute intensive workloads.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,370
So let's have a quick look at each of these different types of FSx file system.

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,890
So this is the FSx for Windows file server.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,160
And what you have is you can connect your Windows based application.

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,680
So for instance you might have two instances running Windows but you could also have on premises clients

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,090
running Windows connected over a VPN or direct connect connection and you can then talk to a file system

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,430
and that file system supports the native Windows file system features such as NTFS file systems and

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,420
ACLs, shadow copies and user quotas amongst other features and has access over the server message block

15
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,130
or SMB protocol.

16
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,950
So just as you would mount any other windows file system you're talking to over SMB, it's formatted

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,260
in NTFS and it offers you the same features of a native Windows file system.

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:41,210
Now it will automatically talk to an AWS managed Microsoft AD so you can configure your authentication

19
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,290
to happen from Microsoft AD.

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,600
And when we go through the wizard I'll show you how that's set up.

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,270
You can also set up multi AZ which means a standby is created in another availability zone.

22
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,290
I'm not showing that on the diagram but that's possible.

23
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,960
So that's the FSx for windows file server.

24
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,570
We then have the Amazon FSx for Lustre.

25
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly because I haven't worked with this service before but this

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,920
is what it is. Now

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,280
the key thing that we'll notice here first off is that we have an S3 bucket.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,610
This is key to know for the exam so you'll need to identify when to use FSx for Windows versus NSX for Lustre.

29
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,780
Now in this case you can have S3 objects in your bucket and they can actually be viewed as files

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,710
in the file system here and then you can perform your processing on that data and then write the data

31
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:41,840
back to S3. Just like with the FSx for Windows you can connect on premises clients over VPN or direct

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,310
connect connections and you can also use NSX the Lustre for cloud bursting and data migration so you

33
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,910
might be migrating your on premise data into the cloud or you might be bursting into the cloud when

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,380
you have that requirement to access extra capacity.

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,730
So that's basically what these two different types of file system are.

36
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,240
There's gonna be some more information in the exam cram at the end of the section and there's also lots

37
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,190
more information on the training notes and obviously the AWS website as well.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,930
So make sure you do know these services especially if you're going into the SAA-C02 exam.

39
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,690
Now what we're going to do now is head over to the console and we're not going to set up a full implementation

40
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,440
like this because it would require quite a lot of resources and especially with the lustre you actually

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,510
have to provision quite a large chunk of storage.

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:38,930
So it could be expensive for you but I'm gonna show you where you create your FSx file systems and we'll

43
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,920
go into the wizard and have a look around and see what the options are.

44
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,070
So I'm in the AWS management console.

45
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:52,140
Let's go down to storage and choose NSX and we can simply choose create file system and first off let's

46
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,190
choose Windows File Server. So it says here that the Windows file server provides a fully managed native Windows

47
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,980
file system so you can easily move your Windows based applications that require file storage to AWS

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,300
and we can see some additional features here that I didn't mentioned before like distributed file

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,770
system so it supports that as well as the SMB protocol, the NTFS file system type and active directory

50
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:25,670
integration so let's just choose next and we can choose multi AZ or single AZ and this will depend

51
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,910
on your region for instance when I was connected to Sydney earlier.

52
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,990
I couldn't choose multi AZ. And you'll just give it a full system name.

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,670
So myFSx and then you can choose your file system size so let's just choose the minimum size here

54
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,340
and you can then choose where to place your endpoints for your file system so you can choose your VPC.

55
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,600
You can choose your security groups, it's selected one for us and you can choose one subnet in which the

56
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,740
file system's network interface will reside.

57
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,650
So just looking back on the diagram that's why I'm showing the FSx instance as being within an availability

58
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,090
zone or within a subnet.

59
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,320
If you want to have your file system available in multiple subnets then that's going to be the multi

60
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,000
AZ feature which means it's gonna be a standby that gets failed over but otherwise the end point

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,730
is going to be within a subnet you then get to choose whether you use a managed Microsoft AD.

62
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,700
And that's going to be like we have in the diagram here or whether you choose a self managed Microsoft

63
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,340
Active Directory and in that case you're going to have to just give the details supply the details for

64
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,940
your self managed Active Directory.

65
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,050
In this case you can choose a directory or you can just chooses to use this wizard to create the directory

66
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,900
and so we actually have to set that up.

67
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,410
I'm not going to set that up now but basically after that you'll then just complete the wizard and the

68
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,730
file system will be created and then you can take your applications and connect and mount that file

69
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,440
system.

70
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,980
So we're not going to go into that level of detail in this lab.

71
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,740
What I'm going to do now is just back down and we're going to go and have a look in the FSx for Lustre.

72
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,170
Let's just choose next and again I'm just going to put something in here.

73
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:21,690
And in this case you can see that the supported sizes are 1200 gigabytes or give your bytes or two thousand

74
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,460
four hundred or increments of thirty six hundred so you know it's got to be pretty big.

75
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,240
So we don't want to.

76
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,900
We don't we want to provision this but let's just put something in for now and again you can choose

77
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,020
your VPC your security group and you can choose the subnet in which the network interface will reside

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,500
and you can see there's a note here about allowing inbound traffic to TCP port 988.

79
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:55,710
It's encrypted at rest by default using this AES 256 block cipher and we just choose next.

80
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,590
It's not going to create anything yet but it's just going to give us that summary and you can see you'd

81
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,820
then create the file system so I wouldn't go ahead and do that because you're going to be basically

82
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,780
paying for some storage here that you really don't want to pay for.

83
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,810
So I will just back out of that but that's the FSx file system.

84
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:19,080
So again it's in a single subnet the network interface for the service will actually reside in one subnet

85
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,600
key exam point here.

86
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,040
The thing to remember is whenever you see S3 being mentioned and it looks like an FSx use case it's

87
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
gonna be NSX for Lustre.

88
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,410
And if it's SMB or if it's gonna be a Windows based application then it's going to push you to FSx for

89
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:35,980
Windows.
