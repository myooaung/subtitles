00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:03,800
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,950
Up until now, we've been using public subnets, which, as you know, means that your E.S. two instances

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,140
are accessible from the Internet.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,570
As long as you have the right security group rules, you can access them over a secure shell or put

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,400
80 or whatever it is that you open up.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,880
So obviously, that's not ideal for many scenarios.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:30,320
You want to keep your servers internal in a private subnet that don't have direct access to the Internet.

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,510
And that's what we call a private subnet.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,930
So the key difference with a private subnet is that it doesn't have an Internet gateway in its roots

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,420
able.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,930
So remember, every subnet must be associated with a roundtable.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,610
Now, a public subnet has a round table that has two entries at a minimum.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,210
So firstly, you have this room, which is the site, a block for your VPC.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,810
And what that means is that all traffic.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:09,460
To any subnets that are within this side, a block are rooted locally, so that enables routing between

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,620
subnets, between public private subnets, across multiple availability zones.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,840
It doesn't matter everything within that side.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,560
A block is going to get routed locally by the VPC router.

19
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,110
The other entry in the round table is going to be the entry to the Internet Gateway I.D..

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,060
So in this case, you normally put zero zero zero zero slash zero, which means any destination.

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,220
In other words, any other destination.

22
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,170
Anything that isn't within this block.

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,690
Send it to the Internet gateway.

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,080
So any address within this block routes it locally.

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,840
Any other address outside of that route?

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,900
It's the Internet gateway and it can go out to the outside world.

27
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,960
A private subnet outside doesn't have the Internet gateway around, so it doesn't have a route to the

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
outside world.

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:03,790
Also, it's not configured to provide public IP addresses to the instances that are launched into it.

30
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,610
So if we launch an easy two instance into a private subnet, it gets a private IP.

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,010
There is no public IP and therefore there's no way to access it directly.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,830
If you're trying to manage your instance from the Internet.

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,240
So one of the ways around this is you use what's called a bastion host.

34
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:31,030
A Bastion host is literally an instance in a public subnet that you use to then jump to your private

35
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,510
subnet.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,520
So it's also called a jump post.

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,040
So even a bastion host or jump post, I think in A.W. s terminology, it's usually Bastiaan hosts,

38
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,760
but many people call them jump posts.

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,930
So what you do is, for instance, in this case, you might be these might be Linux instances and you

40
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,440
use Secure Shell and you, S.H., into this AC2 instance, you get a command line and then from there,

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,940
you, S.H. into this one.

42
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,240
And now you can manage your instance in your private subnet from the Internet or from some other network.

43
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,300
So that's the theory.

44
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,110
And we're actually gonna create this configuration in the lab now.

45
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,610
So we're going to create an easy two instance in a public subnet.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,820
We're going to create an easy two instance at a private subnet.

47
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,470
Now, we don't actually have any private subnets yet.

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,610
So that's going to be the first task is to go into the VPC management console and create ourselves a

49
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,020
couple of private subnets.

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,620
So I'm on the AWB management console in the VPC dashboard.

51
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,130
And what I'm gonna do first is I'm going to create a new round table.

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,130
So just to show you what we have at the moment, we just have our default VPC.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,800
We just have free subnets, the default subnets that are created with our account.

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,870
And those are all public subnets.

55
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,400
And you can see that because they have default subnet here and also assigned public IP here.

56
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,560
So we know that default subnets and they're going to assign public IP addresses to instances that are

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,370
launched into them.

58
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:02,060
Now, under round tables, we just have a single round table and that has the roots to side a block

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,780
local.

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,260
And the round to the outside world via an Internet gateway.

61
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,690
And you can see under subnet associations which subnets are associated with it.

62
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,240
And at the moment, we have just these three.

63
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,100
Now, bear in mind, guys, I'm taking you straight into the virtual private cloud here, despite the

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,320
fact that we haven't actually covered that in the course yet.

65
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,570
Now, the reason is I'm going to show you bits and pieces along the way so that you can build your skill

66
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,890
set.

67
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,250
And then when we get to the VPC section of the course, we're going to do more of a deep dive.

68
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,710
And you'll already understand the foundations.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,420
So be much more easy for you.

70
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,020
So let's go back to route tables, and I'm going to create my second round table and I'm gonna call

71
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,010
this artsy one.

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,590
And you associate that to a VPC.

73
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,640
We only have one option.

74
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,790
I choose creates, and that's all I need to do.

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,130
So it will have a route to the side, a block of all VPC.

76
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,590
It doesn't have any subnet associations yet.

77
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,880
There's none in the list here.

78
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,120
And what we want to do now is create our subnets.

79
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,070
So I'm going to choose create subnet.

80
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm going to call this one private subnet, one choose the VPC.

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,080
I'm going to put this one, associate this to an availability zone, AP, SD two way.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,080
So each subnet can be associated with one and only one availability zone.

83
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,860
So it's a one to one relationship.

84
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,380
And you then have to choose the side a block.

85
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,640
So how do we work out what IP address range to use here?

86
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,920
Well, let's just open a another tab.

87
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,580
I'm going to open the VPC management console in a second tab here.

88
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,930
And what I'm going to do is just have a look at these subnet ranges that we've got.

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,050
So what we have here is one seven two top 30, one dot zero.

90
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,720
And then it's a dot 32.

91
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,760
So then it's a dot 16.

92
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,210
And then it's a dot 32.

93
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,110
So I suspect the next one is going to be dot forty.

94
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,960
But I can easily put this into a subnet calculator to work this out.

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,160
So to do that, we can go over to Google and Social IP subnet calculator.

96
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,770
And I like to use this one IP subnet subnet calculator, which is on calculator dot net.

97
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,290
So what I need to do is put in my range here.

98
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,930
So let's take this address here.

99
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,180
And we know it's a slash 20.

100
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,850
So I just copy that to my clipboard.

101
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,120
Put that in and then change here to slash 20 and choose.

102
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,480
And if we scroll down here, what we can see is the network address ranges.

103
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,870
So we've got one seven tudo thirty one dot zero.

104
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,340
Then dot 16.

105
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,620
Then dot 32.

106
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,680
Then dot forty eight.

107
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,780
So what I'm gonna do is choose this one dot forty eight for my first subnet.

108
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,290
So let's come back to the VPC management console.

109
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,790
I'm going to paste this in.

110
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,240
Put dot zero.

111
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,550
And then slash twenty four subnet mask and choose.

112
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,070
Create.

113
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,110
So that's subnet one.

114
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,080
And we can then do the same again.

115
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,910
I could just call it private subnet to choose my VPC.

116
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,180
Choose to put this in to be.

117
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,800
And then what's my next range.

118
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,960
So the next one is sixty four.

119
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,290
So I'm going to copy.

120
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,790
That's my clipboard pasted in dot zero and then slash twenty.

121
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,240
Got two dots and then let's go to that one and create.

122
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,520
So now we've got two private subnets that we could keep doing that we could do that for the third availability

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,180
zone if we want.

124
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't need those so I'm just gonna leave it there.

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,680
But what we do need to do now is go to route tables and under round table.

126
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,310
We need to choose subnet associations and we need to find our subnets and associate them.

127
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,560
So we choose edit subnet associations.

128
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,890
And I can choose these two new subnets, the DOT 48 and the DOT 64.

129
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,960
And you can see that currently associated with the main round table, which is what happens by default

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,040
when you create a subnet.

131
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,870
That's to say.

132
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,070
So we now have our private subnets that are associated with a round table.

133
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,280
So what we have is two private subnets and the only thing they have in there out SABL is this side,

134
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
a block for the local VPC.

135
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:15,100
So what we want to do now is actually go and launch our public instance and an instance into our private

136
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,910
subnet as well.

137
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,690
So I many setu I'm going to launch an instance.

138
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:26,680
So it's gonna be an Amazon and it's two a.m. I t to micro as always, and I'm going to choose my public

139
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,130
subnet to a choose next.

140
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,910
And just go to our security group and we need to give this web access.

141
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,100
So again, that's for SSX.

142
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,730
We will be using the SSA protocol to connect into this instance.

143
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,770
And now I can choose launch.

144
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,600
So that's one done.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,710
Let's do the other one.

146
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,110
So the other one, it's gonna be the same, except we're going to put it into one of our private subnet.

147
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,140
So let's just put it into private subnet one.

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
And again, we're going to need to SSA into this one.

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,660
So we need to use our Web access security group.

150
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,570
And that's it.

151
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,120
We've got all instances launching.

152
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,630
So let's grab the public IP address of our instance in the public subnet.

153
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,490
And we're going to use SSA H to connect into it.

154
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,830
And so I'm going to use my public key file.

155
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,180
And that's connected.

156
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,500
So that's great.

157
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,350
So it connects connected in that instance in the public subnet.

158
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,680
So now we want to be able to connect from this instance to the instance in our private subnet.

159
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,330
Now, the question is, as you know, we've just connected by running a command and specifying our key

160
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,970
profile.

161
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,260
So as you know, the key file is security sensitive because it allows people to access your AC to instances

162
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,500
and gain root level administrative permissions.

163
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,450
So how do you connect from your public instance?

164
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,070
To your private instance, because we've used to keep our far, which we stored securely on our client.

165
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,420
But we don't have that keep our file on here, so let's just go back and see what happens if we try

166
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,090
to connect and the instance in the private subnet is only going to have a private IP address.

167
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:13,350
So let's copy that and let's go SSA easy to dash user at and give it the private IP address and astute.

168
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,970
Yes.

169
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,710
And of course we get a permission denied public key.

170
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,230
So we can't do that.

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,590
We need to be able to connect using a key profile.

172
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,260
So what we have to do is we just going to lose that connection and I'm going to clear the screen to

173
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,090
make things easier.

174
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,170
And I need to run a command.

175
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,300
And that is S.H. Dash ad.

176
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,500
And then if you're on Linux, you do Dasch.

177
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,150
See, I'm on a Mac.

178
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,230
So I do dash capital K.

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,530
And then we specify the key per file and it says that the identity is being added.

180
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,890
And that means that we can now connect without having to specify the keeper file, but also we can configure

181
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,850
agent forwarding.

182
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,580
So you do SSA dash a.

183
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,960
And that's a capital way, and then you do.

184
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,400
Easy to dash user.

185
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,680
At and then let's just go back to the console and we're going to need the public IP of our public instance

186
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,400
and we connect, so we're connected in that instance now.

187
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:19,660
And what we can do this time is let's just go back and get the private IP address of our private instance.

188
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,370
And now we should be able to SSA each to the private IP address.

189
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,470
And there we are.

190
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,230
We're actually in.

191
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,290
So that's how you do agent forwarding.

192
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,170
And that allows you to be able to connect from your Bastian host to your instance in a private subnet.

193
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:42,370
So just to summarize what we've done, we've created a private subnet, which is a subnet in which instances

194
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,380
do not pick up public IP addresses.

195
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,650
And they they have a round table that doesn't have a route to the outside world via an Internet gateway.

196
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,810
We've then created a Bastion host, which is a jump post in our public subnet.

197
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:02,490
And we've used that to connect using agent forwarding for our keeper to an instance in the private subnet

198
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,570
so we can now manage that instance.

199
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,300
So that's pretty cool, guys.

200
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,850
One of the things that you might have noticed is, though, we are able to connect to the outside world

201
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,070
from our public subnets going outbound.

202
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,720
We can't do that from our private subnet because we don't have an Internet gateway.

203
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:27,550
So if we go back to the console and I just do ping Google dot com, it's just going to fail and we're

204
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,860
going to see that we got 100 percent packet loss.

205
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,920
So we don't have a path to the outside world.

206
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,450
And that's going to be the subject of the next couple of labs where we're going to look at how we can

207
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:37,930
do that.

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,190
And there's two ways.

209
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,840
One is called a net instance and one is called a net gateway.

210
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,700
And we're going to cover both of those in detail.

211
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,750
See that, guys?
