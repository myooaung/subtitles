00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.100
The first rousing policy against coverage the simple routing policy were a simple routing policy and

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
a record is associated with one or more IP addresses.

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.810
And then it uses round robin to just cycle through the addresses that it returns.

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.630
It doesn't support health checks so health checks are quite an important feature to determine whether

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.110
your services are actually alive and well.

6
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.130
So they're quite useful as a limitation of the simple routing policy that you can't do that.

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.850
You can have multiple values for a single record.

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.500
So here we have simple DCT labs dot com with a record and it has two possible values.

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.450
And then we have simpler DCT labs dot com which only has one and obviously time to live is quite standard

10
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.870
for all records.

11
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.590
So let's just go back to the console in fact first what we want to do is let's just take the IP address

12
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.050
of one of our instances.

13
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.280
I'm taking the one in Singapore but it doesn't really matter and let's go to hosted zones DCT labs dot

14
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.240
com and I'm gonna create a record set.

15
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.890
So in this case I'm just gonna call it simple and I'm gonna set a TTL 60 seconds and I put my IP address

16
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.420
in.

17
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.080
And here we see routing policy and it's just setting simple by default.

18
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:35.770
So I'll click on Create and now if I go back to a command prompt running on my computer I can do Digg

19
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.960
and put in simple DCT labs dot com and it's going to return that IP address.

20
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.560
So that's really it.

21
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.550
Very very simple record site.

22
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.340
Now if I were to go back and add an additional record let's just put in a made up record like 1 1 1

23
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:07.450
1 and I can then go back to my command prompt and run Digg again but it still shows me now remember

24
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.140
the time to live.

25
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.080
So you'll have seen before we had a time to live a sixty.

26
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.700
It's come down to 30 now so if we just wait a little bit longer we should then find that we get a new

27
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.780
record.

28
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.640
So let's just try once more now

29
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.030
and it seems to be counting down.

30
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.740
And so now we get a brand new TTL of 60 seconds and this time we get both records so that's it for simple

31
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.030
routing policy.

32
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.310
Just remember that it doesn't support health checks.

33
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.430
Is that something that could come up on the exam.
