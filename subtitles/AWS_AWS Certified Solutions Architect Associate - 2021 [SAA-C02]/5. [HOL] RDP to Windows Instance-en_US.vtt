00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.320
In the last lesson, we connected to our Linux instance using secure shell with Windows, we use something

2
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.860
called the remote desktop protocol RTP.

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.120
So let's look at how we can connect to our easy to instance running windows.

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.580
Back in the management console, I'm going to select my windows instance, and what we're going to do

5
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.660
is click on Kinect and we're going to choose our clients.

6
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.210
Now the interesting thing here is that we first need to get the password.

7
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.820
So we need to choose get password.

8
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.390
And it's going to ask us for that keypad file.

9
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.870
So I'm going to choose browse and I'm going to select the file that we downloaded, which is Cloud Lab

10
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.490
Dash Envy, DHCP PCM.

11
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.840
Choose the file upload and then click on Decrypt password.

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.960
So now I have the password, so I'm going to copy that and paste it somewhere so I can use it in a moment.

13
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.920
Then what I'm going to do is just copy this public DNS name.

14
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.650
Now you can download a remote desktop file as well, but I'm going to do it manually and show you how

15
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.720
to do it on my Windows computer.

16
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.720
I'm going to go to the search box and type deep and will find the remote desktop connection.

17
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:26.210
Now, if you are using Linux or Mac, you'll need to search online for ADP and you'll find an ADB client

18
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.140
that you can install.

19
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.010
So in this case, on Windows, it's preinstalled for us.

20
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.530
What I need to do is enter the computer name and here I'm going to paste in the DNS name that we got

21
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.400
from the console.

22
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.650
Then for username.

23
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.670
I'm going to enter administrator and then let's click on Connect and it's going to ask me for the password.

24
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.460
So what I'm going to do is paste the password, which we got from the console and then hit Enter.

25
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.050
I'm going to confirm.

26
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.070
Click on.

27
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.520
Yes.

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.900
And in a moment, you'll find that you get connected to your windows instance in the IWC data center.

29
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.580
And that's it.

30
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.080
We're now logged on to our Easy to Windows server in the US data center.

31
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.220
So that's it for this lesson, and we finished with these instances now.

32
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.430
So to make sure we don't eat into our free tier credits too much, we're going to go back to the IWC

33
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.370
management console and terminate these instances.

34
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.930
So back in the IWC management console, we're just going to select our two instances we can go to instance

35
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.120
states and then terminate instance.

36
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.400
Now when we do this, it will completely terminate and delete these instances.

37
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.290
That means that any data stored on their hard drives will be gone forever.

38
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.240
So that's it.

39
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.770
We can see that they're now in a state of shutting down, and it won't take long, and they should then

40
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.630
change to a terminated status.

41
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.350
So that's it for this lesson.

42
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.870
I'll see you in the next lesson.
