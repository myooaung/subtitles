Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to look at how we can use lifecycle rules to manage our objects.

2
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.660
I'm back in history, I'm going to choose my DCT cloud storage bucket and then go to management.

3
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
And here we can create a lifecycle rule.

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.540
So the first rule I'm going to create is simply going to be called transition current.

5
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.900
Now you can choose to limit the scope of the role using filters like a prefix, or you can choose all

6
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.470
objects.

7
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.360
I'm going to choose all objects.

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.690
Now we've got some rule actions here.

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.560
We can transition current or previous versions, expire current versions or permanently delete previous

10
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.130
versions.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.660
And we can delete expired delete markers or incomplete multiple uploads.

12
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.890
Now what I want to do for this rule is maybe I want to transition the current versions of my objects

13
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.400
only.

14
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.950
So let's say that after a period of, let's say, 30 days, I want to move my objects from standard

15
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.670
to standard, i.e. because I know that they're less likely to be used after 30 days for this particular

16
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.570
use case.

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.580
So that's my first transition.

18
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.740
Now, maybe I also know that after an even longer period of time, maybe after 90 days, there very,

19
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.390
very rarely, if ever used.

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.570
So maybe at that point I can archive the objects completely and we can see there is a per object cost

21
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.470
for this transition.

22
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.940
I have to acknowledge that.

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.840
I understand that.

24
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.060
So that's my rule.

25
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.100
You can see it shows you what's happening to current versions versus previous versions.

26
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.970
So if the current versions D0, the object gets uploaded after 30 days, it gets transitioned to Standard

27
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.920
II and then after 90 days, the object's transition to glacier.

28
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.190
So let's create that rule now.

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.680
Maybe I want another one, this one I'm going to call expire.

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.370
Previous.

31
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.980
Again, it's going to be for all objects.

32
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.520
But this time what I'm going to do is permanently delete the previous versions of objects, and I just

33
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.960
need to specify days.

34
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.000
So now have 30 days.

35
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.520
So after 30 days, those non-current versions, the previous versions will be deleted.

36
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.820
So now I have a couple of rules so you can create multiple rules and then you have to work out, you

37
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.420
know, what are the effects of actions going to be on my objects?

38
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.540
Once you've created rules, these are enabled.

39
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.610
You have a couple of options whereby you can disable a rule or you can delete it.

40
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.780
So perhaps we don't need to actually transition any objects.

41
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.320
So let's just go ahead and disable these rules.

42
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.540
And that's it.

43
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.930
That's really all there is to the actual configuration of lifecycle rules.

44
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.970
You just need to understand what you want to do, and then it's quite simple to implement it.
