IWC VPN and Cloud Hub is not actually a service that you can go and find in the IWC console, what this

2
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:19.900
really is is a pattern and architectural pattern that you can use when you utilize the IWC site to site

3
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.070
VPN technology.

4
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.690
So let's have a look at the architecture in which you can implement Cloud Hub.

5
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.910
So we've got a VPC and we've implemented a virtual private gateway of GW and that's obviously deployed

6
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.170
on the IWC sites.

7
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.840
We then have multiple customer offices.

8
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.470
All of these could be customer data centers, but they're different on premises environments that we

9
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.880
want to connect using a virtual private network to IWC.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.640
Now, the way that we connect them in a cloud hub topology is using a hub and spoke model.

11
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.440
So in other words, IWC is the hub, the VPC and then the spokes go out to each of these offices.

12
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.780
So what we do is we deploy a customer gateway into each of these offices.

13
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.470
Each of these customer gateways has a unique BGP asset, and that's a border gateway protocol.

14
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.670
Autonomous system.

15
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.090
No.

16
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.860
So BGP is a protocol that you can use for advertising routes to different parts of your network, and

17
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.370
each environment has its own ascent.

18
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.560
And that corresponds with the routes that would be advertised into the network.

19
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.970
So the IP prefixes.

20
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.820
So you must have a unique BGP asset for each of us, and then we can establish a VPN connection between

21
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.410
each of those customer gateways.

22
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.710
And the same virtual gateway on the U.S. side.

23
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.760
Now, network traffic can originate from an office and go to the VPC or the VPC back to an office.

24
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.810
But also, it can go between the customer offices or the customer on premises environments, whether

25
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.670
their offices or data centers.

26
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.650
So the customer office here can communicate via the VW.

27
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.140
So this customer office here?

28
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.930
So we're using the IWC site to site VPNs to establish a routing topology, which connects multiple customer

29
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.570
offices, as well as the VPC itself.

30
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.450
Now this is using IP set VPNs, the same VPNs as we just looked at in previous lessons.

31
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.410
So that's it.

32
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.730
That's VPN Cloud Hub.

33
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.470
As I mentioned, if you go around looking in the IWC console, you won't find cloud hub.

34
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.780
But if you actually do a search online, you'll find some articles about this architecture, which can

35
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.270
give you a bit more insight as to how it's set up.

36
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.360
But basically, we're just connecting multiple customer gateways to a single virtual private gateway,

37
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.020
and then it's up to you to configure your BGP protocol accordingly to advertise the routes that you

38
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.330
want to advertise into the network.

39
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.030
So that's set for a quick overview of cloud hop.

40
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.650
I'll see you in the next lesson.
