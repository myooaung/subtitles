00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.270
So this is a quick lab just to discuss AWB start connect gateway so remember this slide from the last

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:15.440
lab and this is an AWB Direct Connect connection and what you can do with Direct Connect is you can

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.740
establish a connection from your corporate data center into VPC.

4
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.810
Now this is within a single region you can connect using multiple private events to multiple pieces

5
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.130
within the region.

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.780
But if you want to connect to other VPC in other regions around the world from this connection then

7
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760
that becomes a bit more difficult.

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.470
So what we need to do then is use an AWB Direct Connect gateway so a direct connect Gateway is a globally

9
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.310
available service which enables you to then create a private if into the direct direct connect Gateway

10
00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:01.420
and from there you can then create private shifts to your VPN gateways in VIP season in different regions.

11
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.770
Now alternatively you can actually connect that to a transit Gateway which we talked about earlier in

12
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.460
this section

13
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.510
so I'll just head over to the console and show you where you can configure Direct Connect gateways.

14
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.620
So under the AWB direct connect you can see we can create a direct connect connections here modify our

15
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.930
virtual interfaces in our L.A. jeez you have transit gateways at the bottom.

16
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.340
Virtual Private gateways and then you go in the middle here you got your Direct Connect gateways.

17
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.110
So all of those different services come under the AWB s Direct Connect console and we can't really create

18
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.090
this in a lab unfortunately but this is where you would go to create that configuration

19
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.680
so for the exam just remember that if you need to connect using private that's so private IP address

20
00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.690
spaces globally and it's a use case for Direct Connect e.g. it's something along the lines of low latency

21
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.890
high bandwidth dedicated network connection but you need to better connect over private IP address spaces

22
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.330
globally then you might be looking to a direct connect gateway as the answer.
