00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:09.560
Within us, ayam, we can actually configure identity providers and federation, and what this means

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:17.090
is we can configure within Iame the ability to have our users come from another identity source.

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.360
So rather than creating users in Iame, we might have users that are in active directory now.

4
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.490
We might also use social providers and this is more for mobile applications now.

5
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.580
When we're talking about a directory service such as aid, we're using something called Samel, and

6
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.650
when we're looking at these social providers, we're using what's called open connect, and that's also

7
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.840
known as Web Identity Federation.

8
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.790
Now, I mostly recommend that you use a USB cognito for this use case, but you can also configure this

9
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.270
through Iame as well.

10
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.830
So in short, what we're talking about is having our identity so our user accounts in another service

11
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.430
that are able to then log on and have permissions to AWB resources.

12
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.270
And so this is done using SAML 2.0 and you can connect to any Samwell two point zero compatible LDAP

13
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.490
source in this case its active directory.

14
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.920
But it could be some other LDAP database.

15
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.110
So Helda if you don't know it stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

16
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.660
Active Directory is built off of LDAP.

17
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.150
Alhadeff is what you use to be able to query the information in Active Directory, and there are other

18
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.090
similar databases out there that do very much the same thing.

19
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.350
So once users are authenticated and authorized, they can then access A.W. services.

20
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.220
So that's the key thing is you want your users from Active Directory to be able to authenticate to Adewusi.

21
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.090
You don't want to have to create another account for them in IAM.

22
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.930
So let's have a look a bit more data about Web identity providers and federation.

23
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.800
So we have an identity provider.

24
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.270
You can manage your user identities outside of Adewusi and give these external user identities permissions

25
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.070
to use resources in your account.

26
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.850
So an example is that your organization already has its own identity system, such as Microsoft Active

27
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.950
Directory, or you're creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWB resources.

28
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.830
When you use an Iame identity provider, you then don't have to create a custom signing code or manage

29
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.590
your own user identities, the identity provider does that for you.

30
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.640
And external users sign in then for a well known IDP's, such as log in with Amazon, Facebook or Google,

31
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.910
and you can give those external identities permissions to use AYSO resources in your account.

32
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.570
Using identity providers helps to keep your account secure because you don't have to distribute or embed

33
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.040
long term security credentials such as access keys in your application.

34
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.170
And from a customer's perspective, from an organization that's using us, it's also an additional security

35
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.540
because they only have to create their identities in one place, which means they manage their identities

36
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.220
in one place.

37
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.890
They only have one set of usernames and passwords to manage.

38
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.210
So to create an IDP, you create the IAM identity provider entity to establish a trust relationship

39
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.940
between your account and the IDP.

40
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.610
And IAM supports IDPs that are compatible with Open ID Connect or Samwell 2.0.

41
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.030
So that's it for the ferry.

42
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.960
I'm just going to take you into the management console and we're going to see how you would configure

43
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.200
an identity provider.

44
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.350
I'm in the management console in identity and access management.

45
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.720
If you just come down to identity providers and here you can create a provider and then you choose the

46
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.090
time.

47
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.280
So Samal would be then your active directory and you've got to give it a name and you need a metadata

48
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.790
document.

49
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.530
Now, we're not going to create any of this.

50
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.010
I don't have an active directory to configure here.

51
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.270
It wouldn't prove an awful lot anyway.

52
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.980
I suppose I could show you how users could then authenticate when I was service, but it's probably

53
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.180
more than you need to know already.

54
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.370
You just need to understand what identity provider is, what the options are that are available.

55
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.250
So the other option is open.

56
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.060
It connects.

57
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.570
And in this case you have a provider URL and an audience.

58
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.480
So that's it.

59
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.540
Just remember, this is another option.

60
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.030
You know, we've got a single Sinon, we've got the eight of us directory service.

61
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.850
These are all different options for how you can configure where your identities are and how they're

62
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.690
able to authenticate even in a sort of single sinon way or just by being able to allow your users on

63
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.600
premise to authenticate into a single Adewusi account.

64
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.410
So there's a few different tricks that you need to understand and you need to understand for the exam

65
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.760
which one you would use in a specific scenario.

66
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:10.350
So I would say remember that for mobile applications, when you want to add, sign in and sign up configuration

67
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.210
for a mobile application, typically you're going to go with cognito.

68
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.810
You're not going to use the Iame identity provider.

69
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:27.310
Now, efore you need to do is to authenticate your users from on premise into a single AWB account.

70
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.310
That's something where you could use this.

71
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.840
So you would use the Samuell and you would configure the source as the active directory of the organization.

72
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.390
And that will enable users of that active directory to then be able to have permissions assigned to

73
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.820
them to access Awassa resources.

74
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.260
And then if you are going to give access to multiple accounts, you might use a single sign on instead.

75
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.520
And database to actually service is something we're going to cover in another lesson.

76
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.780
There's quite a lot to learn there, so I'll leave that one for now.
