1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:10,370
We're now going to talk about network AC ls so network access control lists known as network AC Ailes

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,530
or Nichols for short are different to security groups in several ways.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,320
Now we've used security groups extensively up to this point in the course but we haven't modified the

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:28,310
network AC yells at all but we've been relying on the fact that the default network ACL allows our traffic

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,320
between subnets.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,850
So let's explore that in a bit more detail.

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,490
A network ACL functions as a firewall at the subnet level.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,920
It's actually hosted on the BPC router so you remember that we have a VPC router which is responsible

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,810
for routing traffic between our subnets so any traffic that leaves one subnet goes through the VPC router

10
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,080
before it goes into another subnet.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,300
So the network ACL is hosted on the BPC router and logically is associated with the subnet networK AC

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,540
yells filter based on ingress traffic.

13
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,870
So traffic coming into the subnet and egress traffic traffic going out of the subnet so inbound and

14
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,860
outbound essentially

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,120
and network ICL is associated with a subnet not with an instance.

16
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,760
So that's one of the key differences between a security group and a network ICL.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:41,180
Another is that your network ACL has allow or deny rules so you can specify allow or deny rules.

18
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:48,020
Whereas with you remember with a security group you only have permit rules or allow rules so you specify

19
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,300
the traffic that you want to allow and that traffic is then accepted.

20
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,530
And if you don't have a rule allowing that traffic it just gets dropped by default which is what we

21
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:07,510
call an implicit deny so of a network ACL instead you have a list of rules and the rules are processed

22
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,580
in order from the first to the last and you'll see when we go to the console that they're actually no

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,530
I don't show it in tables here but they each have a number.

24
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,090
So you might have one hundred and then one hundred and one or two hundred two hundred and one and so

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,200
on.

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,230
And I'll tell you a bit more about how eight of us recommend you.

27
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,040
No.

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,140
Your rules shortly so they're processed in order.

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,560
And what happens is as soon as a allow or deny is reached.

30
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,320
That's basically the end of the processing the traffic is either accepted or it's dropped.

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,580
And we'll see how this works.

32
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:51,910
So just to compare two security groups again if you remember if we have a security group a it really

33
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,450
doesn't matter.

34
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,390
These these are VPC levels so it doesn't matter where you instances reside if you have a permit rule

35
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,970
in that security group that says that the instances can talk to each other then they can communicate

36
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:11,760
directly whether they're in the same subnet or in different subnets now as they do that they're actually

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,430
reliant on the fact that the network ACL is set up correctly because otherwise the traffic which goes

38
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,070
between subnets must exit via you through the network ACL that's hosted on the to and then into and

39
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:34,590
be processed by another network ACL as it comes into the other subnet so you do need a rule to allow

40
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,290
that traffic of course with security groups if instances communicate directly with one another within

41
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,390
the subnet then nothing ever goes to the network ACL so it really doesn't matter what you have configured

42
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,020
here these these two instances will be either talk to each other

43
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,520
now before we head out to the console let's just have a look at the default network ACL so just as with

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,600
security groups your VPC will come with a default knuckle and you can then create custom knuckles and

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,030
the key difference is this.

46
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,680
So with a default on that there is an allow rule for any protocol from any source and if you have IP

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,140
six enabled you will have two rules one for IP before one for IP B6 and this is inbound and outbound

48
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,930
however custom natural if you just create it and save it.

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,090
This is what you're going to get.

50
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,780
You just get a deny.

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,850
So as soon as you associate this with a subnet no traffic will be able to go into that subnet or out

52
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,940
of that subnet so that's very important to note.

53
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,220
Now each subnet can be associated with one network ICAO only.

54
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:59,590
However you can have multiple subnets associated with a single network ICAO.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,720
Now let's just before we go to the console we're going to look at one more slide.

56
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,270
So I just want to make it very clear to you the differences between security groups in network AC ls

57
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,450
so security groups they operate at the instance level and that specifically at the network interface

58
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,990
level whereas a network ACL operates at the subnet level with security groups you have allow rules only

59
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,320
and with network ACLU you have allow and deny rules a security group has state full whereas a network

60
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,460
ACL is state less and we just go back over to hear what that means is that if you have traffic coming

61
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:43,470
into your subnet and the network ACL allows that that the return traffic going back must also be allowed

62
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,720
there has to be a rule in the network ACL that allows the port protocol to go back out again that's

63
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,640
different to security groups where as long as it's allowed inbound whatever outbound connections go

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,960
back or allow by default

65
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,320
a security group evaluates all rules whereas a network ICAO processes the rules in order until it reaches

66
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:14,430
a permit or deny and a security group applies to instances only if they're specifically associated with

67
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,060
that group.

68
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:23,640
Whereas a network ICL applies to every instance that's within a subnet that that network ICL is associated

69
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:23,820
with

70
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:38,440
so let's go to the console and what we're gonna do is we're going to just head over to easy to and we're

71
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,420
also going to bring out the VPC console so it's kind of easy to and what we're gonna do is we're going

72
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,040
to launch a couple of instances

73
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,020
and the first one I'm gonna go to.

74
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:59,060
I'm gonna put this into my VPC so this is the custom BPC we created in this part of the course and I'm

75
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:08,150
gonna put this instance in public to a I'm gonna select my I am wrong and then I'm going to take the

76
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,730
code and hopefully you followed through this course from the previous section.

77
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:20,540
If not you'll find this code within the course downloads and what it essentially does is cause the bash

78
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:30,380
interpreter updates packages installs and enables Apache and then it uses a couple of s free for objects

79
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,140
that we upload it to a bucket and it essentially just updates an X indexed or hasty metal file with

80
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,140
a name that it pulls at random from this file.

81
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,090
So let's continue.

82
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,220
We're going to configure security group choose web access which gives us access H and we're going to

83
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,790
launch

84
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,740
and we're going to do the same thing now in to be.

85
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,900
So we're going to just put this instance into TV and actually we we don't need to install Apache on

86
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,130
this one so let's just put this one in public to be and we don't need to change that rolls or add a

87
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,940
new user data

88
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:25,620
so we can choose web access again view and launch and launch.

89
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,760
So while those are launching let's head to the VPC management console and have a look at network AC

90
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:39,570
sales so you can see here the default network ACL and this top one is the one that's associated with

91
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,940
the custom BPC we created.

92
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,460
And you can see it's associated with all six subnets

93
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,310
and you can see that allow all that I talked about and it's rule.

94
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,570
So the format the IWM suggest is that you leave big spaces between your numbers so that you can I suppose

95
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,110
fill them in with other rules later down the line so they suggest that you start with 100 and then you

96
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:12,420
do 200 and 300 and then the patent seems to be that you then use the next number for the IP B6 version

97
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,010
of that rule.

98
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,280
So you have one hundred one then two hundred and two hundred and one and we have the same of outbound

99
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,340
it's identical you have allows and then there's explicit denies at the end.

100
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,460
So the rules would be processed in order until they reach a deny.

101
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,500
And in this case the traffic will be allowed because it says any protocol any port any destination and

102
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,650
we can associate administrator here.

103
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:48,210
So let's go ahead and create a test and ICL just gonna call it that and put that in the VPC and let's

104
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,800
have a look at the rules associate of this.

105
00:09:50,790 --> 00:10:00,980
So as we can see you only have to deny rules there are no allow rules and the same of outbound.

106
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:09,840
Now what I want to do is go over to the council and I want to take the IP address of my instance that's

107
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,890
in to be.

108
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:20,790
So not this one that's into wireless connect to the instance into B so I'm in the console and I'm going

109
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,750
to SSA into this instance

110
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:36,990
and we're in and I'm now going to go back and get the private IP address of this other instance which

111
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:46,180
is the instance that's in to a I remember it's the instance into why that actually has a patchy install.

112
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,790
So what I should be able to do is what I want to be able to do is to ping this instance.

113
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,580
But first we need to go back and allow it us in the security groups.

114
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:04,690
So let's just head back over to the VPC management console and that's choose our security group and

115
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:12,710
we only have association this one at the moment so I'm going to create one that says all ICMP V4 and

116
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:21,450
another one that's allowed HDTV which is there it is.

117
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,650
So we're just going to allow any address range.

118
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:34,280
So going to save those rules head back to the console and that's try to ping the private because I'm

119
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,160
going to go back and copy my IP address again.

120
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,490
So let's just go in and copy the IP address and then we're going to ping the IP address of the other

121
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,430
instance which remember is in a different subnet and that's fine.

122
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,900
And then we should be able to curl that instance and you'll see that the index or hasty mail file displayed

123
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,490
at the bottom there we can see that the names we've got.

124
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,670
Hi this is colony so that's the name that was given to that instance.

125
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,500
So that all works fine.

126
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,590
Now let's go back to VPC management console and we're gonna go to network AC yells.

127
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:21,110
And so what I want to do is I'm going to associate this network ACL with to a subnet so that's where

128
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,670
our web server is sitting and I click on edit.

129
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,980
So now we only have five subnets associated with the default ACL and we have one subnet associated with

130
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,510
the new custom ACL.

131
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:42,140
So remember that's what happens when you Associates a network ACL because you can only have one network

132
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,900
ACL associated per subnet.

133
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:51,020
So we don't have any allow rules so the expected behavior would be if we tried to rerun those commands

134
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,620
it doesn't work and sure enough we're not getting any response.

135
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:03,310
So let's go back over and what we're going to do is we're going to edit the inbound rules and we're

136
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:15,260
going to allow and let's choose all ICMP and we're going to put that as well 100 from any source and

137
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,290
then we're going to allow HDTV

138
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,580
and we're going to put this one is following the protocol.

139
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,510
Let's put those two hundred and again that's any source.

140
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,610
So let's go by we've created those rules.

141
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,840
Let's go and try again and we're not getting any response still.

142
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,680
So I've tried the ping I've tried the curl and we're not getting any response from our web server.

143
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,760
And of course that's because this is a state less firewall.

144
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,940
It's not a state for firewall like a security group.

145
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,830
So we have to go to outbound rules and we need to add the rules in here.

146
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:07,460
So let's put in rule 100 ICMP before and allow and then rule one hundred and paste ETP and that is being

147
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,890
allowed as well.

148
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,100
Excuse me I need to change up to 200 click on save.

149
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,150
And now let's go back and see what happens.

150
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,410
So we'll run the ping and that's great.

151
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:24,410
So we've now got traffic going in both directions and let's try running curl.

152
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,910
And that's not working.

153
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:35,270
So the reason being if we go back to our rules we have an inbound rule and that allows ICMP V4 and an

154
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,800
outbound rule that allows ICMP V4.

155
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,450
Now this is a protocol level.

156
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,290
It's not a port level.

157
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,520
So it doesn't matter what port the traffic comes back as as long as it's in ICMP packet.

158
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:53,150
It's allowed now with haste ETP we're sending data one direction to our Web server and it's heading

159
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,830
the web server on port 80.

160
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,760
But the return traffic doesn't come back on port 80.

161
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,050
It comes back on an ephemeral port and a federal port is a high number port.

162
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:11,350
So we're going to put in a custom DCP rule and we're going to put in 10 24 to sixty five 5 3 5.

163
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,510
And that's that's the range which most federal ports sit in.

164
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,290
And it really depends on your operating system.

165
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,020
But we're going to use this and I think this will work just fine.

166
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,280
So we.

167
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,230
So what's essentially happening is the traffic hits your web server and port 80 but the return connection

168
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,890
that comes back is on a port somewhere within this range.

169
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:37,860
So we just need to allow that return traffic and we can come back here and hit kill and now it works

170
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,950
just fine so another thing you can do.

171
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:50,320
Network ACLJ is you can apply the new rules and what we need to do for a deny role is make sure that

172
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:59,020
the rule is reached before and allow rule because these are processed in order and the first allow or

173
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,020
deny that's reached is process and nothing happens after that.

174
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,200
So what we need to do is we need to make sure that our deny rules if you want to deny a specific source

175
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:16,180
for instance are higher in the list of rules than ours open allow rules and I'm going to show you an

176
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,870
example of that.

177
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:26,710
So let's just go over and to our instances and I'm going to take the public IP address of our instance

178
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,480
into a which is this one

179
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,790
and I've opened a new terminal window and what I'm gonna do is just ping that instance from my clients.

180
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:48,250
So I have a I'm going to Mac working at home and I can ping this instance by the Internet.

181
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:54,540
Now what I want to do is I want to block traffic from my IP address.

182
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,060
So the way I can do that is I can come in here and I can add a rule.

183
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,700
Let's just put this is 300 that says all I see NPV for now.

184
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:13,190
I could specify my source IP address here but if I did it there the allowed rule would still be reached

185
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,640
first.

186
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,090
So let's just try that.

187
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,030
So we put in the IP address that I have on the Internet click on site.

188
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,970
And let's go back and ping and sure enough that traffic is allowed because the rules are being processed

189
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,620
in order.

190
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,010
So let's just go back and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to copy this

191
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,930
up into the one hundred rule.

192
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,470
And so what I said is that this IP address and the slash 32 means this exact IP address you could put

193
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,120
in a range if you like.

194
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,420
So we've put in our source address with our slash 32 to to say this exact type pay address and what

195
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:58,770
we want to do now is change this to deny and click on save.

196
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:08,450
And so what I want to do is try and ping that address and it's a file and let's try again to reach that

197
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,070
address via curl.

198
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,580
So this is trying to reach the web server in port 80 and that's fine so that works okay.

199
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,810
Whereas pinging doesn't.

200
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:31,740
And of course that's because we have a deny rule for ICMP but we have an allow rule for port 80 TCB

201
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:42,510
so that's it for network AC ls what we're going to do is we're going to go back into our default network

202
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,250
ICL here.

203
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:54,210
I'm just going to re associate public to a and then we now have no associations and we can delete that

204
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,620
network ICL and the only other thing to do is just delete instances.

205
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,670
So let's just terminate our instances.

206
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,910
So go back to the slides you know key things to remember BPC rounds are actually hosts the network AC

207
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,150
ls but they're logically associated with subnets they process traffic that's coming into ingress or

208
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,540
out of egress the subnet so they don't affect anything it's within the subnet.

209
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:31,990
So if you see questions around around blocking access for instance between instances within a subnet

210
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,270
then that's a security group it can't be a network ICAO again after exam questions you might get say

211
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:42,340
that you want to deny a specific IP address from sending data.

212
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,730
So I remembered the nine rules are allowed to network ICL but there's no such thing with security groups.

213
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:56,350
So you've got to work out the differences between how you might be able to implement that solution.

214
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,150
So that's it for this now guys.
