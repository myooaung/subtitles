Hi, guys, this is another orientation video for console changes, this time for Amazon excuse me,

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.940
so excuse me, has also undergone quite a few changes.

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.130
Again, most of the settings are the same.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.380
It's just a different look and feel.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.450
So let's go in and create a queue.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.270
And I'm just going to create a standard queue.

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.010
I'm going to call this my queue.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.480
And then you'll notice that you've got some options here for the configuration that we're going to go

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.160
through all of this in the section.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.810
So and these are different.

11
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.480
So this is no different to in the old console.

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.500
The settings are the same.

13
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.760
It's just the layout.

14
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.830
We then had the access policies, encryption, dead letter cues and tax settings.

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.330
Now let's just create this queue.

16
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.670
So once you created the queue, there's a few settings here you can configure S.A.S. subscriptions,

17
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.820
Lamba triggers dead letter queues, you can monitor your queue, configure tagging, access policies

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.510
and encryption.

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.060
Now, the key thing I wanted to show you is how to send and receive messages, because we are going

20
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.560
to be doing that in the hands on in the section and is a little bit different.

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.200
So up in the top right hand corner here, you can click on send and receive messages, will then enter

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.360
our message body.

23
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.470
So I'm just going to put it in text message and then we can send that message.

24
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.720
And there are additional attributes here.

25
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.160
So four additional attributes.

26
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.750
You can expand this box.

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.790
Let's click on Send Message.

28
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.470
The message has been sent and now we can pull four messages in the bottom part of the screen here.

29
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.840
So this is our Receive Messages section.

30
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.650
Let's click on poll for messages and the message turns up.

31
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.610
We can then click on the message, choose, view details and view information about that particular

32
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.060
message.

33
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.470
And we can go in and see the body here and any attributes that we've defined.

34
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.630
So that's it's not hugely different.

35
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.540
It's just a little bit confusing when you first go and try and work out how you can send messages manually

36
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.190
and then poll for messages.

37
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.810
Now that we've finished with this message, I'm just going to go in and delete the message and that's

38
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.110
gone.

39
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.640
So I hope you find that useful.

40
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.140
And I'll see you in the next lesson.
