1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,510
We're going to talk a bit more now about hosted zones.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,990
So let's go to the console and I mean the round 53 dashboard and I have one hosted zone.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,200
Now if you watch the lamps from Section two you'll see me create this and you might have even created

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,260
one of your own.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,390
So I actually went and registered a domain name on the video.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,500
So I have this one public domain name.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,470
This one hosted its own excuse me and within there the only records I have at this stage are the start

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,240
of authority record and the name server records.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,430
And then we can then go and import records or create records sets.

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,000
So simply it is a hosted its own is a collection of records.

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,480
Now if we go back to hosting zines we can actually create hosts of songs from here.

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,180
And what I'm going to do in this lab is I want to show you what a private hosted zone is.

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:08,670
So this is used with VPC and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to call this DCT private dot com

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:22,190
and what I need to do now is choose my region and your VPC will need to be enabled for DNS host names.

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,650
So it tells us here you have to have enabled DNS host names and enabled DNS support configured on your

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,910
BPC.

17
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,470
So I already have that which is why those two pieces are showing.

18
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,820
So let's click on Create

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,260
and so I now have these records.

20
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,360
So what I want to do now is go to easy too and I'm actually going to launch a couple of instances and

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,730
then create some records for them in that private zone.

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,710
So I'm just going to choose to launch two instances and I'm going to put them into

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,200
my custom BPC and they're going to go into a public subnet and that's really all I need to do.

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,390
I just want to click free to the security groups choose my web access so I can access H into one of

25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,490
these instances and then launch.

26
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:29,710
And while these instances are launching I just want to copy that public IP addresses and I'm just pasting

27
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,080
them somewhere.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,060
And what we'll do then is create a couple of records

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,060
right.

30
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,210
So let's go back over to round 50 free

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,560
and I'm going to go into my private Hastings zone and create a record set and the first one I'm going

32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,040
to call app and I'm going to paste one of my IP addresses in there.

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:05,430
So it's just Apple DCT private dot com and I'll click on Create the second one I'm going to call D.B..

34
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,650
So let's consider that these are DB servers and our app service

35
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,830
and I'm going to click on Create.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,940
So what I want to do now is just secure a shell into one of those instances and we're just going to

37
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,910
see if we can resolve these domain names

38
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,250
so I'm at a command prompt now and I'm going to SSL each into one of these instances

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,420
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to I don't know which one this is but let's just ping DCC DB

40
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,310
the DCT private dot com and we'll get a response.

41
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,920
Of course we're allowing ICMP within the security group.

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,660
So that's why this works.

43
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,560
And then let's just change that to app and we get a response again.

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,840
So very very simple.

45
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:18,550
We could also run Digg and we could do app or DCT private dot com and we'll see that we have in the

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,690
answer section here the IP address and we could do the same for D.B.

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,260
and we get the IP address of the DB server.

48
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,210
So very simple guys just wanted to show you hosted zines.

49
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,080
I want to go.

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,800
We will kill these off because we're going to launch some other instances with a different configuration

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,950
seen for the rest of them for the exercises in the rest of the lab.

52
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,380
And I'm also going to go back to around 50 free.

53
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,400
Now you do pay a small charge.

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,220
It's not much.

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,300
It's like 50 cents a month or something for a private for us for our hosted zone in general.

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,800
So you might as well get rid of your private hosting zone if you don't need it anymore.

57
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,950
And I think it's going to warm up before I get there I'll just go and delete the records say it will

58
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,730
tell you that you have to delete your records and that is your records other than the NSA and SLA.

59
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,480
So you have to delete your records.

60
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,140
You can go back at that point and delete your hosting zone

61
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,650
so that's it for this lab in the next lab we can talk about DNS records.
