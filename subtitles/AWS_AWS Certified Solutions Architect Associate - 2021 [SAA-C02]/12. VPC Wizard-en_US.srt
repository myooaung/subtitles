00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,320
In this lab I want to show you the VPC wizard.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,960
So you now know how to create your own VPC manually and that's probably the way you're going to do it.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,860
Most of the time however it's worth knowing that there is a VPC wizard which automates part of that

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,940
process.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,160
And it's also worth noting for the exam because there are some questions that come up sometimes which

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,610
ask you about the configurations that are created through the VPC wizard.

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,580
So if you come in here you get a few options.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:41,230
You can select VPC with a single public subnet and it will create a slash 16 network with it.

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,350
So it's a slash 16 side a block that is with a 24 subnet.

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:53,080
So a single subnet and public subnet instances use elastic eyepiece or public eyepiece to access the

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,500
Internet.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,860
So it's basically just creating a public subnet and we know exactly what those are.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,810
And then if you collects click select it will just ask you to define your own site a block you can choose

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:11,510
to use IP B6 and you can specify Availability Zones and subnet names and so on.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,680
So that's very simple.

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,980
Then there's the public and private subnets.

17
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:24,250
So in this case you get two subnets you still get the slash 16 network and you get a public subnet and

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,160
a private subnet and the private subnet instances access the Internet via net.

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,770
So what that would actually do then is create a NAT gateway for you.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,200
So if you have a look in here you can see it's all very similar except we have the private subnet as

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,070
well.

22
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,540
And then we have the NAT gateway and it's going to ask for an elastic IP

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:57,690
so the third option here is VPC with public and private subnets and hardware VPN access.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,700
So this is the same as the previous one except that we connect the corporate data center using a virtual

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,850
private network.

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:13,010
So let's select this option and what you'll see in here is very similar let's just give it a name so

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,700
that we can get to the next screen.

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,340
And then when we click next it's going to ask us for the customer Gateway information

29
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,800
so I'll cancel out of that one and this is go back to the ABC wizard and then the last one is a VPC

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,230
of a private subnet only and hardware VPN access.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,920
So in this case there's no connectivity via the Internet.

32
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,140
So this is other VPN is obviously an encrypted connection that goes over the Internet.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,100
But what I mean is nothing is addressable by the Internet.

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,860
So as a purely private subnet and you're able to then round data between your corporate datacenter and

35
00:02:52,860 --> 00:03:01,170
that private subnet without any public exposure so very simple just need to know it's there it's under

36
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:08,240
VPC dashboard not under you'll be pieces so you'll find the wizard here and you just understand that

37
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,790
different options in the Wizard and what configurations they create.
