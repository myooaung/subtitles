1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,510
And this lesson, we're going to look at what we need to do to to find the side of blocks, we're going

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,080
to use a few of the rules and guidelines and best practices.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,400
So first, with the rules and guidelines and these come from IWC, these side a block size can be between

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,120
a slash 16 and slash 28 subnet mask.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,490
It cannot overlap with any existing side, a block that's associated with the VPC.

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,520
And you cannot increase or decrease the size of an existing site a block, so you must get it right.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,980
From the beginning, the first four and last IP address are not available for use.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,860
So you've got to account for that when you set the size of your subnet because you want to make sure

9
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,250
you have enough addresses for your instances that you deploy.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,620
IWC recommend that you use sider blocks from the RC 1918 Rangers, remember these are the private IP

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,380
ranges and that's these addresses.

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,520
And of course, these give you plenty of scope, so that shouldn't be a problem.

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,770
Now let's have a look at an example.

14
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,200
So let's say I have a BPC side, a block that looks like this.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,100
It's 10 zero zero zero with a 16 bit subnet mask.

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,620
So that means it looks like this 10 000 slash 16.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,990
So that's the overall block of addresses.

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,420
But now we want to create a subnets.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,260
So what we need to do there is we're going to take some of the bits from the host portion here and assign

20
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,150
them to the network portion.

21
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:46,570
So maybe we're going to have 10 zero one zero slash 24, and that means we borrowed all eight bits from

22
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,270
that third octet for the network side.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,960
So your VPC subnets will have a longer subnet mask than the slider block that they come from.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,320
Now, in this case, it's a 24 bit subnet mask.

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,290
Now what's the next network?

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:09,400
The next network is 10 zero two zero slash 24, and then the next one is 10 zero three zero slash 24.

27
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,630
So each of these subnets is going to have up to 254 potential hosts.

28
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,730
But of course, you have to take away a few from that number, so take away five from that number.

29
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,440
And that's how many addresses you have remaining for your active instances.

30
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,690
So as long as you're happy with that number of instances per network, which is quite a big number still,

31
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,680
then this is a good and very simple range to use.

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,770
Now let's go through a few additional considerations.

33
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,270
You got to ensure you have enough networks and hosts.

34
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,290
You really don't want to mess this up.

35
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,410
You only get to set this side a block once and then you're stuck with it, so make sure you plan correctly.

36
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,960
Bigger slider blocks are typically better.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,210
It gives you more flexibility down the road.

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,930
Smaller subsets are OK for most use cases.

39
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,810
You don't need thousands of instances per subnet.

40
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,150
Consider deploying application tiers per subnet.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,330
So if you have a free tier application, you might have different subnets for each tier and you might

42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,250
have it as highly available across multiple availability zones as well with a subnet in each A-Z.

43
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,730
So that's a good way of getting that high availability and resilience into your workload.

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,330
Now VPC pairing, which we're going to cover a bit later, is where you connect your VoIP sees so that

45
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,360
you can route directly between them using private IP addresses so you don't go out to the public internet.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,620
Now it's really essential that you don't have overlapping side blocks.

47
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:47,160
So in other words, you can't have the same side a block in to VPC and connect them with VPC pairing.

48
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,870
So even if you're not doing pairing now, just remember this because you might need to do it in the

49
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,380
future.

50
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,190
You want to make sure your site blocks don't overlap, and this is across all the and all regions and

51
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,970
all accounts.

52
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,530
So make sure you get it correct.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,450
So in general, just avoid overlapping sites blocks as much as possible.

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,770
Make sure you consider this when you're designing your IP address ranges.

55
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,140
So let's go back to an example.

56
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:21,120
Let's say we have 10 zero zero zero slash 16, so that's outside a block and we create a series of subnets.

57
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,350
Now each of these subnet has a 24 bit subnet mask, and as you can see, we're separating them into

58
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,550
public and private subnet in different availability zones.

59
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,250
The private subnet to have a private round table and the public ones have a different round table.

60
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,650
Of course, the main round table for the public, Subnet said, will have an internet gateway, and

61
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,900
those subnets will also assign public IP addresses to the instances that are launched in them.

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,250
So that's a bit of fairy behind it and some practical examples here.

63
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,220
I also want to show you a very useful tool that helps you to plan out your side of blocks and your subnets.

64
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,870
I'll attach a link to this tool to the lesson.

65
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:09,320
Now what we can do with this tool is specify our side of block and see the subnets and we can actually

66
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,960
the tool will help us to work out which subnets to use based on the number of networks we need.

67
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,860
Subnets or the number of hosts per network.

68
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,330
So let's stick with the example and put in 10 zero zero zero and then subnet mask.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,540
We're going to scroll down to slash 16.

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,780
Now I want to have subnets with at least 250 full hosts.

71
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,260
So that would be a standard Class C network.

72
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,930
Now let's have a look what we get.

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,250
So let's click on Create.

74
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,840
And it gives us all the subnets with a 24 bit subnet mask that fit within the side block.

75
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,630
So we've got the zero subnet here.

76
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,740
And then all the way down, we get to the very last subnet, which is two five five.

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:06,110
So that's two hundred and fifty five subnet so that we can have and each of those subnet can support

78
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,450
up to 254 hosts.

79
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,970
Of course, the VPC will actually reserve a few addresses so you won't get that many, but you'll still

80
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,340
get close to 250.

81
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,860
So that's a really nice tool to use to help you to work out what your subnets are going to be within

82
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,120
your a block, and that will also help you to determine the best site of block as well.
