Hi guys we're now going to cover Amazon MQ Amazon MQ is another message broking service.

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.770
And in this case it uses Apache active MQ which is open source software.

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.010
So the key use case is going to be for where companies have applications on premises that are using

4
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.440
Apache active MQ and they want to migrate their applications into the cloud and they don't want to

5
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.220
reengineer their message broking service.

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.240
You see questions like that in the exam Amazon MQ is likely to be the solution for solutions that

7
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.660
are being developed developed within the AWS cloud.

8
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.870
There's still a lot of advantages to using SQS and one of them is going to be that SQS is priced

9
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.060
based on the amount of requests and the data transfer charges.

10
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.710
So it's very different to the pricing model that you can see here with Amazon

11
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.880
MQ Which is using instance sizes so you're actually provisioning instances on EC2.

12
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.340
So this is a service that requires instances whereas SQS is more of a service a service where you're

13
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.420
paying just for the resources used.

14
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.170
So very different pricing model.

15
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.210
But again those use cases around existing applications using Apache active MQ are going to be the

16
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.120
ones which you see on the exam that might point you towards using Amazon

17
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.950
MQ You can click on the learn more link here and it gives you a bit more information about the pricing

18
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.190
and an overview and so on.

19
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.280
So we're not going to go into a huge amount of detail detail on MQ.

20
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.030
I don't think it's going to come up a lot.

21
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.320
I know that you're going to be expected to know details of the architecture of Amazon MQ but let's just

22
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.530
click on the Get Started link and see what we've got here so you can choose to select a single broker

23
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.660
or an active standby broker.

24
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.260
Let's just choose a single instance broker and then you get an option to use some sample blueprints

25
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.320
let's just choose the one that says mesh network of single instance brokers and click next.

26
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.270
So now you get to call this something so let's just call it my mesh network you get to choose your instance

27
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:19.380
size let's just choose the T2 micro and then you can put in a use a it's just called MQ user and I'm

28
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.410
going to put in a password and then we can just click on deploy and we now get a message telling us

29
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.950
that the brokers are being created and a cloud formation stack is being created.

30
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.230
So I can head over to cloud formation and let's just have a look at what's going on so we can see my

31
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.480
mesh network is being created and let's head over to resources and see what's being created for us and

32
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.830
we'll see a security group is being created.

33
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.820
We've got three brokers being created and they're in progress.

34
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.530
So it's been quite a few minutes it took 15-20 minutes to set this all up looks like it's pretty much

35
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.700
complete.

36
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.460
So let's head over to the Amazon MQ console and we can see that we have all three message brokers running.

37
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.870
Now they did come up before and then went down for a reboot and that took another several minutes.

38
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.380
But everything appears to be available now.

39
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.050
And if you click on the message broker you can see some important information and some of that is the

40
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.550
end point so you can see the four different types or the five different types of endpoints available

41
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.360
here and you can just scroll down and see the network connectors.

42
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.170
You can edit the configuration and change the broker engine and change the configuration and enable

43
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.610
cloudwatch logs and you can choose whether minor version updates are automatically installed.

44
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.860
So that's really all I wanted to show you just a very brief overview just to show you how you set it

45
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.700
up and get you to understand how this is different from SQS.

46
00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.120
So clearly we now have three EC2 instances running to create this configuration whereas with SQS

47
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.940
you're just going to pay for the messages that are put in the queue and in some cases the data transfer.

48
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.340
So definitely very similar to rescue us in many ways.

49
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.890
But you're you're going to use them in different scenarios.

50
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.260
So just remember SQS for cloud native applications that are built in AWS whereas your Amazon MQ

51
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.920
could be for you existing on premises or applications that you're moving from some other cloud. Now to

52
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.210
close all this down

53
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:39.320
we can simply go into our stack and choose Delete and it's going to delete the stack for us if you have

54
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.250
created this just make sure you go back in and ensure that your resources at the least.

55
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.740
Because these may or may not being free,  actually I believe they are in free tier because we chose

56
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.720
the T2 micro instance.

57
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.830
But again you got three instances running so you want to make sure you got everything shut down.
