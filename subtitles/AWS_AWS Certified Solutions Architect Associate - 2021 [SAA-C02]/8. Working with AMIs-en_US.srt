1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,120
We have these two snapshots that we created earlier of a root and a data volume and all I want to

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:17,460
show you here is how you can create a image or an AMI from one of these snapshots and we can also go

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,520
in and create a volume from the snapshot and choose which availability zone.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,890
And that would just create an EBS volume or we can go in and copy it and we can copy to another region

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,610
or the other option there is.

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,540
And interestingly actually when you go into here you can see that you can optionally encrypt the snapshot.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,020
Go into all that and a lot more detail later in this lab.

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,830
But for now let's look at creating an image.

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,530
So this is creating an AMI.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:58,680
So let's just call this DCT labs AMI and you can choose the device name and you can choose various

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,960
other things around which type of hardware virtualization you use that ram this guy the kernel ID

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,740
and so on and we're just going to leave that defaults.

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,110
We could also use these snapshot idea of the other volume to actually add that in here so we could press

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,600
start in and just search for it and add the second volume in but we don't need to do that for now.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,720
So let's just click on Create and what we should now find is that we have an AMI here so if we go into

16
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,790
instances and you can see that it's very quick because it's actually using that snapshot.

17
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,040
So it does require that snapshot to be available because the AMI links back to the snapshot.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,130
So if we go into launch an instance now we can choose my AMIs and we can find our AMI in here and

19
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,940
then because it's an AMI we can then choose we're free to do whatever we want.

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,290
We can then choose to put it in any availability zone we like.

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,570
So I'll put it into to see where we haven't had any volumes or snapshots or we haven't had any volumes

22
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,930
or instances running in that availability zone.

23
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:10,950
So let's just click Next we can see the configuration and the snapshot I.D. which is the snapshot there's

24
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,920
some EMI backs off which is the same snapshot that we created earlier on so I'm just gonna go and choose

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,570
my security group and launch.

26
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,130
So that instance is running now and I've copied the public IP.

27
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:32,410
So let's just go over and secure shell into this instance so that's the instance is up and running and

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,730
we should be able to find our data directory there it is.

29
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,860
So you know we won't find anything in it if we change the slash data but at least we did create that

30
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,160
directory so it shows that we're using, we've booted off that snapshot.

31
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,000
And if we'd had any data in there that was local to that root volume we'd see it in this case we've

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,900
just got the Mount point that we use for the second volume.

33
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,710
So that's us using an AMI within the region.

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,960
Let's now look at how we can copy the AMI between regions so it can now simply go in here.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,840
Copy AMI and choose another region.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,140
I'm going to choose Singapore and click copy AMI and we could again encrypt the snapshot if we wanted

37
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,500
to.

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,810
So that's going to copy.

39
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,500
And by the way there'll be some transfer charges for integration transfer here.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,700
So if you do this you might incur some charges so here we go we can see this is pending and the data's

41
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,180
in process and that's being transferred.

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm actually just gonna kill this off because it's not really going to prove much but what I would be

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,090
able to do once that's complete is go in here and choose my AMIs and it would be available to me.

44
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,110
So that's how you can copy AMIs between regions and launch from them.

45
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,810
And the way you get rid of an AMI is you deregister it.

46
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,600
And if I do that it just deletes it.

47
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,110
And in this case we can see the snapshot which it was also copying across because remember that AMI

48
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,520
is backed by a snapshot.

49
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,400
So we can see that it's copied the snapshot across.

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,480
So let's also delete the snapshot

51
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,470
and now we're clear.

52
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,030
And so now want to go back and see the Sydney region

53
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:25,750
and I can go up and shut down my instance will terminate my instance and we finished with these two

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,810
now so we're just going to delete out these EBS volumes

55
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,190
and I'm going to keep these snapshots because we might work with these in the next labs but I can go

56
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,500
in and just deregister my AMI.
