Hi, guys, welcome to this lesson.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.900
This lesson is about the IWC client VPN, so it is exactly what it sounds like.

3
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:22.140
This is a way that you can connect your client computer to the IWC data center to a VPC via a VPN connection.

4
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.270
So a virtual private network connection.

5
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.530
So let's say you've got a computer which is Windows or Mac or Linux.

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.670
You're able to set up a client connection from there into a VPC, and that means you're then able to

7
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.460
communicate with resources in that PPC.

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.710
So you might be able to connect to an easy to instance directly using private IP addresses.

9
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.630
Now, of course, it's a virtual private network, so that does mean that it's encrypted as well.

10
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.280
Ends end.

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.630
So let's look at how you set them up.

12
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.520
So here we have a region in that region, we have a VPC with a couple of subnets.

13
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.930
Now we create a VPN endpoints and the VPN endpoint is associated with subnets.

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.460
So the client VPN network interfaces are created in the subnet, and that is the method by which the

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.210
VPN connection is then able to communicate with resources in the subnets because there is an association

16
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.850
between this network adapter that's provisioned into the subnet and the VPN endpoint.

17
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.160
We then have the client computer and that's going to be running some VPN software.

18
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.450
The VPN software is not IWC software, so you need to choose one of the available options.

19
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.710
There's lots of free options in the hands on.

20
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.590
In the next lesson, we're going to use OpenVPN.

21
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.330
The client software will establish a connection with the VPN endpoint over SSL, TLS support for for

22
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.490
free, and that's going to be via the internet.

23
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.230
The VPN endpoint will actually perform source network address translation from the side, a block that's

24
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.930
associated with the VPN client to the side to block that's associated with the VPC.

25
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.840
And on the client side, if you look at your routes able, you can run a command on windows, which

26
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.530
is route print, and you would then see your route table and you'd be able to see that you have a destination

27
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.590
for the site, a block of the VPC and a gateway which is pointing at the VPN endpoints.

28
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.220
So that's the theory behind how a client VPN works.

29
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.450
Again, this is an encrypted connection over the internet from your computer, so your computer is then

30
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.150
able to communicate using private IP addresses over to your instances in your subnet within your VPNs.
