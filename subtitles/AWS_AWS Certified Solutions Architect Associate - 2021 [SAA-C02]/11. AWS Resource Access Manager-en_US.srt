00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,540
Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'm going to cover AWB Resource Access Manager.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,620
Now, this is a really exciting service because it lets you share resources between AWB accounts.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,650
So what you can do is you can share certain resources.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,530
And there's a list of them on this Web page that I'm looking at now, and you can share them across

5
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,220
accounts.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,900
So this could be really useful in lots of different use cases.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,370
So let's have a look at what services you can actually share so we can see Ammash, Amazon and Rora

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,190
Code build Ekta Easy to image builder license manager resource groups and round 53.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,130
And then if you go to one of these you can see a bit more detail which types of services within these

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,440
categories you can actually share.

11
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,350
So for instance, you can share transit gateways, subnets, dedicated hosts and so on.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,960
And what we're going to do in the lab in this lesson is I'm going to show you how we can share a subnet

13
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,020
between two different accounts.

14
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,760
So this is the diagram.

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,470
And in this diagram, we have two accounts.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,360
So let's say on the left here, we have accounts which could be your development environment.

17
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,670
And then let's say we have a test environment on the right here, which is account B.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,780
So in this case, what I want to do is I need my instances in this public subnet and it could be a private

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,620
subnet as well.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,430
It doesn't matter.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,860
But I want my instances here to actually be able to communicate using private IP addresses to my instances

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,990
in my other account here.

23
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:47,780
So we've ram I can actually extend this subnet the same subnet into account B.

24
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,490
So that's what we're going to do in the lab now, so let's go to the management console and what we're

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,010
going to do is go to resource access manager, which is under security, identity and compliance.

26
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,570
Now, a couple of things before we get started.

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,620
You can see I've actually deleted a couple of subnets that I shared when I was testing go down to settings.

28
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,660
And if you're going to use an AWB organization, you need to enable sharing here.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,190
You'll see what I mean in a minute.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,870
So you might want to do that first.

31
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:25,190
Also, if you are using Adewusi organizations, just head into the council for organizations and then

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:33,650
what you need to do here is head over to settings again and then just scroll down and you might need

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,610
to enable access for resource access manager here as well.

34
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,610
So once you've done those things, let's come back and we're going to go to resource shares and we're

35
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,400
going to create a resource share.

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,920
So I'm just going to call this shared subnet and it's going to be free for me because I've already created

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,730
a couple and I'm going to choose a public subnet.

38
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,070
So I'm going to choose public to I only because it's going to make the lab a bit easier for you guys

39
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,060
in terms of connecting to your subnet, to your AC to instance in your subnet, so that you can prove

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,020
that the lab works.

41
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:19,420
So I can now come down here and for Awassa organizations, I can show organization structure now, otherwise

42
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,350
you just put in the account side.

43
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:28,420
So if you don't have an organization, you can just put in your account ID of your second account here.

44
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,310
And if you don't have a second account, just watch along and I'm going to show you what Resource Access

45
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,360
Manager is anyway.

46
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,980
If you do have one and it's in an organization, you can come down and choose it here.

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,420
So I have two that are called Digital Cloud Training Lab, so I'm going to.

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,370
Choose to share with this second account here.

49
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,000
So then I come down and I choose, create resource share.

50
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:02,160
And that's it, I've got my Shadd subnet shared and what will happen is in my other account now, I

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,100
should be able to find that shared subnet.

52
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,150
So this is the management console for my second account.

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,910
I'm going to go to resource access manager and let's see resource shares.

54
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,700
And sure enough, I've got shared subnet free.

55
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,200
So that's been shared with me.

56
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:23,370
And if I click on that and I can actually go into that subnet and I can see the configuration for that

57
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:23,830
subnet.

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,850
So there it is.

59
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,210
Now, I'm just going to turn off the new VPC experience for now just to make things a bit clearer and

60
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,840
cancel.

61
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,370
So that's my subnet and it's been shared.

62
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,510
So what I want to do now is I'm going to go to Ekta and in EC2 I'm going to launch an instance.

63
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,430
So I'm just going to choose Linux.

64
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,940
And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to change and you'll find that I've got a second VPC.

65
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,100
So on this account I only have one VPC, but now I can see a second VPC and it says it's shared and

66
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,450
then there's just one subnet.

67
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,410
So we can see that AP switched to a subnet has been shared.

68
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,410
And I'm just going to remember that I'd say the subnet ID ends NCEA eight.

69
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,070
So that's my subnet that's just go forwards and we're going to put it in a security group.

70
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,290
Now I have SNH on this one and also ICMP.

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,020
So let's just launch and what I'm going to do is head back to my other account.

72
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,020
So this is where I'm also going to launch an easy to instant's.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,370
So let's launch an instance and I'm going to find that same VPC, which I know is this one here, and

74
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,690
this is the subnet that I want to put it into.

75
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,980
So it's the same subnet that I just shared across accounts to select the existing security group.

76
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,930
Got to choose the right one hand.

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,300
This is the VPC and again, I've got SNH in this one.

78
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,970
And so I'm going to launch and I don't need ICMP in this one.

79
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm just going to ping one direction.

80
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,880
So I'm going to ping from this instance to the other instance to prove that I can connect to it over

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,420
the same subnet, but from two different accounts and we're going to ping using the private IP address.

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,900
So it's been a few minutes.

83
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,440
Let's try and log in to our instance.

84
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:26,940
So I'm just going to copy the public IP to connect to the instance and let's just use S.H. So I'm connected

85
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,730
in and I just need to go and get the IP address of my other instance.

86
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:40,470
So my second instance is this one running in account B and I'm just going to copy its private IP here

87
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,040
and then let's ping and hopefully yeah, we've got a response.

88
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,590
So that's exactly as expected.

89
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,770
What we've done is we've got two accounts.

90
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,230
We've shared a subnet from Account A to account B.

91
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,260
We've then launched an instant in each subnet.

92
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,040
And what I just did then was connect to this instance and then ping this instant here using a private

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,850
IP address.

94
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,860
So that shows that we've now got that private access that we want between these two accounts.

95
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:18,720
By putting the instances on the same shared subnet, you can use IAM policies to control access to RAM

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,770
and your resources.

97
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,560
And by the way, this does not cost anything.

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,780
So there's no cost to sharing a resource.

99
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,860
And you can always stop sharing a resource at any point in time as well.

100
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,430
So that's it for this lab.

101
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:37,990
All I'm going to do is just go back and terminate my instances and those are the things that are costing

102
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,290
money.

103
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,590
And then you might want to go back in and delete your shared subnet as well once you've got rid of your

104
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,290
instances.

105
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,100
So I hope you enjoyed that lot.

106
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,840
Guys, this is a really exciting, so very, very useful for lots of different use cases where you want

107
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,140
to share certain resources between different accounts.
