1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,720
I'm in the AWS Management Council and we can find AWS Organizations under management and governance.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,850
If you don't have an organization already created then you just see the splash screen and you just choose

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,970
create organization and there's really nothing else that you need to do here.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,970
You just choose create organization and it'll create the first organization for you.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,750
And I actually have the accounts in the console here so you can see digital cloud training labs.

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,720
Now if you choose organize accounts this is where we can see a hierarchy.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,390
Now in this case we don't have anything.

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,640
We've just got the root.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,110
But you can now create your hierarchy in here and you can also see policies.

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,790
So we've got service control policies and tag policies.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,380
And if we choose each one of these we need to enable it first so enabled service control policies and

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,010
then I'm going to go into tag policies and enable tag policies.

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,710
Now what I want to do now is we're going to add another account.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,450
So the way we do that is we actually going to invite an account.

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,070
You can say you can create an account as well but we're just going to invite an account and I'm going

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,650
to put in the account number and just choose invites.

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,420
And what will happen is the invitation now gets sent and we need to go to the other account and accept

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:29,710
that invitation now what'll happen is you'll be emailed a invite to the e-mail account that's associated

19
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,050
with that account that you've just invited.

20
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:39,130
Now I've looked into that account on a number private browsing window and I'm just pasting in the

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,350
URL that I was given in the email I received.

22
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,680
So you could just click on the link and the email and what I need to do is I've got to log into this

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,160
account.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,450
So this is DCC labs 2.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,790
And now that I'm logged in.

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:58,870
We can see that I have an invitation from another account that DCT training labs.

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:05,470
And so now that I'm logged in we can see that we have an invitation to join an organization from digital

28
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,020
cloud training labs.

29
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,550
So I'm just going to choose accept and confirm.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,010
And now the DCT labs 2 account is also associated with the same organization.

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,830
So if I come back over to here and let's go back to accounts and the screen's refreshing and we can

32
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,590
now see that we have two accounts and they both have the same name.

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,370
But these are definitely two different accounts.

34
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,230
So what I want to do now is set up the organization with an organizational unit that I'm going to put

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,390
the DCT labs 2 account in seeing and the service control policy here.

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,180
So first off let's go and create the organizational unit.

37
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:53,000
So we're going to head to organize accounts to click on the group and then you can create a new organizational

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,510
unit.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
And I'm just going to call this OU1.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,710
So now we have the you I'm going to choose the second account and I'm going to move it into a new one.

41
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,500
So if we now go into that OU we can see that we have this second account.

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,790
So that's the structure set up we now need to create a service control policy that denies people from

43
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,490
the ability to launch instances other than the T2 micro.

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,970
So I'm going to show you where to find some service control policies.

45
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,820
So let's just search for service control policy examples.

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,430
And here we have some example service policies.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,530
Now you'll see there's 13 different examples there.

48
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,960
And the one that we want to use is this one example 10, require Amazon EC2 instances to use a specific

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,190
type.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,040
So if we click on that will come down and this is the service control policy that we want to apply so

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,780
you can copy that or you can click on the little button up here and this SCP enforces that

52
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,420
Any instance launch is not using the T2 micro are denied.

53
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,940
So what we can do now we can come back.

54
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:11,360
We can go to policies, service control policies, we can create a policy and I'll just I'll go back and

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,460
let you know about that's the policy that exists there already that's created by default and we can

56
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,250
just call this allow only T2 micro.

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,460
And what I'm gonna do is just override this policy.

58
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,910
I'm just going to paste in the JSON code and we can now choose create policy and that's being created.

59
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,920
Now let's just have a look at this one here.

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,670
So we've got the full AWS access policy.

61
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,260
This is created by default.

62
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,340
And let's just have a look at the policy.

63
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,750
This is the one we saw in the slide that allows basically every action on every resource.

64
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,150
So now that we've got the policy we need to apply it to our organizational unit so we can choose the

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,640
OU, go to service control policies, and we're going to attach the allow only T2 micro so you can see

66
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,400
because it's in a hierarchy the full AWS access is attached to this OU.

67
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:19,550
But because the most restrictive policy will be applied applying this allow only T2 micro will restrict

68
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,320
access to to ensure that we can only launch T2 micro instances.

69
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,430
So the most restrictive policy will apply.

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,590
So what we can do now that we've applied that is let's go back to our other organization.

71
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,760
So this is DCT Labs 2 and I'm going to go to EC2 and let's try and launch an instance.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,360
And what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to go in and let's just choose a T2 large and just try to

73
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,420
configure a security group so it doesn't try and create one for us.

74
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,770
But this shouldn't work anyway so let's just have a look and see what happens.

75
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,100
So let's click on launch and we've got to create a key pair for this region.

76
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,460
So let's just go in and create a key pair.

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,750
I was going to call it my new key pair download and let's launch and there we go.

78
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,120
We get the launch failed so it says you're not authorized to perform this operation.

79
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,220
So obviously that's because of that policy.

80
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,160
Now I'm logged in with an administrative account so I have full privileges to AWS but I'm not able

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,020
to launch that instance. Of course I can go in and let's just try and launch another instance this just

82
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,490
choose a T2 micro and this should work fine.

83
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,800
And we just go back and stop it from creating new security groups and I'm just going to launch that

84
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
instance.

85
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,690
And that's no problem.

86
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,750
So we can launch T2 micro instances but we can't launch anything else.

87
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,750
So that's exactly what we wanted to achieve.

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,090
So coming back and looking at this diagram we have a master account DCT labs.

89
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,310
We have our DCT labs 2 account within an organizational unit.

90
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,330
And we've applied a policy and we've only allowed people to launch T2 micro instances.

91
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,970
So that's it for this lab.

92
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,050
Let's just go back and what we're going to do is just clean this up.

93
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:18,820
So I'm going to terminate this instance and then go back to my master account and what I can do here

94
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,990
is I can detach

95
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,460
that service control policy and

96
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,570
I can quite easily go in and remove this account as well.

97
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,020
So I'm just going to go ahead and do that going to remove the account and I'm going to leave the organization

98
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,700
set up.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,030
But you can also just delete your organization if you need to.

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,930
You could do that by going into settings and choosing delete organization.

101
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,650
Now I'm aware that many of you won't have two accounts so might not have been able to follow along but

102
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,650
at least through viewing this lab you'll have a good understanding of what AWS Organizations are.

103
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:03,400
And also the key thing for the exam is just to understand how the SCPs are applied and what takes

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,030
precedence.

105
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,800
And remember the most restrictive policy takes precedence.
