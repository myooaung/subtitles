00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.760
With Amazon as free, you can actually host a static Web site.

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.970
So by static website, that means that on the street side, there's not going to be any application

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.690
processing.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:22.560
Now you can still have client side code like maybe client side JavaScript running, but it's only static

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.910
on the Israeli side.

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.240
So the simplest thing to do with this is to actually go and set this up now back in history free, you'll

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.080
note that from the beginning I had the DCC Cloud Labs dot com buckets.

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.050
Now I needed to make sure that I'd reserve this bucket.

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.930
I've also registered a domain now.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.630
We actually registered the domain in the next section.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.890
But you may have already done yours because we did actually use it a bit earlier on.

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
That was optional and it is optional that you register a domain it's up to.

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.200
You will cost you a few dollars.

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.040
If you do have a domain, that's great, you can use that for this lesson.

15
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.030
If not, you can host a static website from any bucket.

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.420
But you won't be able to use a public domain name with it.

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.540
So firstly, let's set up our static website.

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.660
If you do have a domain name, the bucket name must match your domain name.

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.480
So I'm going to select DCT Cloud Lipscombe and I'm going to upload a couple of objects.

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.360
And these are going to be used for the static website.

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.860
The objects I'm going to upload are these indexed on HD male and female files, which are in the course

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.140
download in the Amazon as free folder.

23
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.630
So those two files have been uploaded.

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.230
Now let's go to properties all the way to the bottom and understand it.

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.650
Website hosting click on Edit and Enable.

26
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.680
And then what we're going to do is host a static website.

27
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.270
I'm going to specify my indexed or HD html as the index document and then error dot html as the error

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.750
document.

29
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.050
And that's basically it, that's all you need to do.

30
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.790
Let's save those changes.

31
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.060
Now, back at the bottom here we can see we have the static website enabled and we have a website endpoint.

32
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.040
And I'm going to copy that to my clipboard.

33
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
Now we won't be able to access it yet because we don't have public access enabled.

34
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.520
So let's go to permissions.

35
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.110
Firstly, we need to remove the block all public access, and then let's just confirm and then let's

36
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.340
go to our objects.

37
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.940
And one by one, we need to make them public.

38
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.620
So that's the era.

39
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.990
And now I'm going to do the indexed HTML make public, and that's that.

40
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.060
So now let's go to a new browser window and I'm going to paste this in.

41
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.380
And there we go.

42
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.560
We've got the indexed or HD email for our static website.

43
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.400
If you do have around 50 free domain name, then now is the time that we can go into round 53 and actually

44
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.260
set up an alias there.

45
00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.340
So in the round 50 free console, which you can find under services and networking and content delivery,

46
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.460
let's go to hosted zines and I have DCG Cloud Labs dot com, which, as you know, is the same name

47
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.960
that I have for my bucket.

48
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.660
And what I need to do is create a record.

49
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.800
It's going to be a record and it's going to be an alias.

50
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.310
And this time we're going to choose an S3 website endpoint.

51
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.780
Choose our region.

52
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.090
And then we should be able to find the endpoint and create the record.

53
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.050
So now we should be able to connect a DCT Cloud Labs dot com and we should see the same indexed HTML.

54
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.050
So this time that's put in the domain name.

55
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.950
Hit Enter.

56
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.570
And of course, we get the bucket.

57
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.860
So very simple to create a static web site, you just need an index document at a minimum and optionally

58
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.270
an error document as well.

59
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.990
And the key thing to remember for the exam is this is static only.

60
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.610
But as an example, to make sure you remember, you can still run client side code.

61
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.670
So sometimes they try and trick you by saying that there's some kind of client side JavaScript, and

62
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.450
that's different to having any kind of dynamic content on the server side.

63
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.430
It's happening on the client side, and that's OK.

64
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.420
That does work.

65
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.280
Webinars free static web site.

66
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.720
Now, just as a clean up, I would like to go back and just remove this record from roots of 50.

67
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.830
And remove.

68
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.210
To clean up, I'd just like to go back to wrap 53 and remove this record.

69
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.250
And that's all cleaned up.
