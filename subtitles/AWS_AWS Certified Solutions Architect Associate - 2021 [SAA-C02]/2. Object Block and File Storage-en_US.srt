00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,320
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:09,140
We're about to get started on the storage section of the course and I just wanted to talk about the

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,920
three different types of storage that we're going to be covering.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,050
So first there's Amazon S3

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,070
The simple storage service then the elastic block service or EBS.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,110
And lastly the elastic file system (EFS).

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,940
Now these are very different types of storage systems and I wanted to throw in a theory-based lecture

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,460
just to discuss some of the differences in the use cases so let's get started with Amazon S3

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:44,240
S3 is an object storage system which means you load you upload your files as objects and it uses

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,160
an Internet accessible public endpoint.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,560
So this is a HTTP address which contains the region the bucket and the object and there's a couple of

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,100
different formats for this but this is one of them.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,920
And what you actually use to manipulate objects.

14
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:12,030
So to upload objects to download objects to delete objects and so on is a REST API and that uses HTTP

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,430
verbs (methods) so you use the HTTP get requests which is what you normally use to retrieve a web page.

16
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,530
The HTTP put requests which is what you use to upload to a website and so on.

17
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:33,400
Then you've got the posts and the select and the delete so you should consider S3 as being a web service

18
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,820
that's accessible via a public endpoint you can connect your EC2 to it but they go out

19
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,730
via an Internet gateway to an Internet endpoint unless you are using a VPN endpoint which we'll talk about

20
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:51,670
later in this section and then obviously you can access it from any Internet clients as well and you

21
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,310
would do so through a rest api.

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:02,820
So the common use cases are backup application hosting media hosting software delivery so that's Amazon

23
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,450
S3

24
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,310
So that's your object storage system we'll then move on to the elastic block store (EBS) which is a block

25
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,470
storage system.

26
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:20,890
And what that means is that data within hard disk drives or solid state drives is accessed in blocks

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,970
which are within sectors and tracks on the disk.

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,920
So if you think about your computer whether you've got a laptop or or a desktop machine it has a hard

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,280
disk drive in it or a solid state drive and the operating system accesses that through a bus which is

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:45,130
typically a SCSI bus or a serial ATA bus. SCSI stands for small computer systems interface and is

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:53,090
usually used on server systems and then you have the serial ATA or SATA bus which is used in more 

32
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,570
well it's used in server systems as well but it's also often used in client systems like laptops and desktop

33
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:07,720
computers and those are high performance buses within your computer which then can talk directly to

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,550
a disk drive. You then format that disk drive or you create partitions and then format those partitions

35
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:23,100
and then you can store your data on them and typically the actual disk itself is quite close to the

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,900
computer so you know whether you're using a USB drive for instance which you wouldn't typically use

37
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,050
in an application environment because of the performance limitations but you know that cable can only

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,850
be so long from your computer it can't be you know more than maybe a few feet I'm not sure about the

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,790
exact specifications and it's the same with the SCSI bus in the SATA so they need to be very close

40
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,270
to the actual computer so there's a small distance between the disk and the computer and that's why

41
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,060
they're typically internal to the actual computer itself.

42
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,030
Now in the case of the elastic block store it's actually accessed over a network.

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,680
So if you're from a traditional on premise environment you'll know that you can use the iSCSI protocol

44
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:15,420
or fibre channel to send the commands that would be sent to the disk over a network so Fibre Channel

45
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:23,400
is a dedicated storage network and then iSCSI is is where you actually encapsulate those SCSI commands

46
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,090
with an Ethernet header and send it over a traditional network and then you'd have a storage array

47
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,240
with a series of disks and some controllers which then receive that data.

48
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,050
And that's pretty much what the elastic block store is but it's transparent to you.

49
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:47,250
So all you need to worry about with EC2 and EBS is choosing the size and the type and the size of your

50
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,590
volume and then you can adjust some of the performance characteristics as well.

51
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,290
So in terms of use cases for EBS. firstly your operating system of your EC2 instance will be installed

52
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,740
on an EBS volume so whether it's Windows or Linux EBS is what's used for the operating system.

53
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,840
In fact you can't store an operating system on S3.

54
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,410
You can't install to an operating system on the EFS either.

55
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,430
So you must use a block based storage system for your operating system you also might use it for database

56
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,380
systems file systems transactional logs that kind of thing.

57
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,750
So anywhere where you have high performance requirements you need low latency and you need the ability

58
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,200
to be able to have a good granularity in how you configure your performance characteristics of your

59
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,400
storage system

60
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,750
the third type is the elastic file system.

61
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:49,750
So this is a file system that's actually created for you so you know it's actually means that somewhere

62
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:56,710
there's a block based storage system where the server that's presenting that system to you has already

63
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,720
created the partitions it's already formatted the file system and is now able to present that file

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,270
system to you.

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:11,080
So whereas with EBS you mount the block storage to a device mapping within your Linux operating system

66
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,870
with EFS you mount it using the NFSv1 protocol to a mount point which you can create.

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,230
And what happens then is you'll just see the file system and whatever files already exist on that file

68
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:34,430
system that you're mounting. Now with EBS your EC2 instance and your EBS volume must be in the same

69
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,100
availability zone.

70
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:42,050
However with an EFS file system your instances can be in different availability zones mounting

71
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:49,040
the same file system and you can actually have a large number of instances mounting the same file system

72
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,250
whereas with EBS it's a one to one mapping.

73
00:06:51,260 --> 00:07:00,730
So only one EC2 instance to one EBS volume you can also connect and on premises clients or server

74
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:06,710
to an elastic file system and for that you need a VPN.

75
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,860
Note that this is for Linux only whereas you can use Windows or Linux for your EC2 instance and

76
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,790
connect to the EBS volume and you can have any client that has the ability to use a REST API for Amazon

77
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,270
S3.

78
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,990
So those are some of the differences between S3, EBS, and EFS.

79
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,860
So whenever exam questions come up just remember S3 is the object storage system and you use HTTP

80
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:43,080
verbs (methods) to access a public endpoint, EBS is for block-based storage, hard disk drives, solid state

81
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,910
drives, operating systems, and you must be in the same availability zone as your instance.

82
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,450
And then EFS is when you're looking at file systems which you might want to mount from multiple EC2

83
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,410
instances within different Availability Zones and even on premises clients over a VPN so use cases for

84
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:09,090
EFS include home directories, shared corporate directories, database backups, big data analytics.

85
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,960
Just remember you cannot issue block level commands or format file systems with NFS mounted

86
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,570
file system that's already being shared from somewhere else.

87
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,040
So that's it just an overview of object block and file storage and now we'll get on with the S3 section.
