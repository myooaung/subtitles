1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,250
So we're back in EC2 and I'm actually going to launch another instance and what I'm gonna do this

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,530
time it's going to be the same configuration apart from we're not going to add that extra volume as

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:23,290
part of the launch so we're going to stick to the same Availability Zones, keep clicking next go through.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,580
I should change my security group because it keeps created at launch ones and then we've got

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,530
to review and launch. That's been a couple of minutes

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:41,950
It's still initializing but let's go down to EBS volumes and so we have our additional volume that we

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:49,130
left from before and that's available which means that you can attach it to an instance.

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,720
So what we're going to do is go here and we'll click on attach volume and then it will actually come

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,810
up with the instance ID obviously if you've got a lot of instances you need to search by instance

10
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:09,510
I.D. but in this case we can easily select it from the list and we're going to just leave the default

11
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,430
device mapping here and click on attach.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,840
So while that same process let's head over to the command line and I'm going to secure shell into

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,370
this Linux instance

14
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:32,610
and say I'm going to run the command LSP L K and we can see that that additional volume has been attached.

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:41,660
So I'm just going to switch the root user and I'm gonna run the command file DASH Yes and then Dev x

16
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:49,470
d f and so this time we can see that there's already a file system because we created it on the instance

17
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,470
in the last lab and I'm going to do the same thing as before I'm just going to do I can get rid of the

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,620
pseudo again and get rid of the do and make directory slash data and then we're going to mount slash

19
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,530
Dev slash X VDI F to the slash data directory.

20
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,530
And now that's changed to slash data and run ls and sure enough there's our files so we've now just

21
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:22,440
mounted the same EBS volume to a different instance but we have actually done that within the same availability

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,370
zone and that's all we're going to do in this lab we can come back now and just terminate this instance.

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,490
And then what I'm gonna do in the next lab is show you how you can then take used the snapshot that

24
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:43,620
we created before to actually create an API volume in a different availability zone and attach that

25
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,640
to another instance.
