00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:09,050
Before we get stuck into the labs on EBS I wanted to cover off instance stores and just outline the

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:16,640
differences between an EBS volume and an instance store volume so instance store volumes are ephemeral

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:25,550
storage and they're based on NVME technology which is local to the actual server where your instance

4
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,380
is running.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:33,620
So EBS is actually accessed over a network whereas NVME is local to the actual server itself so it's

6
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,280
higher performance.

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,920
However being ephemeral that means that the data is not secure.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,270
So when you switch off when you shut down your instance your data is lost so let's launch an instance

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,590
and see where this is.

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,830
So if we click on select we're just going to we need to scroll down here actually and find a different

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,860
instance type so we won't be able to find an instance store there.

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,100
But we should be out to find one here we can try.

13
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,280
Well let's just go right down to the bottom actually go to storage optimized.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,320
This is this is a huge server and I'm pretty sure this comes with a whole bunch of instance stores so

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,090
if you go to add storage so you can see here that we have the root device which is always going to

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:32,390
be an elastic block store volume and then you have all these ephemeral disks and these are local devices

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,780
and NVMW technology and you can see it says here that it's an SSD

18
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,750
so ephemeral means that the data will not be persistent.

19
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,070
In other words when you shut down your instance if you stop it you will lose that data.

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,710
So there are some use cases where people do want to use these you can use them for some kind of temporary

21
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:06,080
data data that's perhaps distributed across instances and replicated in some other way and where you

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,450
need that high level of performance.

23
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,470
So with an ephemeral volume you can't stop your instance so you'll lose your data you can restart your

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,430
instance though.

25
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:24,100
And you can't detach an ephemeral volume from one instance and attach it to another like you can with

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,330
an EBS volume.

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,660
So those are just a few facts about ephemeral storage.

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,550
You will see it occasionally coming up.

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,370
I don't think they use very much anymore.

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,430
There's some fantastic performance coming through on EBS so it probably doesn't matter as much nowadays

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,860
but there are still use cases where some organizations will use it and you just need to be sure that

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:51,520
you understand from an exam perspective that if you see ephemeral that's an instance store and that

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,820
means that the data is not persistent.
