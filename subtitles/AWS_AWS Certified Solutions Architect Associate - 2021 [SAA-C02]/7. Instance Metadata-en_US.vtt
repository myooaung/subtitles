Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.850
In this lab we're going to talk about instance meta data so there's instance metadata and instant use

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.730
of data and user data will be the next lab.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.710
So for now I'm going to talk about metadata.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.410
Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.990
And this is an article that will be in the course download which describes a bit more about it.

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.110
But the best thing to do is to show you in action.

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.730
Now you can see some commands here on the screen and we're actually going to run these commands.

9
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.520
So I'm just going to copy this one to my clipboard.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.310
In fact what I need is this one here.

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.420
This has the curl command so you can go there you can choose the option here just to copy it to your

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.860
clipboard and what I've done is I've actually launched an instance it's just a T2 micro Amazon Linux

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.780
to EMI and what I'm going to do now is head over to the console.

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.470
So I'm logged into my instance and if I run this command we're going to see some information.

15
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.750
Now you definitely need to know this command.

16
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.230
So just remember that the U.R.L. is 1 6 9 2 5 4 and then it repeats dot 1 6 9 2 5 4.

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.960
Then it's slash latest slash meter dash data and you do need that training slash if you take it off.

18
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320
Nothing happens by put it on.

19
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.380
This is what I get.

20
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.890
So this gives me some categories of information about my instance and I can then drill down further

21
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.870
into this.

22
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:42.240
So for instance I could put on public dash hostname and what happens is the public hostname gets pre

23
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.150
pendant to the text here so you can actually see the hostname of the instance.

24
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.990
I could do the same for public that's put in dash IP the full.

25
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.050
And again you get the public IP address and you could do local hostname.

26
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.220
So let's just type in local dash hostname and again you get the hostname you can get the instance I.D.

27
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.280
you can get metrics and information about the network and so on.

28
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.610
There's lots of information there that you can use

29
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.720
I'm going to clear my screen and I want to show you one more tool the tool I want to show you can be

30
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.410
downloaded by running w get with this U.R.L. and this will be available again in the course download.

31
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.260
If I press enter it downloads the file and if I now do less I can see that I have this file

32
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.740
if I do an alias.

33
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.470
L.A. easy to dash metadata however I can see that I don't have executable permissions so I'm going to

34
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.650
do c h mode U Plus X easy to metadata and now I should have executable permissions so I can actually

35
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.640
run this tool

36
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.760
and that's put in the dash help option and you can see a help menu here and what you can then do is

37
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.190
choose one of these options.

38
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.570
So for instance let us put dash P for public hostname and it retrieves that information and then we

39
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.680
could do Dash said for availability zone.

40
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.140
It shows us which availability zone which in the end.

41
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.410
So this is a better way of accessing the metadata at the command line like this.

42
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.700
However the U or L is very good for working programmatically with instance metadata.

43
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.140
So that's just a really quick lab just to show you what instance metadata is.

44
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:51.400
You should remember the URL which is hate CTP colon slash slash 1 6 9 2 5 4 1 6 9 2 5 4 slash latest

45
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.890
slash meter dash data with a slash on the end.

46
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.750
That's it for this lab guys in the next lab.

47
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.710
We're going to go free easy to instance use a data.
