00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,580
In this section on guns, COVID, DNS caching and performance optimization, there's a few services

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,540
I'm going to cover.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:14,080
The first service is Amazon Rout 53, which is a DNS server, and I'll explain all about what that is

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,450
and how it works in the very next lesson.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,960
Essentially, a DNS server helps your computer to understand where to go, to speak to an application.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,270
Then we're going to look at Amazon Cloud Front.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,380
Cloud Front is a content delivery network that means it caches data in different locations around the

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,460
world to get it closer to the people who are actually using that data.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,350
So it's about optimization of performance through reducing latency will also cover IWC global accelerator.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,530
It's similar to cloud front in that it's helping you to reduce latency, but it has some differences

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,320
and different use cases in which we will use it.

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,140
So we'll cover that in quite a bit of detail as well.

13
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,200
So I hope you enjoyed the section and I'll see you in the next lesson.
