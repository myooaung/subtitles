Welcome to this lesson in this lesson, we're going to explore identity based policies and resource

2
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.020
based policies.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.080
So let's start with identity based policies.

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:23.080
Remember that these are Jason based permissions, policy documents that control the actions and identity

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.840
and performance.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.800
They're applied to an identity, and they control the actions that that identity can perform on resources

7
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.870
and under what specific conditions.

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.970
So let's say we have a user account, we might have a group and then we have a role.

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.590
These are all different places that you can apply an identity based policy.

10
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.580
Now there are a few ways that you can attach identity based policies.

11
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.120
Firstly, we have something called an inline policy.

12
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.290
Inline policies have a one to one relationship with the user, the group or the role.

13
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.200
So you create an inline policy for a specific user group or role.

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.350
You can't share them, you can't use them across other roles.

15
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.700
If you delete that user, for example, you'll delete the policy along with it.

16
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.850
We then have what are called managed policies.

17
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.710
Manage policies can be either eight of us managed or customer managed.

18
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.480
As the name suggests, eight of us managed are created and managed by us and customer managed are created

19
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.740
and managed by you.

20
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.040
So you can't modify an IWC manage policy.

21
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.020
But you can use those policies in your account so we can attach a manage policy to multiple entities

22
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.220
so we can attach the policy to a user, a group and a role at the same time if we want to and then known

23
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.820
as standalone policies for that reason, because you can attach them to multiple identities in your

24
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.300
account.

25
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.780
Next, we have resource based policies, so these are the JSON policy documents that you attach to a

26
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.660
resource such as an S3 bucket or a Dynamo DB table, for example.

27
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.850
And there are several different services to which you can attach a resource based policy.

28
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.250
So let's say we've got an S3 bucket and we've got Paul on the left hand side.

29
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.110
Here are user accounts, and Paul wants to place an object in the buckets.

30
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.690
So in this case, we could apply a permissions policy to the the bucket itself.

31
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.850
So a resource based policy.

32
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.320
And in that policy, we can define the principle.

33
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.270
So if we look at how this policy is written, it's a bit different to the policies that are applied

34
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.920
to identity based policies.

35
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.500
In this case, you get the principle.

36
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.030
So we have the effect allow the principle, which is the R.N of the user accounts, and then we have

37
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.490
the action, which is as free star.

38
00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.260
So in this case, this user is allowed to perform any free API action and we then have a resource in

39
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.070
this case, the origin of the specific bucket so he can perform any action, but only on this specific

40
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.460
bucket.

41
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.510
The resource based policy will grant the specified principle the permission to perform actions on the

42
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.200
resource.

43
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.820
So in this case, the user is then able to perform the free puts object API action.

44
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.240
It's also possible to attach a resource based policy to an iron roll.

45
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.840
So remember, with I am, we have a trust policy and a permissions policy that we apply to the role.

46
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.550
Now, a trust policy is also an example of a resource based policy, whereas the permissions policy

47
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.430
is an example of an identity based policy.

48
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.010
So that's it for this lesson.

49
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.060
Hopefully, that helps you to understand these two different types of policy and a bit more detail.
