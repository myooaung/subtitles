Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.450
In this lab we're going to create a billing alarm so that you get a notification when you are estimated

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.380
to reach or have reached a certain threshold.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.330
So what we're going to do is actually set a dollar value and say if we reach or estimated to reach five

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.310
or ten dollars then we're going to get an email alert to let us know.

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.500
Now if you follow my instructions for out the course you'll be terminating your instances and the leasing

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.210
objects that might otherwise cost you money to make sure that you stay within the free to air.

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.540
But you've got to follow my instructions and you should also read up what's included in the free tier

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.760
and just make sure you're aware of what you should be doing to make sure you don't get any bills.

10
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.260
But just in case we're going to set up the billing alarm now you do need to be logged in into the root

11
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.090
account to do this because only the root account actually has access to modifying billing information.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Now we don't have any other accounts here anyway but it's just a reminder that once we do have our accounts

13
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.430
you still need to come back to use the root account for billing related modifications.

14
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.420
But for all other purposes you should always leave the root account alone you shouldn't log in with

15
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.640
the root account.

16
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.380
You should make it a very secure account with a strong password a multifactor authentication because

17
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.540
it's a very powerful account.

18
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.030
Now we're going to do that later on we're going to create our own user for logging in.

19
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.360
We're going to set up multifactor authentication on the root account and from that point on in the course

20
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.810
mostly we're going to be using an IAM account rather than a root account.

21
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.530
But getting back to the subject of this lab what we want to do.

22
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.380
We're logged into the management console as the root account.

23
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.270
We go up here where we've got the name of our account.

24
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.970
We choose the down arrow and then we go to my building dashboard.

25
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.760
We can then go down to billing preferences and what you'll need to do is enable receive free tier

26
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.670
usage alerts and receive billing alerts and then you need to put in the email address that you want

27
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.820
these to be sent to.

28
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.720
You can then choose safe preferences will now receive free tier usage alerts to the email address that

29
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.250
we specified.

30
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.600
And we also want to receive billing alerts when we reach a certain threshold in a dollar value.

31
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.950
So what we do here is we can choose manage billing alerts.

32
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.690
I'm gonna open it in a new tab.

33
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.410
And what this does is it opens up the monitoring tool called Cloud watch and in cloud watch we go down

34
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.580
to billing which is under alarms and we can choose creates alarm and what it does is actually loads

35
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.110
the metrics for us.

36
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.260
So the metric name is estimated the charges and the currency is US dollars and what we need to do now

37
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.860
is we come down and specify the amount in this case I'm gonna set mine to ten dollars.

38
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.390
You can then choose next.

39
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.170
And what happens is cloud watch will create an SNS topic SNS stands for the simple notification

40
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.690
service and is one of the AWS services that sends messages to you.

41
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.420
You can then choose create a new topic and I'm gonna change the name of the topic to billing alert you

42
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.260
then specify the end point which in this case is my email address and you can now just choose create

43
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.570
topic we can then choose billing alerts as the name and we can choose next.

44
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.870
We then get a summary of the information and we can just choose create alarm and that's it.

45
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.870
We've now created our alarm but we get a message which tells us that we need to confirm the subscription

46
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.620
in SNS so the way we do that is we can choose this option here view and SNS subscriptions and it

47
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.100
takes us over to the simple notification services console.

48
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.670
You can now see there's a pending confirmation here.

49
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.650
And what you need to do is go to the email address that you used and you should find an email from Amazon.

50
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.140
And this is the message that I received.

51
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.290
So all you need to do is choose confirmed subscription and you should then get a message saying subscription

52
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.110
confirmed.

53
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.190
And if we head back to the console and refresh this page we should now see that our subscription has

54
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.650
been confirmed and that's it.

55
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.990
That's all we need to do.

56
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.720
We'll now get free tier usage alerts and we'll also get alerts when our account balance is going to exceed

57
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.040
10 dollars and that's it for this lab guys.

58
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.190
I hope you followed along and got this set up just to make sure that you don't receive any surprise

59
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.930
bills in the next lab.

60
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.610
What we're going to do is set up multifactor authentication for the root account.
