00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,630
In this lesson, I'm going to cover nitro instances and nitro enclaves.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,950
Now these are both part of the IWC Nitro system, which is the underlying platform for the next generation

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,660
of active instances.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,330
It's been around for a few years, but it's been evolving over time, and more and more instance types

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,910
are now supported on the Nitro system.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,230
That includes by virtualized instances and bare metal instances now by bare metal.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,720
What we mean is rather than having a virtualisation layer, a hypervisor between the physical infrastructure

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,650
and the instances operating system, it actually accesses bare metal, so it's connected directly to

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,480
that physical infrastructure layer.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,450
Now, in some cases, that improves performance.

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
It might help you with licensing restrictions as well.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,780
Virtualization can impose a performance penalty.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,150
And with Nitro, what they're trying to do is eliminate that and give you the best performance you possibly

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,440
can get for both bare metal and virtualized instances.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,190
Now, the functions of the underlying infrastructure layer, including the hypervisor, are broken into

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,050
separate hardware modules.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:25,110
We have the Nitro cards for VPC, Nitro cards for EBS and Instant Storage on Nitro Card Controller and

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,730
Nitro Security Chip.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,300
We've then got the Nitro Hypervisor and Nitro Enclave's, so each of these functions is broken into

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,880
a separate specialized hardware module, which gives you the best flexibility in performance.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,310
The key benefits of the Nitro system involve performance, security and innovation.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,360
The performance is close to bare metal, even for virtualized instances.

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,440
The Elastic Network adapts and elastic fabric adaptor are both based on the Nitro system.

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,650
There's more bare metal instance types, and there's higher network performance, including up to 100

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,700
gigabits per second.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,750
It's also optimized very well for high performance computing.

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,300
Additionally, we have support for dense storage instances, which go up to 60 terabytes at the time

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,900
of recording.

29
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,680
Next, we have Nitro Enclave's and this is really about security.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,890
These provide isolated compute environments.

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,960
Your instances will run on isolated and hardened virtual machines.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,970
There's no persistent storage, no interactive access or external networking.

33
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,930
It uses cryptographic attestation to ensure only authorized code is actually running on your instance.

34
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,900
So it's an extremely secure computing environment.

35
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,590
It integrates with K.M. encryption, and you can protect and securely process your highly sensitive

36
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,340
data for use cases like personally identifiable information protection, health care data, financial

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,100
data and intellectual property data.

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,510
So the key takeaways are that the U.S. Nitro system is the next generation of the underlying hardware

39
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,170
platform.

40
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,670
For easy to, it breaks apart various functions into these different modules, like the Nitro cards

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,530
and the Nitro security chip.

42
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,200
We then got the Nitro enclaves, which help you with really secure computing environments that are very

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,190
much isolated.

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,010
As I mentioned before, there's quite a lot of instance types that do support the Nitro system now.

45
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,210
The T2 type that we use during this course is not supported for Nitro.

46
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,320
It's a lower cost instance, and it doesn't support many different features.

47
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,870
Now, if you're interested in understanding which instance Typekit support which features, I'll add

48
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,770
a link to this lesson.

49
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,240
You don't need to know them all off by heart, but it's useful to pass over it with a quick glance just

50
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,330
to understand the differences between what supported for different instance types and instance families.
