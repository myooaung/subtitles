00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.810
Hi guys in this lab were going to cover CloudHSM. So CloudHSM is a implementation of a hardware

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.010
security module.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:20.420
So that's a device which securely stores encryption keys you use CloudHSM to meet corporate contractual

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.110
or regulatory compliance requirements for data security.

5
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.130
So wherever you see questions that state that those kind of regulations or compliance requirements exist

6
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.250
and encryption keys must be cleared on a hardware device or hardware security module.

7
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.590
CloudHSM is the way to go.

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.270
So if CloudHSM you can securely generate store and manage cryptographic keys used for data encryption

9
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.180
in a way that the keys are only accessible to you.

10
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.260
So it's a dedicated device for your use only.

11
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.210
And having this hardware security module means that the keys are stored within a tamper resistant hardware

12
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.960
device.

13
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.040
Now before we carry on we've actually creating a CloudHSM cluster.

14
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.100
I just wanted to show you a slide what we're looking at here is a bit of history because in the middle

15
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.770
column there you can see the classic CloudHSM.

16
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.310
So this is the way CloudHSM was until relatively recently and then it moved over to the current

17
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.420
CloudHSM.

18
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.630
That's quite a big change here and it's certainly reduced the amount of price of actually implementing

19
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.370
that CloudHSM device.

20
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.720
So it's definitely a big plus.

21
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.060
And I wanted to present this to you just so that you understand this is something that's changed within

22
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.700
the last couple of years and it's probably going to be the latest version will be on the exam rather

23
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.620
than the classic but it just gives you an understanding of how things have changed and might sort of

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.940
skew requirements one way or another.

25
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.550
So with the classic CloudHSM that used a third party device called a Safe Net Luna and it required

26
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.710
you to pay five thousand dollars upfront and if you wanted high availability you needed another device.

27
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.280
And in terms of security requirements it meets the FIPS 140-2 Level 2 standard. Current cloud

28
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.290
HSM is a proprietary AWS device.

29
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.680
There's no upfront costs you just have to pay per usage.

30
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.610
It's clustered across multiple Availability Zones and it meets FIPS 140-2 level 3 Standard.

31
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.260
So that's just a little bit about understanding the history of CloudHSM.

32
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.400
Let's get over to the console and actually create ourselves a cluster.

33
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.700
So in the console here we can just choose create cluster and or we have to do a select a VPC and then

34
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.920
select the availability zones within that VPC and you can have one availability zone.

35
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.730
Excuse me you can have one subnet per availability zone.

36
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.750
And in this case we're going to create a new cluster.

37
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.830
So we choose next and we choose Create cluster.

38
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.280
Now before you do that just bear in mind this is not going to be AWS free tier so you may pay a charge

39
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.880
for using this device.

40
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.640
We won't have it running for long but if you do choose to go down that path then you might incur some

41
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.470
costs.

42
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.900
So I'm going to just choose Create cluster and we now have a crate in progress the cluster is ready to

43
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.420
be initialized now.

44
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.450
And but what I want to do is I'm just going to hit on the question mark here and it tells you a little

45
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.200
bit more about the clusters.

46
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.960
So we have clusters you get multiple hardware security modules which are kept in sync as part of the

47
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.380
cluster.

48
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.650
So when you make changes on one then it's replicated to another one.

49
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.960
So you can have one to 28 and if you just scroll down a bit here it shows you the architecture.

50
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.670
So in this case we've done something very similar to this.

51
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.040
We've chosen a VPC and we've chosen multiple subnets in that VPC and you can see what actually happens

52
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.420
is an elastic network interface is put into your VPC which connects which connects you all VPC to the

53
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.280
hardware security module.

54
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.010
So the devices won't actually appear within your VPC they're elsewhere but you can actually see them

55
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.920
via the elastic network interface which means your applications can then use the cryptographic keys

56
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.240
that are stored on the HSN.

57
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.970
So you also get synchronization between each of you CloudHSMs.

58
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.550
And additionally on top of that you get high availability and load balancing because CloudHSM automatically

59
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.430
distributes the connections between or the operations that is between each of the major Sims in the

60
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.100
cluster.

61
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.510
So it's worth having a read of this article just to understand CloudHSM better.

62
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.460
Let's go back to the console and we can click on a mission initialize so to initialize the cluster you

63
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.600
have to actually create the hardware security module.

64
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.390
And in this case we can choose an availability zone and then choose create.

65
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.050
And it tells us that the hate you Sam is taking a few minutes to be created.

66
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.110
So a few minutes of past and we're now at a point where we can click next to continue with initializing

67
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.230
the cluster or the hate you send for that matter.

68
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.310
So we click on Next.

69
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.640
So it now tells us that you need to download a certificate signing request and then sign it and we can

70
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.400
continue by clicking next.

71
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.660
And then next again and now what we need to do is upload the signed cluster certificate and the issuing

72
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.560
certificate.

73
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.990
Now it's going beyond the scope of the exam to actually go through all the steps of actually signing

74
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.480
creating and completing this configuration.

75
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.370
Really what you need to know for the exam is the differences between KMS and CloudHSM.

76
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.140
And when you'd use them what are the use cases.

77
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.070
So we're actually gonna leave it here.

78
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.400
And what I'm gonna do is just click on cancel and we can go into our cluster and just choose Delete

79
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.150
cluster and delete and we get an error so what we actually have to do is go in and delete our CloudHSM

80
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.510
first.

81
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.210
So let's just go in we have an active CloudHSM. We can see the elastic network interface address of this

82
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.970
HSM as well and the availability zone that it's in and let's just click on delete and it took a few

83
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:14.330
minutes but now the CloudHSM has been deleted so we can go back up to clusters and delete cluster.

84
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.980
Now before we finish this lab I just wanted to bring an article to your attention.

85
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.670
This is the getting started with AWS CloudHSM.

86
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.050
So if you do want to take it a bit further and fully create a cluster.

87
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.410
This has all these different topics for understanding in full and you can set up through both the console

88
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.160
or the command line and connect to Linux or Windows client to the cluster and so on.

89
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.500
So if you want to take it a bit further you need to know if your job or you just want more information

90
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.570
and more understanding.

91
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.650
Have a look at this article and follow through the steps.
