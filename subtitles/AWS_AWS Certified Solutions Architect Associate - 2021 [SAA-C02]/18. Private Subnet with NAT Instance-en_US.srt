00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,890
Hi guys we're now going to create a net instance.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,130
I just wanted to put the slide back up just to remind you some of the pros and cons again not gateways

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,200
to the ones the eight of us have recommended for most use cases you're going to use a net Gateway because

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,810
it's managed for you.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,270
It's a classically scalable it has hate Che and so on but you can't add security groups of your own

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,730
and you can't use it as a bastion host.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,860
So there are a couple of advantages to using in that instance you might want to use it in some scenarios

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,470
and that's what we're going to do in this lab.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,800
So we're going to create this configuration we're going to have an easy to instance and a private subnet

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,250
and we're going to have a net instance in a public subnet.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:51,140
And we're going to create a round table entry that points to the net instance for any IP address destinations

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,270
that aren't within the VPC.

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,840
So that's what we're going to do.

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,850
And we can also use this net instance as a jump post so that we can assess age into the net instance

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,290
across to our private instance and then paying the outside world via the Net instance.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,500
So that's something that we weren't able to do when we set up our bastion hosting in the original bastion

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,280
host lab so that's what we're going to do.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,620
Let's head over to the console and get this setup.

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,180
So I'm back in the easy to management console and we already have a couple of instances running.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,690
Now I'm gonna keep my private instance but actually I'm going to just terminate this instance in the

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:36,340
public subnet because I still want to show you how you can use a net instance as a bastion host.

22
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:44,680
So let's go to launch an instance and what I want to do now is actually search for community semis and

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,190
I'm going to type I am set N Dash I corrected it for me.

24
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,200
Let's just make sure it doesn't Dash.

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:02:01,810
Am I dash VPC dash Nat and let's just search and so you get a list of EMI like Amazon machine images

26
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:08,680
that are pre configured and I want to use this one that's not hate VM and this might look slightly different

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,870
when you search but if you just put that in you'll be able to find your EMI.

28
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,490
So we choose select we keep it as a T2 micro.

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,290
We want to put this into our public subnet and we can then go to security groups and I'm just going

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,880
to choose Web access.

31
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:36,190
So what we need from this is we need SSA each inbound because we want to use it as a bastion host and

32
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,400
for the outbound we need to be able to send traffic out to the Internet and that's already allowed by

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,890
default in the in the security group.

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,470
So let's choose review and launch and launch.

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,650
So that instance is launching and this couple of things we need to do we need to go to actions networking

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,260
and change source destination check.

37
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,510
So by default an instance in EU does not allow port forwarding and we need to enable port forwarding

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,980
for it to function as a net instance.

39
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,060
So we choose yes disable and we can then take the public IP address and head over to the console and

40
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,970
we're going to SSA into this box.

41
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,310
So I'm going to SSA H and I'm going to use port forwarding again as we did in the previous lamps and

42
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm going to put in the public IP and choose yes.

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:35,000
And I'm now going to SSA each into my instance in the private subnet.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,670
So let's go back and get the IP of my instance in the private subnet and I'll just need to put an at

45
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,440
sign in there so let's just do that.

46
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,480
And there we are we're in.

47
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,080
So let's see if we can ping Google dot com and we're not getting a response because remember what we

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
need to do is actually add an entry into the round table.

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:05,690
So let's go back to our console and I'm gonna go to VPC open in a new tab and we're going to head down

50
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,980
to round tables and choose round type of one.

51
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:17,140
Now we've still got this target for on that gateway that we had in the previous lab and because that's

52
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,980
been deleted.

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,340
It says black hole.

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:26,470
So all we can do is we can just delete that out and I need to get the instance I.D. of my net instance

55
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:34,820
so this one with a public address is my net instance and I need to copy the instance I.D. ed back to

56
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:43,730
rounds at around and it's going to be 0 0 0 0 slash 0 and then I'm going to choose instance and it was

57
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,330
this one here so I don't need to paste it in I can just choose it from the list or remember it is the

58
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,380
one that finished with F one.

59
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,510
So let's choose that and click save rounds and we now have an active route via our instance and you

60
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,880
can see it's changed the target to the elastic network interface of that instance.

61
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,830
So let's head back over to the command line and let's try and ping.

62
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,710
Hi guys.

63
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,840
I just got disconnected.

64
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,020
So I had to clear my screen but I pinged Google dot com and I still got a failure.

65
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:19,400
And the reason for this is what we need to do is go back to our Web access group security group and

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,900
choose edit rules and we need to add a rule to allow ICMP traffic and I'm to choose from anywhere and

67
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,740
choose safe rules and if we go back to the console now and we ping.

68
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,280
There we go.

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,250
We get a response so that's all working.

70
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,880
So we have our Nat instance which is also functioning as a bastion host.

71
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:49,030
We've created the Nats instance from the Amazon EMI for VPC net.

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,870
We've added a roundtable entry to point to the net instance in the roundtable for the private subnet.

73
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,440
And we've also had to enable ICMP inbound to get the response traffic that comes back when we send our

74
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,760
pings.

75
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,860
Course we already have a role in our security groups to allow all traffic outbound so we didn't have

76
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,820
to change anything there.

77
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,530
So that's the configuration and we're now able to SSA age in to our instance via our not instance and

78
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,230
then pinging the outside world via the Net instance that's enabled Internet connectivity.

79
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,740
So that's all it is for NATS instances guys.

80
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:34,570
Let's go back to the console and what we can do is firstly I'm going to remove the ICMP rule here because

81
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,620
I use this for Internet facing instances so I don't want everything to be able to ping me and save rules

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,130
and then I'm gonna go and terminate my instances choose both instances.

83
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,840
Let's go back to the VPC management console and what we're going to do is just go to our round table

84
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,870
and we can remove that entry which has now gone into a black hole and that's everything cleaned up for

85
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,890
this lap and we're now all done with Nat gateways and Nat instances.
