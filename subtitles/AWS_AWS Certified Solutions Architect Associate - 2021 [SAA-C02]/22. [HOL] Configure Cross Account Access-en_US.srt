00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,550
Welcome back in this lesson, we're going to implement cross account access to Amazon as free and the

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,740
implementation we're going to create is very much like we saw in the scenario at the end of the last

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,160
lesson.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,110
In this case, account a is going to be our management account.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,470
That's the main account we log in with using IWC organizations.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,090
We created our production account.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,690
So Account B is going to be our production accounts.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,650
Now what I'm going to do is create a user called John an account.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,420
B John will have an identity based policy attached in-line, and that policy will allow John to assume

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,690
a role in accounts in our management account.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,870
That role will have a trust policy that allows John to assume the role and a permissions policy, which

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,350
defines the permissions that John will have to the three buckets.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,180
So let's go over, and the first thing we need to do is create our user, John.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,980
So back in the management console, I'm going to switch to DCT production, so I'm accessing I am in

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,570
the DCT production accounts.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,910
Let's go to users.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,680
And we don't have any uses in this account, so let's create a user.

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,110
I'm going to call it John.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,230
You can call him whatever you want.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,280
Now I only need management console access at this point in time.

21
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,950
I'm going to set a password, go free, no permissions and just simply create the user.

22
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,300
So that's it.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,290
The user is ready.

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,160
I'm going to copy this URL.

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,820
This is the URL the user is going to use to log in.

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,460
And we have this file in code Amazon S3 cross accounts Access Dot Jason.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm just going to paste in this URL so I can use it later on.

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,530
Now, this first snippet of JSON is the trust policy for the role that we're going to create in our

29
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,820
management account accounts.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,400
And we need the afriend for our user in account B. So back in, I am.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,700
Let's just go back up a level, click on the user.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,420
Copy the R.N, come back here and we'll paste it in.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,900
So we now have the Aaron Fry user, so now we can actually go and create our trust policy.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,820
So let's copy this code.

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,360
We need to switch back to our management accounts.

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,640
Goats rolls great role we can choose easy to.

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,490
For now, we're going to override that in a moment for permissions.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
We're not going to add anything at this point.

39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,690
We're going to go through and give it a roll name.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,510
I'm going to call it cross account as free.

41
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,740
I'm going to take out the description, just put something in there and create this role.

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,930
So now let's find our role under trust relationships.

43
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,640
Let's edit the trust relationship.

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,700
Delete all of this out.

45
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,480
I need to come back because I already use copy, just re copy my trust policy and paste on in.

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,460
So now the trust relationship here should allow the user from Account B to actually assume this role

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,180
so that user has the allow for the action SDS assume role.

48
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,920
So that's the trust policy.

49
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,030
Next, we go back to permissions, add an inline policy, go to Jason.

50
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,000
We're going to delete this code and then let's go and see our snippet of code.

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,570
So here is the permissions for the policy.

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,730
Now we do need a couple of things.

53
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,580
We need to have the bucket name in two different places.

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,740
Otherwise, everything's okay.

55
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,870
We're going to be less buckets.

56
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,760
We're going to be able to get bucket location, get objects and put objects as well.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,290
So let's go and get our bucket ayorinde in Amazon S3.

58
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,990
I'm going to use the DCT cloud storage bucket now.

59
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,350
I just want to check if I've left, I have left the bucket policy.

60
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's remove the bucket policy.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,300
So that's been deleted back in properties.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,860
Let's copy the R.N.

63
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,150
And then we're going to come back here and place that over the top into these two locations.

64
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,910
Leaving the slash staff so that we apply to objects and then let's copy all of this code and then paste

65
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,140
that into our JASON editor for our permissions policy.

66
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,610
Give this a name.

67
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,610
I'm just going to call it free access and create that policy.

68
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,670
So now we have the roll sets up with the trust relationship set correctly so that the user an account

69
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,730
B can assume the role and the permissions assigned.

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,780
We now need to give Paul an in-line policy, allowing Paul to actually call the assumed role.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,660
And then we need to log in as Paul once has this all out.

72
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,600
Now we're going to need our role.

73
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,210
R-N.

74
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,990
So looking at my role here, let's just copy the irony of our role and our third piece of code here.

75
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,590
We're going to paste in the role Aron.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,860
So now we have to run for the role.

77
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,540
We're going to copy this code.

78
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,320
We're going to go to users and then switch accounts.

79
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,140
So now we're going to switch accounts, DCT production.

80
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,790
We can see John and under permissions, we're going to add an in-line policy.

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Go to Jason and add this in.

82
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,380
I'm just going to call this assume role and let's create the policy.

83
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,250
So we need to log in as John now and attempt to assume the role.

84
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,470
We're going to need a few pieces of information for that.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,660
Firstly, we need this URL.

86
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,400
So let's log in as John.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,070
So when you enter the URL, you should see a page like this put in your username and password for John

88
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,540
and sign in.

89
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,590
So we're signed in, and what we're going to do is switch roles and to switch roles.

90
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,930
We need a bit of information.

91
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,410
Firstly, we need the account side and then we need the role name.

92
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:50,320
So back in I I'm going to go back to my main accounts and any user here I should find an R.N., which

93
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,640
includes the account side.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,150
Let's just come back, pay, start in copy the account's I.D. Come back, we can paste it in.

95
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,730
We need the role name that was crossed.

96
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,070
The account free will paste it in.

97
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,610
I'll set the display names across the account as free as well.

98
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,670
Put this is green and let's click on Switch Roll.

99
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,680
So we appear to have switched roles.

100
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,030
Now let's go to Amazon is free and we can see these buckets and we don't have too many permissions,

101
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,080
but we should have the permissions to actually get an object.

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,550
So let's try downloading and objects, and that's worked.

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,990
We can see that just downloaded and then maybe we can upload an object as well, just a test that we

104
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,620
can do that.

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,830
So let's try and upload this HD html.

106
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,840
Click on Upload and that works successfully as well.

107
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,570
Now we shouldn't have permissions to delete, so let's just try and make sure that we do have all the

108
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,740
permissions we expect.

109
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,880
So I'm going to try and delete this object, and I get an access denied.

110
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,000
So that's how you enable cross account access.

111
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,200
So just coming back to our diagram quickly, we have our user ID account be in our production account.

112
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,790
That's John, who had an inline identity based policy, which literally just allowed him to assume a

113
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,950
role and account, say the role in accounts.

114
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,980
He has a trust policy to allow John to assume the role, and then we had some permissions to find.

115
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,750
So that's it for cross accounts.

116
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,130
Access hope that was useful.

117
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,510
I'll see you in the next lesson.
