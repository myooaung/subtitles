00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.720
IWC organizations is a service that we can use to collect, organize and manage multiple U.S. accounts.

2
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.590
Now it's also useful creating IWC accounts and having a consolidated bill from multiple IWC accounts.

3
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.060
So it's a really useful tool and we'll see some additional features as well.

4
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.020
In this section.

5
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.770
So organizations allows you to consolidate multiple IWC accounts into an organization, and then you

6
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.290
can centrally managed those accounts.

7
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.190
Now you can also create the accounts using the organization so it can automatically create IWC accounts

8
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.880
for you and then you have that centralized management of them.

9
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.030
Now there are two different feature sets for IWC organizations, and you've really got to remember this.

10
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.270
So the first one is called Consolidated Billing.

11
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.930
Now, what consolidated billing gives you is it gives you the ability to have a single bill in the main

12
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.060
account, which is called the management accounts.

13
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.030
That's the account which you have at the top of the hierarchy.

14
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.400
You connect the other accounts to it by creating an organization in that management accounts.

15
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.220
Now, when you have an organization with multiple accounts, you can then have a consolidated bill.

16
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.430
So that means you have one credit card and one bill.

17
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.760
You can still see where the costs are coming from.

18
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.280
But it means you only pay in one place.

19
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.960
A consolidated bill is also good when you get volume pricing discounts.

20
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.500
So, for example, some services have a tiered structure where the more you use, the less you pay per

21
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.950
unit.

22
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.900
So with a consolidated bill, you actually leverage that capability by aggregating the usage of a service

23
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.980
across your accounts.

24
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.110
The second feature set is known as all features, and this gives you some additional capabilities,

25
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
including service, control policies and tax policies.

26
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.750
So if you need to use those, you have to use, all features will learn about what these are shortly.

27
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.160
And organizations, we have roots accounts.

28
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.030
These are the accounts through which you create the organization and then connects in the other accounts.

29
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.620
And that's also known as the management account used to be known as the master account.

30
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.350
So sometimes you'll see that terminology as well.

31
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.260
We then have organizational units.

32
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.900
These are essentially a type of organizational container, and you can apply things like service control

33
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.690
policies and tax policies to the Blues again.

34
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.070
We'll see how to do that shortly.

35
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.400
So these types of policies are applied to the root accounts auto use with consolidated billing.

36
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.030
You have a paying account and then you have your linked accounts.

37
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.150
So the paying account is the one that actually pays the bill.

38
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.400
Now is independent and it cannot access the resources of the other accounts.

39
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.990
So the linked accounts are essentially the members within the organization.

40
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.780
Those are member accounts and they are also independent.

41
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.500
So essentially, all accounts in the organization are independent.

42
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.170
They have their own roles and users and groups, but they're centrally managed and we can push policies

43
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.850
onto those accounts, which we'll see now.

44
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.190
So we have an organization within that organization.

45
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.300
We have a management account, and the management account essentially is at the root of the hierarchy.

46
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.240
We can then create other accounts like here we have a production accounts and a development account.

47
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.340
We can launch resources in each of these accounts, and these are completely separate from each other.

48
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.660
We can then form this hierarchy within the organization.

49
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.760
So here we have created separate organizational units and we've put our accounts into those organizational

50
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.240
units.

51
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.180
We can then apply service control policies and tax policies to our organizational units.

52
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.930
ASCAP can actually control the maximum available permissions within the account, so it's a security

53
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.390
control that you can apply to your member accounts, as well as your root account to a certain extent

54
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.690
within your organization with organizations.

55
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.270
You can also create accounts programmatically using the organization's API.

56
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.000
And in this case, we've created a test account, deployed some resources and also connected it to the

57
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.340
same 0U as the development account.

58
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:24.350
You can also use IWC single sign on the U.S. so service using an on prem directory as well, like maybe

59
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.670
an Active Directory and this organization, we've enabled all features.

60
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.950
So we get a consolidated bill and we get the usage of service control policies as well.

61
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.860
Another thing we can do in an organization is enable cloud trial in the management account and it will

62
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.260
apply to member accounts as well.

63
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.980
So you've got that centralized control over how you set up your API auditing within your organization,

64
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.380
so that can be really useful for compliance purposes to make sure that all accounts are adhering to

65
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.220
those requirements.

66
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.830
So that's it for the first part of the ferry.

67
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.310
What we'll do in the next lesson is we're actually going to go and create an organization in our IWC

68
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.160
accounts and then we're going to add a new account.

69
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.640
So we have a second linked accounts within our organization.
