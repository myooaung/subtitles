00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,530
This section of the course we're going to talk about the elastic block store and the elastic file system.

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:12,680
So if you've already done the Amazon S3 section of the course at the very beginning I talked about

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,830
the difference between object based storage systems which is what Amazon S3 is and block-based storage

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,410
systems and file-based storage systems which is what EBS and EFS are.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,380
If you haven't seen that it might be worth checking it out but I'll recap most of what I said here.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,890
So with the elastic block store this is a block based storage system and you can think of a block based

7
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,170
storage system as being analogous to a drive that's in your computer so a disk drive in your computer

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,470
which would be a hard disk drive or solid state drive and your operating system of your computer would

9
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:58,340
be able to then access that disk create partitions on that disk create file systems and format those

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,200
file systems and then store data on it.

11
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:08,280
So your operating system can interact with an EBS volume in the same way and it really is a hard disk

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,790
drive or solid state drive that's sort of located somewhere else.

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,600
So it's actually accessed over the network and connected to your EC2 instance you can think of an

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,760
EBS volume then as a virtual hard drive in the cloud and your computer sees it as a device.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:34,310
This is different to an elastic file system with EFS the file system is already created somewhere else

16
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,930
and formatted and then presented to your computer.

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,260
So in this case your EC2 instance then connects to it using a protocol over the network.

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,710
So in this case with EFS it's NFSv1 so you connect to and mount that.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,310
So it's not a device mapping.

20
00:01:52,310 --> 00:02:00,350
It's a mount point on your computer a couple of key differences between EBS and EFS as the diagram

21
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,970
shows what we have here is one EC2 instance accessing one volume.

22
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:10,710
Now you can have multiple volumes attached to the same EC2 instance but you can't have multiple

23
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,910
EC2 instances attached to a single volume so you can't share volumes between computers.

24
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,340
You can detach it from one computer and then attach it to another computer but they can't both access it at

25
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:31,910
the same time with EFS you can have multiple computers accessing the same file system so they can

26
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,610
be reading and writing to the exact same file system and you can have them across multiple Availability

27
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,610
Zones whereas with EBS the volume and the EC2 instance must be in the same availability zone.

28
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:52,620
You can even have an on premises client connecting into your VPC over a VPN and accessing the EFS

29
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,960
file system.

30
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,440
Now one note point is that Linux only for EFS

31
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,280
You can't connect a Windows instance to SFS.

32
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,510
You can pretty much run whatever you want on your EC2 instance with a block storage system.

33
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,470
So with EBS. So that's some high level information on EBS and EFS.

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,050
And now we're going to cover both technologies off in a series of labs.
