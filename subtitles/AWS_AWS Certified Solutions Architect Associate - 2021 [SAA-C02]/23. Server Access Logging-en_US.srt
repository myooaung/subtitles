1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:09,640
Another security feature of S3 is server access logging, with server access logging, you can log the

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,840
requests that are made to S3.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,040
So that means you can log whatever happens.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,940
Innisfree, for instance, somebody uploads or downloads an object.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:27,160
You can have an access log written to notify you or keep a record of that activity.

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,560
And that's useful for security and for access audits.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,680
So the way you do it is you configure a source and a destination.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,670
Buckett, the destination can actually be the same bucket, but it's recommended to be a different bucket.

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,530
Actually, if you use the same bucket, it will actually create a log entry for the writing of a log

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:47,890
entry.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,620
So you might end up with more records in.

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,030
There might be a bit confusing.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,130
So you're better off having a separate bucket.

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,490
Ideally dedicated specifically to that purpose, so we can do a couple of ways, we can enabler for

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,280
the console, you can enable it programmatically and it gives you a bit of information on the page here

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,290
about the format of the logs.

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,040
Another interesting thing is that his best efforts, server log delivery, so pretty much says here

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,420
that you will get a log or you maybe won't get a log.

19
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,170
It's it's not even guaranteed.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,550
And if you do, it could be some hours after the event actually happens.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,100
So let's just go to the console and have a look where we can implement this.

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,060
So we're in a bucket on the properties tab and we've got this entry here, server access logging.

23
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,170
So if I enable this, this will be the source packet.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,500
So this is where the log logging will take place based on activities that happen within this bucket.

25
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,920
So I can choose my bucket and I'm going to follow the recommended advice and use a different bucket

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
for the destination.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:00,190
And I can then put a prefix in as well so I could say deliver it to logs and that will mean that I can

28
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,890
separate out those logs and identify the more easily.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,910
So we can click on Save.

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,460
The other thing that needs to be done is on the destination bucket, we have to assign permissions for

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:21,960
an access control list to the S3 log delivery group when you enable server access logging for the console.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,470
It actually already creates a couple of these permissions for you.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,690
So hopefully that will work.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,400
OK.

35
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:35,180
So what we want to do now is just go back and actually generate some activity on our bucket, so let's

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,880
just upload a couple of files.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,030
I'm just going to.

38
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,540
Choose a couple of these files I've got here, and then we'll just delete those files and that just

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,580
gives us a bit of activity happening.

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,740
As I mentioned before, it can take some time to actually generate the log files.

41
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,170
So you might want to just give it a bit of time and then come back in an hour or two and just see what

42
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,490
log files are being generated.
