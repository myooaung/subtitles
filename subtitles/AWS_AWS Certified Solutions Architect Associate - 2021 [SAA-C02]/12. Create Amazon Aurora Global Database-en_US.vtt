00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.080
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.120
So the last lab for Aurora is on global database.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.010
Now you may remember from the overview section that we have global database.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.120
The key benefit is that you get very low latency replication across regions.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.530
So it's similar to my see call cross region read replicas and that your secondary regions can serve

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.150
read traffic only.

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.090
But the key benefit is that you're able to do so with much lower latency.

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.390
So if your applications are reading the data from your database in your other regions and they need

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.910
to make sure that they get the latest data they can't even handle a you know a few seconds of delay

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.590
then you're going to need to use global database.

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.930
The other key benefit is that it doesn't put much of a performance impacts on your master database so

12
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.180
it's not using the sequel features within the actual database instance itself.

13
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.130
Some of that processing is being offloaded and it's actually putting a minimal impact on your database.

14
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.130
So that's really good.

15
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.760
And what we're going to do now is actually create a configuration in AWS, so let's head over to the

16
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.270
console.

17
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.140
So we're here in the console and I'm just going to go to databases.

18
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.500
I still got my databases deleting from the previous lab and we're going to choose create database.

19
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.350
We're going to choose Aurora and we're going to come down and choose this option here where it says

20
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.470
Aurora global database feature is now available.

21
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.360
Now this is another one that's quite new so may not be on the exam but it's gonna be a quick lab anyway

22
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.650
so let's get into it and remember you will pay for the resources you create on Aurora,

23
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.350
there's no free tier. So we're going to leave mysql compatibility enabled.

24
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.770
We're going to leave Aurora mysql 5.6 and this is where we could choose regional and

25
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.850
if we choose regional we get the option to add Read replicas and to choose service or we can go to global

26
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.090
and we don't get those options for Aurora replicas or service.

27
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.160
So what we do get are these two options where we just choose a profile.

28
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.440
So we'll choose a dev/test template and that's going to reduce the resources that are created.

29
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.110
I'm just going to call this global DB and I'm going to copy that and paste it in as my try that again.

30
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:45.470
Copy that and paste it and paste it as the password paste it to confirm our lead encryption enabled.

31
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.700
I'm going to choose the smallest instance I can but the options are different too with standard Aurora

32
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.390
and you can't go to the smaller instances that I use there you can choose to enable multiple AZ.

33
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.000
And in this case it creates an aurora replica read node in a different AZ, so we know what this is,

34
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.670
this is for scaling read traffic.

35
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.810
I'm going to leave the default VPC enabled and I'm just going to choose

36
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.680
Create database so that I'll take a little while to create and we'll just pause the recording for a

37
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.620
few minutes while that takes place.

38
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.210
That took 15 minutes or so and now we have our global database and available state so you can see that

39
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.860
the role is global for the database configuration.

40
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:42.280
And then we've got our cluster here with the primary instance being in AP-southeast-2 and it's a writer.

41
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.560
So what we want to do now is create a global database in another region and the way we do that is we

42
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.790
highlight at the top here we go to actions and add region and it would tell us that we're adding a secondary

43
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.800
region to the global database.

44
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.860
Secondary regions can serve low latency reads In the unlikely event your database becomes degraded or

45
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.450
isolated in the primary region.

46
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.660
You can promote your secondary region so we can then just go in and select the region we want to go

47
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.370
with.

48
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.670
I'm just gonna choose U.S. East North Virginia and again we get some options here and I'm just gonna

49
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.160
put it down to the smallest instance type available and we also get an option to create a rural replica

50
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.150
in the availability zone in the upper region.

51
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.530
I'm just gonna leave these as defaults and just come down here and click Add region now in the console.

52
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.870
We have the role secondary here and we can see this secondary cluster.

53
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.550
So we have our global database defined here.

54
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.810
Then we have our primary in AP-southeast-2 and then we have our secondary in us-east-1 and then our primary

55
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.960
we have a writer and in our secondary we have a reader reader.

56
00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.710
They'll take a few minutes to provision and once that's complete we'll have a look at how we can promote

57
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.070
our secondary to become its own primary instance and a writable database.

58
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.530
Our secondary global database is now available and if we go and try and can figure out what's going

59
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.390
to happen is it's going to just open the console in US North Virginia because obviously RDS is regional

60
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.880
and we can then actually go in and see the endpoint names and we can go in and have a look at our cluster.

61
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.320
So what we've done is we've now created our secondary region and we have this read only database here.

62
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.810
And as you know it's created a cluster so it's got multiple copies of our database data there and we've

63
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.070
got asynchronous replication going on.

64
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.870
But what happens if our primary region fails and we want to enable our secondary region or perhaps we're

65
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.510
using this as a way to migrate our database from one region to another.

66
00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:01.650
And if so what we need to do is break the replication and then promote this read only database to become

67
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.460
a writable database.

68
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:11.540
So let's head back to the console and see how that's done, we head to our cluster and we choose actions

69
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.010
and remove from global and you see the option here is remove and promote.

70
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.320
So it does it all for you.

71
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:24.560
Removing them promoting global DB cluster 1 in USD-east-1 will stop the replication from global DB cluster

72
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.470
1 in ap-southeast-2 and convert it into a standalone cluster.

73
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.190
So let's press remote remove and promote and we'll get this done.

74
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.900
And we've now got little banner at the top here and it's telling us that it's removing and promoting

75
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:52.130
the secondary global DB class the one from the global database being a few minutes it still says it's

76
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:58.060
promoting but we can see that the database is being created so it's created a separate copy of the database.

77
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.000
So let's go back here and we can now see that this has changed from a global to a regional role and

78
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.390
it's a writer.

79
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.710
So this has now become its own database.

80
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:15.160
You can now write to this database and you can now go and create a cross region replica or even create

81
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.290
a global database and create a secondary global database out of this one in a different region.

82
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.390
So that's all great and that's the end of this lab.

83
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.900
All we need to do now is just go in and delete our databases.

84
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.820
So let's go disable the final creation of the final snapshot.

85
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:44.780
We just need to go in and type delete me and we'll then need to go and do the same thing for our databases

86
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.330
in the Sydney region here

87
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.320
and then once those have deleted you'll then be able to go in and actually delete your clusters.

88
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.540
That won't be available until you've got these deleted so make sure you do because you will pay money

89
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.060
for these raw databases and clean up all your resources and that's it for this lab.

90
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.260
Guys see you in the next lab.
