00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,550
Before we get started with the labs there are a couple of things we need to do to get set up.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,330
Firstly we need to install the Amazon ECS CLI.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,160
So there are two different types of command line interface for ECS.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:22,390
There's the AWS CLI and then there's the ECS-CLI and we're going to use both in this section. What

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,500
you need to do, and its operating system specific, is follow one of these.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,630
Now I've already done it but you'll need to choose for your operating system anyway so follow one of

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,060
these commands depending on your operating system and then there's some verification stuff you can do

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,930
as well.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,800
And the other essential thing you need to do is come down and apply the execute permissions to the binary.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,260
So again operating system specific go ahead and do that should be very simple.

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,770
The other thing we need to do is create an ECS container instance

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,960
IAM role.

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,170
There are two different types of IAM role that we use with ECS clusters.

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,410
Firstly there's the IAm instance role and this is at the container instance level.

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,960
So this is attached to your EC2 instance just as you normally attach a role to your EC2 instance

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,290
to provide access to AWA services.

17
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,460
The other level is at the task level.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,260
So here you're allowing your task specific permissions to interact with other services on the Fargate.

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,390
So there is no EC2 instance that you have control over.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:42,900
So the only place you need to worry about is the task role. AWS recommend that with the IAM instance

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,580
role you limit the permissions to only those that are necessary.

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,020
And the reason being is the tasks can inherit some of the permissions from the container instance at

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,230
the task level.

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:03,530
You can give the IAM permissions that you need to assign to an individual task so you have some granularity

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,580
there in how you assign permissions to tasks.

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,280
We're going to go ahead and do this now and I'm just going to scroll down this web page.

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,190
The instructions are actually here so to create the I guess instance IAM role we're going to go to the

28
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,020
IAM console and we're going to create a role.

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:31,710
We're in the IAM management console now and I'm gonna head down to roles create role and then for the

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:41,330
AWS service type we want to choose elastic container service and then EC2 role for elastic container

31
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,320
service.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,540
So we're trying to allow EC2 instances in the cluster to access ECS. We can click next

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:04,760
and it's already selected the policy for us so we can click Next again and go to review and you can

34
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:13,190
call this whatever you want but it's better to call it ECS instance role and try and capitalize the

35
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,160
same way.

36
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,550
The reason being this is actually picked up in some in the console sometimes when you're creating clusters

37
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,620
and tasks in the console

38
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,440
will leave the role description and click Create role.

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,910
If we now go into the role and have a look at trust relationships we can see that this provides EC2

40
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,890
to Amazon the AWS.com.

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:46,530
So an EC2 instance the ability to assume a role so we're allowing our EC2 instance to assume

42
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,830
a role and then the permissions that we're providing are the permissions in this role.

43
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,810
So have a look at this.

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,210
So we can describe tanks on EC2 and then a whole load of different ECS and elastic container registry

45
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,900
permissions.

46
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:11,130
Another policy that we might want to attach is S3 read only access so let's have a look at S3 read. We

47
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,270
just type S3, actually we should find it.. there it is, read only access and this will give all instances

48
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,140
the ability to pull data from history and that's all we need to do.

49
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,120
We're now set up and we can continue with creating some clusters in the next labs.
