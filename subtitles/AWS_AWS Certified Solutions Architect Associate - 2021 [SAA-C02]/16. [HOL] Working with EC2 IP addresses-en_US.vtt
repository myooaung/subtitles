00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.550
Hi, guys, welcome to this lesson, we're now going to do some hands on practice with IP addresses,

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.430
any C2, so let's head over to the console back in the console.

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.690
We have our running instance from before and you remember this one has multiple network adapters attached,

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.570
so we can say we have two network interfaces.

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.410
What I'm going to do now is go to network interfaces, select the f one adapter, and I'm just going

6
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.930
to detach it and click on Detach.

7
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.450
So I want to show you some behavior and I want to show you how things work without this attached first.

8
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.350
So we should be able to refresh this and find that it's gone from in use to available.

9
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.480
It's not there yet, so let's just give that a moment.

10
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.400
Now it's changed to available.

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.590
So let's come back to two.

12
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.690
Can I click on Refresh again?

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.000
Select, for instance.

14
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
And now we only have the one network interface.

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.470
So what I want to do is I want you to actually note down your IP addresses so we can see the private

16
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.340
IP address here.

17
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.930
Minus 10 zero one one seven seven public IP is free 84 to one free.

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.520
18.

19
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.720
What I'm going to do now is stop my instance.

20
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.820
So I just click Instant State and stop, and then that's just going to take a few moments to shut down,

21
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.950
my instance is now stopped.

22
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.220
And what I want to show you is that we still have the private IP address, but the public IP address

23
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.060
is no longer there.

24
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.780
So that's gone.

25
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.320
So remember, I told you that public IP addresses are dynamic and they get lost when you stop your instance.

26
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.290
So now let's click on start instance again and again, that will take a few minutes to start back up.

27
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.360
So the instance is starting up, it's running, but still initializing.

28
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.730
But straight away, I can see it now has a different public IP address says picks up a new IP address.

29
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.180
Now the reason I detach the network interface is if you have multiple agencies attached and you stop

30
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.110
and start your instance, then you'll find you don't pick up a public IP.

31
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.130
But you can have a public IP as a static IP assigned to your elastic network interface.

32
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.660
That's something we'll do in a moment.

33
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.630
The next thing I wanted to show you is the behavior when you actually reboot your instance instead of

34
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.830
stopping it and starting it.

35
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.890
So again, note down your public IP address.

36
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.000
Mine ends in one eight seven three seven and I'm going to go to instant state and reboot instance and

37
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.960
then click on Reboot.

38
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.780
And let's give it a few minutes.

39
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.350
And what we should find is that it comes back up again and it's still got the same address.

40
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.650
So when you stop your instance, you lose the address.

41
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.190
But when you restart your instance, you retain the address, and that applies to public IP addresses

42
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.910
only unless the clips remember they aren't static, they don't change, and private IPS are also static.

43
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.660
They don't change.

44
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.700
So my instance has rebooted and we can see it still has this address.

45
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.320
What I'm going to do now is go down to elastica clips and we don't have any elastic types in this region

46
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.920
at this stage.

47
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.320
Now, note that it uses region terminology here, which means the elastic types are available within

48
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.120
a region once you do allocate them.

49
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.760
I'm going to allocate an elastic IP.

50
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.410
And again, it chooses a network border group.

51
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.340
We don't need to specify anything there.

52
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.010
It's going to use Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses, and then we just choose Allocate.

53
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.930
So we now have an address.

54
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.530
This is allocated to our accounts, but not used.

55
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.130
So remember, that means you're going to pay for it because it's not in a used state.

56
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.620
So what we need to do now is actually assign this to our elastic network interface.

57
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.330
So what we could do is associate the elastic IP address, choose either instance or network interface.

58
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.770
I'm going to choose network interface and then I'm going to click on this option, and it doesn't actually

59
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.000
show me the name of the interface, so I've actually got to find out what that is.

60
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.540
So what I'm going to do is open, easy to in a separate window.

61
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.830
And then I'm going to come down, go to network interfaces, select the network interface and then copy

62
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.790
the interface I.

63
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.020
And let's just note what that is, ends in 85.

64
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.630
So we might just be able to come back and let's just choose that option, and it's the first option

65
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.200
in the list.

66
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.540
And then we need to associate it with a private IP address.

67
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.520
And if you just click in the box there, it will bring up the private IP for that interface.

68
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.500
You can also choose whether this IP address is allowed to be reassigned Shiites, and so we might want

69
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.430
to reassess yet it.

70
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.370
So let's choose that option and then click on Associate.

71
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.930
So now the elastic IP is associated to the Elastic Network interface.

72
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.170
So if you go down to network interfaces and let's just give it a refresh as well to make sure that we

73
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.900
can see what we need to say and then come down.

74
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.290
And sure enough, we have a public IP and we can see it's an elastic IP address.

75
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.160
Great.

76
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.140
So we have that's what I want to do now is associate it back to my instance.

77
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.210
So I'm going to click on Detach here because sometimes the console gets a bit confused.

78
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.720
It's not actually attached to anything we can scroll across and it says available, we click on Detach.

79
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.790
Choose detach hair.

80
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.240
It says that there is no interface attachment, and then I'm expecting now that when I go back and try

81
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.490
and do it again, sure enough, I can attach it.

82
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.540
So let's choose an instance and then click on Attach.

83
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.750
So now let's go back to our instance, and it will give it a quick refresh here.

84
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.290
I'm going to clear away these information boxes from the top.

85
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:55.630
Choose my instance, and under networking, we should find we have the interface if one and it has a

86
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.530
public IP.

87
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:04.960
Now the key difference now is if I stop this instance and then started again, what we should find is

88
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.730
we're going to lose the public IP associated with if zero interface.

89
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.420
But because we have an elastic interface on if one, that interface should still have an IP address.

90
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.270
So let's stop this instance shouldn't take a minute now, and then we're going to reboot it again as

91
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.110
soon as it stopped.

92
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.890
So my instant stop successfully, I started it again and under networking, I can see that we've lost

93
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.770
the public IP associated with f zero.

94
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.440
But under network interfaces, we still have the public IP associated with f one.

95
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.050
And that's because that's an elastic IP.

96
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.860
So it's static.

97
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.610
So what if we now launch a new instance?

98
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.200
So that are clear these boxes.

99
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.930
Let's launch a new EC2 instance.

100
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.260
And we're going to put it into a different availability zone.

101
00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:01.900
So let's choose the same settings for the instance type and the am-I choose the same VPC, but we're

102
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.720
going to choose the public one b subnet instead.

103
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.900
Click on Next, click through.

104
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.760
We don't need to change anything else.

105
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.210
Choose web access and we'll launch this instance.

106
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.510
So what I want to do now is see if I can really satiate the elastic IP with a different instance.

107
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.500
So maybe my existing instance files for some reason.

108
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.630
So let's terminate this instance.

109
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.070
So that one has failed.

110
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.110
And what we need to do is we've got traffic that's going to the elastic IP address.

111
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.360
So we want to be able to associate that elastic IP address to another instance.

112
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.600
And in this case, I want to do it into a different availability zone.

113
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.460
So let's have a look.

114
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.040
We've now got a second instance running.

115
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.080
So what we can do is we can't re associate the network.

116
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.270
It's out to remember because it's actually within the wrong availability zone.

117
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.040
It's in the public one availability zone, but the elastic IP can be associated.

118
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.720
So let's choose actions that associate address and we have to select the address pair combination here

119
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.280
and disassociate.

120
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.770
And that should now release all elastic IP address.

121
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.450
So let's come down to the last two.

122
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.720
We can see we have an elastic IP address still, and it's not associated.

123
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.120
So what we can do now is go to actions associate elastic IP address.

124
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:34.240
We're going to choose instance, and we only have one running instance because we terminated other instance.

125
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.460
And then we're going to assign it to the instance and click on Associate.

126
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.190
Now I didn't specify the private IP, but it only has one, so it's automatically taken care of that

127
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.640
for me.

128
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:53.080
So now if we go back up two instances, we've got this new instance that still initializing and it should

129
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.070
now have an elastic IP address.

130
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.290
So let's go to networking.

131
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:04.000
Network interfaces come down and we can see it has an allocated IPv4 address, which is an IP.

132
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.060
So that's how we can reassess Shiite elastic types.

133
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.790
That's all I wanted to show you in this particular lesson.

134
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.950
What I'm going to do is terminate my instance and then we're going to go and clean a couple of things

135
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.340
up so we can come down to network interfaces.

136
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:25.000
We can find if one choose actions and delete and then choose delete.

137
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.710
Now this one will be deleted.

138
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.680
This is the if zero, for the instance, we've just terminated, so that should be gone very soon on

139
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.040
its own.

140
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.090
So don't worry about that one.

141
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:40.810
Then we got a last eclipse, and if we just refresh just to make sure that this has been disassociated,

142
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.070
well, it's still terminating.

143
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.570
So I'm going to do it manually.

144
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.910
Let's just disassociate this address.

145
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.540
Great.

146
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:52.270
It's now not attached, which means I can release the elastic IP and then I'm not going to pay for it

147
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.740
because it's not attached to anything.

148
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.760
So that's it for this lesson.

149
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.240
Hope you enjoyed that, and I'll see you in the next lesson.
