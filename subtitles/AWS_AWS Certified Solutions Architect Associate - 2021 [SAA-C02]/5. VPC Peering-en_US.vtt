00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:10.380
We're now going to cover VPC pairing VPC pairing is a way that you can set up a network connection so

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.680
that you can send traffic between V.P. seats using private IP addresses so we can use the site blocks

3
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.110
of our VPC is to send traffic directly to other pieces and those can be in the same account or they

4
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.890
can be in a different account and they can even be in a different region.

5
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.420
And even if they're in a different region they're not going to hit the Internet as they normally would.

6
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.010
They're going to go over the AWB as global backbone so you have bandwidth.

7
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.640
There are no constraints in terms of bandwidth.

8
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.690
It's redundantly connected.

9
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.770
So you think redundantly connect you'll be pieces.

10
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.980
So in the example here we have two accounts and let's say that these are in the same region but they

11
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.420
could be in different regions and each has a different side of block.

12
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.790
And this is essential because you can't have the same side a block in both in both theses.

13
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.360
When you set up a Parent Connection they cannot overlap.

14
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.460
So we have different cyber blocks and we can therefore create a pairing connection between these two

15
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.680
accounts.

16
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.920
And then we want to be able to send traffic between these instances using private IP addresses.

17
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.290
So the other thing that we need to do once we set up the Parent Connection is upbeat the tables.

18
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:38.200
So each round table needs an entry that has the side a block of the opposite VPC and the pairing connection

19
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.200
I.D. And that's generated when we create our parent connection so you can see hey you have around table

20
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:54.490
entries saying that for 10 0 0 0 slash 16 go to the parent connection this and this VPC we say that

21
00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.640
any traffic going to to 1 0 0 0 should go to the Parent Connection I.D. so they can get routed into

22
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:09.120
this BPC so that's how it works and the other thing that you need to do is configure your security groups

23
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:16.080
so that you can allow this traffic and you can do that through setting up IP ranges or you can do it

24
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.910
free setting up the security group by d of the security groups in the offset account.

25
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.510
So either way so let's head over to the console and what we're going to do is we're going to build exactly

26
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.540
this configuration so we're gonna have two accounts in one account we're going to put a E2 instance

27
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.940
in a private subnet and then the other we're going to put an easy to instance in a public subnet and

28
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.680
we're going to SSA each into this instance and we have obviously an Internet gateway allowing us in.

29
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.080
And then from there we're then going to try and paying the private instance here.

30
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.120
So we need to have a rule that allows ICMP and we're going to specify the security group by day of the

31
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.820
security group.

32
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:09.320
This instance is attached to so let's go to the console and I mean the VPC dashboard and this is the

33
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.610
account to on the right hand side and I'm going to go down to peering connections and try to pay connection

34
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.490
is going to call it my hearing

35
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.520
BBC and I now specify I'm going to my BP say I'm going to choose the custom BBC we created and I can

36
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:40.170
choose another account and I'm just going to copy this account number to my clipboard so you now need

37
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.120
the accounts I.D. of the opposite accounts and the then me to specify whether it's in this region or

38
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.810
another region.

39
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.540
So you could specify what any other region in this case we're going to just choose this region and we're

40
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:07.670
going to put in the VPC idea of the BBC an account one so let's just go to another call another browser

41
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.870
session here and I'm going to go to the VPC is and I have this VPC here which I want to get the idea

42
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.110
of

43
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.320
I'm going to come back here and paste that VPC idea in and create Parent Connection.

44
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.990
So what will happen now is a acceptance request will be sent to the other VPC.

45
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.160
So let's go back here.

46
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.500
Go to parent connections and we now have this parent pending acceptance message so we can just select

47
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:51.770
this option and accept request and it gives a summary of what's happening and we can click yes except

48
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.320
and it says our VPC Parent Connection has been established and then it warns us that to send and receive

49
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.950
traffic across this connection you must get around to the paired VPC in one or more of your BPC round

50
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.260
tables.

51
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.770
So let's do that now.

52
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.380
So I'm gonna head over to round tables

53
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.200
and I'm going to choose this round table here which is associated with my account the VPC that I want

54
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.080
to set up as part of this pairing connection and you'll see it already has around to tend to 1.0 to

55
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.690
zero which is the local round.

56
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:37.420
So I want to put in the side a block of the other accounts or the other BPC that I want to connect to.

57
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.000
And we can now just go down as a pairing connection and we've got a couple of Parent Connection ideas

58
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.840
because I set one up before.

59
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.240
So let me just go back and verify which one I want to use.

60
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.200
And so this pairing connection I.D. finishes in nine to eight.

61
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.120
So let's go back to round tables and select

62
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.740
this round table click edit routes and let's just go down to grab this before I forget it.

63
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.140
There we go.

64
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.060
Nine to eight and we're gonna do tend 0 0 0 0

65
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.960
slash 16

66
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.000
and save rounds and that looks great.

67
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.180
And it tells us exactly as well.

68
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.580
And so we're now going to do the same thing in this account.

69
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.010
And in this case I'm going to associate my public around table.

70
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.220
I'm gonna go to rounds and it rounds.

71
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.560
Let's go down to the parent connection.

72
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.360
There it is.

73
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.460
And this case I want to pretend a 1 0 0 slash 16.

74
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.450
So the sort of block of the account.

75
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.930
1

76
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.730
so that's all set up.

77
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.780
Now before we do the security breach let's just go to the easy to console and launch a couple of instances.

78
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:11.470
And I'm just going to launch an instance with the Amazon minutes to I am I I'm going to put this in

79
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:20.390
my custom VPC and I'm going to put it in public to a and that's all I really need to do is go to security

80
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:27.830
group give it web access we've got quite a few ports quite a few rules in here we only really need SSA

81
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.300
for this one because that's the only inbound port protocol that we need

82
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.060
right.

83
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.630
So that's launching we can head back to VPC console and I'm going to go to the other account and do

84
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.170
the same

85
00:07:49.860 --> 00:08:03.150
so instances and launch Amazon Linux going to choose this VPC and I have one private subnet and let's

86
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.700
go forward choose our security groups and I'll have a security group pick what I just call private access

87
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:13.820
at the moment it has SSA age 22 allowed we don't actually need that we're going to configure that security

88
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.510
group shortly

89
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.810
so those easy two instances are now launching.

90
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:28.760
And what I want to do is go to security groups and I want to find my the private access security group.

91
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:39.030
That's the one which I associated with my instance and account 1 and I don't need that rule.

92
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.840
The rule that I do need is ICMP before.

93
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:50.720
And what I want to do is I want to lock this to the security group by d of the security group in the

94
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.670
Alvaro account.

95
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.010
So back here we've got a Web access security group

96
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.860
and I'm just gonna take the security group by day

97
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.180
and I'm going to pay start in here.

98
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.420
You can't look it up because it's in a different accounts.

99
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:13.340
You can't just type ESG like we normally do and see a list of security groups come up.

100
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.400
Well I've put that one in their.

101
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:24.910
So now we have an inbound law allowing ICMP from and we can see the account I.D. and the security group

102
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.080
I.D. of the security group in account too.

103
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.710
So just going back here to sort of make it clear what we've done we've set up a easy to instance an

104
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:41.200
account one an easy to instance and a public submit an account to which we're about to connect into.

105
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.210
So we've got port 22 open we had some other rules but they weren't really relevant.

106
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:55.240
And then what we're trying to test is that this security group rule will allow us to send data to the

107
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.020
private IP address of this instance in the private subnet over the parent connection.

108
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.040
So let's go back and I want to go across to account too.

109
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:09.730
And I'm just going to go back to the easy to management console and take the public IP address of the

110
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:17.800
instance and I'm at the command line now and I'm just going to secure shell into that instance

111
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.280
and we're connected.

112
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.780
So let's go back now and in the other account.

113
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.070
So this is the account one in our diagram.

114
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:38.030
I'm going to go through our running instance and take it private IP address and let's go back here and

115
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.850
let's see if we can ping that address and we can.

116
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.390
That's great.

117
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:47.720
So we've got a connection that we're able to ping the instance in the private subnet in the other account

118
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.630
via the BPC Parent Connection.

119
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:57.770
So just to make sure that that's exactly what's happening let's go back here to security groups and

120
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.700
I'm going to remove that rule and safe.

121
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.330
And then just go back and verify that's broken the connection

122
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.110
so those are the main things to know about VPC parent connections.

123
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.990
Another one which I want to cover with you is pairing multiple V.P. it's more than two BPC.

124
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.090
So in this case we got four.

125
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.710
But you can work this out how this would relate to additional BPC.

126
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.740
So the point is that a VPC Parent Connection goes between one BPC and another VPC.

127
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.520
So if we only have one parent connection here and one parent connection here it means that this top

128
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:46.590
left my CPC can speak to this VPC and same for this CPC at the bottom here can speak to this one on

129
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.360
the top right hand side.

130
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:54.120
It doesn't mean that this VPC here can talk through this VPC to this one and that would be known as

131
00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:00.760
transitive period it's not allowed so the configuration you do need is to have this extra connection.

132
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:09.070
That means that it's a one to one connection between each VPC and another VPC so this VPC at the bottom

133
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.030
here needs to have a connection with this one to be able to communicate.

134
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.470
Likewise this VPC needs to connect to this one has a can have a connection to this one in order to be

135
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:23.830
able to communicate and this CPC also needs a connection to the bottom VPC to communicate between its

136
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.850
resources.

137
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:32.850
So you can't transition pairing with BPC with BPC pairing you can do transit gateways and that's gonna

138
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.240
be a subject for another lap

139
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:45.530
so that's it for this lab to clean up your lab you might want to go in and delete your peering connections

140
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:52.160
and then you can go into your room tables and remove the root table entry which will be shown as a black

141
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.480
hole now because the VPC pairing connection has been deleted and then go into your security groups and

142
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.460
remove any rules that you added that reference security groups from the other account and that's it

143
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.790
for now.
