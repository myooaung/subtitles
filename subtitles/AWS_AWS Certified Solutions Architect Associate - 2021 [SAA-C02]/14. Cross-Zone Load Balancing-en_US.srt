00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:12,830
Cross load balancing is a feature of elastic load balancers, which attempts to evenly distribute traffic

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,630
to registered instances.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:21,200
So when cross own load balancing is enabled, each load balance node will distribute traffic across

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,590
registered targets in all availability zones.

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,340
When cross own load balancing is disabled, each load balancer no distributes traffic only across the

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,610
registered instances in its availability zone.

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,100
And this can result in an uneven distribution of the incoming traffic.

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,650
With application load balances, cross own load balancing is always enabled with network load balancers

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,420
and gateway load balances.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,290
Cross line load balancing is disabled by default, but can be enabled.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,400
Now, the best way to really understand this is with a diagram.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,570
We have an elastic load balancer sets up, and as you can see, we have five active instances spread

13
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,270
unevenly across availability zones.

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,990
Now, the load balance is going to provision nodes in each of these subnets.

15
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:21,550
And when traffic comes in, that traffic is going to get split, so 50 percent will go to one subnet

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,560
and 50 percent will go to the other.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,000
And of course, that results in an uneven distribution of the traffic because each of the free targets

18
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,930
in Zone A is going to receive sixteen point six percent of the traffic because it's getting one third

19
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:46,330
of 50 percent and an availability zone B. We're going to get 25 percent of the traffic distributed to

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,910
these nodes so they can have a higher distribution.

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,500
That's because there's two instances splitting the 50 percent of incoming traffic.

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,800
So that's cross zone load balancing being disabled.

23
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,290
Now let's look what happens when it's enabled.

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,050
We've got the same situation and the connections are coming in.

25
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:11,800
But this time, 60 percent of the traffic is going to go to the Subnet and Availability Zone II, which

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,830
means that each of the targets will get 20 percent.

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,360
The other 40 percent will get split into availability zone B, which means the targets that also only

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,040
receive 20 percent of the traffic.

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,590
So now we have an even distribution of the connections to AC two instances.

30
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,490
Now this is going to help you to evenly distribute those incoming connections across your back end instances.
