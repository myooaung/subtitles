00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.630
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.130
We can't cover security groups in this lab and we've covered security groups quite a bit in this cause

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.580
so far especially in the last section.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.790
But there's more to go over.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.400
Now you may recognize the left hand side of this diagram from the previous section and what I've done

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.850
is I've removed some things that are not relevant so Availability Zones and subnets are not relevant

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.390
to security groups because security groups operate within your VPC so it doesn't matter where your instances

8
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.860
are sat.

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.580
They can be in any subnet in any availability zone and you can still apply a security group to them.

10
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.740
Now security groups operate as essentially firewalls running at the instance level.

11
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.080
And specifically they operate at the network interface level.

12
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.090
Now we're going to cover this configuration in a bit more detail shortly but firstly I just want to

13
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.260
go across to these security group tables that I have here.

14
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.520
So this is showing the detail security group and the default configuration of a custom security group.

15
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.810
So sorry if that's a bit confusing but what I mean is that when you create your accounts you have a

16
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.800
default security group in your default BPC and its rules are configured like this but whenever you create

17
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.980
custom security groups within that VPC or in any other VPC the configuration is slightly different.

18
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.820
So let's just review that.

19
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.660
So for each security you have inbound and outbound rules.

20
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.620
Now for the inbound rules what you're looking at is the destination port and protocol.

21
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.150
So just try and remember that as you specify the source where the traffic's coming from.

22
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.770
But the protocol in the port is actually the protocol import on the destination.

23
00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:04.050
So this essentially says that the source is the security group I.D. which allows any instance that's

24
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.680
attached to the security group to talk to any other instances attached to the security group and on

25
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.150
any protocol and.

26
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.910
Then for the outbound rules we have the wildcard for IP before and V six.

27
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.580
So this just means any destination for either IP V4 or IP B6.

28
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.710
And again as any protocol any port when you create a custom security group the detail is that there

29
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.960
are no inbound rules but there's the deal.

30
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.550
The allow us are there for outbound.

31
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.330
So that means if you just create a custom security group and save it you would be able to send traffic

32
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.530
outbound from an easy to instance that's attached that has the security group attached to it but you

33
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.030
wouldn't be out to receive any traffic.

34
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.310
So you actually have to set up those rules.

35
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.580
Now as we can see here we've been a security group.

36
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.180
You can specify the I.D. of a security group.

37
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:09.240
You can specify an IP address and you can also specify a site a block and so one of the secure configurations

38
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.780
that we showed in the Elastic Load Balancing lab is where we're using the names of the security groups

39
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.350
the security group I.D. to restrict traffic.

40
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.400
So what we can see in this configuration is that the Internet facing LP which received traffic from

41
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.380
the Internet allows traffic to come in on port 80 from anywhere and then the outbound protocol refers

42
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.650
to the traffic being sent to the web front end.

43
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.950
So it allows you to sell send traffic using poor data to the public to security group and in turn the

44
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.760
public see two security group only is only allowed to receive traffic from the public Alby security

45
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.150
group and then you repeat that free to the back end.

46
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.380
And if you had the database layer as well we would do exactly the same thing.

47
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.600
And when we get into the RDX section of the course we're going to set up a multi tier architecture of

48
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.510
RDX on the back end and we'll see this in action but for now let's head over to the console and we're

49
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.190
just going to have a look at security groups.

50
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:23.730
So I mean the VPC dashboard and I'm going to head down to security group's and you can see here that

51
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:33.860
you have default security groups and these are created within each of these pieces so if we have a look

52
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:44.030
at these security groups and I haven't actually edited this one this is the default VPC security group

53
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.670
in a BBC that we just created recently and you can see that there is an inbound role and that role allows

54
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.370
traffic from this source to these destination protocols and ports and the source is the security group

55
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.030
itself.

56
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.430
So you can see that up here.

57
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.740
So the source is the same as itself.

58
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:13.080
So that means if you attach this to us and an instance or a series of instances they'll be able to talk

59
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.920
to each other by virtue of the fact that they're all part of the same security group.

60
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:29.690
Now if we then created a custom security group let's just call this test that's g and we need to copy

61
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:40.250
that down into the description and let's just put that into our custom VPC so we've now created a custom

62
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.090
security group and it doesn't matter whether it's in a custom BBC or somewhere else.

63
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.720
So we don't have any inbound rules which means if you attached a security group to some instances they

64
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.680
won't be able to receive any traffic or at least not because of this security group.

65
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:04.440
Remember you can attach multiple security groups to an instance you can have as many instances as you

66
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.420
want in a security group and you can attach up to five security groups to an individual instance

67
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.700
are things you remember about security groups just going back to the diagram here is that state full

68
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.190
say when you send any traffic coming in the return traffic is allowed by default.

69
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.330
So if you remember the Internet facing I'll be here as an inbound protocol port of 80 the only outbound

70
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.910
protocol port it has is also 80 and that's going to the public see two instances.

71
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.970
So there's no rule to allow traffic back out to the Internet to the clients from which it received the

72
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.670
traffic because as a state for firewall it knows about the connections and it allows or return traffic

73
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.160
to go back out again.

74
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.550
So you only need to specify the rule in one direction.

75
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.360
Now going back to the rules we can have a list of rules and what happens is each rule is evaluated until

76
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:14.230
a permit is encountered or otherwise it just continues through the list until the end where there's

77
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.690
an implicit deny.

78
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.640
So essentially that means all rules of permit rules.

79
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.360
So there's a rule in here that allows traffic in a certain direction on a certain protocol and Paul

80
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.670
if it doesn't exist the traffic gets dropped there's no such thing as deny rule.

81
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.340
There are only permit rules.

82
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:42.910
So the rules are evaluated in order until a permit is encountered for the traffic that's being filtered

83
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:49.010
and if a permit isn't encountered then the traffic just gets dropped which essentially means there's

84
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:58.270
an implicit deny at the end of the list so one more thing to mention is the security groups can be changed

85
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.670
while instances are running and the effects are pretty much immediate and we've seen this in some of

86
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:09.460
the labs before where we've made some changes and immediately the change is implemented.

87
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:16.480
And if you're allowing a certain port through as soon as you save that security group very quickly you'll

88
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.390
be able to then send that traffic.

89
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.030
So you don't have to take your instances down.

90
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.440
You don't have to reboot them or wait for any periods of time.

91
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.300
So let's just go back to the console and look at rules that a bit more detail.

92
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:43.890
So when we add a rule we get to choose from custom DCP or UDP or ICMP or we can go down and choose All

93
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:54.580
TGP UDP or ICMP and beneath that we have options for a traffic option or we have well-known ports that

94
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.140
are defined.

95
00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.720
So you select SSA h it fills in Port 22 because that's a well-known port.

96
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:08.730
Similarly does 25 for a 70 P and DNS UDP fifty free and so on.

97
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:17.330
So we can just go down this list and select the protocols that we want to allow and we can then choose

98
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.250
to specify the source.

99
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:27.920
And as you can see here in this information you can specify a single IP address an IP address range

100
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.760
inside the notation or you can specify a security group by D.

101
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.190
And if you want to specify a specific IP address this is the format.

102
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:47.800
So you specify the IP address and then slash 32 on the end to mean this exact address so let's just

103
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.510
copy and paste it in here.

104
00:09:53.230 --> 00:10:02.610
So what this rule will do now is it will allow hygiene CPS inbound from this IP address and know over

105
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.880
IP address because we've got Slash 32 on the end

106
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:18.540
we can also select anywhere and it will just automatically fill in 0 8 0 0 0 0 slash 0 which is the

107
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:27.550
IP V4 version of anywhere or colon colon slash 0 which is the IP v 6 version that means anywhere or

108
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:33.180
we can select my IP and actually goes and picks up the IP that you're connected from.

109
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.970
So I'm just going to cancel out of that and delete the security group because we don't need it now.

110
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.050
That's it for this lab.

111
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:46.330
It was really just to go over some of the concepts around security groups again and we've been using

112
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.160
them throughout the course and we're going to keep using them throughout the rest of the course.

113
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.820
So you should have great hands on knowledge of security groups by the end of this course.
