00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.220
Hi, guys, another concept you need to understand for the exam is that the like you now similar to

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.000
a dead letter?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.280
Q This is actually a configuration that you apply to a stand a Q or a FIFO.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.500
Q And the purpose of the delay?

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.820
Q is that you have a duration in seconds and within that time any message is added to the Q will not

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.480
be visible.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.120
So what it does is it gives your consumers a bit more time to process the messages.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.970
So in this case, a producer has put a message into the Q, but for this duration of time, the delay

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.950
seconds, it won't be visible.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.970
So if the function here actually tries to find messages in the Q, the message cannot be found and returned.

11
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.470
Now, after a period of time, the message will become visible and at that point the consumer can then

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.190
process the message so you can apply the configuration to the queue or you can apply the configuration

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.040
in the API call that's made from the producer.

14
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:10.110
So you can specify the delay seconds at the queue level, or your producer can specify how long to delay

15
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560
the specific message for when it enters the queue.

16
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.540
And that's what we're going to have a look at how to do now by going over to the command line and using

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.650
the command line.

18
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.060
The first command I'm going to run is Adewusi.

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.620
Ask us help and let's have a look at some of the available commands so we can create a queue.

20
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.510
We can get the queue attributes in the URL, we can list our queues and we can receive a message and

21
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.500
send a message.

22
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.820
And there's lots of others as well.

23
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.590
But those are some of the key ones that we're going to have a look at.

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.410
So let's just quit out of this and I'm going to type HWC excuse list cues.

25
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.500
And so this gives me a list of useful queue names.

26
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.580
I'm going to take one of these and that's my standard queue.

27
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.910
Just quit out of there and put that into the command line.

28
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.930
So I've got it in memory.

29
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.990
And the other one I want to look at now is eight of us ask us, send a message and let's put help on

30
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.300
to that.

31
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.390
So what we need to do is have a look at these command attributes here.

32
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.430
So I'm going to copy those, come back up, paste this in, and I'm going to specify a delay of 10 seconds.

33
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.900
I'm going to put the message body as a test message one.

34
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.910
And then what I need to do next is just copy that URL from before and paste that in.

35
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.700
So now I've got send message, I've got the query URL specified.

36
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.230
So this message will go into our standard queue.

37
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.770
The message body is test message one and I've specified a delay of ten seconds, so let's hit enter

38
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.250
and that's run and then let's come back to our standard queue and let's pull four messages and we can

39
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.290
see there's nothing there.

40
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.310
So the message is currently not visible in the queue.

41
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.630
Now it's turned up.

42
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.690
So that was the delay.

43
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.320
If I just quit out of here and I'm going to put another message in the queue and now, again, we're

44
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.050
going to have to wait ten seconds before that message appears and then it will be available at that

45
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.040
point only for consumers to actually process it.

46
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.300
So there it is.

47
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.450
That was ten seconds.

48
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.210
And we've now got both of our messages in the queue.

49
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.050
So delay queues, postpone the delivery of messages to a queue for a number of seconds, messages sent

50
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.970
to the door like you remain invisible to consumers then for the duration of whatever that delay period

51
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.270
is.

52
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.210
And the default is zero seconds and no delay.

53
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.580
And the maximum is nine hundred seconds.

54
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.230
Fifteen minutes for stand.

55
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.210
Accused of changing the setting does not affect the delay of messages already in the queue, only new

56
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.900
messages.

57
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.610
Whereas for FIFO cuz this affects the delay of messages that are already in the queue as well.

58
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.780
And you can specify the delivery delay at the Q level.

59
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.750
So we just saw how to do it at the send message API.

60
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.290
But let's go back to the console and see where we can do it at the Q level.

61
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.680
So I'm back in the console, I'm going to configure my Q and then here we have delivery delay in seconds

62
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.260
so we can say it's zero seconds is the minimum and fifteen minutes is the maximum and you can change

63
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.790
that between seconds and minutes.

64
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.500
So that's the like use.

65
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.490
And in the next lesson we're going to cover the visibility timeout.
