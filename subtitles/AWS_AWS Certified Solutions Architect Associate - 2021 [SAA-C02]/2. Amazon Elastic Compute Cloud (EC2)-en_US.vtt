00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.690
In this lesson, I'm going to teach you about the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.330
Easy, too easy two is one of the most important services on IWC.

3
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.670
It's been around a long time, and it also is used by many other high level services, as you'll see

4
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.110
as we go through the course.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.590
Now, it is a way that we can run virtual servers in the cloud.

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.900
So in the IWC data center, there are host servers and all nice house servers we can run are two instances.

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.900
And this is using server virtualization.

8
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.240
So just as we saw in the last lesson, that means we've got a pool of physical hardware.

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.130
And then on top of it, we can then run our own virtual instances.

10
00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:00.730
Now the ETC hosts are managed by IWC, and then you manage the easy to instance that you run on top

11
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.100
of the IWC host servers.

12
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:11.560
So the easy to instance is essentially a virtual server, and it has a certain amount of CPU and RAM

13
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.310
and storage and network capability assigned to it.

14
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.980
And it then has an operating system.

15
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.380
The operating systems can be Windows or Linux or even Mac OS, which is quite new.

16
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.630
And then on top of that, you install your applications and run whatever it is.

17
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.510
You want to run on your virtual server and you have full Skype to do whatever you want with your virtual

18
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.930
server.

19
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.910
When we launch our instances, we have to choose something called an instance type.

20
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.520
And this gives us different combinations of CPU and memory and storage and networking.

21
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.070
As I mentioned, the easy two instances themselves can run different operating systems.

22
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.940
And at the moment, you can run Windows and Linux and Mac OS.

23
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.880
So how do we launch an instance?

24
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.290
Well, we can simply go into the IWC management console and choose to launch an easy to instance.

25
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.250
When we do that, we have to select an instance type.

26
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.610
And here's a few examples there's hundreds of options, but these are some examples of different hardware

27
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.070
profiles that you would be able to choose.

28
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.010
And this will also dictate the cost.

29
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.650
It will dictate the performance and also the cost.

30
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.210
Then we have to choose something called an Amazon machine image.

31
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.970
And am I the am-I is essentially an image that contains the operating system and any configuration settings.

32
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.000
So it's the configuration, for the instance.

33
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.300
So we're choosing the hardware profile and then we're choosing the operating system and any configurations

34
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.830
that we want to apply to.

35
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.760
Our instance and am-I is actually created from something called an EBS snapshot, and that is a point

36
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.530
in time back up of an instance.

37
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.590
So that means you can create an instance, configure it a certain way, create a snapshot, create an

38
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.470
ally from the snapshot and then create a new instance the same as the one that you customized yourself.

39
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.110
And we'll see how to do that as well later in the course.

40
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.640
So you can create a customized am-I and then use that to deploy your own customized profiles.

41
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.530
So what are the benefits of easy to do?

42
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.770
Well, it gives you elastic computing.

43
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.530
You can launch hundreds or thousands of EC2 instances within a matter of minutes.

44
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.480
You've got complete control.

45
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.420
So the easy two instances, you have full administrative or root access to them.

46
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.110
That means you can configure them however you want.

47
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.370
You have that full scope of management.

48
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.320
It's flexible.

49
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.590
You get a choice of different instance types, operating systems and also software packages that can

50
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.700
come pre-installed.

51
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.660
It's very reliable.

52
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.220
It offers very high levels of availability, and the instances can be rapidly commissioned and replaced.

53
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.810
It's also secure.

54
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.910
It's fully integrated with Amazon VPC and security features.

55
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.970
And lastly, it's inexpensive, it's fairly low cost and you only pay for what you use.

56
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:21.010
So that's a great use case in terms of the financials of using EC2 compared to owning your own infrastructure.

57
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.570
So that's it for the ferry.

58
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.160
In the next lesson, we're going to go into the console and launch an in instance.
