00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,710
Migration and transfer services are tools that you're really going to want to use.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,950
If you're migrating from on premises into the cloud, there's also other use cases migrating between

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,780
different resources in the cloud as well.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,770
But primarily, it's going to be migrating from an on premise infrastructure.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,890
And lots of the eight up U.S. exam questions are going to pose scenarios along that kind of line.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,960
So in this section, we'll look at some of the services you can use, like the Database Migration Service,

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:35,490
the Server Migration Service, AWOL data sync, snowmobile and Snowbowl, as well as importing and exporting

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,420
virtual machines.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,220
Now, this is quite a short section and it's mostly faery based because you don't need to go into too

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,250
much detail or spend too much time on these topics.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,360
But make sure that you do go through these lessons and understand the level of detail that I provide.
