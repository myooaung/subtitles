00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.260
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.230
Directory service has been around for a little while, comes up on the exam every now and then, sometimes

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.510
a bit more than other exams.

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.610
So it really depends what you get on the day.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.860
But I definitely want to cover this one off in a reasonable amount of detail so that you definitely

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.800
understand it now.

7
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.480
The key thing is there's free different services underneath a directory service that I want to talk

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.130
about today.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.670
There's the AWB managed Microsoft Active Directory.

10
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.250
There's simple aid and there's a connector.

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.430
And you need to understand all three of these.

12
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.470
You need to understand the differences between them and you need to understand when you would use one

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.460
over another one.

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.010
So first off, I've just taken this Adewusi diagram.

15
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.550
I didn't want to try and recreate this myself because there's quite a lot going on there.

16
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.580
But it just articulates a bit about the Microsoft active directory.

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.190
So this is a managed Microsoft active directory within the AWB cloud.

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.780
Now, one of the things is you can set up what's called a trust relationship.

19
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.930
Now, I don't know if you come from a Microsoft background or not.

20
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.680
I do.

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.450
I did a lot of work with Active Directory, but many people will be coming into this and I don't really

22
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.170
understand it.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.780
But what this means is you set up something called a trust relationship between two active directories,

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.360
and it enables users in one active directory to be able to access resources in another active directory.

25
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.740
So that's simply all it is.

26
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.330
It's just a trust relationship between those two active directories.

27
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.570
So with a mix of ID, you can set up a trust relationship with your on premises active directory.

28
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.210
You might do this because you have your users here and you don't want to recreate them here.

29
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.490
You'd rather use a trust relationship now from a security and governance perspective.

30
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.830
That means you're keeping your users in one place, but you are extending their reach, you extending

31
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.130
their ability to authenticate to services somewhere else.

32
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.290
Now, people might like this because it's a single set of governance in terms of the user accounts,

33
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.150
they're in one place.

34
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.440
It also means that security credentials, like the passwords or the hashes of the passwords are not

35
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.160
stored here.

36
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.760
They're only stored on premises in your active directory that you manage yourself so you can then access

37
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.850
services within and within Awassa.

38
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.450
Excuse me.

39
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.230
And one of the things you can do, for instance, with your Windows two instances is you can join those

40
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.640
to the AWB, Microsoft Nancy directories so they can become computers that are part of the AWB Microsoft.

41
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.240
They are managed by the Microsoft Active Directory.

42
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.680
You can also connect to applications and services within AWA, such as work docs and workspaces.

43
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.320
You could connect to a Addy's Federation Services server to then extend authentication through to another

44
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.340
activity or actually maybe in Azerrad, for example.

45
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.560
So this slide gives you a quite a little bit of information about what you can do with Microsoft idea.

46
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.040
Let's talk look at a bit more of the background detail.

47
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.170
So it's a fully managed service on Adewusi infrastructure.

48
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.100
It's the best choice if you have more than 5000 users or you need to set up a trust relationship.

49
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.830
So if you're if you have a large user base, you want to have the full Aiwass managed ad or if you need

50
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.870
to set up a trust relationship and or because you might have the scenario where you have plus five thousand

51
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.980
users and you also need to set up trust relationships with other directory services.

52
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.870
So this is the service you need to use for those two scenarios.

53
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.970
It runs on a Windows server.

54
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.150
You can perform things like schema extensions.

55
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.500
It works with SharePoint, SQL Server, dot net apps, lots more.

56
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.500
So critically, you can set up those trust relationships to extend authentication from on premises active

57
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.720
directories into the cloud.

58
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.020
On premise, users and groups can access resources in every domain then using SSL.

59
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.270
So single sign on it does require a VPN or a direct connect connection.

60
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.640
It can also be used as a standalone active directory so you don't have to set up a trust relationship.

61
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.940
You can use it as just your one and only active directory configuration in the cloud.

62
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.610
When it's used as a standalone active directory, users can access third party applications such as

63
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.540
Microsoft Office 365 through Federation.

64
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.410
So we saw that in the diagram where you use Federation Services Server.

65
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.630
The next service is simple.

66
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.060
And so this is not a Microsoft that is directly, but it's on a simple active directory.

67
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.910
So it's something similar, but with fewer features.

68
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.050
It's inexpensive, it's active directory compatible.

69
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.300
We have common directory features.

70
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.050
So standalone, fully managed, direct.

71
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.050
On AWEX cloud, it's generally the least expensive option and it's the best choice if you have less

72
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.290
than 5000 users and you don't need advanced active directory features, it's powered by the sand.

73
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.480
Before Active Directory compatible server, you can create users and control access to applications

74
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.350
on us.

75
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.000
And it provides a subset of the features provided by AWB.

76
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.700
Microsoft Active Directory features include that you can manage user accounts and groups, apply group

77
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.570
policies, use Kerberos based SSA and support joining Linux or Windows based, etc. instances.

78
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.670
It's also compatible with workspaces.

79
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.550
Work Docs, work Milankovic quicksort and you can sign into the AWEX management console with simple

80
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.700
ADA user accounts to manage resources.

81
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.620
It's available in two editions.

82
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.410
So you have small, which is up to 500 users or approximately two thousand objects, and then you have

83
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.820
large, which is up to five thousand users or approximately 20000 objects to directory services and

84
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.490
DNS servers on two different subnets were Beninese.

85
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.740
So it's highly available.

86
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.250
It does not support these features.

87
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.920
Now, these are mostly features that you associate with Microsoft that are directories.

88
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.580
So we've got DNS dynamic update, schema extensions, multifactor authentication, communication over

89
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.190
secure LDAP, partial A-T commanders and ephemeral transfer.

90
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.040
You don't need to know all of those are just understand that it is a simple version of active directory.

91
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.350
So it doesn't support lots of these features.

92
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.080
Most of those are not going to come up in an exam question.

93
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.990
Perhaps schema extensions could do so.

94
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.770
Just be aware that it doesn't support schema extensions and it's not compatible with OD's Escorial server.

95
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.060
It also does not support trust relationships with other domains.

96
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.910
And this is another thing that could come up in an exam question.

97
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.770
Again, you should use the AWB managed Microsoft that is directly for that.

98
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.280
Instead, for the third service here we have a connecter.

99
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:11.050
So it connects it gives you the ability to connect your existing self managed active directory.

100
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.140
So this is most likely going to be on premises, though.

101
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.450
It could be running in EC2 as well.

102
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:23.890
And you need to connect that into Awassa so that you have the ability to sign into the management console,

103
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:31.840
to access to resources and so on, so you can still seamlessly join your windows to instances if something

104
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.800
went wrong with the slide there.

105
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:40.540
But you can connect your AC to instances to your own premises, as if to actually domain using add connector.

106
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:47.290
You have Federated Signing's database management console by mapping active directory identities here

107
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.020
to Adewusi IAM roles.

108
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:58.720
So you Mappin add your identity or user account to an IAM role in the management console and that user

109
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.480
then has the privileges that are assigned to that role.

110
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.320
So you can also sign into these applications as workspaces.

111
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.460
Work docs work email by using your active directory credentials.

112
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.180
Now again, you have to use a VPN or Direct Connect connection.

113
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.100
So let's have a look at a bit more background.

114
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:22.240
This is a directory gateway for redirecting directory requests to your on premise active directory.

115
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:28.510
It eliminates the need for directory synchronization and the cost and complexity of hosting a federation

116
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.260
infrastructure.

117
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.070
It connects your existing on premise add to us.

118
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.660
So this is the best choice.

119
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.880
When you want to use an existing ad with Adewusi services, it comes in two sizes.

120
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.100
So you've got the small up to five hundred users and the launch for up to 5000 users.

121
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:51.460
Now you're VPC must be connected to your on premise network via VPN or Direct Connect when users log

122
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:59.140
in to AYSO applications and connects a forward signing request to your on premise active directory domain

123
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.710
controllers, you can also join AC2 instances to your on premise.

124
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.480
Add through add connector and you can log into the AWEX management console.

125
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.020
So just to compare these particular to.

126
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.290
So I'd connect on the left and simple idea on the right for 80 connect.

127
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:19.930
So you have to have an existing active directory, whereas with simple add it is an active directory

128
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.380
itself.

129
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:26.420
So it's a standalone ad based on Sambor we've added Kenexa existing active to actually users can access

130
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.670
AWEX assets via Iame roles, whereas with simple ID, this supports user accounts, groups, group policies

131
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:39.400
and domains within the database, Hédi connects or supports multifactor authentication using radius.

132
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:47.770
Simple data does not support MFA, but it does use Kerberos by single Sinon and it also doesn't support

133
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.910
Trus relationships.

134
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:54.940
Just one more slide, and this is to understand some of the use cases that might put you towards one

135
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.900
of these services.

136
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.260
So starting at the top, we've got the directory service for Microsoft.

137
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.910
And so again, this is a.

138
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:07.580
Managed full Microsoft satisfactory running in Adewusi on Windows Server 2012 R-2.

139
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:15.230
This is when you have an enterprise that once hosted Microsoft active for free or you need LDAP out

140
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.300
for Linux apps.

141
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.910
So remember, this is where you have large user bases, maybe plus 5000 users, or you need to have

142
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:29.350
that trust relationship between your on premises, active directory and your active directory.

143
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.340
Then we have a connector.

144
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:38.480
So this allows on premises users to log in to services with existing aid credentials and allows easy

145
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.130
two instances to join the active directory domain.

146
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.700
So you use this when you need a single sign on for on premises employees and for adding easy to instances

147
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.600
to the domain.

148
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.060
And lastly, we have simplicity, which is a low scale, low cost active directory implementation based

149
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.720
on Sambor.

150
00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:00.680
And you'd use that when you have a simple user directory requirement or you need just simple LDAP compatibility.

151
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.430
So that gives you a few different use cases.

152
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.600
There's one more design pattern that I didn't mention before, and that's where an organization has

153
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.960
an active directory on premise and they add a new active directory domain controller.

154
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:21.560
So another domain controller for their access directory enables us maybe on two, and that means that

155
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.380
they can extend their on premises active directory into the cloud.

156
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:32.310
The advantage of that means they then have low latency authentication services within the cloud itself.

157
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.800
The downside to that is they have to replicate information into the cloud.

158
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.440
So there's synchronization happening with their database, their user credentials of going into that

159
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.520
instance that's on AWB.

160
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:50.240
So just bear in mind, in case an exam question comes up, there might be certain circumstances where

161
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.480
an organisation or security department of an organisation doesn't want those user identities to be synchronized

162
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.950
into AWB.

163
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.770
And that might then require AWB directory service or add connecter.

164
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.920
What I want to do now is just head over to the AWB management console and show you where the AWB directory

165
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.520
services and see how we can actually configure the service.

166
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.660
So I'm in the AWB management console that's going to services, security, identity and compliance and

167
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.720
we find directory service, some of inter actually service.

168
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.650
We don't have anything set up so we can choose set up directory.

169
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.000
And this is where we have some options.

170
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.180
You also see there's Amazon cognito, user pools.

171
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:39.260
We cover cognito in another section of the course, but with cognito, user pools, you can also add

172
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:44.140
that user registration and sign in features typically to mobile applications.

173
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:51.910
So what we've been focusing on in this section is a has managed Microsoft and simplified an ID connector.

174
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:58.190
So if I just choose next, we can say that for the database manager, did we then get to choose from

175
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.020
two different editions and we then have to put in some information.

176
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:09.890
So for instance, we'd put in CCC labs dot com for the fully qualified domain name and then it might

177
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.070
be just DCT labs for the net byas name.

178
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:18.650
And then you put in some credentials and you can set that up and you can see what the cost is per month.

179
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:24.560
So this is going to cost 100 bucks a month or cost about three hundred and fifty for the bigger enterprise

180
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.040
edition.

181
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:31.340
So I'm just going to cancel out of there, go back to set up directory and then simply simplicity.

182
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:37.580
So remember, this is the Linux, Sambor Active Directory compatible server and much cheaper.

183
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:43.250
So you can see this one is fifty seven US dollars a month for the smaller one hundred and seventy two

184
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.280
dollars for the large and that's in the Sydney region.

185
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.980
Depends on where you are, which region that might be different.

186
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.970
And again, it's asking for very much the same information, a fully qualified domain name and that

187
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.990
last name and then some credentials.

188
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.600
So let's cancel out of that one.

189
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.630
And then lastly, we have the add connector.

190
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:10.490
So this is described as a proxy for redirecting directory requests to your existing Microsoft EDI without

191
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.410
caching any information in the cloud.

192
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.470
So that's a key thing to remember there.

193
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.290
Nothing is cached in the cloud we choose next.

194
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.400
Again, we have a couple of different sizes and the pricing seems to be about the same.

195
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.540
As for the simple Ade's so fifty seven point one hundred and seventy two dollars.

196
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:34.130
So you'll choose your option and you can type a description or otherwise you'd click on next and you

197
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:41.510
have to specify a VPC, your subnets and then you get free to the fully qualified to my name net bias,

198
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.120
name some DNS addresses and so on.

199
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.450
So that's how you configure these services.

200
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.980
We're not going to actually create any of these as part of this lab, but I just wanted to show you

201
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.760
where it all is.

202
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.800
So hopefully that gives you a bit more information.

203
00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.020
Now, I know it's a little bit complex, but just try to understand the differences between the services

204
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.410
and the scenarios in which you would use one over another.
