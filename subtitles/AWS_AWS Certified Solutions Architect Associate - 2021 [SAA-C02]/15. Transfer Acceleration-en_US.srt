00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,540
This is a lab about transfer acceleration as free transfer acceleration is a technology that you can

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:15,690
use to accelerate the transfer of objects that you're uploading into a bucket so if you have a lot of

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,330
latency between you and your bucket that can affect the transfer times when you upload data to your

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,800
bucket S3 transfer acceleration does is it

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,410
leverages the Amazon cloudfront network specifically the edge locations that are part of the cloud

6
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,730
front service.

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,950
So we haven't talked about the cloudfront service yet but as a content delivery network and there are

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,040
edge locations all over the world.

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:49,720
In fact if we have a quick look at this diagram from AWS it shows you the locations of the edge locations

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,930
where there are multiple locations where we've got the purple dots and regional edge caches as well

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,380
which are all part of the Amazon cloudfront network.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,750
So they're in quite a few locations around the world with transfer acceleration you have different end

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,380
points so you may remember these end points from a previous lab and there are a couple of different

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,330
formats for the endpoints that you can use and they look a bit like this where you'd replace your region

15
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,160
name and your bucket name.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,520
However with transfer acceleration the bucket name comes first and then you have dot s3 dash accelerate

17
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,220
and then there are two different end points here ones dual stack so that's the IPv6 whereas the other

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,270
one is for IPv4.

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,250
So you end up using a different endpoint to access and your data is uploaded to a cloudfront edge location

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,640
where whereas then forwarded onto your bucket.

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
Now that the benefits that you can get can really vary but we'll have a look at them in a minute and

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,910
they can vary from a small benefit or even no benefit to a huge benefit.

23
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,890
Multiple uploads can also be used with transfer acceleration so this can also be used where you have

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,940
large amounts of data or large files that you need to break up into pieces.

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,290
Now there is a charge so you will incur a cost.

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,660
So you really need to have a look and see how much benefit you're going to get from S3 transfer acceleration

27
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,950
before you start using it.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:27,410
So coming over to the console here I just to go into a bucket and click on properties and if we come

29
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,150
down to advance settings we have transfer acceleration and that's the learn more link to give you a

30
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,590
bit more information and you can then enable or suspend.

31
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,710
So you can't actually disable this once you've enabled it.

32
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,940
You can only then go and suspend it.

33
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,690
You can also see here the end point for this bucket.

34
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,210
So we can now say that this would be the end point that you would use if you wanted to accelerate your

35
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,960
uploads.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,350
So it doesn't mean that you can't still upload traditionally using the normal endpoint but you can also

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,690
choose to use this end point when you need to try and get some kind of benefit from the acceleration

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
and you can also have a look at the data transfer speeds here.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:18,000
So if I click on this link it actually chooses then the local region where I am which is ap-southeast-2 and

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,130
it starts doing an upload and it gives you an S3 direct upload speed and then a transfer an accelerated

41
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,230
transfer upload speed so you can see what the benefit is sometimes takes a bit of time to populate.

42
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,410
So I actually have one running here and in this case it was using us-east-1.

43
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:43,410
So it's saying that from where I am which is Sydney it's six hundred ninety three percent faster to

44
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,590
upload using S3 transfer acceleration versus using S3 directly.

45
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,010
So that's huge.

46
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,070
And then we can come down and see all these different regions here and it shows us the benefit

47
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,520
so not a huge advantage if I was just transferring data from where I am now straight into the Sydney

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,330
data center.

49
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,800
But as you can see pretty much the farther you get away the better

50
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,380
but not always because London is quite a long way from here and that's that's not that's not a huge

51
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:19,950
advantage.

52
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,690
So so it varies a lot.

53
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,870
You really have to come in here and check out the benefit that you're going to get coming back here.

54
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,420
We could just enable this and click save but it's not really going to do much in terms of a lab so it

55
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,200
does cost money.

56
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,560
So I'm not going to bother doing that for this lab.

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
I just wanted to show you where it is.

58
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,680
You need to understand the circumstances where this might be useful.

59
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,880
So just remember if you have latency and your uploads are latency sensitive or that time sensitive so

60
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,800
you need to get that data into your bucket quickly and you will benefit financially or by some kind

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,600
of benefit to the business if you get that data out quickly that it might be worth spending the extra

62
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,430
money to ensure that your upload is quicker.

63
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,470
Couple of other notes about transfer acceleration as I said before it kind of cannot be disabled only

64
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,070
suspended.

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,820
Also you are actually only charged if there is a benefit but as far as I know that means if you get

66
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,960
some benefit whether it's a small benefit or not you'll be charged.

67
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,400
So you've got to work out if you do get a small benefit is it cost effective and just also remember

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,230
for the exam that you must use the correct endpoint to get the advantage.

69
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,050
So you have to use the extra accelerate endpoints.
