00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.030
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.940
So we have our Aurora database running and we created an Aurora replica within the same region in the last

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.740
lab.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.060
And what we're going to do in this lab is we're going to create a cross region replica with aurora

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.540
.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.910
Well so as you'll remember we have the cross region replica.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.900
You can create up to five copies of your database so you can create five cross region replicas.

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.760
And that's one per each of these regions.

9
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.690
So in this case we have three or we have two replicas and one primary region and the reads are taking

10
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.590
place only in the primary region and then asynchronous replication is replicating the data across

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740
to these different regions.

12
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.060
Now we actually do have a cluster in each of these regions because when you use this method it creates

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.230
a cluster and it uses the MySQL bin log replication to replicate the data across.

14
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.200
So we have multiple copies of our data in each of these regions but we can only serve read traffic but

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.110
we can if we want to failover regions.

16
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.460
So there is some disaster recovery options here let's head back into the console and set this up

17
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.860
back in the console and just to point out quickly the read only DB from the last lab now has its end

18
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.850
point so we can say that it has a different endpoint to the primary database and everything's looking

19
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.370
good, everything's available.

20
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.730
Just a quick warning if you haven't watched the previous lab I did mention there that with Aurora you

21
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.070
don't actually get any three tier so whatever we create in Aurora is going to cost something so it's

22
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.190
up to you whether you want to spend some money or just watch along before we can actually get started

23
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.450
creating our cross region read replica.

24
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.980
We need to enable binary logging and we do this through parameter groups.

25
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.220
Now I've already set mine up but I'm gonna show you how to do it now by default.

26
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.730
You'll be at your cluster we'll use the default Aurora.

27
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.920
That five point six D.B. cluster parameter group.

28
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.880
And if you go into here and search for bin log

29
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.820
you'll find this bin log format here and you'll see that it's set off.

30
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.120
Now what we need to do is create a new parameter group with that set to mixed and the way we do that

31
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.860
is you just come back to parameter groups and choose create parameter group.

32
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.890
We're going to set D.B. cluster parameter group and then give it a name and a description.

33
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.880
And once it's created, I've created my own mine called Cross region D.B. Once it's created you then

34
00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.890
just need to go in and you can find that bin log it's just format and then you can go in and you select

35
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.610
edit parameters and just change it from off to mixed and click save.

36
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.880
Now once you've done that you can then come back to your databases and you need to go to your writer

37
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.490
and you need to go to modify

38
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.180
and you've got to scroll down until you find DB cluster parameter group and yours will be set to default

39
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.340
Aurora and you just change it to your new DB parameter group and then when you click on Save

40
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.970
don't forget to Choose the option that says apply now and you'll then need to wait a few minutes until

41
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.100
that update is completed and you might need to reboot your instance.

42
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.690
If so just choose your database here and then go to reboot.

43
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.940
So mine's already set up.

44
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.760
So what I'm going to do is go to choose my cluster here and then I'm going to go to create cross region

45
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.390
read replica

46
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.850
and I can choose my region.

47
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.010
I'm just gonna leave it as U.S. East North Virginia.

48
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.270
I'm going to leave these other options.

49
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.480
Encryption is greyed out because our source is encrypted so you can't change the status and I can choose

50
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.150
my instance class I'm going to leave it on the smallest one I can and then you'll see that by default

51
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.970
it says multi AZ deploymentspecifies if the DB instance should have a standby deployed in another

52
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.220
AZ so if I leave this enabled it's going to create a Aurora replica in another availability zone within

53
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.850
that region within the U.S. East North Virginia.

54
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.460
So I'm going to leave that and I'm just going to call this cross region D.B..

55
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.860
Copy that paste it into my identifier and leave the other options as defaults.

56
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.780
I need to disable performance inside.

57
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.280
She need to do this it won't work with the performance insights enabled and then click Create you'll

58
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.770
now get this screen which just tells you that your read rapid creation has been initiated and it's got

59
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.940
a little click here button and you can click that and I'll just take you to that region.

60
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.700
So this will take me over to U.S. East North Virginia

61
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.190
and we can see now that we have our regional role.

62
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.580
This is our database.

63
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.210
So it's a different database name.

64
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.970
And then we've got to readers.

65
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.480
So that's giving us an extra read.

66
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.480
So we've got a better fault tolerance as well by having those two readers and different availability

67
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.490
zones so we can see ones in U.S. East 1B and the other ones in USD 1D.

68
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.150
It's gonna take several minutes for these to become available but once they're available I'm going to

69
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:47.730
show you how to then promote one of these to a primary so that we can actually create a writable database

70
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:55.730
in US North Virginia. So I left that for half an hour or so and everything is available now.

71
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.270
We can see that we have our two instances now you'll see that one of them says writer and the other

72
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.030
reader.

73
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.000
Now this is a cross region readable database.

74
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.190
However of course one of them actually needs to write that data to the database that it receives through

75
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.250
replication traffic.

76
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.100
So that's why that one is showing as a writer.

77
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.970
Now what we want to do is if we click up at the cluster level here we can go to actions and we can choose

78
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:30.190
promote and this will as it says promote this read replica to a primary instance and replication will

79
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.350
start once the promotion process begins.

80
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.800
Do you want to continue.

81
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.980
So I click promote read replica.

82
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.570
It's going to break for application and it's going to turn this instance into a primary writable

83
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.480
database

84
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.150
and we can now see that our status is modifying.

85
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.840
So we're just going to wait a few minutes for that to complete and become available again.

86
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.900
So that took a few minutes and now we can see that our database is available again.

87
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.620
Everything is green and what's happened is this has now become its own database.

88
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.340
So it's a completely separate.

89
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.180
It's not being replicated to from the Sydney region anymore.

90
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.550
And if we actually go into the configuration we can see that we have an option here under actions to

91
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.710
create a cross region read replica.

92
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.730
So you'd only be had to do that if this was actually a viable database.

93
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.430
So that's all we want to do in this lab and what we want to do now is delete the cluster.

94
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:45.110
But before we can do that we actually have to go into each of these and let's delete the read only database

95
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.620
first

96
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.770
and we just need to type in delete me, copy this, because I'm going to need it a few times

97
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:03.430
and then we can go to the actual database itself the right of the database.

98
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.730
I'm not going to create a final snapshot.

99
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.390
I'll acknowledge that I'm going to delete all data and click delete me

100
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:22.770
so those might take a few minutes to delete and once they're deleted we'll be able to actually go in

101
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.050
and delete the cluster configuration as well.

102
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.860
And while that's happening I'm going to do the same thing in Sydney

103
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.100
for the reader and the writer

104
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.960
and again those are going to need a few minutes to fully delete but make sure you delete these guys

105
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.360
because these are going to cost you money.

106
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.100
So just make sure that you delete and if you've done this in multiple regions make sure you go to each

107
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.560
of those regions and make sure you've got everything deleted.

108
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.150
So that's it for this lab in the next hour we're going to go over global database.
