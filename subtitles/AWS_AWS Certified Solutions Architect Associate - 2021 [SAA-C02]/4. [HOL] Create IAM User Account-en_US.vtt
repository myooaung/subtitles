00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.830
In this lesson, we're going to create an individual IAM user account that we can log in with throughout

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.790
the rest of the course.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.470
So just to contrast the root user versus an IAM user.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.320
Remember that the root user logs in with the email address that we use to create the accounts.

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.050
Now, the root user has full permissions to the accounts, and those are totally unrestricted.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.990
And in fact, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to remove permissions from the root user accounts.

7
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.220
And that's why it's dangerous to keep logging in with the root user account.

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.270
So what we're going to do is create an IAM user and that user will have a friendly name like John O'Neill

9
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.050
or whatever you want to call your users and needs to supply the account side or the alias at log in

10
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.700
for IAM users.

11
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.660
We have complete control over the permissions that we assign to them so we can use IAM permissions policies

12
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.300
to assign the specific permissions that a user needs to perform their role in the organization.

13
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.260
Now I've come back over to the IWC management console and I'm on the dashboard for the IAM service on

14
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.540
the left hand side where we're going to click on users.

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.410
Click add, users.

16
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.170
And the first thing you need to supply is the username.

17
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.910
In my case, I'm going to choose Neil on the access type.

18
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.080
There's two different access types that we can supply to the user.

19
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.860
We can either enable programmatic access or management, console access or both.

20
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.850
Now, programmatic access means that you're using certain credentials called an access kiddie and a

21
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.130
secret access key to interact with IWC using the API.

22
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.170
The Seelye or the SDK and all of that will be covered a bit later on in the course.

23
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.860
I'm not going to enable programmatic access at this point in time.

24
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.680
I'm going to enable management console access.

25
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.800
I'm going to supply a custom password and I don't want to require a password reset, so I'm going to

26
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.880
disable that option.

27
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.440
Click on Next.

28
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.420
And now we come to permissions.

29
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.510
So how do we assign permissions to users?

30
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.010
Well, remember we can attach policies directly to users, which is an option up here, and we have

31
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.960
a whole load of policies that are predefined.

32
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.270
These are AWG managed policies.

33
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.910
We could choose one of those and attach it to the user.

34
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.910
We could copy the permissions from another user.

35
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.290
If we have one, we don't.

36
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.990
Or you can add the user to a group.

37
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.420
Now I prefer the group option and it is a best practice.

38
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240
So I'm actually going to create a group.

39
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.070
I'm going to give the group a name.

40
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.440
It's just going to be called admins and this group is going to have administrator access.

41
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.960
So I'm going to assign the policy administrator access and create the group.

42
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.620
The group is selected, so this user will be added to the group.

43
00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.400
Let's click on next on the tag so you can add key value pairs to your user accounts and you can add

44
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.500
tags to lots of different resources in us.

45
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.560
So, for example, we might add a key value pair of departments with a value of administrators, and

46
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.070
that could be useful later on if we wanted to use this information to find users who have this tag applied

47
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.460
to them.

48
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.370
Let's click on next and go to the review screen.

49
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.600
Everything's ready.

50
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.220
So we're going to create this user.

51
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.920
So the user is being created.

52
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.950
You can email logging instructions to the user.

53
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.740
I know what, Linus, I'm just going to close out of here, and we now have our user account created

54
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.520
now under user groups.

55
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.110
You'll notice that we now have the admins group, and if we click on that group and look at permissions,

56
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.690
we can see the administrator access policy if I expand this policy here.

57
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.130
You can see the JSON code that makes up the policy statement and JSON stands a JavaScript object notation.

58
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.860
Now in this statement, and you'll learn a lot more about this a bit later on, we can see that we have

59
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.860
an effect of allow an action of star.

60
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.540
That's a wild card, which means any and a resource which is also a wildcard.

61
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.470
So essentially this allows any action on any resource.

62
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.240
So we now have a user set up with full administrative permissions to the account.

63
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.410
So let's log in as our new user and top right hand side of the screen.

64
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.150
I'm going to sign out because we need to sign out from our root account first.

65
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.900
Let's click on, log back in, choose IAM user.

66
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.780
We're going to supply the account alias, which in my case is DCC, IWC Cloud Labs.

67
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.210
We can select remember this accounts.

68
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.710
Choose next and then supply our username and password.

69
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.420
So my username is Neil.

70
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.630
I'll put in my password and then click on Sign In.

71
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.300
And so now I'm signed in as Neil, which you can see up in the top right hand side here, says Neil

72
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.750
A..

73
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.280
And then the account's alias.

74
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.830
So that's it, we're now able to log in with our individual user accounts and have full administrative

75
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.460
permissions over the accounts, so we no longer need to log in as rates.
