00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.620
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to go into Amazon S3 and we're going to create a S3 bucket

2
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.870
in the console here, which you can find under services storage as free.

3
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.590
We can see the buckets that we have.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.070
I've got one bucket, which is something we'll use later on in the course.

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.250
Now, in the top right hand corner, you can see that the scope is global so you don't have to choose

6
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
a region, but the actual bucket here is within a specific region.

7
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.750
So really, remember that for the exam, it's very important.

8
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.980
The scope is global because the URLs that we access as free with are global, but your data is always

9
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.180
stored within a single region unless you can figure out otherwise.

10
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.840
So try and choose regions that are closest to your end users.

11
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.480
Now I'm going to click on, create buckets, give it a bucket name, which has to be unique globally.

12
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.100
Choose a region.

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.400
So I'm going to choose us east North Virginia here.

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.000
You can copy settings from another bucket if you want it.

15
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.450
Public access is blocked by default.

16
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.110
If we want to enable public access to our data, we must disable this option and then configure public

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.420
access, which will see how to do a bit later on.

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
We can enable versioning so we keep different versions of our objects, but I'll leave that disabled.

19
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.240
For now, we can add tanks and we can enable encryption, which will go into and a lot more detail later

20
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.230
on in this section.

21
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.510
So I'm happy with the defaults.

22
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.070
Let's just create this bucket.

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.340
So that's it.

24
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.150
I now have my DCT cloud storage bucket.

25
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.030
And if I go into this bucket, you'll see there are several different tabs at the top here, and we

26
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.390
can upload files and create folders within our buckets.

27
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.450
Now we're going to explore the various different tabs here and the different features available as we

28
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.440
go through this section.

29
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.940
For now, all I want to do is upload a couple of objects to my buckets.

30
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.640
So after clicking on Upload, I can add files and I'm going to choose these to JPG images and click

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.270
on Upload.

32
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.660
We can now specify the properties for objects.

33
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.940
So if we just select this option down here.

34
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.770
So firstly, we get the option to store objects in a different storage class.

35
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.630
I'll leave standard selected.

36
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.490
Now you may notice there's an additional storage closet called reduced redundancy.

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.230
This is a legacy storage class, and it's not really covered on the exam anymore.

38
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.800
We can then specify encryption settings for all specific objects.

39
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.530
So we might have different encryption settings for different objects and different storage classes for

40
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.840
different objects or within the same buckets.

41
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.060
I'll leave this switched off for now.

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.710
You can enable tags for your objects and also add metadata.

43
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.690
So if you want to add some information to describe your data, you can add it in there.

44
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.840
Of course, all this can be done programmatically as well.

45
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.170
So all I need to do here is click on Upload and we're going to see that are two objects will very quickly

46
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.300
be uploaded to S3 buckets.

47
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.220
So that was successful.

48
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.300
Let's click on close.

49
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.970
And now, back in our bucket, we can see we have a couple of objects, and if we select one of these

50
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.260
objects, we'll see that the object has a URL.

51
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.900
Now we do have public access disabled, so we won't be able to access this publicly at this stage.

52
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.260
We would have to change that, which will do a bit later on in the section.

53
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.130
But this is the URL with which we will be able to access our data if it's made publicly available or

54
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.800
if we have the permissions on the left hand side.

55
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.280
Here, you can see the key and the key is just the file name.

56
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.960
So remember, the key is the file name.

57
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.560
The value is the data moving back up to the top.

58
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.210
You can also see the permissions.

59
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.670
So we have an access control list here, and then we have the access control list back up in the permissions

60
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.730
of the bucket as well just here, as well as some options for adding a policy to the bucket, which

61
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.960
we'll cover in another lesson.

62
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.950
So that's some basic navigation around the console.

63
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.910
You know now how to create a bucket and upload objects to your bucket.

64
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.660
In the next lesson, we're going to start looking into the access control options for our buckets and

65
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.030
for the data in our buckets and a bit more detail.
