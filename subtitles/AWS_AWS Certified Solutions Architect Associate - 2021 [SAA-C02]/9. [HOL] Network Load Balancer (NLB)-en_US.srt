1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,890
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,410
We're now going to continue and we're going to create a network load balancer back in the console.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,580
You should have created your target groups.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,030
You should also have two instances running because he created an auto scaling group earlier.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Now I want to attach elastic clips to my network load balancer.

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,760
So let's allocate an elastic IP.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,590
Just going to leave the defaults.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,150
I'm going to do the same again and once more so I should have free.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,580
Now you have to clear the filter and then you'll be able to see all three elastic clips and these aren't

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,890
associated with anything.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,380
Yeah, we're going to associate those when we create the load balancer.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,320
So now we have everything ready.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:54,200
We can scroll down on the left hand side to load balancers, create load balancer, and now you can

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,820
see the four different types.

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,710
So we've got the classic, the Gateway, the network and the application.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,740
In this case, we're going to use a network and note that it's showing us the protocols we can use.

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,620
Let's click on Create Under Network Load Balancer.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm just going to call this my NHLBI.

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,110
This is going to be internet facing.

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,230
You can have internal load balances as well.

21
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,780
But we want a public DNS endpoint so we can connect from the internet.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,990
I'm going to leave IP addresses IPv4.

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,950
If you use dual stack, then you get an IPv6 address as well.

24
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,380
The VPC has already selected.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,270
And what I'm going to do is choose three different availability zones.

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,090
Now these must be public availability zones.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,740
Now we only have one private one in this particular subnet, so that's easy.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,760
And then what I want to do here is use an elastic IP.

29
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,420
We're going to do the same for us East 1B and then USC East 1C.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,390
Now we might find that we get the same address assigned.

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,230
So if that happens, just change these addresses.

32
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,890
Make sure that we have three different elastic types across these three different subnets.

33
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:14,510
So these are the subnet in which the elastic load balancing service is going to place the network load

34
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,870
balancing nodes so that we can distribute incoming connections into those subnets scrolling down a bit

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,350
further.

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,520
Here we have the listener, so the listeners must be unique.

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,870
In this case, we have one listener listening on TCP Port 18, and we're going to forward to this target

38
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,230
group.

39
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,510
You could create another listener.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,690
But in this case, you wouldn't be able to have the same protocol and port combination.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,850
Now we don't need that at this stage.

42
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,560
We're going to see how to add additional listeners with the application load balancer later on.

43
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,310
Now let's create a light balancer, go to view load balancers, and we can see now that it's in the

44
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,300
provisioning state.

45
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:03,050
We have a DNS name, so this is the public DNS name for our load balancer, which will be able to connect

46
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,970
to shortly under listeners.

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,100
We can see the lesson that we have.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,430
You can go to monitoring, see some cloud watch data here and under integrated services.

49
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,200
You can integrate services like Global Accelerator, which will cover later on in the course.

50
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:27,200
And IWC config is automatically recording a history of configuration changes to our load balancer with

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,510
the load balance of selected under actions.

52
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,720
You can also see that there's various things that you can edit here.

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,500
So, for example, if you edit attributes, you can enable deletion protection, cross home load balancing

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,560
and access logs with access logs.

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,770
You specify an Amazon S3 buckets into which the log data is actually stored.

56
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,800
Now we're not going to enable any of those at this point.

57
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,220
Now I copied the load balancer name to my clipboard.

58
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,340
If you haven't done that, go back to description and just use this option, he had a copy, the DNS

59
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:01,640
name.

60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,540
And we're going to use that in a moment to connect to our instance.

61
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,690
Now, if we scroll down to target groups, this is where we can go and have a look at our target group

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,870
and see if we have healthy instances.

63
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,210
Now, if we go to targets here, you can see that there are no targets.

64
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:26,540
And the reason for that is because we haven't added our target group to our auto screening group.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,600
So let's come to auto scanning groups, select auto screening group, click on Edit.

66
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,890
And if we scroll down a little way here, we'll find load balancing, choose application network or

67
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,700
Gateway Load Balancer and then select your target group.

68
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,470
Once you've done that, scroll down and click on Update.

69
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,570
Now, make sure that you have selected the TGA Dash and LP, not the Albi one.

70
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,400
Let's click on Update.

71
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,790
And what we should find now is when we go back to target groups, click on TG, Dash and LP.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,580
We'll see some targets here shortly so that they've just refreshed and we can see that the health status

73
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,520
for the two instances is in initial.

74
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,980
So it's checking the health status.

75
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,770
Remember, there's multiple health checks that need to come back as successful before these are considered

76
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,090
as operational and that point in time, they'll change to healthy.

77
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,750
So we just need to wait a couple of minutes while that's happening.

78
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,520
I'm coming over to a command line and I'm going to use the nslookup utility.

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:38,630
So this utility will check the DNS name of my load balancer and find out what IP addresses are associated

80
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:38,900
with it.

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:46,070
So all I have to do is paste in that DNS name, former load balancer and hit enter in the response data.

82
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,750
Here we can see that we can identify elastic IP addresses.

83
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,690
These are the free elastic IP addresses.

84
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,720
Now, if you were using an application load balancer, what you'd see instead is public IP addresses

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,030
that are dynamically assigned, so you wouldn't be able to use those addresses if you needed to whitelisted

86
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,650
the firewall.

87
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,880
So what do I mean by that?

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,910
Let's say you have a company on the internet and you're connecting to your network load balancer over

89
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,620
some custom TCP pool.

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,970
Now you don't want to allow that pull out of your firewall to anywhere in the world.

91
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,150
So instead, you create a whitelist of IP addresses.

92
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,410
You add these free IP addresses knowing that they're never going to change.

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,240
Now your application can connect to the DNS name of the load balancer, and DNS is going to respond

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,540
with these different IPS and your firewall already allows them.

95
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,690
So that's a common use case for network load balancer.

96
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,240
Let's go back to our target group and click on Refresh, and it's still an initial, so I've got to

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,350
give it a little bit longer and hopefully they'll be healthy.

98
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,550
Let's go back to our target group now and click Refresh.

99
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,510
And now we have two healthy instances, so that's great.

100
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,050
What we can do now is try and connect to the load balancer.

101
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,140
So I'm just going to open a new tab in my browser, paste in that DNS name for the load balancer and

102
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,680
hit Enter.

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:17,570
So this is the web page that's generated by our actual instance, and it tells us that the actual instance

104
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,620
is located in the US East one a availability zone.

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,410
Now, when you refresh the load, balancer may actually send you to the other instance.

106
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,610
That's in a different availability zone, but it might not for a while.

107
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,550
So the NHLBI behavior is very different to the ALP.

108
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,970
See with the Albi.

109
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,420
It will pretty much every refresh of your browser send you to a different instance, and that's something

110
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,920
we'll see a bit later on.

111
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,100
Now, another thing we can do is actually take this address, this elastic IP address.

112
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,940
And if I put that into my browser, I should find that I can connect to the instance, so I've connected

113
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,750
directly to it via the low balancer node IP address.

114
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,520
I can now take the next IP address.

115
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,510
Now, one of these won't work because we don't have a node in every subnet or free subnet.

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,670
So yeah, that one's.

117
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,840
Not working.

118
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:21,140
Now let's try the last one, and this one should take us to the instance in the one see subnet, so

119
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,860
we paste it in hit enter.

120
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,780
And now we're on a different instance.

121
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:32,070
So what you can see here is a DNS name is really just giving you some DNS resolution for the static

122
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,860
IP used that are assigned to the nodes and then you have to connect to the nodes.

123
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,880
But the load balancer knows which nodes actually have instances that are healthy and attached to them.

124
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,620
So you do still want to use the load balance of DNS name, but the static IP can help you to whitelisted

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,320
your firewalls.

126
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,620
Now that's all I wanted to do for the NHLBI.

127
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,170
We're going to move on to the Albi shortly.

128
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,350
So for this lesson, we're just going to conclude by going down to load balancers and we're going to

129
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,060
delete our load balancer.

130
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,020
Now you don't have to worry about the target group at this point, they don't actually cost you anything.

131
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,860
So we'll leave the target group there now.

132
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,220
Something that will cost you money is those elastic eclipse.

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,350
Remember when they're not associated.

134
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,460
So what we want to do is go into each of these and we're going to release the address we might need

135
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,230
to disassociate first.

136
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,270
Let's see if that works.

137
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,660
It's not worked yet because the load balance is still being deleted.

138
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,000
So wait until the load balances, delete it and then you want to go in, disassociate these.

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,100
You have to do them one at a time and then release them afterwards.

140
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,980
And that's it for this lesson I will see in the next one.
