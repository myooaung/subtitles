1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,790
Another great feature of Amazon S3 is cross region replication.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:16,470
So CRR enables you to asynchronously copy objects between buckets that are in different AWS

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:24,060
regions so AWS already replicates your data between geographically distant Availability Zones but

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,190
you might want to copy it to even greater distances across regions.

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,950
You also might do it so that you can minimize the latency in other words the distance between your users

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,480
and your data.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,300
It might also be for operational reasons so you might have computer clusters in different regions they

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,560
could be processing some data and you want that information to be locally available for those compute

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,800
instances.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:59,850
So there are a few reasons for enabling CRR and a few requirements that you need to understand for

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,720
how you set it up.

12
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,670
So firstly you need to have versioning enabled.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,850
So you need to have the regions that able to account as well but versioning is essential and you need

14
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,760
to have that set up straight away before you can use CRR the source and destination buckets have to

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,370
be in different AWS regions so you can't use it as a way to backup one bucket to another bucket within

16
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,370
the same region.

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,810
We also need to provide permissions to S3 to replicate the objects and we're going to do that for

18
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,590
a role.

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,300
So let's head over to the S3 console and we're going to set up a couple of buckets there.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,080
So we're going to create one which we're going to call DCTTestCRR

21
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:00,460
and we can go into this bucket and straight away we can go to properties and enable versioning

22
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,430
and before we set up the configuration because we can actually go in now and set up our replication

23
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,710
rule to enable cross region replication but we're going to need a role.

24
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,850
And so we're going to create a role and we need to come down here and choose S3 because this is

25
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,170
the service that's going to assume this role and we'll see why this is required shortly.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,860
We then got a permissions and what I'm gonna do is we could lock this down but just for this exercise

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,950
I'm just gonna go with full access so let's go through and we're just gonna call this S3 our

28
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,470
now if we have a look at this role.

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,500
The reason that we choose the service is because when you go to trust relationships here you can see

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,670
the service is specified as S3 to Amazon AWS dot com and the action is assumed role.

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:08,050
So this means that S3 can assume this role the role that we've created earlier for S3 in this case

32
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,050
was used for EC2 so if we have a look at this one the service is easy to which means that an EC2

33
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,090
instance can assume this role.

34
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,780
So you have to have that set up you've got to have the correct trust relationship as well as the permissions.

35
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,100
So let's go back to S4.

36
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,320
So we're back in S3 and before we carry on I just want to create a folder and I'm gonna call

37
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:36,180
this replicated and I'm not going to upload any objects yet because objects that are uploaded before

38
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:45,310
you enable CRR won't actually be replicated so let's now go to replication and add a rule and instead of

39
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,890
replicating the entire bucket we're going to choose a prefix and the prefix is going to be the folder

40
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,940
replicated we can optionally enable encryption and now we need to create a destination bucket.

41
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,550
Obviously if you had one existing you'd just choose it.

42
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,210
But in this case I'm just going to create a new bucket and you could optionally create one in another

43
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,530
account using an account I.D..

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,260
So in this case we're going to create a new bucket.

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,050
We're going to select a region and choose Singapore and then I'm going to call this DCTTestCRR

46
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,740
tfor destination we could optionally change the storage class for the replicated objects so we could

47
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,670
for instance change to a cheaper storage tier such as one zone IA.

48
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,990
I'm not going to do that.

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,660
You can even change the object ownership to the destination bucket owner.

50
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,110
So now we need to choose our role and we're going to choose the role we created earlier.

51
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,270
And we just need to give this a name.

52
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,420
And if we click on Next we get a summary.

53
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:57,410
So it says and it's going to replicate the bucket DCCTestCRR from Sydney to DCTTestCRR

54
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,330
in Singapore.

55
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,190
And this is the role we're going to use.

56
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,210
So let's click save

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,480
and this will automatically enable versioning in the destination bucket.

58
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,540
So you need versioning enabled in both the source and the destination.

59
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,720
And so we can now see it's being created successfully and we can see the scope as the prefix replicated.

60
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:26,450
So let's go back to the bucket and what we're gonna do is we're going to upload some objects so I'm

61
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,400
going to upload a couple of these JPEG files

62
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,910
and they're going to be in the roots of the bucket and then I'm going to go into replicated.

63
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,600
And here we're going to upload let's say these two HTML files here

64
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,230
so we've now got these files in the folder that's called replicated and we've got a couple in the root

65
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,370
here as well.

66
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,980
But remember we enabled the role to replicate the folder that's called replicated.

67
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,590
So let's now go back up a level and we can now see that we have the destination bucket here which is

68
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,660
in Singapore.

69
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,870
So let's go in and we can see the replicated folder and just as expected we can't see those objects

70
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,710
that were at the bucket root level but if we go into here we can see these files and we have versioning

71
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,930
enabled on this destination bucket as well.

72
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,990
So if there were multiple versions we would see them here

73
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,700
we go back to the source bucket again we have versioning.

74
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,720
So we can see if there's a different version here.

75
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,640
There are some peculiarities around cross region replication.

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,070
So have a look at the documentation and definitely have a play with it.

77
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,080
It's worth trying to understand what happens when you delete an object.

78
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,730
What is replicates it and what if you delete an object in the destination or the source.

79
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,610
So there's a few different behaviours there which you can practice where it's very easy to set this

80
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,110
up and have a play around.
