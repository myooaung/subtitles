00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,720
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,800
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,030
We're now going to continue with a discussion on plastic IP addresses.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,440
I've launched two instances into my VPC.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,940
Now all I've done is put them both in the same subnet so that both in the same availability zone here

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,390
and I just used an Amazon and it's to a mine and to micro instances that's where you or you need to

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,710
do so.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,830
Both of these are in a public subnet and therefore they have a public IP address.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,440
Now as you know these are just the dynamic public IP addresses that instances pick up when their subnet

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,640
is configured to provide them with one.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,320
What we want to do now is actually create an elastic IP address and associate that with an instance.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,750
So you come down to elastic IP here under network and security and choose allocate new address and the

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,040
scope is VPC.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,540
And that really is it.

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:00,540
There's nothing else to do you just choose allocate and as you can see we now have a public IP address

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,080
and this is gonna be a static address.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,360
So if we close we can come back here we can see we have this allocated to our account and it's not going

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,050
anywhere.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:18,210
It's not even associated with an instance or a network adapter.

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,430
So what I want to do now is actually associate it with my instance.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,300
So I choose actions associate address and under here you can choose two different types of resource

22
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,700
either an easy to instance or a network interface.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,260
So that's an elastic network interface and we'll see how to create one of those shortly.

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,690
I'm going to choose instance I'm going to choose instance one and then I have to associate it with the

25
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,670
private IP address.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:54,380
So that means it's going to disassociate the existing public address so it warns you here by saying

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,720
if you so associate an elastic IP with you instance your current public address is released.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:07,950
So the dynamic addresses released and the new elastic or static address is assigned so I'm going gonna

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,630
choose associate before I do that I'm just going to choose learn more I just want to bring this article

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,890
to your attention.

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,960
If you scroll down a little way you can see some information about the behavior of public Hopis.

32
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,480
It says here that a W.S. will release your instance his public address when the instance is stopped

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,200
or terminated.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,820
We know that from the previous lab it also says we release your instances public address when you associate

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,070
an elastic IP address.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
So that's what we're doing now.

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,880
And then if you disassociate the elastic address the instance will pick up a public IP.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,000
However if your instance has more than one network interface it won't pick up a new dynamic public IP

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,250
address.

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,520
And also if your instance has a secondary private IP address with an elastic IP associated with it it

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,930
also won't pick up a new dynamic public address.

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,460
So those are just a few things to understand.

43
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,460
Let's close that and choose associate.

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,920
So we now have our address associated.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Let's go back to instances choose instance one and we can see now here under elastic eyepiece we have

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,630
an address and that address now shows as the primary IP V for public address.

47
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:25,100
We still have only one if an interface if zero and if we choose that we can see that we have the public

48
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,490
address and the public private IP address.

49
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,630
So very simple.

50
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,210
And now if we stopped our instance and started it again it would retain that IP address the other way

51
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,130
you can associate an elastic IP is using an elastic network interface.

52
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,070
So let's first go to elastic IP addresses and allocate another one to our account so we have the second

53
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,290
address here.

54
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,740
Let's go to network interfaces and what you can see here of the elastic network interfaces associated

55
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,560
with your existing easy two instances.

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,880
So these are the if zero interface on those instances I'm gonna create a new one I'm just gonna call

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:15,080
it my E and I I'm going to choose my AP SD to a availability zones so that I'm in the same subnet and

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:23,360
then you can choose custom or auto assigned IP before I'm going to leave it on it's on auto assign and

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,690
then we're just going to choose a security group.

60
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,620
Now just a note the elastic fabric adapter here if you choose the information icon it tells you that

61
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,010
this is a device used for reducing latency and increasing Freeport for hate UPC high performance computing

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,170
and machine learning applications.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,460
So those are for specific use cases.

64
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,450
We don't need those now let's just choose create.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,640
And what I'm going to do to make sure this is clear in the console I'm going to put the name here as

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,980
well so my E and I and just.

67
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,940
Okay.

68
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:00,710
And now if we come back to Alaska co-pays I'm going to go to actions associated dress choose network

69
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:08,300
interface I could find my IP address I know I could find my network interface and then I can associate

70
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,180
with a private IP address and click associate.

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:20,510
So we now have an elastic network adapter and it has a public IP and its status is available so it's

72
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,470
not in use.

73
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,710
What we need to do is sign it to an instance.

74
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:35,510
So we do that by clicking attach and we choose our instance one and attach if we now had back to instances

75
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,830
under instance one we can see we have two elastic IP addresses and two network interfaces so you can

76
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,810
see the new elastic IP is associated with each one.

77
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,840
Now remember one of the key benefits of elastic IP addresses is they can be read it and it's the same

78
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,910
for elastic network interfaces.

79
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,960
So you can't move if 0 to another instance and you can't move a public IP to another instance but you

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:11,040
can move your elastic eyepiece and your additional elastic network interfaces so if I go down to network

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,930
interfaces I can choose to detach my interface she's forced to make short works and now that it's detached

82
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,990
I can attach it and choose instance to.

83
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,690
Now remember in the real world you might want to do this programmatically and that means that you can

84
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,330
then file over your address to another instance maybe that's something that you programmatically use

85
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,320
for failure scenarios or you might move an elastic network interface because of re platforming or something

86
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,140
like that.

87
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,670
So let's go back to instances and if we choose instance to we can now say that it has each one with

88
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,650
the same public IP address.

89
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,240
So I've just moved that interface onto a different instance.

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,870
Now if you can imagine that you have a public DNS name that's resolving to the IP on that network instant

91
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:09,420
interface it would now be directed to instance to rather than instance one and you can easily remap

92
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,120
it to a third instance if instance two failed.

93
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,620
So that's just a little bit about classical piece.

94
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:22,080
What I'm gonna do now is terminate my instances and remember this is really important now that you need

95
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,720
to release your elastic eyepiece because you do get charged for elastic IP addresses when they're not

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,820
in use.

97
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,890
Now you have to wait until you instance is shut down because as long as they're associated with an adapter

98
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,140
that is in use you won't be able to release them.

99
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
But that should just take a few seconds and then we'll go into a elastic eyepiece and release our addresses.

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,380
So both of my instances are terminated.

101
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,540
Let's go to a plastic eyepiece and I'm going to choose to release this address and I can see that this

102
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,840
other one is associated with a network interface that's my elastic network interface so I need to disassociate

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:09,240
it first and then I can release the address and now you won't get charged and we can go in and delete

104
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
your elastic network interface as well.

105
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,140
So that's it for this lab guys in the next lab.

106
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,720
We're going to cover private subnets and Bastion hosts.
