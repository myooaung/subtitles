Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'm going to show you how to use the VPC wizard, the wizard helps you

2
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.100
to really easily create a VPC without having to do much manual work at all.

3
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.480
Now, of course, I do want to show you how to create your own custom BPC and do all this manually.

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.920
It's really important knowledge for the exam, but the exam also sometimes asks you about scenarios

5
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.660
related to the VPC wizard.

6
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.420
So it's worth a quick walkthrough to see what the available options are through the wizard in my management

7
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.960
console.

8
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.210
Let's go down to networking and VPC on the VPC dashboard.

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.040
Here I can choose Launch VPC Wizard, and we then offered four different pre-configured options, and

10
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.820
what I want to do is just go through what you get with each of these options.

11
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.460
So the first one is a VPC with a single public subnet.

12
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.140
Very simple.

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.720
You get a slash 16 side, a block and a slash 24 subnet, and it's a public subnet.

14
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.900
So if you select this option, you can specify your side block and it's giving you this default.

15
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.820
You can specify a name.

16
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.150
It's already entered the subnet side a block as well.

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.630
You could choose an AC if you want to or otherwise.

18
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.400
After entering the name, you could literally just create the VPC, and it's going to do all the tasks

19
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.880
for you.

20
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.550
And that would include attaching an internet gateway so that you have internet connectivity for your

21
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.330
public subnet.

22
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.490
Now let's cancel out of that.

23
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.330
Or let's go back.

24
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
Go to VPC with public and private subnet.

25
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.780
So now you simply get public and private subnet and you've got a network address translation device,

26
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.010
so you get a NAT Gateway so your private instances can access the internet.

27
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.090
So again, with this option, there's not too much to configure.

28
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.580
Other than the different subnets, public and private, the key difference here is your NAT Gateway

29
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.350
does need an elastic IP, so you need an elastic IP allocation IP.

30
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.460
Now, let's go back again, and this time we're going to go to VPC with public and private subnet and

31
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.080
hardware VPN access.

32
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.870
Here you have public subnets, private subnet and also a VPN tunnel gets created.

33
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.790
Now you need to have a VPN device in your corporate data center.

34
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.630
If we select this option, and let's just give this a name my VPC and leave the defaults on this page.

35
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.550
Click on Next.

36
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.940
And then it's going to ask for the customer gateway IP, and that's the IP address of your VPN device

37
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.910
on your side of the network on your corporate data center.

38
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.310
So if you specify those details when you create this, CPC is going to make that connection.

39
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.670
Let's just go back back again.

40
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.660
And the last one at the bottom is VPC with a private subnet only and hardware VPN access the same as

41
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.870
the one before, except that you only have a private subnet.

42
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.980
So you've got a VPN connection from your corporate data center to a private subnet and IWC with no routing

43
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.520
going out via the internet from that subnet in IWC.

44
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.070
So those are the four options I just wanted to quickly show you through them, and in the next lesson,

45
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.620
we'll actually create our own custom BPC.
