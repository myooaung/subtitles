1
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:09.580
So what we're going to do now is we're going to launch an instance and we're going to give it a configuration.

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.600
We have some EBS volumes.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.350
So we're going to just going to choose the general purpose t2 micro.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.070
We're going to click.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.230
Next I'm going to leave the defaults.

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.240
And then we get to add storage.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.680
So as we can see the default here is that we have a volume.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.270
It's got a device mapping to xvdc and we can see a snapshot idea.

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.420
So when you use an AMI the AMI is essentially a snapshot.

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.620
So it's a snapshot with a block device mapping that configures the configuration parameters for the

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.340
disk drive and the data from the AMI is then part of your desk as it is provisioned.

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.930
So the default size here is 8 gigabytes and then we have the default volume type as general purpose

13
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.630
versus day.

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.540
So here we can change it and remember the old magnetic is still here.

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.080
Not really used very much these days.

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.800
So we can choose general purpose SSD and it gives us side default hundred IOPS with a burst ability

17
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.910
of up to 3000 and delete on termination is actually enabled here.

18
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.310
So this is a key thing to remember when you terminate your EC2 instances your EBS volume will also

19
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.120
be deleted.

20
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.100
So any data that's on that volume is going to be destroyed and there's no way of recovering it unless

21
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.890
you've taken a snapshot.

22
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.430
You won't be out to find it again.

23
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.750
So that's gone.

24
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.520
Now that's different so when you add a volume which we'll see in a minute.

25
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.790
The other thing you can do now is enable encryption.

26
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.120
You didn't used to be able to do this but now you can.

27
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.470
So you'd be able to select a KMS Key for encryption and the disk will be encrypted.

28
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.460
So I'm just gonna take that out for now.

29
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.340
So let's have a new volume and we can see the only option here is EBS you can't add an instance store

30
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.970
volume and it automatically just takes the next available device mapping here on this list which is

31
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.030
sdb you could then search for a snapshot.

32
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.690
We're just gonna leave that blank and we're going to leave general purpose SSD as well.

33
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.330
We could choose provisioned IOPS and really it would just be a performance difference.

34
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.190
So I don't need that for this lab but you could just choose that if you wanted to so notice a difference

35
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.830
had the delete on termination is enabled for the volume but it's not enabled for any additional volumes

36
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.550
this is a key exam question sometimes you'll find something come up where it mentions that an

37
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.290
instance has been terminated it had a volume and it had a couple of additional volumes added to it you

38
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.330
know what data is going to be accessible and you know that the additional volumes by default will be

39
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.630
available because they're not gonna be deleted.

40
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.120
So let's go forward and we're just going to launch this instance

41
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.360
so we have our instance running now and we can see down here the block device mapping so what devices

42
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.580
are actually attached to this instance.

43
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.770
So we have our root device and our additional volume and then you can see some additional information

44
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.650
about EBS down here at Elastic block store.

45
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.100
So we have volume snapshots and lifecycle manager.

46
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.770
So the gains and volumes we can see our route volume and we know this is the route volume because we

47
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:54.960
can see the snapshot I.D. here which is the AMI that it was created from there both in ap-southeast-2a and

48
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.130
this is our additional volume.

49
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.690
So this is the extra EBS volume that was attached.

50
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.360
If you go into actions you can do a few things you can create a snapshot you can attach volumes if they're

51
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.420
unattached you can delete them again if they're unattached you can detach a volume you can force it

52
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.830
to be detached you can change the auto enabled Io setting and so on.

53
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.350
Let's just have a quick look at modify volume.

54
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.760
So in here you can actually on the fly change to a different volume type and adjust the size and just

55
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.650
click modify and that will just go and change that volume type and provision the extra storage.

56
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.820
Now that doesn't mean that your operating system will see the extra space you have to check to see whether

57
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.360
your operating system is using that space or you might need to extend your file system or your partition

58
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.220
to be able to access that extra storage space.

59
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.430
So that's a couple of things we can do there.

60
00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:00.220
What I want to do now is let's go back and we're going to get the public IP address of the instance

61
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.750
and I'm going to SSA age into this instance

62
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.060
and what we're going to do is we're going to run thelsblk command and with this we can see the

63
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.420
root device which has a partition and that's mounted to / that's the root file system.

64
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.460
We then have the xdb device which is a disk but it doesn't show a file system and we can run the

65
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:38.710
command sudo fs s to switch to it and then we can do file -s -dev and then the device

66
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.830
name and it doesn't show any more information than this it just as data and that means that there isn't

67
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.690
a file system created for this.

68
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.200
So what we can do now is we can run mkfs for make file system -T.

69
00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:02.530
We give it the file system type xfs and then again we type dev xdv and if we rerun the previous

70
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:09.370
command we can now see that we have an xfs file system so the next thing to do is actually to mount

71
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.430
this file system.

72
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.220
So we do sudo

73
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.840
mkdir

74
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.860
We don't need selects.

75
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:24.010
We are already running as the root so we can do mkdir /data and then I'm going to mount

76
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.770
the device.

77
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:36.540
So cd to the directory so that's now mounted to the Mount point and we can change to /data

78
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.600
and whatever data we write in here is going to go straight to that file system the additional volume

79
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:49.530
so we can just touch a text test file and you know just add a couple of test files in here just for

80
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.410
the fun of it that we can then see this data when we change to a different instance.

81
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.770
So we just run it.

82
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.360
We just saved a couple of empty files here

83
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:10.630
and what we're gonna do now is we're just going to go back to the console and we're going to come down

84
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:17.690
to volumes and we're going to take a couple of snapshots so.

85
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.150
So this one is the additional volume.

86
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.830
So this is the we create a snapshot and I'm going to call this data volume

87
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:36.240
and that should be almost instantaneous because there's there's pretty much no data on that say we can

88
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.010
see it going on.

89
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.720
It's taken a few seconds.

90
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.760
So now let's come back and let's take a snapshot of the root volume.

91
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.770
So this one I'm just going to call root volume

92
00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:00.500
and if you come down to snapshots again we can see that these are both pending so I had to wait a couple

93
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.470
of minutes for those but now they've completed.

94
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.300
And so what we're gonna do is actually you can just terminate this instance because we're finished with

95
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.630
this one for now and I'm just going to go terminate

96
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.550
and now it's terminated.

97
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:22.300
Let's go back to volumes and we can just see one volume because remember the delete on termination actually

98
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.630
wasn't enabled for the additional volume as it was for the root volume.

99
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.240
So the root volume was deleted and the additional volume is still here.

100
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.670
And if we go to snapshots these are still here so we've got our volume and our data volume as a backup

101
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.860
which we could then use to restore and and create a new instance from and we're gonna do that later

102
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.410
on in this section.

103
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.090
So for now that said we've terminated that instance and in the next lab we're then going to create a

104
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:54.280
new instance and attach the data volume to that instance.
