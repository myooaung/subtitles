00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,170
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to create a free two accounts on IWC.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,260
So let's first clarify what it is you're going to need.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,700
Firstly, you're going to need a credit card for setting up the account and paying any bills.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,270
Now it is a free tier account, but you always need to have a billing method, so you have to have a

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,760
credit card assigned to the accounts.

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,830
Now we are going to try and make sure that you don't run up any bills, so it's important to follow

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,790
my instructions.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,450
One of the things we'll do is create a billing alarm so that if you do forget to terminate an instance

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,640
or you leave something running, you shouldn't have done.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,590
Then you'll get a warning to let you know that you might exceed your threshold so you can keep that

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,700
threshold very low.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,200
You'll also need a unique email address for this account, so an email address that hasn't been used

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,720
with any other IWC accounts.

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,760
Now check if you can use a dynamic alias with an existing email address.

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:09,560
If you already have other IWC accounts, say, for example, if your email address is John at gmail.com,

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,180
you can use John Plus and then put in some kind of alias for your accounts at gmail.com and it'll still

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,280
come to your email inbox.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,730
Then when you have another account, you can have John Plus account alias two at gmail.com.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,730
Now, Gmail does support dynamic aliases.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,870
You'll just have to check if you're using a different email provider, whether they do as well.

21
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,950
But it's a good way of getting around, having to set up multiple email accounts.

22
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,140
You'll also need to create your own account, name an alias, and you'll see how to do this shortly.

23
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,370
Lastly, you will need a phone to receive an SMS verification code.

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,100
That's part of the process of opening the account.

25
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,270
So that's it, really.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,530
Let's go over to a web browser and we're going to start setting up our free tier accounts.

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,730
I mean, Google here and I'm just going to search for eight U.S. free tier.

28
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,570
And the very first result here, IWC Free two is what I want.

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,570
This page helps you understand what a free tier account is and what you can use in a free tier account.

30
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,460
So, for example, there's always free, there's 12 months free and there's free trials.

31
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,720
Now, if you scroll down a bit, you'll see, for example, you get 12 months free of Amazon EC2, and

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,780
the limitation on that is 750 hours a month.

33
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,870
And you've got to choose the right type of EC2 instance.

34
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,670
Easy two is where you're running.

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,820
Virtual servers in the cloud is something you're going to learn very early on.

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,250
In this course, with as free, you get five gigabytes of storage space and with the island's database

37
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,740
service again, 750 fifty hours a month as long as you choose the right type of database.

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,650
Now what we can do is scroll back up to the top and choose Create a free account on this page.

39
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,430
Choose this button down here that says Create a new AWG account.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,120
You'll then need to supply your unique email address.

41
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,220
You'll need to supply a password, confirm the password and then choose an account name.

42
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,110
The account name can be changed later on, as well as the alias we're going to use to log in.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,060
So let's continue to step two for the first question How do you plan to use IWC?

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,130
Just choose personal.

45
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,850
You'll then need to supply your name, your phone number, your country or region address and then accept

46
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,820
the terms and conditions and continue to the next step.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,640
Next, you need to supply your billing information, so enter your credit card number, expiration date

48
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,000
your card holders name and confirm your contacts, address and then continue to step four.

49
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,860
You may be asked to confirm your identity.

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,020
So again, you'll need to enter your phone number.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,840
Answer the security check and then get it to send you an SMS and enter the code that you're sent.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,890
I've answered my verification code and I'm going to click on Continue.

53
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,940
And then for support plan in this case will choose the basic support.

54
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,800
So that's completely free and only really gives you help if you have a council billing issues.

55
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,170
And then we just collect complete sign up.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,490
And that's it, we can now go to the IWC management console, so let's click on the button in the middle

57
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,300
of the screen here.

58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,360
And it's going to ask us for our account's I.D. or our accounts alias.

59
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,940
Now at this point, we haven't specified an account alias, and I don't even know what the accounts

60
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,590
ideas yet for this account.

61
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,150
We also don't have a username because this is an IAM username.

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,770
What we do have is the root user email, so we have to choose sign in using root user email supply the

63
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,450
email address you just signed up with.

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,010
Enter your password and click on Sign In, and that's it.

65
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,220
We are now logged in to the IWC management console and that's all I wanted to cover in this lesson.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,140
And the next lesson, we're going to configure a few attributes of our accounts.

67
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,790
So make sure you stay signed in.
