1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,420
If you're migrating a database into a W.S..

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,090
Then the database migration service is the tool.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,470
You might want to use.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,260
So there's not gonna be hands on in this, I'm afraid, with a lot of these migration tools.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,370
I just need to give you the feary, because setting them up means, you know, you've got to set up

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,650
a source database somewhere and a destination and it won't be that exciting, really, once you get

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,250
it set up.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,740
But, you know, if you've got the time, then by all means you can play around and try and use these

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,220
tools.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,680
Might be a good exercise to understand and deeper.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,060
If you're planning to use them.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,110
But for the purposes of the exam, you really just need to know the high level.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:48,990
So what you can have is you might have your on premises data center or you might have some workloads

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,960
that are in easy to or even an RDX already.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,010
So they might already be on the A.W. as cloud, but you want to move them to a different destination.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,390
So that could be you're moving them from east to into RDX or you're moving them from RDX.

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,770
Parkin's easy to that's possible as well.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,060
So lots of different source and destination options you can see here.

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,910
Destinations include a Rora Redshift dynamo, DP and document DP as well.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,900
And DMX will actually manage the entire migration process for you now at your source database can stay

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,140
on line and see your application can stay on line throughout the entire process, which will minimize

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,330
the disruption.

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,340
So there's a lot there's not much downside.

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,120
You just got to work out how to cut over at the final time.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,380
But during the migration, while your data is migrating, there's no actual downtime.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,710
So that's a really good thing.

27
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,370
Now, you can also not just do homogeneous.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,700
So, for instance, my ask you all to a minus QOL compatible database, but you can also do heterogeneous

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,560
migrations so you can take, for instance, an Oracle database and put it into redshift.

30
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,590
And there's quite a few different options.

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,760
And to do that, you use something called the schema conversion tool.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,290
So the key thing to remember, you've got the database migration service.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,540
And if it's a homogeneous migration, you don't need to use the schema conversion tool.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,260
But you do if you're moving between different types of schema.

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,300
And so just remember also that the source can be in the A.W. as cloud as well as on premises and the

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,830
different destination options.

37
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,280
And that should have you covered for the exam.
