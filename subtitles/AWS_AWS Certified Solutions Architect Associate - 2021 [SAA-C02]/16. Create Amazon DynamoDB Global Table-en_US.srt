1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,970
We're now going to create a global tables configuration.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:10,790
So if you remember from a couple of labs back or the lesson at the beginning of the dynamoDB part

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,280
of this section I discussed what global tables is.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,760
So it's a multi region multi master database.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,800
That means you can have a dynamoDB table that's replicated asynchronously around the world to different

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,280
regions and you're able to read and write to that database within those regions.

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,980
So you can have your users in whatever region.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,930
This could be you know the U.S. you could have one in Australasia somewhere you can have one in South

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,570
America and your users are reading and writing to the database and it's the same database that they're

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,420
sharing and that data is being replicated.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,300
And this comes with five nines of availability.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,000
So it's pretty amazing very highly available very fast synchronization.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,280
It is a synchronous replication but it uses the AWS as global backbone which is very high bandwidth

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,870
and low latency.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,980
So this is what it looks like.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,010
Let's go into the console and actually build the configuration out.

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,080
So what we're going to do is just create two regions and it's very simple.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,390
We go in and create a table and I'm going to call this global table and we can choose a partition K

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,670
and then a name doesn't really matter.

20
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:35,900
We're not going to put any data into this table we're just going to create the configuration.

21
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:43,900
So my table is being created and I go to global tables and you'll notice that we have global table regions

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,140
here but you can't add a region because we haven't enabled streams yet.

23
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,680
So what we need to do is click here, enable streams, just choose enable.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,310
And now we can go in and add our region.

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:02,930
So I'm going to choose Singapore and it will check that the regions locator deploy in C and then we

26
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,100
can click on continue

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,210
and that's really all there is to it.

28
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:19,160
It's really simple to create and we now have a table in these two regions which is being replicated

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,510
and you can see an IAM role here that's being used for the replication

30
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,510
and you can also look here at the replication latency and pending replication counts as well to see

31
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,040
you know what's outstanding so we can now just clean up this configuration by going into Singapore and

32
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,510
choosing remove region and we just need to confirm by typing remove

33
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,910
and then we can just go in and delete our table in the Sydney region

34
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,470
so that got rid of our table here in Sydney.

35
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,480
And now let's head over to the console and we can see that the table is still available so we removed

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,600
the configuration for replicating the tables but the table in the other region in Singapore actually

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,690
still exists.

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,530
So don't forget.

39
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,140
So as you go into your region don't confuse the removing it from replication with actually deleting

40
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,530
the table you still need to come in here and choose Delete table and that's really all there is to it.

41
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,210
It's really amazing how easy it is to create a multi region multi master database.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,490
This is something that in the past would've taken months of planning and a really complex configuration

43
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,670
and the AWS cloud really allows us to create these complex configurations that under the hood are very

44
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,690
complex but very very easy to create in AWS.

45
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,870
So I hope you had some fun with DynamoDB and in the next lesson we're going to start going over 

46
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,570
Elasticache.
