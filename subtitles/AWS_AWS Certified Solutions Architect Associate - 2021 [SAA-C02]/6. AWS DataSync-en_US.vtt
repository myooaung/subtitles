00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.470
For migrating your data, you can use the Adaba US data sync tool.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.460
So this is a online tool that allows you to migrate very large datasets into a W.S..

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.090
And in this case, you are going to be using a Adaba US direct connect connection or you're gonna be

4
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.460
using the Internet or a VPN.

5
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.980
So it does encrypt the data.

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
So it's going to be safe no matter which medium you're using.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.450
But this is an online tool, so it's going to migrate your data online.

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.480
So you got to consider the bandwidth that you've got from your data center into a W.S..

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.940
Now, your source is going to be a NAS file server.

10
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.160
So it's going to be a piece of network attached storage or a file server that sharing using the network

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.870
file system an offense or the server message block SMB protocols.

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.330
So that's going to be your source.

13
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.380
And what happens is Data Sync will connect to that source using a software agent, which you don't have

14
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.890
to install.

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.630
We'd have to modify anything here.

16
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.470
It will connect to your now server and it will then pick up the data and migrate it.

17
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.230
And now you can schedule that.

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.850
Transfer.

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.230
And it's all automated is going to use tearless encryption, as I mentioned before.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.860
And you've got quite a bit of granularity in terms of how you schedule so you can do sort of daily or

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.750
hourly or whatever it is you want to do.

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.640
So you're migrating your data and then these are the possible destinations.

23
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.060
So you got Amazon Asri, you've got Amazon, SSX for Windows File service.

24
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.560
So not Lastra, only Windows File service.

25
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.620
And then you've got the Amazon elastic file system, which is Obasi another and a fast paced system.

26
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.440
So those are the free destinations.

27
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.950
Now, it does preserve your permissions and your metadata as well.

28
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.570
So that will all be still present when you migrate into the cloud.

29
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.980
And so think of data sync as the service to use when you want to migrate from an end FSL SMB server

30
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.270
into a W.S. to one of these free destinations.

31
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.370
And you're going to do so online.

32
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.160
So via direct connect or via the Internet.

33
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.580
If you can't migrate online because your data is just too much and you're bound with can't handle it

34
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.170
or it's going to take too long, that's when you might have to look at Snowbell, which I'm going to

35
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.130
talk about shortly.
