Hi, guys, in this lesson, I just wanted to teach you an important concept around how network address

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.030
translation works for public addresses.

3
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.340
So let's have a look at what I mean here.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.250
We have an easy to instance it has an infinite interface and has a private IP.

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.040
Now there's also a public IP address.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.430
Now, one of the things you'll notice is that if you have a look in the command line, so if you run

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.820
a tool such as IP config, ifconfig or the IP address show, if zero command I've run here, it will

8
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.390
show you the IP addresses on that particular interface.

9
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.200
Now you'll note that we have the private IP address.

10
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.630
Now, ordinarily in most servers, if you have a public IP address, it will be configured and you'd

11
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.290
see it here.

12
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.180
But on AC two, you don't.

13
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.910
You only see the private IP address.

14
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.260
The public IP address does not exist anywhere on your instance.

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.310
Your instance doesn't know anything about this public IP address, and the reason for that is it's actually

16
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.260
associated to the adapter.

17
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.600
It's actually associated with the private address.

18
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.540
Now your instance doesn't know about that.

19
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.840
That actually takes place externally to the instance, and it's performed by the internet gateway.

20
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.010
So the incident Gateway performs network address translation.

21
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.910
It performs once one knows what that means is when a packet goes out from your instance.

22
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.520
It has a source address of the private IP destination of whatever the address is on the internet.

23
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.000
The net gateway will then change the source address to be the public or elastic IP address.

24
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.590
And then when the return traffic comes back, it's destined to the public address, and the internet

25
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.030
gateway will translate that to the private address that we've seen before.

26
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.970
How networks.

27
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.950
I just wanted to let you know that's actually taking place for the public IP addresses.

28
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.470
So your instances don't actually see them.

29
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.850
So that's important to understand if you're playing around on the command line and looking for the IP

30
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.930
and you can't see it there.

31
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
That's why it's happening externally to the instance.

32
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.060
So that's just a quick lesson to explain that concept to you, and I'll see you in the next lesson.
