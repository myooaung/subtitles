00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:08.350
Hello and welcome to this lesson on Ill be connections and logging what I want to do here is just make

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:17.110
you aware of how this works how the LP connects from a client on the Internet free to your instance

3
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.100
and specifically around the addresses that are seen by the low balance and easy to instance and how

4
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.260
that relates to logging.

5
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.120
So when a client makes a connection to your load balancer and it's on the internet its source address

6
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.300
is going to be a public IP address.

7
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.770
Now you've got to also consider whether this is behind a proxy server in a company.

8
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.510
If so then it's going to be the proxy server address not the individual computer that's within the company

9
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.530
or otherwise it could be an individual one the Internet and it's their individual IP address even way.

10
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.050
There's gonna be a source public IP address and the destination public IP address is going to be that

11
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.150
of the a load balancer itself.

12
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.240
Now remember you don't actually see these unless you look in your cache what you address your load balancer

13
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.630
with is the public DNS name NWS name servers then resolve that to an IP address.

14
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.910
Now when it comes to the low answer you can actually set up something called server access logging and

15
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.850
that means that it saves logs on connection information to an S3 bucket that you specify so it's within

16
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.530
your account when you look in those logs you'll see connection information and you'll see the source

17
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.660
of IP address of the client.

18
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.790
What then happens is the low balance creates another connection fruity or easy to instance.

19
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.250
Now as you know even if you're easy to instance has a public IP address and as you know also the load

20
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.310
balancer nodes have public ip addresses but the load balancer will address your instance on its private

21
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.820
IP address whether it's in a private or public subnet and therefore it's gonna use a private range and

22
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.720
the source address is going to be the load balancers IP address.

23
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.150
Now if you're running Apache for example on your easy to instance as we're going to do in a lab when

24
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.330
you look into your log file for Apache you'd expect probably to see the source address of the elastic

25
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.400
load balancer because that's where the packet actually came from remember they the connection is terminated

26
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.320
on the load balancer and then you the low balance of reconnects through to your instance.

27
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.050
So the source address you would expect to be this IP address in actual fact it depends because there's

28
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.460
a couple of protocols called ex forwarded for and proxy protocol which are used to maintain the source

29
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.710
address that when you look in your log files you can actually see the source address and this depends

30
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.100
on the type of load balancer you're going to use.

31
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.250
If we look at the classic load balancer there are two options.

32
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.850
Proxy Protocol which runs that layer for an ex forwarded for which ones at least seven.

33
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.880
So we've a classic load balancer.

34
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.930
It depends on what your listener is whether your listener on your front and back end is hasty TPA CPS

35
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.230
on Layer 7 in which case you use X voted for or if it's layer forward DCP then you use proxy protocol.

36
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.880
Now I'm going to show you a good article which gives you a bit more information on this.

37
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.780
I'll have the link to this in the course downloads of course but this is worth understanding.

38
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.740
Now I'm not gonna go into too much more detail after this on classic low balances in the lab.

39
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.780
We're going to do is going to be on application network low balances because they're the new generation

40
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.160
and this is the old generation but it may still come up on the exam so it's worth knowing.

41
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.610
So as you can see here we have two tables and the top one is related to having front and back end protocol

42
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.880
attached ETP or hasty CPS.

43
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.240
And the bottom table is using TGP or SSL.

44
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.650
Now in the case of the last seven as you can see X 44 headers are supported and 4 Layer 4 proxy protocol

45
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.240
headers and supported.

46
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.990
Now you may notice there's no mismatch between Layer 4 and Layer 7.

47
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.260
And in fact if we go to the console and try and create a load balancer and choose classic load balancer

48
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.170
and we'll just put anything in here we then have the load balance of protocol that's the front end protocol

49
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.080
and the instance protocol.

50
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.460
Now you have the option for hasty T.P. hasty TPA TPP or SSL but what happens if we try to have hasty

51
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.980
TPP on the front end and TPP on the back end and it just tells us low balance of protocol and instance

52
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.960
protocol must be at the same layer.

53
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.900
So you need to have hasty TPA or HDTV Yes and you can.

54
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.450
You can mix and match these so you can have HDTV and hasty yes a little except that you could do the

55
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.250
other way and have secure on the front and then just hasty TPA in the back.

56
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.270
And that's fine as well.

57
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.460
Alternatively you can have TPP and CCP life for and that's okay.

58
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.310
And you can have CCP and SSL.

59
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.960
So it's just about the layers.

60
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.450
Just make sure you remember that you have to have the same layer on the front in the back and export

61
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.200
it for runs at last 7 and proxy protocol runs it like a full.

62
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.290
And what these do is maintain or pass on that source IP address so that you can see it in your log files

63
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.820
on your easy two instances.

64
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.860
So now that's it for this quick lesson.

65
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.290
What we're gonna do now is go into a lab with the application and network load balance that's a setup

66
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.810
server access logging and also to have a look in the log files on the easy two instances and see what

67
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.040
information we can find.
