00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,360
In this lesson, we're going to cover signed URLs and origin access identities, eyes.

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,790
So let's start with signs, URLs.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,830
We're also going to look at assigned cookies.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,120
Signed URLs provide control over access to your content.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,290
You can specify a beginning and an expiration date and time.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,030
The IP address is in the range of users that are allowed to use the signed URL.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,290
So let's say we have an application running on a mobile device.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,470
We've got cloud front and we've got a surplus application.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,980
The mobile device wants to access content on cloud front.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Now, first, it authenticates to the mobile application and requests a signed URL.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,640
The application responds, provides the signed URL and using that signed URL.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,640
The mobile app is unable to access the content.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,780
Signed URLs should be used for individual files and clients that don't support cookies.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,020
So you can't use it for multiple files.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,640
The signed cookies are very similar to sign URLs.

16
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,420
You use them when you don't want to change your URLs and you can use them also when you want to access

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,460
multiple restricted files.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,280
So that was a limitation of signed URLs, but it is something you can do with sign cookies.

19
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,040
Now that's a fairly basic overview, but in reality, that's about all you need to know for the exam.

20
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,410
Now onto origin access identity.

21
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,990
This one comes up quite a lot.

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,780
So you've got an origin in this case, an S3 bucket configured as a static website.

23
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:48,710
We've got cloud front and we've got some users and the users are trying to access some content, which

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,090
comes from an S3 bucket.

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,390
In this case, the users are connecting over the standard cloud from domain name.

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,610
Of course, it could be a custom domain name as well.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,470
Then Cloud Fund is trying to fetch from the origin.

28
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,930
And it does say using a special user account called an origin access identity.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,580
The bucket policy has a statement which will only allow access to the origin access identity.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,630
So we happen to allow role here for the principle.

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,280
And this is the principle which corresponds to this origin access identity.

32
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:31,140
So that means the policies restricting access to the Oh I only access in this case is granted and the

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,160
object gets returned.

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,330
So what happens if a user tries to circumvent cloud front and actually use the free URL?

35
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,650
Well, in that case, the request will be blocked by the bucket policy.

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,280
So this is a way that we can make sure that our consent is served by a cloud front and that no one is

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,940
able to circumvent cloud front and go to our origin.

38
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,030
So this is a great solution for free.

39
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,390
Now, if you have an easy to origin, it's different.

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,420
It's a bit harder with an easy to origin and the reason being so you can't use an A.I., but what you

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,200
can do is IWC publish a list of the IP addresses of the nodes on cloud front, and you can use those

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,780
in security group rules to only allow access from the cloud front nodes.

43
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,820
You've got to keep on top of that and you need to keep updating it as they change the IP address ranges

44
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,510
that they use.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,400
But it is a way of doing that.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,100
You sometimes see that coming up and exam questions.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,460
So remember the key thing there is another way AI is use of free.

48
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,890
It's not used with to.
