00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.880
In this lesson, we're going to deploy a NAT Gateway, so are instance in a private sub that can connect

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.900
to the internet.

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.230
Now, if you haven't already got your instances running your private subnet configured, then you might

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.370
skip to this lesson.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.430
You should go back to lessons to the last hands on lesson, private subnets and bastion hosts.

6
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.990
And within that lesson, we set up our VPC with a private subnet.

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.110
We can figure out a round table and then we deploy an instance into a private subnet one into a public

8
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.620
subnet.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.300
And then we used agent forwarding to connect to the instance in our private subnet.

10
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.590
So basically, all configuration is we've got a private instance and we jump to that from an instance

11
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.430
in the public subnet.

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.500
We can't see that in this diagram, but it's there.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.430
So you should now have a command line on this C2 instance.

14
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.760
I'm still connected to my instance here, and I know that if I try to ping an internet address like

15
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.890
Google.com, it's not going to work.

16
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.800
We can see that resulted in 100 percent packet loss.

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.630
So basically it didn't work at all.

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.370
So what we need to do now is deploy on that gateway into a public subnet at the root table, in the

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.030
private subnet with a Nat Gateway I.D. And then we should be able to connect to the internet outbound

20
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.190
only via the NAT Gateway.

21
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.270
So let's head over and build this out in my VPC dashboard here.

22
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.490
I'm in the same region as before North Virginia.

23
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.870
Let's head down to NAT gateways and creates in that gateway.

24
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.840
I'll simply call this my tushnet dash GW and let's select a subnet.

25
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.430
Now, remember, we want it to be in a public subnet, so I'm going to choose my one, a subnet that's

26
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.150
in the public.

27
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.910
Remember all of these subnets here that were created by default are public subnet, whereas this one

28
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.480
here is the one we created ourselves, and that's a private subnet.

29
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.690
So I'm going to deploy into a public subnet.

30
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.940
The connectivity type is going to be public.

31
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.600
We're using network address translation to connect to the internet.

32
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.250
You can do it between different address ranges within us as well.

33
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.650
If you choose a private connectivity type.

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.890
So with public selected, we need to allocate an elastic IP.

35
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.570
Now, I don't have any associated with my accounts, so let's just allocate the elastic IP and then

36
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.740
create on that gateway.

37
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.530
So that's being created should only take a few minutes.

38
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.440
Now what we need to do is go to our round table for a private subnet.

39
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.300
So this is this one here.

40
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.030
Let's go to routes.

41
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.050
Edit routes.

42
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.360
And we need to add routes.

43
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.250
And this is going to be for the internet.

44
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.700
So we're going to use zero zero zero zero zero.

45
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.100
And here, if we just click in the box, choose not gateway and it's going to autofill on that Gateway

46
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.150
ID for us.

47
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.280
We can then save changes.

48
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.210
OK, great.

49
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.500
That's the configuration.

50
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.210
We don't need to do anything else.

51
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.880
Now you will, of course, need to make sure that your instance has a security group associated with

52
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.250
it that allows outbound access.

53
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.760
All security groups should have that, but let's just go and check.

54
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.980
So back in instances here, I can see this is my instance in the private subnet.

55
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.330
If I go to security, I can see the security group is called web access.

56
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.730
Let's click on that in our security group.

57
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.200
Let's choose outbound rules.

58
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.180
Now we see we have a rule here that allows all traffic, all protocols and allport ranges outbound to

59
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.800
any destination address.

60
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.000
So that should cover everything, including the protocol ICMP, the internet control message protocol,

61
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.880
which is what our ping attempt is actually trying to use.

62
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.130
So the security group looks good.

63
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.900
Let's come back to the command line and I'm just going to run that same command again.

64
00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.310
Ping Google.com.

65
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.580
And this time we can see we're getting a response.

66
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.850
And I'll end it there and we can see I got zero percent packet loss.

67
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.310
So complete success.

68
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.920
So this is really useful where you need to enable outbound access for your instances.

69
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.680
Often that's going to be to pull down binary software or software updates from the internet or connecting

70
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.240
to some kind of API service or any service really on the internet.

71
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.270
Remember, the key is this is for outbound only.

72
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.450
You cannot have inbound access via a NAT gateway.

73
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.490
So that's it for this lesson, and we should clean up now because we don't need these resources anymore

74
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.240
in the VPC dashboard.

75
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.770
I'm going to go down to NAT gateways and delete my NAT Gateway.

76
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.090
You do pay for these.

77
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.800
So you do need to get rid of it.

78
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.170
So that will be deleted now.

79
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.610
And don't forget, we had an elastic IP associated with that, so we're going to have to clean that

80
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.300
up as well.

81
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.570
Back in EC2, I've got my two instances.

82
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.630
So let's go and terminate both instances.

83
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.970
Now you don't pay for root tables.

84
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.950
You don't pay for your internet gateway.

85
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.700
You don't pay.

86
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.100
For security groups and things like that, those are included in VPC.

87
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.690
But we do now need to go down and remove elastic IP address because you do pay for these when they're

88
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.780
not in use with the elastic IP, you can go to actions and disassociate if you need to.

89
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.170
In this case, I tried that, but it wouldn't work.

90
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.120
And the reason was it was still attached to the NAT Gateway, which was being deleted in the background.

91
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.740
Once that has happened and it is no longer associated, you can then go and release the elastic IP address.

92
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.770
So don't forget to do that because you will pay for an elastic IP that's associated with your account,

93
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.080
but not actually allocated to anything.
