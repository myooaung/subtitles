1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,360
We're now going to create an RDS

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,440
read replica of our master database and that means we'll have some asynchronous replication coming

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,410
from the RDS master to read replica.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,740
And we could then serve reads using you know other apps service to connect and just read data from the

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,790
database.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,080
We're not actually going to create an app server and connect to the database.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,360
We're just going to go into the console and create the read replica.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,040
So I'm back in the console.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:36,120
I'm going to go into my database and then go to actions and I click Create read replica.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,240
And we now have some new options available to us for the read replica so we can choose where we want

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,840
this to be.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,960
So remember that read replicas can be in different regions.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,000
So I could choose another region.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,860
I could say well I want to put this one in Singapore and this subnet groups there I could choose

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,360
an availability zone I could choose to make it publicly available and so on.

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:09,340
Now I'm just gonna leave this one in Sydney and we can then choose encryption for the database.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,740
Remember though that that's not going to work.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,080
So there's gonna be a problem if you try and do that because you can't have an encrypted replica

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:26,120
of an unencrypted master database. We could then choose a different DB instance class for our read replica.

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,260
And as it's not a writable database you can't create a multi AZ deployment of it.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,760
So the option is there but it doesn't work.

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,740
We now need to give it an identifier.

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:47,840
So what I could do is call it a dash digital cloud read only and we're going to leave this ports the

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,520
same.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,780
We're going to leave the monitoring as defaults and we just click Create read replica.

26
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,070
So if we come back to databases now you can see we've got two databases the original digital cloud and

27
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,840
now we've got the read only digital cloud.

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,770
And that's going to take a few minutes to create let's go into digital cloud and go to maintenance and

29
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,370
backups and if you come down here you can actually see that a snapshot is in the creating stage.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,450
And the reason for that is because what happens when you create a read replica is ideas will take a

31
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,380
snapshot and then the snapshot is then transferred over to create the read replica from the snapshot.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,940
So that's just the process.

33
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's have a look at a couple of other things while we're here.

34
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:35,270
If you go to monitoring you can see some information here so you can see the CPU utilization over the

35
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,290
last hour or the timeframes.

36
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,210
You can see the DB connections.

37
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,270
Free storage and megabytes free of memory write IOPS and read IOPS and then there's more.

38
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,600
So you can look at queue depth and read free.

39
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,410
What usage and so on.

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,190
And you know there's this quite a lot of information here so plenty of data to use if we go to logs

41
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,700
and events we can see some events there.

42
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,570
And if you go down to logs you can then see some logging information here which you can then download.

43
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,630
So we're not going to do that.

44
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,650
Let's just go back and give this couple of minutes until this is complete.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,670
It's been about 10 minutes or so and now I have both of my databases available and if I go into my RDS

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,810
dash digital cloud you'll see that we have a different endpoints.

47
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,610
That's the one thing I just wanted to point out.

48
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,970
Don't forget you have a different endpoint from Read replicas.

49
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,910
And if we just head down to the bottom here you can actually see that we have our master and our replica

50
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:44,750
and the replication state is replicating if we go back to our main database our master database.

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,580
Again you can go down to replication and you can see the master and the replica.

52
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,160
So that's it for this lab.

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:01,100
And what we're going to do now is we're just going to delete our databases and you need to confirm by

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:09,120
typing delete me and then for the master database we need to also delete.

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,300
And in this case I'm just gonna deselect that option.

56
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,510
So by default it will create a final DB snapshot

57
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:26,190
and I actually need to acknowledge that the all the backups are gonna be deleted so there's

58
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,840
no way of recovering this database.

59
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,230
So I said that both deleting we can also then go back to instance and we can terminate our instance

60
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,240
and that's everything cleaned up and that's the end of this lab.
