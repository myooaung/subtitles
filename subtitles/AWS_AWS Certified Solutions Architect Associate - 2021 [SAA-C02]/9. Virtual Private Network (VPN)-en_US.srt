1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,120
So now we're going to talk about virtual private networks.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,630
And there's a couple of times that you can use with eight of us.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,400
There's a side to side connection and as a client VPN endpoint.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,150
So this slide is about site to site VPN.

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,890
So in this case you have a corporate data center.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,780
So this is could be the company you work in and you want to establish a virtual private network connection

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,630
so that you can send data using private IP addresses over the Internet and then into your VPC.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,720
So the components that you need for this are the customer gateway.

9
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,640
Now this is a configuration that you create within a W W but then you apply that configuration to your

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,360
router or your network device in your corporate datacenter.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,260
There's then a VPN gateway and this is the configuration on the AWB side of the connection.

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,880
And once you've got the customer Gateway and the VPN gateway you can then create the VPN connection

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,910
and layer that on top.

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,410
Now the other thing you need to do to be able to send data from your private subnet to corporate datacenter

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:17,990
is you need to add the correct side a block into your round table and then specify the virtual Gateway

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,840
I.D..

17
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,740
So when we create this this connection you'll see it as a virtual Gateway idea and that's what you use

18
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,560
as the target and then data that needs to go to this IP address range we'll just then be routed over

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,070
this connection.

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,860
So let's go to the console and this is the VPC dashboard.

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,470
I'm going to head down to VPN and we're going to create the configuration but I don't actually have

22
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,660
the correct devices to be able to actually enable this VPN.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,470
And in your situation it would be different anyway depending on what type of device you have.

24
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,940
But the general steps are the same.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,470
So we create the customer Gateway and there's going to call it my CCW and it's saying that we can choose

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,490
dynamic addresses which uses BGP or we can choose static.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,420
And in this case I'm just going to stick in a bogus address and we can create the customer gateway.

28
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:22,600
Now what we next need to do is to go to virtual private gateways.

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,590
So now we're going to create our Virtual Private gateway.

30
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm going to call it my VPC.

31
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:35,240
And on this side it does use BGP so there's an autonomous system number is even the Amazon D4 or you

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,340
can choose your own.

33
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,980
So I'm just gonna leave it at default and create virtual private Gateway

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,110
now that we've got that we can then go and create a VPN connection.

35
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:55,080
So let's just go this my VPN and we now get to choose the virtual private gateway.

36
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,450
Then we come down and say existing customer Gateway and we can choose the one we just created and we've

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:09,320
now got to put an aside a blog so it says that it needs to be a site a block in the 1 6 9 2 5 4 0 0

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
16 range.

39
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,340
So I'm going to do one sec.

40
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,700
Nine dot 2 5 4 0 dot five slash 30.

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,660
Because I know that's the first address block and then I'm going to leave the PRICHEP key to be generated

42
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,620
by Amazon.

43
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,330
Now the site to site VPN uses IP SEC and Telus for security.

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:43,330
So once that's created we can then go back to our customer gateway that's all configured correctly we

45
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:49,840
need to go to a virtual private Gateway and this is where we actually attach this to a VPC so we can

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,920
attach that to a VPC and it's now in the state of attaching and just a few seconds later and it's attached

47
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,950
and we can now go to our site to site connection and we can see that this is in the state of pending

48
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,800
it's not going to activate because this is a bogus configuration but this is where you could also go

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,140
and download your configuration and you could choose whatever type of network device you have you could

50
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,160
choose F5 for instance and select the type of platform and then if you hit download what will happen

51
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:29,710
is it then gives you this configuration file which you can then apply to your network device router

52
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,190
whatever it might be.

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,390
So that's it quite simply we can just go and delete this configuration

54
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:49,510
and I need to detach this from the VPC and then delete go back to customer Gateway same again.

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
So the other thing that you'll notice here is apply the VPN endpoint.

56
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,790
And so what you can do here is your able to use either mutual authentication or active directory authentication

57
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,150
along with a certificate in order to connect client devices directly and so rather than having a site

58
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,430
to site VPN.

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,700
This is a way of connecting client devices.

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
It could be you know users laptops as they're on the move

61
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,590
so that's it for virtual private networks.

62
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:27,460
You can just remember the key things are customer gateways on the corporate datacenter side so the site

63
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,940
that you're trying to connect into a is the VPN gateway or the Virtual Private Gateway it comes on different

64
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:41,230
names is on the AWB side and you need those two things to establish a VPN connection and the other key

65
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,810
piece is you need to update your round table.
