00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.040
Hi, guys, I'm in clown trial and this is the main dashboard, and we can see a list of events in the

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.810
account here.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.890
So I choose view all events.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.050
It's going to load a series of events.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.230
And this is all the stuff we've been doing recently in the labs.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.650
So you can see where we've got some remove targets, delete rules, delete key where we had that excuse.

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.080
Q We've terminated an easy two instance and you can see the I.D. You've got the excuse.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.260
Q Your URL there.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040
And if you go down, obviously you see quite a lot more.

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.750
We've got a confirmed subscription which would have been S.A.S. and you can expand each of these as

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.720
well and see a bit more information, including the event ID.

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.050
And so everything that we're seeing here is relevant to the Oregon region because we're in Oregon at

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.120
the moment and we don't have a trial configured that is all regions.

14
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
So, for instance, if I head over now to the Sydney region, where I obviously do quite a bit of work

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.580
in the console, we've got a lot more events here and there are different events.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.630
So we're seeing completely different events now.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.880
Now, if we want to keep a record of these longer, then we can go and create a trial.

18
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.460
So if I choose create a trial and we can give the trial a name, like I'm going to call this my Sydney

19
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.840
trial and we can choose to apply to all regions or just one region.

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
I'm going to choose just this region and you can apply it to an organisation as well.

21
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.940
I'm going to leave the default here.

22
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.340
So this is management events.

23
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.660
So remember, these are the records of actions performed on or within your resources.

24
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.860
I'm going to leave it at all.

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.460
We can log Kamus events as well, the key management service, and you can choose to log inside events.

26
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.380
We haven't got that enabled now.

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.470
And that's not something we're covering at this stage because it's not in the exam.

28
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.380
And then you've got your data events here.

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.270
So remember, this is like the S3 and LAMDA event, so you can record the object level API activity.

30
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.180
I'm going to leave that off and then I can choose to create a new bucket or just choose one of my existing

31
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.720
buckets.

32
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
So I scroll down, I just go down and choose DCT labs and choose create.

33
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.600
So that's it.

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.860
We've now got our trial active and this is not a multi region trial.

35
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.750
It's not an organisation trial.

36
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.490
We don't have any prefixes or anything and we didn't associate a cloud logs like group.

37
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.670
But nonetheless, it's going to record some information.

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.330
We can go in here if we wanted to reconfigure it at all, and if we head over to Amazon as free.

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.640
And let's scroll down to our Descamps bucket and let's see what's being created in here.

40
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.160
And we can see we have this adewusi logs.

41
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.590
So let's go in there and see the account ID.

42
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.410
And then we've got cloud travel folders here and there's nothing in that one year and just go in and

43
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.250
there's nothing in that one.

44
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.730
Yeah, but basically this is where it's going to start logging data now.

45
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.520
So it's going to log activity in the account.

46
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.080
Of course we're not doing anything at this stage in the account, but once we start creating resources,

47
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.500
modifying or deleting resources, you're going to start seeing entries being recorded in this folder.

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.160
So that's it for just a really quick overview of the cloud trial console.
