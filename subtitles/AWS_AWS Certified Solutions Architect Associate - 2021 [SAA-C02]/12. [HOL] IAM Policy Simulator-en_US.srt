00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,410
The IAM policy simulator is a really useful tool that enables you to actually simulate policies being

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,140
applied to users and actually view what permissions they should be granted or restricted.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,630
There is a link attached to this lesson that you'll need to follow to open the IAM policy simulator

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,970
and you'll need to be locked into your account as well.

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,480
So this is the main page for the policy simulator.

6
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,140
On the left hand side, we can choose users groups or roles.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,340
Let's keep it on users.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,940
Now I only have one user, so I don't need to use a filter to search.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,860
I can see my user account on the left.

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,430
So let's choose Neil and we can see that Neil has the administrator access policy applied.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,940
On the right hand side, I can then select a service, so perhaps I'm going to type two and select that

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,020
easy to service.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,490
Now there's lots of API actions associated with the service.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,010
As you can see, there's a few hundred of them.

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,260
In fact, what I'm going to do is select all and I want to see which permissions I have now.

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,320
As you can imagine, I should have permissions to all of these.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,860
So let's run the simulation and very quickly it returns these results, and it's showing each of the

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,430
individual API actions and the permission is allowed.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,340
So I definitely am allowed all of these permissions.

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,660
Let's now create an IAM user who will have fewer permissions and see how useful this tool is back in

21
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,240
IAM.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,650
I've chosen users and I'm going to add a new user.

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,980
I'll call this user Sara Enable Management Console Access with an auto generated password because we're

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,140
not actually going to log in as this user.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,510
Now what I'm going to do is rather than adding to a group for this particular use case, I'm going to

26
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,120
attach an existing policy directly.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,310
So let's search for easy to.

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,140
And I'm going to scroll down to where it says easy to read only access, then after selecting that policy,

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,250
click on Next, go to review and create the user.

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,990
Let's now close out of that.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,650
Select the user and we can see the permissions policies that are attached because we left the option

32
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,560
selected to force a password, reset the users being granted the permission that the other policy that's

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,930
applied is easy to read, only access.

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,920
So let's now go and see what access this user has too easy to say back in the policy simulator.

35
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,170
I'm going to choose back up in the top left.

36
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,050
The page might need to be refreshed, and now it's showing Sarah we can see the policies apply to Sarah.

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,310
Let's do the same thing again, and in the right hand side, choose to.

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,470
I'm going to select all permissions.

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,750
And then run the simulation.

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,310
So this time we get lots of the so we're getting deniers for things like assign an IP address or associate

41
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:00,450
a DHC option, all things that are involving changing, deleting or adding a configuration.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,880
If we scroll down quite a way, we should find some allowed permissions.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,050
So here we go.

44
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,740
For allow permissions, we can see things like describe addresses, describe bundle tasks, described

45
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,210
carrier gateways, et cetera.

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,060
So anything that's just about viewing information.

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,210
So that's the policy simulator is very useful, especially when you have quite complex policies applied

48
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,850
to users and you want to be able to view the results here rather than actually logging in as these users

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,020
and testing the results.

50
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:38,070
So really great tool for simulating the effects of the policies that you apply to your principles in

51
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,170
a.
