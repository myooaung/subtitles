00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,930
Hello and welcome to this lab on application low balance a path based routing.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,700
There are two different types of routing that we're going to cover in the next two labs.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,310
The first is path based and the second is host based.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,770
So what I'm going to show you is how to create this configuration where we have an application load

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,710
balancer that forwards to different target groups based on conditions in roles.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,370
So you'll remember from the slide that shows the different types of low balances that the application

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,010
load balancer operates at the request level.

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,910
So it routes based on the content of the request that Layer 7.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,500
That means it looks at what's in the DTP and hasty CPS protocol information.

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,800
So that is the header and the path in the URL.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,840
So we can then support path based routing host based routing query string parameter based routing and

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
source IP based routing.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,460
So we're going to concentrate on path based routing for this lab and then host based routing.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,770
So what this means is we're going to create this configuration we're going to have a default rule which

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,830
just forwards all traffic to target group 1 but we're then also going to have a rule which says that

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:21,050
if the U.R.L. includes slash orders and then as that you're gonna be a wildcard a star then forward

17
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:27,050
to target group 2 which is also going to have two instances in and we're actually going to have names

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,170
on these instances through the code that we're going to use in the user data.

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,960
So we'll be able to see ourselves cycling between the different instances in each of the target groups.

20
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,740
So it sounds like a lot of fun I think.

21
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,450
Let's get into the easy to management console and start building this out someone that easy to management

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:53,060
console let's click launch instance I'm going to choose the Linux 2 am I T2 micro I'm going to change

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:00,200
my number of instances to 4 I'm going to choose my S3 full access roll and then I'm going to go down

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,170
to advance details and I'm going to paste in my code.

25
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,530
Now we've used this code before I think the only difference is at the very end I've got a command that

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,310
copies the index or hasty amount to orders not H2 email.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,840
So what it does is it picks up a name from this file which is on as free and then it puts that name

28
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,650
into the index or a hasty email far so we actually have a name for instance.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,300
So I'm going to click on Next go through to security groups choose web access review and launch and

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,970
launch.

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,700
And while those four instances are launching Let's go down to target groups and we're going to create

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,900
our target groups.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,670
So I'm going to create two target groups.

34
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,940
The first is t g 1 and as you can see for a application load balancer you can actually choose a lambda

35
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,610
function as well as an IP we're going to choose instance we're going to leave the protocol as page DTP.

36
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,800
Now you can see all the other protocols like the laughable ones but that's because we're just creating

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,550
a target group.

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,650
So this is generic.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,710
If you chose DCP you wouldn't be able to attach this target group to an application load balancer.

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,680
So we have to choose like a seven page TTP.

41
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,110
It's going to go in my default VPC.

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,590
I'm going to leave the other settings as default except the healthy threshold is going to be to and

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:27,150
then I'm going to do exactly the same and create my second target group T G two and use the same settings.

44
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,610
What I'm going to do now is go back and I'm going to name my instances so I know which ones are which.

45
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:46,330
So let's do instance one instance to instance free and instance for and I'm going to go back to my target

46
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:53,760
groups and in target group one I'm going to register instance one an instance two and then in target

47
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,180
group two I'm going to register instance free and instance for and now I can create my load balancer.

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,300
So let's choose crate load balancer and we can see the application load balance on the left here which

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,820
is hate TTP and hasty tepees.

50
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:16,080
So as it says you use this for web applications with haste ETP in haste G.P.S. s traffic and it tells

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,020
you that it operates at the request level Albee's provide advance routing and visibility features targeted

52
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,440
at application architectures including micro services and containers and we're actually going to do

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,410
a lab on containers in section 9 where we attach an elastic load balancer.

54
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,950
So let's choose create.

55
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm going to call this my Alby.

56
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:47,560
We're going to keep the protocol as TTP and then we're going to specify multiple Availability Zones

57
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:56,560
and subnets already predefined for us and then go to choose the web access security group and underwriting.

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,380
I can choose an existing group and I'm going to choose one so that's going to be the target group for

59
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,000
my default rule.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,650
Now you can say it finds the instances and tells us that they're already going to be registered.

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:17,220
So let's go create and our load balance is being created so our low balance is being created.

62
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,420
But all it's got is one rule which rules connections to target group one and you can see that under

63
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,170
listeners here.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,710
So it says default rule forwarding to target group 1 but we've got to target groups.

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:39,300
So what we can do is edit rules click the plus insert rule add condition and this is where you select

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
the type of condition you want to use.

67
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:48,080
So I'm going to select a path based condition and I'm going to put slash orders and then a staff or

68
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,700
a wildcard click the tick mark and then action forward to target group 2 and click on say.

69
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,140
So we now have two rules.

70
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,670
Got the default rule at the end here which says that all traffic will be forwarded to target group one

71
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:11,000
but the number one rule here is that if the path is slash orders then forward to target group 2.

72
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,210
So that's all looking good.

73
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,350
Let's go back and check if our instances are healthy.

74
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,570
So they're actually in the initial stage in target group 2.

75
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,270
It's got a target group one they're also in the initial stage so we need to wait a couple of minutes

76
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,860
until our instances show as being healthy.

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,220
So it's been a few minutes and I can see my instances in target group one are healthy and in target

78
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,850
group 2.

79
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,270
They're also healthy.

80
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,040
So that looks great.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:43,380
Let's go to load balancers description and we can copy the DNS name and I'm going to go to a new tab.

82
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,310
Put it in.

83
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,850
And here we go.

84
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,710
We've got this is Brett.

85
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,320
And if I just hit refresh.

86
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,970
We've now got Joe Len as well.

87
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,420
So we should cycle through Brett and Joe Len.

88
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,780
Now these instances are in target group 1 because we've gone straight through the default rule because

89
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,630
we didn't put slash orders in.

90
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,890
So let's go back and put in slash orders into the path and see what happens.

91
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:16,680
So I'm going to type in slash orders dot hasty email because that's the file on our instances.

92
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,700
And now we've got Sandra and Alicia so you can see we're now cycling through Sandra.

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,860
Alicia these are the instances in target group 2 because we've used a path that includes slash orders

94
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:36,800
so our rule has triggered on a condition and forwarded traffic to target group to so that's how it works

95
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,240
we've got Lisa and Sandra there.

96
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,240
And if we remove it slash orders straight away we go back to Brett and Joe Len.

97
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,210
So that's if a path based routing we set up this configuration.

98
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,130
And if you wanted to apply a bit more you could add in additional rules with different conditions.

99
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,290
Now we're going to keep our configuration running because we're going to focus on host based routing

100
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,750
in the next lap.

101
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:08,710
But what we can do is just go back to our load balancer to listeners view and it rules and let's just

102
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,750
delete this rule.

103
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:18,150
So you click the minus select one and then delete and that's put us back to just having the default

104
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,860
rule.

105
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,220
And then in the next slide we're going to look at host based routing so leave everything running and

106
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,660
go straight onto the next lap.
