00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,050
Welcome back in this lesson.

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm going to show you how to use user data and metadata with two, I have a file open here with some

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,470
code in it.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,520
Now don't worry, you don't need to understand too much about this code and you don't need to change

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:19,970
anything.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,830
This is in the code directory.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,400
So when you get your course, download your course.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,900
Download is in the last lesson of section one of the course.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,070
You can download a zip file once you unzip the zip file.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,760
You will find a code directory within there.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,720
You'll find Amazon EC2 and then you'll find this file user data.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,310
That's metadata, though ask.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,370
Now I'll explain to you quickly what this is doing.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:55,690
This is going to update the operating system with patches and then installs a web server called FTP.

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,070
A very simple web service.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,270
Then what's happening is it's actually going to use the metadata of the instance.

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,230
So it's going to find out what the instance ideas.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,470
So remember this URL we saw in the last lesson?

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,250
This URL is actually going to find out what the instance side is for this particular instance.

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,530
And it's going to record it in a variable.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,900
And then it's going to take that variable and put it into some text.

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:34,680
And so what should happen is the web page should say the instance side of this Amazon EC2 instance is.

23
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,040
And then it should have the correct instance side.

24
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,110
And the way it does that is it changes the variable and saves it to the indexed on HTML file, which

25
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,350
is the web page that we're going to see when we connect to the instance.

26
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,590
Now the good news is you don't need to change anything.

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,790
This file is going to be supplied as user data to our S2 instance when we launch.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:08,330
So we're combining metadata to find out the instance, IP and user data in terms of supplying this code

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,580
to the operating system when it boots.

30
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,990
So let's head over to the management console back in AC.

31
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,420
I'm going to choose launch instances.

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,930
I'm going to select Amazon, then it's two am, I will keep it as a teacher in my crew.

33
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,320
Choose configure instance details, and this time we scroll to the bottom and we have two options here,

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,580
we could put the code directly in here or we can choose the file.

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,600
So I'm going to choose the file, select choose file and in my code directory, I'm going to go and

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,660
find that file and choose for upload.

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,000
So now the file is being supplied.

38
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,650
Nothing needs to be changed.

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,240
We can choose next.

40
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,220
Go for it, a security group.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,710
We can choose our security group and then go forwards.

42
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,850
Now there is another thing we're going to need to do once we launch this instance.

43
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,800
Remember, we have two protocols that we can connect to an instance with the secure shell protocol or

44
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,200
DP.

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,890
Nothing else is allowed in our security group, our firewall.

46
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,470
And we will need to allow Port AC because that's the port that a web server runs on.

47
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,010
So that's change review and launch and launch.

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,310
I just need to acknowledge and launch instances.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,460
So while that's launching, let's come back to the console, choose security groups.

50
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,370
I'm going to go back to inbound rules.

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,990
Edit inbound rules.

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,000
Click on ads.

53
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:48,880
And this time I'm going to type FTP, select FTP and it automatically chooses the port range as 80,

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,280
and we're going to allow from anywhere.

55
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,380
I'm going to just use IP version four and save rules.

56
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,670
So that's done.

57
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,660
Let's go back to instances, and we just need to give this a couple of minutes to make sure that it's

58
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,230
booted up.

59
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,120
And then I should be able to copy this IP address and put it into a browser window.

60
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,390
So just give that a couple of minutes and then we'll give it a try.

61
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,750
OK, so it's been a couple of minutes.

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,100
I'm going to copy the public IPv4 address, or you can choose the IPv4 DNS.

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,550
I'm going to open a new tab in my browser, paste that in and hit Enter.

64
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,510
And sure enough, we get a web page and the web page has the text that came from our file that says

65
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:41,380
the instant side of this Amazon EC2 instance is and then we can see it's filled out the instant side.

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,580
So that should correspond with the instant side here.

67
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,520
So that information was found in the metadata for the S2 instance.

68
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:59,050
So we used the user data to install a web service, and we used metadata to find out the instance IP

69
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,460
and then we put it on this page.

70
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,180
So that's how we use user data and metadata.

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,780
Now I'm just going to go back and terminate my instance.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,150
So again, just select your instance, go to instance, state and terminate instance.
