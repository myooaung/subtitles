1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:08,590
We're moving on now to Amazon cloud trial, so cloud trial is a service that records activity about

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,240
the API actions that are taking place in your account.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:19,300
So rather than looking at performance metrics or events, states like Cloud Watch, it's actually looking

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,330
at what is happening, like who is creating a resource, terminating a resource, updating a resource.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,930
And of course, this might not necessarily be a user performing those actions.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,040
It can be a service performing those actions as well.

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,920
So, for example, with LAMDA, you might have a crit or update function API action with easy to run

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,870
instances or terminate instances.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,570
We've asked us it could be to set the key attributes or delete the Q and with Dinamo DB, it might be

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,480
to delete a table or update one.

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:58,570
So Cloud Trail is a web service that records activity made on your account and you create something

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:06,850
called a trial and a trial can be created and it delivers log files to an S3 bucket cloud enables governance,

13
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,110
compliance and operational and risk auditing of your Adewusi account.

14
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,350
So just remember this in exam questions, it's usually pretty obvious when something is pointing towards

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,760
cloud trial rather than cloud watch because cloud watch is all about performance monitoring.

16
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,970
And usually when it's cloud trial, it's something related to governance or compliance where you need

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,400
to record some information about what's happening in your account, what actions are being taken place.

18
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,710
Events include actions taken in the management console of the command line interface.

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,400
The SDK is in the API, so pretty much any event is recorded.

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,970
So if you're modifying a resource in any way or creating a resource or deleting a resource, then that

21
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,440
is an action that can be recorded by Amazon cloud trail.

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,660
Now, cloud trial is enabled on your account when you create it.

23
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,750
You can create two different types of trials so you can get one that applies to all regions.

24
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,850
This records events in all regions and delivers them to a single S3 bucket.

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,220
Or you can have a trial that applies to a single region and that records events in that single region

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,010
and delivers them to a necessary bucket.

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,920
And if you create additional single trails, they can use the same or different bucket.

28
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,320
There are a couple of different types of events that you get in Cloudera one's called a management event.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,690
So this provides information about management operations that are performed on your resources in your

30
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,170
account and also known as control plan operations.

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,250
So some of the examples would be configuring security, like attaching an IBM policy, registering devices

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,450
like creating a default VPC, configuring rules for routing data such as creating a subnet and setting

33
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,490
up logging such as the crit trial API operations.

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,090
We then have data events.

35
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,520
So these provide information about the resource operations performed on or in a resource and then known

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,020
as data plan operations.

37
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,130
And these are often the high volume activities, examples of data.

38
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,630
Events include Ezri object level API activity like get object, lead object and put objects and adewusi

39
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,140
lambda function execution activity.

40
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,280
Where you invoking the API?

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,960
So again, just to make sure we're completely clear on the differences there.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,430
So Cloud, which is about performance monitoring, cloud trial, is about auditing.

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,740
So think of it as a security service.

44
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,900
Cloud watch logs, events across services, and this is more about operations where as cloud trimmers

45
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,010
logging API activity across services.

46
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,300
So that's about the activity in your account cloud, which is high level comprehensive monitoring and

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,540
a venting cloud trollers, lower level and very granular.

48
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,220
We've cloud watch and cloud travel, you can log from multiple accounts and cloud watch logs stored

49
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,500
indefinitely in cloud prologues are stored to ESRI or cloud watch indefinitely.

50
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,980
We've cloud what you have alarms history for 14 days now, remember that with cloud, you don't have

51
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,210
native alarming, but you can use the alarm feature of cloud watch.
