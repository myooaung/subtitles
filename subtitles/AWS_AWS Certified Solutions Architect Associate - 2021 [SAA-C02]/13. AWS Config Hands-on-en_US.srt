00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,500
Hi, guys, I'm in the NWS management console and I'm going to head to services, go down to management

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,450
and governance and choose config.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,290
Now, if you haven't run config before, you may not see this screen, you might actually be put into

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,560
a wizard which asks you a few questions.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,230
So firstly, it's going to ask you which resources you want to enable config to be able to discover

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,930
inventory information from.

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,230
So I just chose to enable all resources within the region.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,890
And you can see what resources I have available here.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,010
It's then going to ask you to choose a bucket and the S3 bucket is where the data, each configuration

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,140
item is actually going to get stored.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,050
Thirdly, it's going to ask you to specify a role.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,710
So this is an Iame role that's used for the service and it will create one by default for you or you

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,850
can specify a role.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,360
It may then also put you into a wizard to create your first rules.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:09,940
So what will happen then is if you can just continue to add the rule and follow my instructions or you

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,020
can exit out of that wizard and then just go to rules on the left hand side here and choose and rule.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,240
And what we have is a series of AWB management rules excuse me, AWB managed rules.

18
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,960
So these are predefined rules that already exist.

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,310
So they cover quite a few scenarios, but you'll likely want to create your own custom rules for what

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,920
we're going to do now is just look for some rules.

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,960
So firstly and type two and then choose this rule here.

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,010
And what this does is this checks we have a detailed monitoring in the neighborhood for two instances

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,410
and I've actually launched an active instance here and this one is using basic monitoring because that's

24
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,980
the default.

25
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,260
So that means it will send information to cloud watch every five minutes, whereas detail means every

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,940
one minutes.

27
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:07,300
So this rule will just check to see if my two instances are actually compliant with this rule that states

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,270
that they should have detailed monitoring enabled so of would just choose, save and then going to go

29
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,470
back into add rules.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,700
And I'm just going to type security and we should have some rules coming up that are related to security

31
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,110
groups.

32
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,390
So this one here is the one I'm looking for.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:32,030
So it checks that security groups are attached to two instances or elastic network interfaces.

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,200
So what that means is every security group in your account, it's going to check whether it's actually

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,140
being used by an elastic network interface or an 82 instance.

36
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,550
So this is a good way of auditing your ruleset to check whether your security groups are being used

37
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,410
or whether they're just sitting there not doing anything.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,830
So what happens straight away is we can see that we very quickly got a response here that says that

39
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,770
we have a non-compliant resource for the detailed monitoring and the overall is still evaluating.

40
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,810
So let's choose to go in and have a look at this rule.

41
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,010
And we can see that we've actually got the I.D. of the instance actually identified here and it says

42
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,570
it's non-compliant and that's because we don't have detailed monitoring enabled.

43
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,420
That's exactly what we'd expect to see.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,840
You can have a look at a bit more information.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,420
For instance, you can see our compliance timeline, and it shows you that at a certain point in time,

46
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,100
the resource was non-compliant.

47
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,380
You can also look at a configuration timeline and this will show you things such as the relationships

48
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,740
as well.

49
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,530
So you can see that this particular instance is related to a network interface, a security group,

50
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,500
a subnet and Ebb's volume and a VPC.

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,670
Now let's head back up to config, going to have a look at our rules.

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,630
And now we have eight non-compliant resources.

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,450
So I've got quite a few security groups in my account, but I've only got one instance running at the

54
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:53,810
moment.

55
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,430
So most of those security groups aren't being used.

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,880
So it's definitely had a look and it's found out that the security groups are not actually currently

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,570
in use.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,100
So those are just a couple of quick examples of what you can do with these compliance rules.

59
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,460
Also, I just want to show you quickly that within the rule now, let's just choose anyone at random

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,690
here.

61
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,810
We have this remediation action so the remediation action can do things like publish and since notification.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,950
But there's also all these other options here as well.

63
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,090
And, you know, these are predefined.

64
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,200
You can create your own and you can run lambda functions and that kind of thing.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,760
But you can see there's lots of things that you could do here, like release an elastic IP.

66
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,500
You know, you might restart or start or stop an active instance or terminate in AC2 instance.

67
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,820
So there's lots of remediation actions that can be performed.

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,990
So I'm just going to cancel out of there now.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,070
I did mention I'm going to go into Asri, so I just want to show you where the actual configuration

70
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,940
items are stored.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,330
So Innisfree, I have my bucket, which is called config bucket DCT lamp's yours will be something different.

72
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,770
And if we head into here, we can see you've got a few folders and then we've got config and then we've

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,440
got the region.

74
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,970
So this is a neighborhood at a regional level.

75
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,700
So if I go in and it's got a whole directory structure based on dates I suppose, and then we go into

76
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,860
here, we can find that we've got lots and lots of configuration items.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,280
So as you can see, we've got configuration items for Internet gateways.

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:29,270
We've got Network ECLSS, we've got network interfaces, subnet security groups, volumes, elastic

79
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,300
beanstalk cards and so on.

80
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,460
So it's it's found lots of resources in my account.

81
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,160
And then it's pulled some configuration information about those resources and stored it in this bucket.

82
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,730
And it will keep it there long term as well, which is how you can look into your configuration history

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,710
and see at a point in time what the resource state was.

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,480
So as you changed or as it re-evaluates, it's going to create new configuration items and keep those

85
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,750
in your bucket as well.

86
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,260
So that's just a quick overview of config.

87
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,560
Now, to delete our rules, we can edit if you just go down to the bottom, we can hit delete rule.

88
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,530
And then I'm just going to repeat that for the other rule and that's it.

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,820
So that's it for this lab, guys.

90
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,780
Hope you enjoyed that.

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,470
Don't forget, if you have launched any resources to go and terminate them.

92
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,930
And I'll see you in the next lesson.
