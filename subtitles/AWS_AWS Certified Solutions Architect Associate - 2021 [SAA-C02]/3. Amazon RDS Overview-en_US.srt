00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,250
Hi guys it's time to get hands on.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:12,110
And in this lab we're going to cover Amazon relational database service. I'm in the AWS management

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,170
console I'm going to go to services, database, and choose RDS.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,800
This is a managed service and we can choose from one of several different engines.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,320
So what I'm gonna do is we're just gonna go through the wizard here.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:34,500
You can just click Create database or go to databases and then create database and by default it always

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,240
comes out with Amazon Aurora.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,120
Now I'm going to cover RDS in this lab but we're going to push Amazon Aurora out for a few labs

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,710
because it's a whole different beast.

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,920
And I want to tackle that independently.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,010
So first off I just want to show you the options associated with these databases so let's choose mysql

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,310
you could also choose then MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle or Microsoft SQL

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,300
server.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,540
Now when doing your labs you can choose to select this option here which will ensure that you

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,040
only use options which are within the free tier.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm not going to do that for now and you can see by the way that a row gets greyed out straight away.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,110
So you can't do Aurora.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,280
So you don't get any free tier credits with Aurora but let's just click next and we now have an option

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,590
to choose our use case so let's say this is a production database which means I'm going to get some

20
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,370
defaults for provisioned I up storage high availability and fast and consistent performance I click

21
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,330
next.

22
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:49,840
And here you can choose your licensing model and then your engine version you then get an instance class.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,500
So if you look here what you're basically looking at is the EC2 instance classes that are associated

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,500
with this database so you can choose your instance class here and this essentially means that your database

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,180
is going to get installed onto an EC2 instance and that's going to happen in your subnets as well.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,140
So for instance we can choose, let's go for an  extra large instance

27
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,180
you then get an option to choose multi AZ.

28
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,320
You can choose no here if you don't want a redundant deployment we're going to go through multi AZ

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,450
in a lot more detail and another lab.

30
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,700
RDS uses EBS for storage.

31
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,750
That's why you recognize general purpose and provisions IOPS.

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:40,310
These are types of EBS storage and you can enable storage auto scaling so the storage allocation will

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,820
increase as your database increases in size.

34
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,270
We then get our estimated monthly costs.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,780
So clearly this is not a free tier ones is going to cost sixteen hundred US dollars a month.

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,990
You then have to put in your settings so we can put in our database identifier.

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,600
Let's just call this digitalcloud and I'm just going to paste this into the master username and password

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
sections as well and then click on Next

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,460
we now get an option to choose our VPC.

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:25,330
So I could choose my custom VPC and then we get to choose a subnet group a DP subnet group is a collection

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,770
of subnets in which your database instances are going to be launched.

42
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,200
You can then choose whether you want them to get a public IP address and be publicly available or not

43
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,250
and you can choose the availability zone within this VPC that you put them in can choose a security

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:53,300
group or allow it to create one for you you can then put in your database name the port of for mySQL

45
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,740
is free for you 06 and you can then enable IAM DB authentication as well so if you leave this disabled

46
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,690
you'll just use your traditional method of using the username and password to connect to the database.

47
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,990
If you enable IAM D.B. authentication you can then use authentication tokens that can be associated

48
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,560
with users and roles you can enable encryption for your database and you have to do that at this point

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,340
in time so you can enable it at a later point in time.

50
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,800
There is a way around that and we'll go through that in a second but basically you need to ensure that you

51
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,600
enable this at the time that you create your database if you want an encrypted database.

52
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,070
So let's just click learn more because there's a great article here which can give you a bit more detail

53
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:44,290
let's just scroll down to the bottom and what I want to point out to you are the limitations of RDS

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,490
encryption.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,250
So the first thing to note is you can only enable encryption for an RDS DB instance when you create

56
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,910
it not after the DB instance is created.

57
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,360
So that's an important point.

58
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:03,640
But because of this is using EBS storage and you can take snapshots of your database and you can then

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:11,350
encrypt that snapshot and what you can do then is you can restore the encrypted snapshot to a new DB

60
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,870
instance. It has to be a new one, it can't be the same DB, instance but you can create a new DB instance

61
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,940
from that encrypted snapshot and now you've got around the problem where you wanted to encrypt an existing

62
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,200
database.

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,780
The next point is that DB instances that are encrypted can't be modified to disable encryption so again

64
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,340
it all comes down to you get the choice when you first deploy your database to encrypt or not encrypt

65
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,080
and you've kind of got to live with that except where you might be out to use the encrypted snapshot

66
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,370
option to create a new encrypted database but you can't do it the other way around.

67
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,120
You also can't have an encrypted read replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted read replica

68
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,920
of an encrypted DB instance and we'll talk more about read replicas and I'll show you how to configure

69
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,960
those within this section.

70
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,940
Also note that encrypted redirect because must be encrypted with the same key as the source D.B. and

71
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,120
you can't restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance.

72
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,340
So this comes back to this first point here where sure you can encrypt a snapshot but you can't restore

73
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,590
it to an unencrypted database you have to create a new database restore the encrypted snapshot to that

74
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,110
database and then you've got you encrypted database

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,600
and also when you copy encrypted snapshots between regions you have to specify the came as key identifier

76
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,600
of the destination AWS region.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:45,720
So what what RDS will do is it will re-encrypt your data with the same key from the destination

78
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,250
region.

79
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,860
The next section in the configuration wizard is backup and the default is that you retain your backups

80
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,600
for seven days.

81
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,330
You can choose 0 which means nothing is going to be retained or you can go up to 35 days.

82
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,640
So I just put that back to the default and you can choose a window in which the backups going to be

83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,060
taken.

84
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,610
So obviously if you want to ensure that any performance implications have taken the backup out within

85
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,710
a time when your users aren't using it then you can select your window there.

86
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,420
You can also enable enhanced monitoring which will cost you a bit more that uses cloudwatch by default

87
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,650
it would be disabled except in the scenarios where you're choosing this production workloads so it's

88
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,950
automatically enabled that under maintenance you can define a maintenance window and that means that

89
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:38,280
when patches or security updates need to be installed it will happen within this time frame and it might

90
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,690
mean in some cases such as for security updates that your easy to instance on which your database is

91
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,070
running needs to be restarted.

92
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,590
So that means a database outage so you can choose the window here.

93
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:57,560
And if you've got multiple AZ then you can ensure that your database stays up by using the replica copy

94
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,540
of your database.

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:10,100
You can also choose whether minor upgrades are automatically installed or not.

96
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,810
You can also enable deletion protection which just means you've got an extra layer of security to stop

97
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,510
your database accidentally being deleted.

98
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,950
Now I'm not gonna click

99
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,200
Create database here because obviously this one is gonna cost lots of money.

100
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,650
So what I'm gonna do is just cancel out of here and in the next lab we're going to install Wordpress

101
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,160
on an EC2 instance and use RDS mysql

102
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,020
as the database backend.
