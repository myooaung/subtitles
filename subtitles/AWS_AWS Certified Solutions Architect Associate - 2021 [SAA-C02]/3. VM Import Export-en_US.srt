Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,160
There's another way that you can import virtual machines into the W.S. Cloud.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,720
Now, I didn't put this on the original slide at the beginning of the section, but this is definitely

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,430
another way.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,450
And this can come up in exam questions.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,880
So you need to understand this now.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,840
It's basically importing and exporting virtual machines.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
So let's say on premises you've got a virtualization stack.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,840
So this could be a Windows or Linux for MS.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,450
The virtualization stack could be VM where ESX.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,590
It can be marks of type of V, it could be Sitrick, Xen, and you got your virtual machines running

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,010
on there.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,820
Now, what you need to do is export your virtual machines.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:49,910
And typically that would be in an ovie, a file and then you upload your A file to Amazon estuary's.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:58,590
You might use to see Allai upload your files to Amazon as free and then you can run a CLIA command to

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,530
import the image and create of a AMISOM C.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,400
And I am I will be sort of registered against E.S. too, but it's also backed by S3.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,760
And then what you do is run another command to use the EMI or just go in through the console.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,370
The point is you've now taken your on premises virtual machine, turned it into an ovie, a file imported

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,090
into a W.S..

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,960
So it becomes an am I.

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,800
And then you're able to use that EMI to launch instances in your VPC.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,500
So that's the import piece for export.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,840
You're kind of doing the reverse.

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,540
You might take your easy two instances and you need to move them back on premises so you can export

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,340
them from a W.S..

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,030
And the process is a little bit different, but it's the same sort of thing.

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,270
And then you export them back to on premises.

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,720
Now, most likely, if this comes up and exam is going to be the other way around because it's going

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,760
to be organizations who want to migrate into the cloud.

31
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,020
So that's B.M. import export.
