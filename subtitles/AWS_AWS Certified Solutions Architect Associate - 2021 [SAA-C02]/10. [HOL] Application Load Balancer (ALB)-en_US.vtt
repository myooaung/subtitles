00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.280
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to create an application load balancer back in the easy to

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.380
management console, you should still have your auto scaling group running with your two instances.

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.240
And what we're going to do is scroll down to auto scaling groups.

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.290
We're going to click on Edit for Auto Scaling Group, and I'm going to come down to load balancers,

5
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:35.870
remove the NHLBI Target Group and choose the Albi Target Group, and then it's come down and save.

6
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.670
So now that's been updated.

7
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.110
Let's go to target groups, and I just want to show you something quickly.

8
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.560
Let's go to TG Dash Albi, and let's just give this a refresh.

9
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.460
Now we can see the instances are here, but the health status is unused.

10
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.430
Now the reason for that is because we don't have a load balancer, so you don't get a health check until

11
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.090
we have a load balancer using these instances.

12
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.190
That's why they're in the unused status.

13
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.740
So let's resolve that.

14
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.850
Let's go and create a load balancer.

15
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.280
I'm going to choose load balances here Crate Load Balancer and application load balancer.

16
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.040
I'm going to call it my Albi, and you can see this wizard is slightly different to the NLP wizard,

17
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.540
which was updated recently.

18
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.590
I assume this will be updated again soon, so you might find it slightly different.

19
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.720
This is a constant thing with IWC.

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.640
They're always changing the console, so the load balance of protocol is cheap and easy.

21
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.290
That's good.

22
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.690
We could, of course, add an HD kps protocol if we chose HD TP.

23
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.290
It wouldn't like the fact that we have two listeners on the same port now.

24
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.810
For now, we don't want to do that.

25
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.000
We're just going to add an FTP listener.

26
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.470
We'll do HD scopes a bit later on the VPC.

27
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm going to use the default.

28
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.580
I have to select a subnet for this.

29
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.780
I because I have two options and four B and C.

30
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.090
This is going to auto assign those.

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.990
Now these addresses are going to be assigned by IWC.

32
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.340
They're going to be public addresses because this is a public facing low balance.

33
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.740
So we chose internet facing up here.

34
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.270
Now there is no option for elastic types, as you can see.

35
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.100
So let's just scroll down.

36
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.090
Click on next.

37
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.130
Click on security groups, and now we have to assign a security group, note that with the NHLBI, there

38
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.600
was no security group option.

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.300
You can't assign a security group to an NLP.

40
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.970
But for a ALP, you do.

41
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.460
Let's move on to configure and routing.

42
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.200
We're going to choose existing target group and it also fills Albi because that's the only one available

43
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.460
which actually fits the ALP.

44
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.890
But you couldn't use the NHLBI Target Group because it specified a TCP protocol and you can't have a

45
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.960
TCP protocol with an ALP, it must be HTP or HTTPS.

46
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.300
I can leave the remaining defaults here.

47
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.700
I'm happy with the health check settings as they are.

48
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.100
We can see that we already have registered targets because they're registered with the target group

49
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.120
that we've specified.

50
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.340
So we just got to review and create and that's going to create a load balancer.

51
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.040
I'm now going to close out of here and we just need to give that a couple of minutes while it's provisioning.

52
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.070
And then we should see all instances in a healthy state and we'll be able to connect using the DNS name

53
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.210
while that's happening.

54
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.490
Let's go to actions, edit attributes so we can see there's quite a few options with the ALP.

55
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.990
We can enable deletion protection so you can't immediately delete your load balancer.

56
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.970
We have an idle time out.

57
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.320
This determines the amount of time before an idle connection is disconnected.

58
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.540
We got http two enabled, and then there's a couple of options here for security.

59
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.240
So decent mitigation mode, which determines how the load balance a handles requests that might pose

60
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.410
a security risk.

61
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.290
We can drop invalid header fields and we can enable access logs here and again.

62
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.940
This is using an S3 bucket.

63
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.000
Why file open is used with the web application firewall and it basically means that if you can't contact

64
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.960
with the low bounce account, contact WAAF, then it will fail open.

65
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.310
It will allow connections free.

66
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.990
We can forward TLS version and cipher information client.

67
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:30.160
Port preservation is where the load balancer is, adding the exe forwarded for header to the packets

68
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.950
that are sent to your easy instances, and that includes the source IP of your clients so you can enable

69
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.730
that if you want to.

70
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.620
I'm just going to cancel out of here.

71
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.800
Now, let's give this a refresh and see what state we're in.

72
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.710
So it looks like we have an active load balancer.

73
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.640
Let's copy the DNS name, and let's just go to our target group to make sure our instances are healthy.

74
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.880
We'll give this a refresh, and there we go.

75
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.740
We have two healthy instances, so that's good.

76
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.030
We should be able to connect now.

77
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:06.040
So I'm going to open a new browser tab, paste in the Ailbhe DNS name, and I get sent to the instance

78
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.310
in U.S.C. eight.

79
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.310
Now, if I refresh my browser, I go to USB one C, then back, I see, I see.

80
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.310
So every time I refresh, it sends me to a different load balancer node.

81
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.430
Now we can control this so that we stick a session to a particular load balancer node.

82
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.690
And there's some good reasons for doing that will cover that.

83
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.910
And another lesson shortly.

84
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.430
Now that's it for this particular lesson.

85
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.940
What we're going to do now is just leave our load balance of running.

86
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.870
We're going to leave our auto scaling group running because we're going to come back to that in another

87
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.440
hands on.
