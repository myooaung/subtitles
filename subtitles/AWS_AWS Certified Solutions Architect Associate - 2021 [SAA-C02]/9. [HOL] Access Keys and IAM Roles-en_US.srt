1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,750
In this lesson, I'm going to show you the difference between access keys and IAM roles.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:17,740
And we're going to use both of them for the same purpose to access some data in Amazon is free, but

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,810
you'll see how the implementation is slightly different and how one way is a bit more secure than the

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,080
other.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,420
So back in the console here, I'm going to launch an active instance.

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,140
It's going to be a Linux two Army, 82 Micro, and we're not going to change anything here.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:42,880
Go through to Security Group, just select our Web Access Security Group and then launch that instance.

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:49,810
Now, while that's launching, I'm going to go to services and open the SE free service under storage.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,680
It's free is what's known as an object based storage system.

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,900
You'll learn a lot more about it later in the course.

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,830
For now, I'm going to create a bucket, and a bucket is simply a container.

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,000
It's kind of like a directory in which you can store data.

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,270
I'm going to call my DCT Dash IWC Dash Cloud, Dash Labs.

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,900
Now, this does need to be unique in the world, so hopefully nobody else has that specific name.

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,900
The region is USC small Virginia.

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,550
That's fine, and I'm just going to scroll down to the bottom and create the buckets.

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,620
And sure enough, that's been allowed.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,350
So you'll need to change your bucket name.

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,970
You can't have the same one as me.

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,850
Let's just choose the bucket here, and I'm simply going to upload a couple of files.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,770
So choose add files.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,060
And I've got a couple of images here, so I'll just choose those images.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,300
It really doesn't matter for the purposes of this exercise.

24
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,640
Just choose any small images you have.

25
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:56,500
So those have been successfully uploaded now back in easy to, I'm going to select my instance, choose,

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,950
connect and use EC2 instance connect.

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,300
Click on the Connect button, and now I'm logged into my EC2 instance.

28
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,850
So let's try and run a command.

29
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,640
I'm going to run IWC.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,460
That's free.

31
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,910
Less so now it should list the names of the buckets that we have in the accounts.

32
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,700
But of course it doesn't.

33
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,670
We saw this earlier.

34
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,540
We need to run this command called IWC Configure.

35
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,320
And it's going to need an access key and a secret ID.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,010
So let's go and get those first back in the console.

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,420
We're going to go to services.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,470
Scroll down to security, identity and compliance and choose I am in the I am console.

39
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,150
We're going to choose users.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Select your user accounts, go to security credentials, and then create an access key.

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,840
So select this one.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,370
Now, the key thing to understand about access case is that you only get to see the secret access key

43
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,820
once.

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,690
Now you can download the file, but you only get to see the secret access key in the console here once

45
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,490
and then it's stored in your file, so you do have to keep the secure.

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,700
I show you because I'm going to delete mine before you actually see this video.

47
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,180
Otherwise, you wouldn't want to share this in a video or in any of a form to people out on the internet.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,790
You should keep this secure only for yourself.

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,640
Now I'm going to copy my access to my clipboard back in instance connects.

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,230
I'm going to type eight of us configure, and it asks me for the access key.

51
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,880
So I pay started, and it now asks me for the secret access key.

52
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,260
So back in I am, I'm going to copy the secret access key.

53
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,160
Come back.

54
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:52,210
Paste that in my region is U.S. Dash East Dash one, and then I'm going to press, enter, enter again,

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
and I'm back at the command prompt.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,800
So let's try and rerun the IWC as free LS command.

57
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,500
And sure enough, now we can see this bucket.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,490
And if I were to do IWC Free Alice.

59
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,490
As free colon slash slash and then the bucket name, I should then see the files in the bucket as well.

60
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,570
So this just proves that using these credentials, we've been able to access another U.S. service.

61
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:31,600
Now there is a problem if I go to this file directory, so I'm going to change Directory Tilde Slashdot

62
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,910
IWC and run the LS command, we'll say these two files.

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,250
Now, if I run the cat's credentials, come on.

64
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,260
This will actually read the file and put it on the screen.

65
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,930
Now, as you can see, this file called credentials has my access code and my secret access keys stored

66
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,140
in it.

67
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,970
And that's in plain text.

68
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,530
It's not encrypted in any way.

69
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,400
So if anybody were able to compromise this system, they would potentially be able to get access to

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
this file and then they'd be able to do anything in my IWC account because they would have the same

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,270
permissions as me.

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,150
So I don't like that.

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,040
That's not really a very secure thing to do.

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,250
And that's one of the I am best practices, which is to not store access keys in your code.

75
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,640
I've just cleared my screen to make things a bit easier to see.

76
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,000
And if I just run that else, command again.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,320
We have these two files and I'm going to type all RAM Dash RF style and that should have deleted them.

78
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,150
So now we don't have those files.

79
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:46,130
So now if I run the IWC free ALS command again, we're back to not being able to access the service.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,450
So now we're going to do the better way, the more secure way which is to use an I am role.

81
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,280
So I've changed back to the I Am console.

82
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,990
We're going to go to roles, create role, choose the create role here under IWC service, we're going

83
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,270
to choose common use cases etc.

84
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,930
So this means that it's going to allow the easy to instance to call other IWC services.

85
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,720
So choose easy to click next.

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,220
On this page, we're now going to search for free and we're going to choose Amazon as free read only

87
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,790
access.

88
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,920
So this is the policy, and we want to choose the one that has the least privileged that we need.

89
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,840
All we need at this stage is to be able to read from Amazon straight sets.

90
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,970
Choose next, go free to review and I'm going to call this one free, read only and choose Crate Roll.

91
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,590
So we've created the role.

92
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,270
Now let's go back to the new management console in the management console here.

93
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,820
I've selected my EC2 instance.

94
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,070
Let's click on actions.

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,390
We're going to go to security and modify.

96
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,480
I am role in the dropdown.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,110
We should see the role that we created as free read only.

98
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,110
So select that and then click on Sage.

99
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,540
So that should have been changed instantly.

100
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,730
Back in the easy to instance connect.

101
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm going to try and rerun this command.

102
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:20,780
So now I'm able to access Amazon as free, but I don't have any of those files on my file system, so

103
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:29,240
I don't have that security exposure of having a unencrypted file on my computer that stores the access

104
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,960
keys, that secret information I wouldn't want anyone to get access to.

105
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,250
So that's how it all works, and we're finished for this lesson.

106
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,810
And what we're going to do is just go and terminate are two instance.

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,620
So back in the console, just select your instance, go to instant state and terminate and were all

108
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,190
cleaned up.
