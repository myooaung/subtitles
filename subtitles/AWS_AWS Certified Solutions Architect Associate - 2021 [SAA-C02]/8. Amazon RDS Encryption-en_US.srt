00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,310
This is a fiery lecture on Amazon A.D.s encryption, there can be some exam questions popping up, and

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,890
I want to make sure you're armed with all the facts you need.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,190
So encryption at rest can be enabled for your Amazon A.D.s instance, so Buy-Out rest, we're talking

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,300
about the storage.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,110
So your Ebb's volumes, any backups that are taken.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,250
So point in time, backups, read replicas are also encrypted if you encrypt the master database and

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,770
then snapshots, which are obviously the snapshots from your Ebb's volumes, it uses IIS two, five

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,640
six encryption.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,080
It's transparent.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,010
So the process is transparent, meaning it happens in the background.

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:54,180
And there's minimal performance impact, so you shouldn't notice a performance impact on your database

12
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,500
now, it absolutely must be enabled at DB creation time.

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,520
So remember that one really important.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,620
You cannot enable encryption for your database instance at a later point in time with ideas for Oracle

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,060
and SQL Server.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,880
You can also use transparent data encryption.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,700
Now, this is encryption and the database layer.

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,620
So it's not A.D.s performing the encryption and it may have a performance impact.

19
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,530
Adewusi KMC is used for managing the encryption keys associated with the encryption here.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,890
Now from Read Replicas, if you create a read replica of an encrypted database, it will also be encrypted

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:44,200
if the replica is in the same region as the master database, you can use the same encryption key to

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,850
encrypt the Reed replica.

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,440
If the replica is in a different region than a different key must be used.

24
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,700
So remember, you can only enable encryption for instances when you create it, not later on.

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,430
Now, I'm going to show you a workaround in a second, and that's really important because it comes

26
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,500
up in exam scenario questions.

27
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:15,040
So DBI instances that are encrypted can be modified to disable encryption, so once you've enabled encryption,

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,120
you can't then later on decide that you want an unencrypted database.

29
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:28,020
You also can't have an encrypted replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted replica of

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,470
an encrypted DB instance.

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,670
So just to simplify that, if your databases encrypted, your marriage replica is encrypted and that's

32
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,810
the way it has to be.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,430
And if your databases unencrypted, your read replica is unencrypted, there are no other options,

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,430
they're encrypted replicas must be encrypted with the same key as the source DBI instance when they're

35
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,300
in the same region.

36
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,460
You can't restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance, so if your database

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,150
instance is encrypted, your snapshots are encrypted, and if your database is unencrypted, your snapshots

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,070
are unencrypted and you can't restore an unencrypted backup to an encrypted DB instance.

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,660
So I mentioned that there's a workaround.

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,050
So let's say you created this database up on the left there.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,100
So this instance is unencrypted and you want to encrypt that database.

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,410
So as you know, you can't do that.

43
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,280
You can't go into the arts management console and enable encryption.

44
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,430
So remember all this for the exam.

45
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,420
You might have an exam question that poses this scenario.

46
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,090
One of the answers is likely to be that you go to the management console and just simply enable encryption.

47
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,850
So remember, you can't do that now.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,460
This means that your this is unencrypted.

49
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:57,240
So the Ebb's volume for this database instance is unencrypted, and that means the snapshots you take

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,580
from it are unencrypted.

51
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:06,150
But what we can then do is create a copy of the snapshot and encrypt the copy of the snapshot.

52
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,600
So now we have an encrypted snapshot from unencrypted database.

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,570
We can then restore that database.

54
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,470
So we're actually going to create a new instance and that has a new end.

55
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,450
So that's important to understand.

56
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,860
It's not going to be the same.

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,480
One is going to be a new instance.

58
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,680
But now you've taken an encrypted snapshot and created an encrypted database instance.

59
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,350
So that's the way to get from unencrypted to encrypted.

60
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,120
And it does mean you're going to create a new instance with a new endpoint.

61
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,420
So you need to consider how to then cut that over in your application.
