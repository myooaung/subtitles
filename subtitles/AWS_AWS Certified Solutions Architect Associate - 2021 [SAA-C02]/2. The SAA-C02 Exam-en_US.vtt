00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.230
In this lesson, I'm going to cover some of the details of the IWC Certified Solutions Architects associate

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.710
exam now each IWC exam has a code.

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.560
The current version of the Solutions Architects Association exam is the SIAC zero two.

4
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.740
Ultimately, what you want to achieve and the reason you're here today is a certification like the one

5
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.520
on the screen here.

6
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.640
Now I can guarantee you whatever your background with the resources available in this course, as well

7
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.980
as the help available free forms such as our Slack channel and our Facebook group, you will be able

8
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.600
to achieve your certification.

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.590
So let's go over some of the details of this exam now.

10
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.050
Firstly, the level is associates eight.

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.040
We have a tiered model with roll based indications.

12
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.380
At the bottom they have the cloud practitioner, which is a foundational level certification.

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.100
Then at the associate level, you have the IWC Certified Solutions Architects Associate, the Developer

14
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.710
Associates and the cis ops associates.

15
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.080
At the top, you have the professional level where you have the solutions architect, professional and

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.250
the DevOps professional.

17
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.530
Then there are some specialty certifications that kind of sit on the side and then more of a deep dive

18
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.260
into particular topics and knowledge areas like security and advanced networking and machine learning

19
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.770
and so on.

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.440
Now, even though this is somewhere in the middle in terms of difficulty, it is open to people who

21
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.870
do not have a background in cloud computing, and plenty of people have passed the exam coming through

22
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.900
our courses with no background in cloud computing at all.

23
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.590
The length of the exam is thirty minutes and there are sixty five questions in the exam which are multiple

24
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.360
choice or multiple response.

25
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.770
We'll talk more about that in a moment.

26
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.950
The cost is one hundred and fifty US dollars.

27
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.190
Now, if you have passed an IWC certification exam before, like the cloud practitioner, for example,

28
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.140
then you should have a discount voucher you can use to get a 50 percent discount.

29
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.460
The delivery method is ever going to a testing centre if it's available near you, or you can do an

30
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.520
online proctored exam for scoring.

31
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.480
It's a scale scoring system between 100 and a thousand points, and the minimum passing score is seven

32
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.760
hundred twenty points, so it's 72 percent.

33
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.510
Now there is some recommended knowledge this comes straight from IWC.

34
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.710
They ask for one year of hands on experience with IWC technology experience deploying, managing and

35
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.720
operating workloads on IWC.

36
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.100
Familiarity with the management console and the command line interface.

37
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.660
And an understanding of various technology areas and architectural frameworks and the global infrastructure

38
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.760
of IWC.

39
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.070
And also the ability to identify which services to use to meet a given requirement.

40
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.650
Now, even though that's what they ask for coming into the exam, it's not what you need coming into

41
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.320
this course.

42
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.770
Coming into this course, if you don't know any of this, that's fine if you have never used IWC before.

43
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.880
That's not a problem.

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.400
This course will give you these skills.

45
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.410
So though it's not going to take you a year to complete, you will get plenty of hands on experience

46
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.180
with IWC technology.

47
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.030
If you follow along with a hands on lessons in this course, we also make sure that all of the knowledge

48
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.780
areas are within the course and whenever the exam evolves, as it does over time, we add new lessons

49
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.280
and we modify lessons as we need to to make sure it always has all the content you need.

50
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.720
The question format is multiple choice and multiple response.

51
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.960
With multiple choice, you'll have full answers and you need to select the one correct answer with multiple

52
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.560
response.

53
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.200
You'll typically have five or six answers and you need to select two or more, and it's always very

54
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.680
clear in the exam exactly how many answers you need to supply.

55
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.610
There is no hands on testing with the SAIC zero two.

56
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.280
It's purely questions and answers.

57
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.750
No hands on required.

58
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.030
Now let's go through the exam in a bit more detail in terms of what knowledge is required.

59
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.250
Now, the white IWC organized their exam material is into domains.

60
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.420
There are four domains in the Solutions Architects Association exam.

61
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.600
The first one is design resilient architectures.

62
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.720
You need to know how to design a multi-tiered architecture solution, design highly available and or

63
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.560
fault tolerant architectures, and design decoupling mechanisms.

64
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.470
Using IWC services, you also need to know how to choose the appropriate resilient storage.

65
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.050
All of these concepts are covered in lots of detail in this course, including in lots of hands on lessons.

66
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.980
Domain two is design high performing architectures.

67
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.480
You need to identify elastic and scalable compute solutions for a workload.

68
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.230
Select high performing and scalable storage solutions for a workload.

69
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.620
Selects high performing networking solutions for a workload, and choose high performing database solutions

70
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.430
for a workload.

71
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.390
Performance.

72
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.640
It's a very important characteristic of the architecture as we build on IWC and has lots of variables

73
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.070
involved.

74
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.200
So what you need to understand for each service, what are these variables?

75
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.730
How can you adjust performance and often you need to understand what is the cost implication of that

76
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.150
as well?

77
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.650
The free is designed, secure applications and architectures.

78
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.040
You need to know how to design secure access to resources.

79
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.180
So authentication and authorization design secure application tiers selects appropriate data security

80
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.660
options like file system access and encryption.

81
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.800
Domain form is design cost optimized architectures.

82
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.620
You need to know how to identify cost effective storage solutions, cost effective compute and database

83
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.040
services, and cost optimized network architectures.

84
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.730
As a solutions architect, you'll regularly be asked to make sure that your solutions are low in cost.

85
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.520
But if you want them to be highly secure and high performing and highly resilient, often that imposes

86
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.910
cost.

87
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.890
Now what you need to know for the exam is you need to understand those variables, so you need to understand

88
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:16.010
the trade offs between them and when it's appropriate to lower the cost or when performance or security

89
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.300
might be more important.

90
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.100
And in the questions in the exam, they'll always make it very clear what they're looking for.

91
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.770
Are they looking for the best performing solution, the most resilient solution or the lowest cost solution?

92
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:35.090
So side by side, we've got the main one, which is 30 percent of the exam domain to comprises 28 percent

93
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.100
of the exam domain, free 24 percent and domain for 18 percent.

94
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.200
And if you'd like a bit more information about the exam, including some links to white papers and other

95
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.040
free resources which we recommend, I've added a link to this lesson, which takes you to the main page

96
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.360
for this certification.

97
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.110
On there, you'll find those links and also the exam guide as well.
