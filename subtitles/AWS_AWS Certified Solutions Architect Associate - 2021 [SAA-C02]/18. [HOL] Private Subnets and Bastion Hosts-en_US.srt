1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,930
And this lesson we're going to deploy a to instance, in a public subnet as a bastion hosts and then

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,250
use that to jump to an easy to instance in a private subnet.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,640
So basically what we covered in the previous lesson in that fairy and this diagram basically shows what

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,400
we're going to do.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,580
We're going to use the default VPC in this case, which already has a public subnet.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,280
And we already have a root table correctly configured and an internet gateway attached to the VPC.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,550
What we then need to do is create a private subnet with a root table, and then we're going to be able

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:47,510
to launch our instances in the appropriate subnets and then connect in and jump from our public instance

9
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,680
to a private instance.

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm in the VPC management console here, which you can find on the services.

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,410
Just scroll down to networking and content delivery and BPC.

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,460
Now, I haven't covered the theory behind VPC in much detail yet.

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,870
I'm going to build you up to that and we're going to go into a lot at that later on in the course.

14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,990
For now, I'm just going to give you the information you need to know so that you can deploy your EC2

15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,180
instances and then you load balancers and auto scaling groups within a BPC.

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,990
So VPC is essentially a virtual private cloud that's a kind of virtual data center in the cloud.

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,900
Now I'm connected to the North Virginia.

18
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,190
This is a regional service.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,510
You can select a region.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,740
I suggest you also use USC, East North Virginia.

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,770
That's going to make this particular exercise a lot easier.

22
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,550
So we have BBQs here under your VPI.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,210
And this is the default VPC, every single region will have a default VPC.

24
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,520
The default VPC will have a subnet in each availability zone.

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,580
So we have six, Subnet said, because US East North Virginia has six availability zones.

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,700
If I change to another one like Sydney, for example, we can see we only have free subnets.

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,000
And that's because Sydney only has free availability zones.

28
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,990
So back to US East North Virginia so we can see our six subnets each in a different availability zone.

29
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,980
If I scroll all the way across here, I can see that you auto assign public IP addresses configuration

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,460
setting.

31
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,220
It sets a yes for all of these.

32
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,880
These are public subnets.

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,640
Now, if I go to round tables will find there's one round table for that default VPC.

34
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:38,650
This round table has a route for the actual site a block, so the overall address block the IP v4 address

35
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,310
block for the VPC of locals.

36
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,090
Remember, that means that it's going to route within the VPC, and then it has the.

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,380
IP address block for all other addresses via the Internet Gateway, you can find your internet gateway

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,320
here, and this one is attached to a specific default VPC, so all of that is set up for us.

39
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,630
We don't need to do anything here.

40
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,090
You'll see how to create your own BPC later on.

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,570
Now what I want to do is create a private subnet.

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,810
So firstly, I need to know the IPv4 address block to use for this particular subnet.

43
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,160
It has to be within the overall site, the block for the VPC.

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
It stands for classless into domain routing.

45
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,380
That's another concept we'll cover later on in the course.

46
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,950
When we look at these IP addresses, we can see that they all start with 172 Dot 31 and then it's different.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,170
We have Dot Zero Dot, 16, Dot 32, Dot 64 and or 80, and then it's a dot zero slashed 20 and that's

48
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,080
the subnet mask.

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,530
Again, we'll cover those concepts in more detail later.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,410
For now, I just want you to follow my instructions.

51
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,320
Now I'm going to copy this one to my clipboard just to make life easier and click on Create Subnet.

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,290
And what I'm going to do is choose my BPC.

53
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,520
Scroll down to where it says IPv4 slider block.

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,570
Paste us in and then I'm going to delete the 80.

55
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:10,130
And I know that the next address range is 96, so I'm going to add that in now.

56
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,780
I want to give the subnet a name.

57
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,720
I want to know that it's private, so I'm going to call it private.

58
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,020
I want to know which deep BPC it's connected to.

59
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,190
So I'm going to put Dash DCF for default, and I want to know which availability zone I'm going to put

60
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,550
one.

61
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,280
I hear and then choose the availability zone.

62
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:34,520
So now from the name, I know some important information about the subnet that you can then add new

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,600
subsets and add more.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,560
But I'm just going to create this particular subnet so that subnet is created.

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,910
We've got a filtered view here.

66
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,820
And if I scroll all the way across, you can see the auto assigned public IPv4 is no.

67
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,340
So we're not going to get a public IP address, so that's the correct setting for a private subnet.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,090
Now also, we want to associate this subnet with a round table that does not have an internet gateway

69
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,230
at the moment.

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,640
It's actually going to be associated with all public subnet routing table, the one that does have an

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,370
internet gateway and that's an implicit association.

72
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,760
We haven't explicitly defined that it should be associated with that round table.

73
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,110
There's no other option, so the default route table is chosen.

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,140
So what we're going to do is create a round table.

75
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,150
We're just going to give this a name.

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,430
I'm going to call it private that Shati.

77
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,510
Select my VPC and then just create the round table.

78
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,630
Now I can go to subnet associations.

79
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,120
Choose Edit Subnet Associations.

80
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,390
And I'm going to select my private.

81
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,480
Subnet and click on Save.

82
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,140
So now when we look at the subnet associations, we should see an explicit subnet association with our

83
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,010
private subnet.

84
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,360
So that's great.

85
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,860
That's all set up correctly.

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,220
Let's now go to EC2 in easy too.

87
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,290
We're going to launch a couple of instances.

88
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm going to choose to launch an instance.

89
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,330
Then it's two am I to micro?

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,350
And this time I'm going to make sure I put it in a particular subnet.

91
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,580
Now I'm happy with this one going into one, eh?

92
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,720
But it's going to be the public one I.

93
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,470
So we should see that the auto assigned public IP on the subnet setting is enabled.

94
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,340
So that's the default.

95
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,420
So that's good.

96
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,530
Click on Next.

97
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,840
Com Afraid of tax security groups?

98
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,950
Select Web Access Security Group and we should have a role for Port 22 because I'm going to use the

99
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,300
secure shell protocol.

100
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,280
And that's from any source.

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,010
So let's launch this instance.

102
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,220
And that's on its way.

103
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,680
Now let's launch another instance, and this one is going to go into a different subnet.

104
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,550
So this one is going to go to a private subnet.

105
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,650
So again, let's just go through at a security group.

106
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,770
We're also going to need SSL.

107
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,930
And let's just launch this issue to, for instance.

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,350
Now you need to make sure you've got your keypad available.

109
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,830
Now you might want to actually give these some names here.

110
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,380
So this one is public and this one I'm going to call private, and that's just going to make things

111
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,840
a bit easier to identify here in the console.

112
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,170
So we now have a public instance in our private instance.

113
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,120
And what we're going to do is connect from all computers through our internet gateway to the public

114
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,870
IP of this instance and then from there to this instance.

115
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,740
Now there's one problem, and that is that I have my keep a file on my computer, which means I can

116
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,730
connect to this instance.

117
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,620
Remember, I need to present my keeper file in order to be able to connect to this instance.

118
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,400
But this instance does not have a copy of that key file.

119
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,670
So how can we connect from here to here?

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,230
It's not going to allow that connection unless we have that particular key file available that we can

121
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,210
present when we're connecting with SSL.

122
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,280
So there is a way that we can do that, and it's called agent forwarding, which I'm going to show you

123
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,240
how to do now.

124
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,100
To use agent forwarding.

125
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,090
We need to follow a particular process, and I've documented that in this blog article.

126
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,360
I'll add a link to this to the video, and they'll also be a link to a similar article from IWC.

127
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,000
And what we need to do is we're going to run this command SSA ad that's going to add our private key

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,830
file to S.H. so that it can then be used in subsequent commands.

129
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,880
And that means we're able to then connect to our public instance and we'll still have the key file stored

130
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,090
in memory that we can then use to connect to our private instance.

131
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,880
Now it's a bit different if you on Linux or Mac.

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,670
And there's also instructions here for how to do on Windows if you're using the Putty tool.

133
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:50,050
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to follow the instructions up here to use the switch at command

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,360
with my Mac on a command line.

135
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:00,370
Here I'm in a directory where I have the key file I need so I can run SSA Dash at Dash and then I can

136
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:07,960
put in the name of my key file, which is Cloud Labs, Dash and V p.m. So that identity has been added.

137
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,960
And now I can connect to my to instance.

138
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,900
So back in the active management console, I'm going to use my public IP address here.

139
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,370
I've copied that to my clipboard.

140
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:28,930
And what I can do now is run SSA Dash, a easy to dash user hat and then put in the IP address of my

141
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,210
instance and I should be able to connect.

142
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,670
And then we all went on our instance.

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,070
So I'm on the public instance, and now I want to be able to connect to my private instance back in

144
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,310
DC to let's go to our private instance and I'm going to copy its private IP address.

145
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:54,310
And now let's try and connect S.H. easy to dash user at, and I'm going to put in the IP and note that

146
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,250
I have not specified a private key file here.

147
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,580
I'm just going to try and connect and let's see.

148
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,570
And that works.

149
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,120
So that's how you can use a bastion host.

150
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,790
We're now connected to all instance, in the private subnet via the instance in the public subnet.

151
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,640
Now what if we want to connect to the outside world?

152
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,530
Well, let me just clear my screen.

153
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
Bring this down so you can see it.

154
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,880
Let's try and ping Google dot com.

155
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,880
And it's a fail.

156
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,570
And the reason it's a fail is we don't have any type of outbound network connectivity.

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,760
That's something for a subsequent lesson.

158
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,550
I'm going to show you how to configure outbound internet connectivity for your instances in your private

159
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,120
subnets.

160
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,850
So leave your instances running for now, and we're going to pick this up in another lesson.
