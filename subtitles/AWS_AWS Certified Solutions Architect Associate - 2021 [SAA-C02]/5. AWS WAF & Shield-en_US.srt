00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,190
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,780
In this lab we're going to cover AWS WAF and AWS Shield.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:13,630
So before we go on with AWS WAF which will take a bit more explanation we're gonna start with AWS shield.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:22,140
So let's just go to AWS Shield and what you can see here is the AWS Shield is a service which provides

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,910
protection for Distributed Denial of Service protection for your applications.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,190
Now there are two different versions of AWS Shield.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,910
We've got the standard and the advanced and as it mentions here the standard comes with AWS WAF and

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,060
your other services so you're not actually paying anything extra for this.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,710
Whereas with the advanced plan which has a lot more features you actually have to pay quite a bit of

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,030
money.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,780
So we're not going to enable advanced.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,250
This is enabled by default whereas the advanced requires you to pay your three thousand dollars a month.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,200
But as you can see if you need that level of protection there's lots of extra features.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,050
Now just to talk a bit more about the distributed denial of service.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,750
This is an article that you should definitely have a read of.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:13,950
You may be asked questions in the exam about which services you can use in an architecture to protect

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,540
against distributed denial of service.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,010
So if it's a specific service like AWS Shield that's great but it might be that it's part of your holistic

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,980
architecture and you need to understand which services help in mitigating DDOS attacks.

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,740
So for instance these services include Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, as well as IAM

21
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,390
as well.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,460
And it gives you a bit more information in this article about how that is.

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,330
Now what are the best practices.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,850
So firstly it's all about being ready to scale you want your architecture to be able to scale so that

25
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,800
if your resource usage does go up you can absorb those spikes.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,010
It's also about minimising the attack surface area and safeguarding exposed resources.

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,860
So this might be using a more distributed decoupled application architecture so that only the resources

28
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,960
that really need to have Internet exposure are actually exposed to the internet then there's know what

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,330
is normal and alert on what is not.

30
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,790
So this is really about understanding your environment monitoring it and being able to understand what

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,940
normal looks like and being able to have alerts generated when something changes from that normal.

32
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:30,690
You also need to architect for resilience so that's about making sure that whatever happens your architecture

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,380
can recover or absorb spikes or keep running in the event that something fails.

34
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,720
So there's a few best practices there and then they go on to talk about the different services and how

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,520
they actually assist with these best practices.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
So I recommend you have a look through that and have a look at the different options that they give

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,070
you here all the different patterns that they talk about as you will often have exam questions coming

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,250
up that might question this knowledge.

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm just gonna close that now.

40
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,970
Let's go back to shield and I'm just going to go back up to AWS Shield and we're going to continue

41
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,250
this discussion with AWS WAF as well.

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,230
So AWS WAF is a web application firewall.

43
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,770
Now let's just go over to the console and get started with AWS as well if you can monitor HTTP

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:29,040
and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon API Gateway APIs, Amazon CloudFront or application

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,710
load balancers. So it's protecting your API and it's protecting your applications that sit behind CloudFront

46
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,340
or an application load balancer. You can control access to your content and you can do so based on conditions

47
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,570
that you specify so you can see on the left here we have all sorts of conditions.

48
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,510
For instance if you go down to geo-match you can go in and create a condition here for location so you

49
00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:00,930
can say country is American Samoa, or country is Barbados, and you can have then a list of countries and

50
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,260
then you can use that list of countries for your filters to either deny or allow access from those countries.

51
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,960
Similarly you can do the same with IP addresses you could even do size constraints so you can come in

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,400
here and say well I want my HTTP method to equal no more than 20 bytes.

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,670
And so let's just cancel out of there.

54
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,420
You can also protect against sequel injection string and regex matching and do cross site scripting

55
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,900
as well when you've created your conditions.

56
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,500
You can then choose one of the following behaviours so even you can allow all requests except the ones

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,830
that you specify you can block all request except the ones that you specify or you can count the requests

58
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,440
that match the properties that you specify might do that so that you can monitor and understand if you

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,980
set up your rules correctly before you actually implement them in allow or block rules.

60
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,680
Let's have a look at creating a Web ACL. We can click on configure web ACL and then we get a page here

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,400
which shows us some of the concepts.

62
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,610
So you can see the conditions which we just talked about where you got things like IP match string match

63
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,860
or secret injection match.

64
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,590
You've then got your rules and you've then got your web ACLs.

65
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,470
So if you look in the middle here what it mentions is that we have rules if you add more than one condition

66
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,100
to a rule the request must match values in all conditions to be allowed or blocked.

67
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,200
So you've got to bear that in mind when you're actually creating your rules.

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,500
If we click on Next we can now choose a name.

69
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,580
I'm just going to call this my web ACL and you can then choose a region so you can say global cloud

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,640
front or you can choose a regional life resource and you can choose your local region.

71
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,370
I'm just going to leave it at look at region global.

72
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,790
Now we don't have any resources to associate at this stage so we can click on to next and we now get

73
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,190
to specify our conditions.

74
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:07,720
So let's go in and create a geo-condition and I'm going to call this include US and you can then choose

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:15,490
country and you can go in here for instance and put in United States and at that location and choose

76
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:24,280
create so we can now choose to set up a rule that allows or denies access to people from the US.

77
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,940
And as you can see you've got all these other options as well.

78
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,840
Let's click on Next.

79
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,280
And there's a couple of things on this page.

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,240
Firstly you need to create a rule.

81
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:39,450
What we're going to do is create a rule to allow and we need to change this dropdown box here to originate

82
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,970
from a geographic location in and then we can choose our include us.

83
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,560
So this is context specific.

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,020
We need to change that so that we pick up this rule and then we could choose to add an additional condition

85
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,660
or just choose create.

86
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,940
And now that we've created that rule we have an option.

87
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,730
So in this case I want to allow people from the US so I can choose allow and then I can set my default

88
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,380
action to block all requests that don't match any rules which means everybody else will be blocked.

89
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,270
And then we just go in and choose review and create and confirm we have our rule now and what we could

90
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,940
do is actually go and use this somewhere.

91
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:25,180
So for instance let's head over to CloudFront and let's create a new distribution and then choose a

92
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,620
Web distribution.

93
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,700
And I'm not going to actually fill out any of these details because we're not actually going to create

94
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,210
this cloudfront distribution.

95
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,560
But if you just scroll down to distribution settings you can now see your web ACL.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,420
So by selecting that web ACL if I created a cloudfront distribution now it would only allow users from

97
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,170
the geographic area of the United States.

98
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,150
So I'm just going to cancel out of that head back over to AWF and I want to delete this web ACL but

99
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:00,360
before I can do that I need to head into the web ACL and I need to delete the rule and click on updates

100
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,020
and then we can go in and actually delete the web ACL.
