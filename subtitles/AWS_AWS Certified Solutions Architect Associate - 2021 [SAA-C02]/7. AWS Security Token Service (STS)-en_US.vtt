00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.900
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.660
I talked a bit earlier about something called SDS, the AWB Security Token Service.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.030
This is the service that provides what are known as short lived or temporary credentials.

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.770
So let's have a look at how SDS works because it's important to understand this.

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.300
So we have an easy two instance.

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.140
And in this case, this easy to instance is running an application, and the application needs to write

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.740
some files or read some files from an S3 bucket.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.060
So how does the application running on easy to get authorized to actually access S3?

9
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.450
What we can do is create something called an instance profile and attach an I am roll to the instance

10
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.910
profile.

11
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.570
We'll see how to actually do this later on in the course.

12
00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.250
The easy to instance will then attempt to assume the role by using the SDS Assume Role API call.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.520
Now there's a couple of different types of policy that apply to the IAM role.

14
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.400
You've got to trust policy and a permissions policy.

15
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.710
We talked about permissions policies before.

16
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.300
These define the permissions that are allowed or denied to this specific entity, but a trust policy

17
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.240
actually controls who can assume the role.

18
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.910
So who is allowed to assume this role and become that role and acts as if they are the role?

19
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.920
And the policy document might look something like this in this particular example.

20
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.220
This policy is allowing the Service EC2 or Amazon Overstock.com to assume roles using the SDS Assume

21
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.450
Role API action.

22
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.940
So the trust policy is going to allow the easy to instance to assume the role.

23
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.210
So the SDS service gets involved and it will return temporary security credentials too easy to and easy

24
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.470
to can then access the S3 bucket with those temporary credentials.

25
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.870
The temporary credentials include an access key and a secret access key.

26
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.920
They have an expiration and something called a session token as well.

27
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.370
So these are provided to allow short term access to remember they expire after a short period of time,

28
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.400
and it will be an automatic process to renew the credentials before they expire.

29
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.710
And that happens using SDS again.

30
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.030
Temporary credentials are used in several situations that includes Identity Federation delegation,

31
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.700
cross account access and I am roles.

32
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.230
That's it for this lesson.

33
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.770
SDS is used and a lot of the operations that we're going to be looking into in more detail in this call.

34
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.030
So it's important to understand how it works, and hopefully you've now got a good understanding.
