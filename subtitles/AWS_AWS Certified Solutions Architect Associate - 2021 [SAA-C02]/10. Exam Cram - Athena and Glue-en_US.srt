1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,520
Continuing our crime with Amazon Rafina, so remember, Rafina is an interactive query service that

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,480
makes it easy to analyze data Innisfree using siecle.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,450
So the key to remember here is the data is sitting on Amazon is free and you use standard structured

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,490
query language queries to query that data.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,590
It's Cervalis and there's no infrastructure to manage and you pay for what you use.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:33,870
And it uses the managed data catalog provided by Glew to store information and schemas about the databases

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,630
and tables that you create for data stored Innisfree.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,200
It uses something called Pressplay will full standard SQL support and supports a variety of different

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,650
formats for the data.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,210
Now it's optimized for fast performance of free as well.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,430
With a FEIGNER, there's no need for complex extract, transform and load jobs to prepare data for analysis.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,490
So it's easy for anyone with SQL skills to just quickly go and query data on as free.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,350
Moving on to Glew, this is the fully managed pay as you go escort service, so this does the extract

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,660
transform and load, which automates the time-Consuming steps of data preparation.

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,060
So preparing data ready for analytics.

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:22,090
It automatically discovers and profiles data by the data catalog and generates the code to transform

17
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:28,900
source data into target schemas, Glu runs the eco jobs on fully managed scale Apache Spark environment

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,200
to load your data into its destination.

19
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:38,830
So you simply point glue to your data stored on us and Glu discovers data and stores.

20
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,570
The associated metadata in the glue data catalog once catalogued, the data is then immediately searchable

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,170
variable and available for ECL.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,930
Now remember, this works with not just data links on history, but also data warehouses such as redshift

23
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,700
and data stores such as A.D.s or databases running on Amazon Etsy to.
