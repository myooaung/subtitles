Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.110
In the next couple of labs we're going to be covering Amazon CloudFront.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.160
This is part of the networking content delivery category but it does make some sense to have it in this

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.210
part of the course as it's very often used with Amazon S3 as well as with EC2.

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.810
So what is CloudFront.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.480
Well it's a content delivery network and its main purpose is to get your data closer to your users.

7
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.840
So let's say you have a global company and your user base is distributed.

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.440
These users could be anywhere around the world and your users need to access data and let's say you're

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:47.500
distributing some images or some web pages and you want to make sure that the user experience is really

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.250
good.

11
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.350
So if your region where you're actually storing this data is in let's say the US and your users are

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.180
in other parts of the world right out in Asia for instance there's gonna be a long distance and a lot

13
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.430
of latency trying to get that content to the users.

14
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.450
So you've got a couple of options.

15
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.780
One is that you could actually have your S3 data for instance copied to another location in the world

16
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.660
that's closer to your users for EC2 Web sites.

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.430
You could have EC2 instance instances running around the world but you might then need to find out

18
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.990
a way of synchronizing that data and it might become complex.

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.320
So what a content delivery network does is make that very easy for you.

20
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.120
You can now have all your data in one location so you've got all your data sitting in a necessary bucket

21
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:42.700
in the US or running on an Amazon EC2 Web site in the US and you can have the content that's being

22
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:52.310
delivered from these buckets or Web sites copied closer to your user and cached in one of these locations.

23
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.980
I'll talk more about the differences between the regional edge caches and edge locations shortly but

24
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.840
these are both places where your data can be cached.

25
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.930
Now let's have a quick look at another diagram and this is an image that comes straight from the AWS

26
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.820
Web site and this shows you where the points of presence are for CloudFront.

27
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.890
So in other words where these edge locations and regional edge car caches are actually located and you

28
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:28.340
can see those 176 edge locations 11 regional edge caches and that incorporates 69 cities in 30 countries.

29
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.020
So there's a lot of places around the world where your data can be cached.

30
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.290
So what's the difference between an edge location and a regional edge cache.

31
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.830
Well basically what this means is that the edge location has a cache and a regional edge location has

32
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.680
a cache.

33
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.340
Now there are a lot more edge locations than there are regional edge caches.

34
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.350
But the regional edge caches have a bigger cache.

35
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.550
So what that means is if your data is being frequently accessed then it's going to get cached at edge

36
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.800
locations and is going to be constantly pulling that down so the time to live is going to keep getting

37
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.700
refreshed as the object is being used.

38
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.140
However if users don't access the objects then the TTL will expire and the object will be removed from

39
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.430
the location.

40
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.620
Now you don't necessarily want it to be all the way back over here where your EC2 instance or bucket

41
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.000
is.

42
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.280
So instead you've got the regional edge caches and because they have a bigger cache you can store some

43
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.620
of that data here and that might be infrequently accessed but you still want it to be a bit closer to

44
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.910
your users.

45
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.150
So if we just go back to this diagram you can see again there's 11 regional edge caches and they're the

46
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.760
circles with the orange band around them.

47
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.910
And so there's probably a lot fewer of those than the actual edge locations but they are distributed

48
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.670
to some of the most populous parts of the world.

49
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.820
So that does mean that you've got a bit more space to put your data on for about less frequently access

50
00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.770
data.

51
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.160
The other key concepts to understand before we get into the labs are distributions and origins.

52
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.680
So an origin is simply where your data comes from.

53
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.400
So that could be an S3 bucket that could be an 3 bucket configured as a static web site or

54
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.280
that could be a EC2 instance or an EC2 instance sat behind an application load balancer. So it

55
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.140
is recommended to use EC2 instances behind ALB because obviously you want to ensure availability

56
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.360
of the actual origin. There are also media package and media store origins but I don't believe that they're

57
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.410
is scope for the exam at this stage so we're not going to cover those right now.

58
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.140
The other component of CloudFront is a distribution. Distributions are how you configure CloudFront

59
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.590
you configure your distributions to connect to your origins and you have two different types of distribution.

60
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.980
One is a Web distribution and the other is an RTMP distribution.

61
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:06.130
So for web that's static and dynamic content using HTTP or HTTPS you can add update or delete objects

62
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.600
and use web forms.

63
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.060
So it's not just about caching and downloading data using CloudFront you can upload data as well.

64
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.060
You can also do real time live streaming.

65
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.410
You've then got the RTMP which uses Adobe Flash media RTMP protocol and that can see some extra things

66
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.530
like you can play a media file before it's actually downloaded.

67
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.650
In that case it actually has to use an S3 origin so you can't use an EC2 origin with RTMP. We'll

68
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.210
get stuck into the labs now and you'll learn a lot more about origins and distributions as we go through

69
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.800
them.

70
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.020
So in the next lab what we're going to do is we're going to create a static Web site on S3 and

71
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.600
publish that through CloudFront.
