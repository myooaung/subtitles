1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,840
So moving on to network ACLs they function at the subnet level not at the instance level. With NACLs

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,440
you can have both permit and deny rules.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,490
They contain a numbered list of rules that get evaluated in order from the lowest number until the explicit

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,860
deny which is at the end of the ruleset.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,460
Network ACLs also have separate inbound and outbound rules and each rule can allow or deny traffic.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,920
They're stateless so in the example I gave before.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:38,380
If you send traffic on port 80 to a web server and the response traffic is coming back on a different

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,120
port number that port number has to be allowed.

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,860
So you have to allow the whole higher address range block or you have to just have a sort of general outbound

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,230
rule that allows any traffic. NACLs apply to traffic that's both ingress and egress so traffic going

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,050
in or out of the subnet but not traffic that's within the subnet so going from one instance to another

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,650
instance in the same subnet for that you need a security group they automatically come with a default

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,470
network ACL or the BPC automatically comes with a default network ACL and that allows all inbound and

14
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,040
outbound traffic custom NACLs deny all traffic by default.

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,070
If you create a custom NACLs associate with a subnet it's going to block everything until we create

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,800
rules all subnets must be associated with one network ACL.

17
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,580
So by default they'll just be associated with the default NACL which will allow all traffic.

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,400
You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets however a subnet can only be associated with one

19
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,750
network ACL at a time. Network ACLs don't filter traffic between instances in the same subnet.

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,220
So this is what network ACLs look like.

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,460
This is an example of the default network ACL.

22
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:54,180
Allows all protocols all ports from any source inbound.

23
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,210
It allows all protocols ports and sources outbound and then you have a custom network ACL.

24
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,990
So this is what will happen if you create one by default and associate it with a subnet is going to

25
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:12,230
deny absolutely everything so network ACLs are the preferred option for blocking specific IPs

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,020
or ranges.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,110
So you might see an exam question that says that a malicious IP address has been identified.

28
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,720
You need to very quickly block that specific IP or that specific range of IPs and you could do

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,360
that from a network ACL but not a security group so you can't do a security groups and network ACL is

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,690
the first line of defense because traffic going into the subnet hits the network ACL first and then

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,370
the security group gets hit because that's associated with the instance which is already within the

32
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,310
subnet.

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,060
Changes take effect immediately.

34
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,080
So just to summarize those differences you really need to know this for the exam so security groups operate

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,000
the instance level network ACL is at the subnet level. Security groups have allow rules only, network

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,230
ACLs both allow and deny the security group is stateful the network ACL is stateless. Security groups

37
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:10,630
evaluate all rules whereas network ACLs process rules in order until they hit an allow or deny.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,020
Security group applies to an instance only if it's associated with a group whereas a network ACL applies

39
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,160
to everything in the subnets it's associated with.

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,710
So moving on to connectivity there's several methods you can connect to a VPC you got the managed VPN

41
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,570
you got direct connect direct connect plus a VPN, VPN cloud Hub, software VPN, transit and

42
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,160
VPC peering as well as private link and VPC endpoints.

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,440
So lets look at these in a bit more detail.

44
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,540
We've got the managed VPN.

45
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,350
This is an IP set VPN connection over the Internet as quick and easy to setup support static routes

46
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,120
or BGP peering and you know this is really dependent on an internet connection.

47
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,300
So you've got the latency issues of the Internet to worry about and you create this by creating a virtual private

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,090
gateway on AWS and the customer gateway

49
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,570
on the on-premises side, we then have direct connect.

50
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,460
So this is network connection over private lines.

51
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:20,490
Think about connecting one cloud to another cloud or a data center to AWS.

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,670
Whenever you see questions that mention creating a hybrid cloud network connection it's probably going

53
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,840
to be direct connect because it's a private link.

54
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,700
It requires a large network link and you'd use it when you have lots of resources and services being

55
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,790
provided on AWS and you need that high bandwidth low-latency connection.

56
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,010
Now you do have to set this up.

57
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,960
You might have to have a relationship with a networking or telecom provider, you might have to put your

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,190
own rack into a data center somewhere so that you can cross connect in or use a third party provider.

59
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,680
And this does take a bit of time to set up and that's something to remember for the exam I've definitely

60
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,780
seen questions that test your knowledge of the fact that direct connect does take time to set up.

61
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,750
So always remember if there's a very quick timeline for deployment like you need to get something set

62
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,310
up within two weeks or a month.

63
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,050
Direct connects.

64
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,280
Probably not going to be provisioned in that time frame it could be two or three months.

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,160
So watch out for that one.

66
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,400
We then have direct connect plus VPN.

67
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,620
This is another exam question that comes up.

68
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,460
So make sure you understand this.

69
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,440
You can't encrypt a direct connect connection natively so there's no sort of button that you press and

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,410
you can enable encryption for direct connect but you can create a VPN connection over direct connect

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,330
and that will enable IP security.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,590
So if you see an exam question that says that you need to enable encryption on a direct connect connection

73
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:56,020
it might be a VPN so you need a virtual private gateway and a customer Gateway. VPN cloud

74
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,490
hub.

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,470
So this is essentially creating a hub and spoke topology with VPN connections so again it's using the

76
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,550
Internet.

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,460
We have a software VPN.

78
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:13,010
This is really your providing your own software and just setting up a VPN connection into VPC transit

79
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,820
VPC is a way that you can connect geographically dispersed pieces in order to create a global network

80
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,550
transit center as they call it.

81
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,990
We then have VPC peering so this is how you can connect the VPCs to each other using private IP addresses.

82
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:38,240
So AWS private link is enabling network connectivity between VPC and AWS services using interface endpoints.

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,740
And this is used to keep private subnets private by using the AWS backbone to reach other a AWS marketplace

84
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,380
services rather than the public Internet so where you're publishing services in a kind of service provider

85
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,280
model to other accounts or other VPCs.

86
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,170
We then have the VPC endpoints you do need to know the difference between these.

87
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,000
You need to know which services use which type of endpoint.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,450
So the interface endpoint is where you have an ENI with a private IP and the gateway endpoint is where

89
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,420
you have a target for a specific route.

90
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,300
So you update your route table.

91
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,710
Now the key thing to remember here is the gateway endpoint is for Amazon S3 and dynamoDB definitely

92
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,330
need to know this for the exam.

93
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,220
You will definitely see questions about VPC endpoints.

94
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,670
You need to know that the gateway endpoint requires you to update the table and its use with these two

95
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,870
services.

96
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,110
Anything else is and there's quite a long list of services.

97
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,380
This is just a few will be an elastic network interface with a private IP address in the subnet.

98
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:48,020
Now something new that might come up on the exam is that you can allow offer AWS accounts to create

99
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:58,770
their application resources into a shared centrally managed VPC. VPC sharing enables subnets to be shared

100
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,280
with other accounts within the same AWS organization and we'll be covering AWS organizations later

101
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,180
in the course.

102
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,940
This means that you can separate duties centrally controlled VPC structure routing and IP address allocation

103
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:20,080
application owners still continue to own the resources accounts and security groups and the participants

104
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,860
can reference security group by these of each other.

105
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,880
Now this might lead to higher density and subnets efficient use of VPN and AWS direct connect.

106
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,570
You can also avoid some of the hard limits of the number of IPs and direct connect connections by simplifying

107
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,490
your network architecture.

108
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,090
Cost can also be optimized through reuse of components such as NAT gateways, VPC interface endpoints

109
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,970
and intra availability zone traffic.

110
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,240
So not getting those network costs now I would just say that you just need to understand VPC sharing

111
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,300
at a high level.

112
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,970
It may come up in exam scenario.

113
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,710
We then have VPC flow logs.

114
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,190
So remember this is how you can capture information about the traffic that's going to and from network

115
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:12,600
interfaces and it's stored using cloudwatch logs and you can create them at the VPC level.

116
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,490
The subnet level or the network interface level

117
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,780
and just finally a little bit of guidance on high availability.

118
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:28,320
Some of the best practices are that you should create subnets in all available places to create multi

119
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:35,490
AZ presence for your VPC create at least two VPN tunnels into your virtual private gateway for using

120
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,230
a VPN Direct Connect is not hijacked by default.

121
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,090
So you do need to establish a second connection that could be direct connect ideally or it could be

122
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,170
using a VPN as a backup for multi AZ redundancy of NAT gateways, create gateways in each availability

123
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,520
zone with routes for private subnets to use the local gateway.

124
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,680
So that's it for this exam cram guys.

125
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,580
Hope you got lots of value.
