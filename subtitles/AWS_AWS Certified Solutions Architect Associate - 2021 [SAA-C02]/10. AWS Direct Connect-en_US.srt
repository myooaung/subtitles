00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,560
So we're now going to talk about AWB Direct Connect Direct Connect enables you to connect your corporate

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,960
data datacenter into the AWB cloud using private connections.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:23,900
So it does that by using connectivity between your customer router and the aid of U.S. router via a

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,640
partner router or a router which you have in a specific location.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,120
So this is not a W.S. cloud location.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,030
This is a direct connect location and what that means is it's a data center somewhere in a city near

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,360
you.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,590
There'll be one or more of these and they'll have a cage in that data center where a W.S. host a bunch

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,390
of routers and switches.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:54,060
Now what you need to do is cross connect your routers and switches into the W.S. cage.

11
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:02,870
So you even need to have your own rack in that data center or you can leverage a partner who provides

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,750
that to you as a service.

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:12,530
So you have private connections then go all the way into into NWS now from the W.S. cage you connect

14
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:19,700
to public services using what's called a public therefore public virtual interface or private services

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,890
such as VPN gateways using a private set of public faith goes to public IP spaces so as free as addressable

16
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,550
by public IP as is easy to.

17
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:38,000
Whereas the private def goes into your data center your load balancers your easy two instances addressing

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,280
them with private IP addresses and you can have multiple private vest connects into different pieces

19
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,850
and you can have multiple public events and they can connect to NWS locations around the world.

20
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,480
So NWS provide two options for bandwidth.

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,570
One is one gigabit per second than the other is 10 gigabits per second.

22
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,140
If you want lower bandwidth right the way down to 50 megabits per second you can use a partner service

23
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:12,290
where they provide a subdivision of the bandwidth but otherwise you use one gigabit or 10 gigabit.

24
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,860
Now the main use case for direct connects is to have this dedicated low latency high bandwidth connection

25
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,780
into the cloud.

26
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:29,770
So use direct connect whenever you expect to require low latency or you just need consistency and dedicated

27
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,740
bandwidth.

28
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,690
You can't rely on the Internet for licensee.

29
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,210
So if an application demands low latency and you see some exam questions and one option is direct connect

30
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:46,210
and another is VPN then in the case where you need to ensure low latency you definitely go for direct

31
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:53,160
connect it is much more costly than a VPN and it takes some time as well it can take months to provision.

32
00:02:53,170 --> 00:03:00,700
So you actually have to put in an order and IWM to give you some information about which cables to connect

33
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,680
to which ports within the data center and then it can take some time for the whole provisioning process

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,000
to take place so that can be weeks it can be months.

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,280
Let's just go back to the console and what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to show you where direct connect

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,300
is configured.

37
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:25,590
So we're just going to search for direct connect and so within here you can then create your order so

38
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:34,110
you'd go to create a connection and I could just put in my connection and I can choose one of these

39
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,370
locations so you just find the location that's news to you.

40
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,880
You know that could be you know Equinix Manchester for instance you choose your speed and then you create

41
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,410
connection and then you get a bunch of information from a W as on what you need to then connect.

42
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,650
They give you a detailed sheet which provides port to port mappings and then you can go and start provisioning

43
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:58,840
that.

44
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,510
So I can't really show you this within this land.

45
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,680
We are going to cover some more about Direct Connect gateways shortly so direct connect gateways give

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,570
you some more capabilities about creating a sort of hub and spoke architecture so key thing to remember.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,750
Use direct connect when you need low latency dedicated connections and you can have private and public

48
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,700
bits connecting to either the private IP spaces or the public IP spaces.
