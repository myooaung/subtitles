1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,640
We're almost ready to get stuck into the labs guys but we need to set up a few things ahead of time

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,980
open up a browser and what we're going to do is install NPM.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,660
So if you just type npm install if you don't have this installed already you can follow this link.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,170
And so this is what they call the neatly packaged modules.

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,270
And this is for node.js.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,760
Yes you can click on the download link and it should take you to the right download for your operating

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,710
system.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:38,370
In my case it's MacOS and I just chose the current version and it's a very simple install.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,650
The next thing we need to do is create a couple of IAM roles.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,200
So we're in IAM.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,130
We're going to click on Create role.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:58,430
We're going to choose Lambda and then under permissions we need to search for AWS Lambda executes

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,190
and it's this one here and just select that option go to review and then you want to call this Lambda

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,550
d-s3-role and you can click right roll we can then do the same thing again.

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:27,720
We're going to choose lambda again and this time we're going to search for AWS Lambda

16
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,410
DynamoDB.

17
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:32,820
And there we go.

18
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,850
We got the DynamoDB execution role.

19
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,630
So I'm going to check that box.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:50,560
Go to review and this one we're going to call lambda-dynamodb-role and click on Create role.

21
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,530
The only other thing we need to do is just create a couple of directories.

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,170
So let's go to a command line and what I've done is I've changed to a directory where I'm going to store

23
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:10,550
my documents and I just want to do make directory lambdaS3 and make directory lambda-dynamodb

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,210
and that's it and we're just gonna use these tools and these directories for some code in the subsequent

25
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,630
labs.
