1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,640
Before we go any deeper into Amazon S3

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,200
I wanted to just talk a little more about access methods.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,300
So as we've already learned Amazon S3 is a public service and you access it using a public endpoint.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,240
So the U.R.L. is a publicly resolvable you URL.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,750
And what that actually means is if you're in a VPC which is obviously a private environment and you

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,830
want to connect to S3 you have to go out to the Internet.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,960
So there would be a Internet gateway and you'd need to go through that Internet gateway in order to

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,700
access the public service.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,800
And that's the same for any public services.

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,710
So the way around that if you don't want to go over the public Internet and there could be several reasons

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,540
for that you might want to use an endpoint.

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,140
And we talked about these in the VPC section of the course and specifically we're talking about S3

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,200
Gateway endpoints and what this means is that your instances in your private instances then don't need

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,650
to have any kind of internet connectivity enabled for them.

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:11,150
They can connect directly to the Gateway endpoint which allows them access to S3 without having

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,770
to use the Internet.

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,600
So what I've done here is I've just created a lab where we're going to come in through SSH each into

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,550
a public EC2 instance.

19
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,010
From there we're going to jump across to a private instance which doesn't have any internet connectivity

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,900
and we're going to access as free through a gateway endpoint.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,110
And the other piece to this is that what you'll see is when we create a gateway endpoint route table

22
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,830
entry is created and it looks like this has got nine days and then it has some some more information

23
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,960
about IP ranges

24
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,110
and then a target which is the actual Gateway endpoint itself.

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,280
So let's head over to the console.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,550
And the first thing I'm going to do is we're just going to head over to see to and I've got 2 instances

27
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,540
one is in a public subnet and we're going to SSH into this one.

28
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:16,490
In fact we're going to SSH with the -A so that I can send my key across and be able to authenticate

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,480
across to the private instance.

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,310
So we come back now and we take the IP address of the private instance

31
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,150
so we're now in the private instance.

32
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,330
And I can do a I can show you that I don't have Internet connectivity I can ping Google and I do have

33
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,750
a security group which would allow ICMP and that's not working.

34
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:55,410
And then I could do an AWS S3 at last so I'm going to specify the region just to be consistent

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,470
because you do need this with the gateway endpoint

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,790
so I've looked to run that command as you can see it's kind of timed out.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,300
So it doesn't actually have a path to S3 at this stage.

38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:23,390
So we can just kill that off and let's go back to the console and get this working so we had to VPC

39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,440
and we're going to go down to end points and create an endpoint.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,960
We can then go down to here where you see the S3 service and as a gateway type of interface types

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,760
those a few which are gateway types and this is where a gateway is different to an interface in that

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,910
it's the one where you do need to update the route table though it does let you do that for you so we

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,170
select the VPC and we have to choose the round table.

44
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,110
I know this route table which is not the main route table is the one that's associated with my private

45
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,040
subnets.

46
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:08,590
So that's the one I want and I'm going to click on Create.

47
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:16,100
So now we can head over it and round tables and I'm going to select my private routes table and if I

48
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,140
go into routes there's nothing there but there will be seen and sometimes it takes a couple of minutes.

49
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:29,610
So I'm just going to pause the video until that comes up so I took a few minutes but we now have this

50
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,720
entry at the bottom of the screen here in our route table which is pointing to our endpoint.

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,550
So what we can do now is we head back over to the console and we're just gonna rerun that command which

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,460
should list the buckets in the AWS S3 account

53
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:58,690
so that's great that's proved that we can access S3 from an instance that's in a private subnet which

54
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,360
doesn't have any access to the Internet so we know that rather than going to the public namespace for

55
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:11,470
S3 it's actually being routed internally on the private secure backbone into the S3 service.
