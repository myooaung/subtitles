00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,090
Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'm going to teach you about the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud or VPC.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,660
Now obviously, you've already been using VPC quite a bit in this course, and that's where you've launched

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,310
EC2 instances and you choose a VPC to put them into.

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,250
And then within the VPC, you choose a subnet.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,610
Well, sometimes we just allow it to auto assign both HPC, incorporate several different concepts,

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,840
and what we're going to do in this section is go into them in much more detail.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,570
So first, we'll start off with the core knowledge around VPC itself.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,100
So within a region we have of Epix's and they are always within a region they can't span across regions.

9
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:58,130
A VPC is essentially a logically isolated portion of the IWC cloud that you can then use to deploy your

10
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,570
resources inside it.

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,560
And that's different to the public space outside of the VPC, where services like Amazon has free set.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,770
This is a private space and you have full control over how you configure your VPC.

13
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,500
Now, as you know, within a region, we have availability zones and you could use those within your

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,830
VPC by creating subnets and assigning those subnets to an availability zone.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,450
A subnet is always assigned to one availability zone.

16
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:37,040
It can't span across multiple axes, but you can of course, have multiple subnets in the same A-Z.

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,770
We then deploy our resources, such as Easy two instances, into our subnets.

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,370
Now there's a thing called the VPC router.

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:54,240
You don't really see the VPC browser, but it exists and we interact with it by configuring roundtables.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,730
Now, the VPC router takes care of all routing for connections that are going outside of a subnet.

21
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,880
If you send data out of a subnet, it's got to go somewhere else, maybe to another subnet or maybe

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,010
out to the internet or some other network.

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,550
So the router takes care of making sure the data connection is sent to the right place.

24
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,640
Now, as I said, you don't see the VPC router.

25
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,910
All you do is see the root tables and they are configuring the VPC routes are for you.

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,810
So we need to specify the destinations and the targets for certain networks, and that's how it then

27
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,300
knows where to send those connection items.

28
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,860
If we want to access the internet, we also need an internet gateway.

29
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,080
The internet gateway is attached to your VPC.

30
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,550
You only ever have one per VPC.

31
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,430
The Internet Gateway is used for sending data out to the internet.

32
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,600
That's egress, traffic and in from the internet.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,010
That's ingress traffic.

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,870
And we configure a roundtable with a route to the Internet Gateway I.D. that tells it to send all traffic

35
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,140
that doesn't fit one of the networks in the round table before it to the internet gateway.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,460
Now you can create multiple VPNs within a region.

37
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,080
You have a limit of five by default, but you can request an increase on that amount.

38
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,990
Each VPC has a side, a block.

39
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,860
That's the overall block of addresses from which you then create the addresses you assign to your subnet.

40
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,470
So it's kind of like a master block of addresses.

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,990
Each VPC has a different one of these.

42
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,490
So in this case, we got two pieces and they have different side blocks.

43
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,210
As you learned in the last lesson, cider stands for classless into domain routing from the overall

44
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,870
side to block.

45
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:52,910
We can then create the network IDs for our subnet, and they fit within that overall cinder block.

46
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,960
But they have a different subnet mask so that essentially a subset of the overall available addresses.

47
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,780
And this is why it's really important to make sure we specify our side of blocks correctly.

48
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,620
So we have enough networks and enough hosts per network will cover that.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,280
And another lesson so here we have two pieces each with different side blocks and then each with different

50
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,620
subnets that come from those side of blocks.

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,810
Now we're going to cover a lot of these components within this section, but I just want to cover them

52
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,830
at a high level now.

53
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,620
So you know what a VPC is and what subnet saw.

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,200
You know what an internet gateway is as well.

55
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,850
Now, an egress only internet gateway is when you're using the IPV six protocol, and it allows traffic

56
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:45,560
outbound only, whereas an internet gateway is the IP version four, and it allows both egress and ingress

57
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,040
traffic.

58
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,010
As you know the router, the VPC browser takes care of routing connections to the right places.

59
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:59,450
Now, a pairing connection is something where you can connect multiple VPNs and have private routing

60
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,220
between that would cover that in detail later on in the section VPC endpoint.

61
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,900
Allow you to connect using private IP addresses to public services on IWC, again, we'll cover that

62
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,680
in detail later on now, not instances and gateways.

63
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,420
We covered these earlier in the course.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:24,370
These are both ways that you can enable internet connectivity outbound only for your instances in private

65
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:24,970
subnets.

66
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:31,870
The next two components the Virtual Private Gateway and the Customer Gateway are both related to creating

67
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,710
virtual private network VPN connections to our company offices or our company data centers.

68
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,240
So that's a virtually private network, an encrypted tunnel over the internet.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,390
We then have direct connect that avoids the internet by using private connections right the way through

70
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,070
to your data center or office.

71
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,400
And security groups and network cycles are two different types of firewall.

72
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,000
We'll cover them in a bit more detail in this section.

73
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,580
We've used security groups quite a lot so far.

74
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,150
They are what we call a instance level firewall because they operate at the level of the network interface

75
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,730
attached to all two instances.

76
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,100
Then we have the network ICL.

77
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,230
That's a subnet level firewall, so it only sees traffic going in and out of the subnet.

78
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:24,190
So just to summarize that core knowledge, a VPN is a virtual network dedicated to your IWC accounts.

79
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,420
It's similar to having your own data centers inside IWC because you're able to have full control over

80
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:37,450
what you do with defining your side of blocks, creating your own subnet, setting up your security,

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,860
your routing, and so on.

82
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,490
You have lots and lots of control.

83
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,520
It's logically isolated from other virtual networks in the US cloud.

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,030
And as I mentioned before, you get full control over lots of the configuration items in your VPC.

85
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,440
And if VPC is a place where you then launch your resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, when you

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,500
create a VPN, you must specify your side a block.

87
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,640
So that's the overall block of addresses.

88
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,590
Now we'll see how to select the best cyber block for our use case.

89
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:17,140
And another lesson a VPC spans all Azeez within a region that essentially means if there's three or

90
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,830
six or whatever number of aces in a region, you can create subnets within your VPC on all of those

91
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,490
aces.

92
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,450
But remember, each subnet is always within one A-Z.

93
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,710
It can't span disease, but you create multiple subnets if you want to.

94
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:39,160
In an availability zone, you get full control over access to your resources inside a VPC as well.

95
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,760
And by default, you can create five per region, but you can extend that if you submit a request.

96
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:53,320
A default VPC is created in each region with a subnet in each availability zone, and that's always

97
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,310
a public subnet.

98
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,030
So whichever region we change to, you'll find, is already a default VPC, and it already has a number

99
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,200
of public subnet in it.

100
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,950
Now that's it for this lesson, and the next lesson will have a look at how we can work out a suitable

101
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,570
site, a block for our use case.
