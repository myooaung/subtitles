IWC Transit Gateway is a really awesome service.

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.210
It's described by IWC as being a cloud rouser, and it connects VPI, sees season on premises, locations

3
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.950
together using a central hub.

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.260
So let's have a look at what this means.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.850
Now again, what I want to do is show you a fully meshed architecture without IWC transit gateway to

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.460
help you understand the problem we're trying to solve.

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.030
Because when we have lots of pieces and on premises locations, it can get really complex.

8
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.580
The peering connections that we set up if we use VPC pairing can become extremely complex.

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.560
So let's say we have VPC, A, B, C and D again, and we've established our VPC pairing links.

10
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.550
And as you know, there's going to be quite a few pairing links.

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.660
We've got six pairing links that we've got to set up just four for VPC.

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.290
And as you increase the number of EPCs, it gets very complex.

13
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.410
So here we have six VPC parent connections.

14
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
We then have a corporate office connected via our customer gateway.

15
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.240
So how do we connect the corporate office using a site to site VPN to each of these VIP seats?

16
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.870
Well, we need a virtual gateway in HPC.

17
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.560
Then we need to establish a connection to the customer gateway from each VPC, and each of those is

18
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.170
its own encrypted IPsec VPN.

19
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.450
So there's full site to site VPN connections, and that's not even including redundancy.

20
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.320
If you wanted to add redundancy, you'd need another customer gateway and double the amount of S2S VPN

21
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.040
connections.

22
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.320
So it starts getting super complex.

23
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.230
Let's now look at the same architecture, but with transit gateway, in this case, the same for BBQs

24
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.280
and a corporate office.

25
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.730
We stick transit gateway in the middle and it becomes the network transit hub that interconnects the

26
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.190
buses and on premises networks.

27
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.590
So now we have connections into each of these vehicles.

28
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:15.510
The bikes become attached to the transit gateway and you specify one subnet from each availability zone.

29
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.740
And that enables routing within that availability zone for any other subnets.

30
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.980
We then have the customer data center.

31
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.380
We've got the corporate office here, we have a customer gateway and the customer gateway connection.

32
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.520
And that's it.

33
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.270
This is now a service which is allowing us to connect through this cloud route to the central hub to

34
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.590
any of these vehicles to use can be attached to VPNs, direct connect gateways, third party appliances

35
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.670
and also transit gateways in other regions and also offer accounts.

36
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.940
So let's have a look at how it works with the Gateway.

37
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.120
So in this case, rather than using a site to site VPN, our corporate office has a customer router

38
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.070
and we're connecting into a DNS location and we're using a DEX gateway.

39
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.180
So now the DEX Gateway has a connection to transit gateway, and that's called an association.

40
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.380
We then have the physical connection back to the corporate office from Direct Connect, and we create

41
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.790
something called a transit vet.

42
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.700
So this is another type of virtual interface specifically used for direct connect gateways.

43
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.150
When they're associated to a transit gateway, so transit is only used when you're attaching a DCS gateway

44
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.710
to a transit gateway.

45
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.880
Now this architecture then supports for transitive routing between on premises, the transit gateway

46
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.210
and all of those connected vehicles.

47
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.370
As you can imagine, when your company gets bigger and starts using more vehicles in more regions and

48
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.830
you want to have that transit of pairing between them.

49
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.150
It can get so complex that transit gateway will really solve a lot of challenges.

50
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.750
So that's it for this lesson.

51
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.330
I'll see you in the next lesson.
