00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,210
Hi guys and welcome to the first practical lap of the course.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm going to guide you through creating your AWS free tier account.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,980
Now this is a practical course.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,890
So I'm actually going to guide you through over 20 hours of practical exercises through hands on labs.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,150
That means an AWS Free Tier account really is essential if you want to follow along with the exercises

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,740
and really gain that hands on experience which I think is the best way to learn.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,800
And it's also the best way to get the knowledge so that you can really understand how to work out the

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,070
answer to a question.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,130
So I do highly recommend that you create an AWS free tier account now for this.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,940
You will need a credit card and you'll also need a mobile phone number.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,650
Some people will be worried about bills.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,860
Now with the AWS free tier account I'm going to show you through it in a second.

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,620
You actually get quite a lot for free.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,260
So for most of the exercises throughout this course you're actually going to be able to stick within

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,930
the free tier and not pay anything.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,380
However you can accidentally leave something running or provision a service which isn't within the free

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,920
tier or just exceed the limits in some way.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,980
So it is really important that you follow my advice through the course that when I tell you to clean

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,310
up resources you go and clean them up.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,310
I'll give you warnings where things aren't within the free tier and also within the section we're

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,280
actually going to set up a billing alarm which will notify you if you're going to exceed a certain amount

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,290
on your bill.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,420
Let's get started and actually create our free tier account.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm on the AWS Web site here and you can easily find this page by just going to Google or typing this

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,070
into your search bar.

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,840
Just type in AWS is free tier and you're going to see the very first link here.

27
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,190
So I've already opened that page and we can just go to create a free tier account.

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Now what I want to do first is just scroll down and have a look at some information here.

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:08,310
So it tells us that there are more than 60 products available within the free to air and you can see

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,320
that there's the always free and these are free to offers that don't expire after the first 12 months.

31
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,010
So in other words you get a certain amount of resource available for free forever as long as you have

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,130
your account.

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,790
You've then got the 12 months free.

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,190
And this just means that for 12 months you'll get a certain allocation of resource that you can consume

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,600
without having to pay.

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,500
And then there are the trials which are short term free trial offers which are available for certain

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,150
services and there's probably fewer of those.

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,230
What we're going to concentrate on mostly in this course are services that are either always free or

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,820
12 months free.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,510
So just have a look at the examples of what you can do under compute here you get Amazon easy to for

41
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,580
750 hours a month.

42
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,490
Now what you have to make sure is that you choose the T2 micro instance which is a certain size of instance.

43
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,070
And that means you can run this for 24 hours every day of the month you've then got storage free tier

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,030
and you can see that for Amazon S3 which is an object storage system.

45
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,690
You can get five gigabytes of storage a month and you get a certain amount of requests for retrieving

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,990
or uploading objects and you've then got the database service over here.

47
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,030
RDS.

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:33,310
Again 750 hours another popular service on Amazon is dynamoDB which is a no SQL database and you

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,920
can see here you get 25 gigabytes.

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,800
So it's always worth having a look and just seeing what you can get.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,260
You can filter on the left hand side here you can see we've also got AWS lambda an elastic container

52
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,810
registry Elastic Load Balancing and lightsail.

53
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,640
If we go down to database you can see There's RDS dynamoDB, Eelasticache, Redshift and database migration

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:02,930
service if we go down to storage we can see in addition to S3 we've got cloud front, elastic file system

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,450
elastic block storage and so on.

56
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,160
So there's quite a lot available.

57
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,310
Now let's just scroll back up again and choose create a free tier account.

58
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,240
What we need to do here is put in our email address.

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,010
We can put a password and confirm the password and then we've got to choose an account name which can

60
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,630
be changed later on.

61
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,940
Once we filled out that information we can just choose to continue on the next page you need to fill

62
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,800
out your contact information.

63
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,850
However before you do that you need to choose the account type.

64
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,200
Now if you hover over the information icon here it tells you that you should select professional if

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,320
the account is intended for company use educational use or for an institutional organisation.

66
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,980
Otherwise select personnel.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,460
So in most cases you're going to use personal.

68
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,970
So just select that option and then fill out your contact information.

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,090
And once you've done that click Create Account and continue you'll now need to enter some payment information.

70
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:03,050
So you'll need your credit and debit card and then just put in your details and click on secure submit.

71
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,210
You're now asked to confirm your identity.

72
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,220
So you have a couple of options here.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,150
You can choose to receive a text message or you can choose to receive a voice call if you receive a

74
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,040
voice call.

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,770
You'll actually get called by an automated service.

76
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,890
But from a AWS and they'll ask you to verify some information.

77
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:28,250
I'm just going to use the text message service and all I need to do is choose my country and my phone

78
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,620
number.

79
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,590
Obviously put in the security check and then click send SMS.

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,650
You should then receive a verification code and you just need to type that into the box.

81
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,370
My case is 6 8 9 2 and then just choose verify code and that's it.

82
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,960
It says that my identity has been verified successfully and I can continue.

83
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,890
You then get asked to select a support plan and there are free options here.

84
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,230
The basic plan which is free to the developer plan which is about $30 dollars a month and then the business

85
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,120
plan at $100 dollars a month.

86
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,750
We don't need to choose any paid plans there for the purposes of training and the labs that we're going

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,720
to be doing in this course the free plan is just fine.

88
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,120
So I'm just going to select that option and that's it.

89
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:17,450
So we've now gone through the whole process and we get a welcome to Amazon Web Services message and

90
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,800
they let us know that they're activating the account which might take a few minutes and then what you

91
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,080
want to do is check your e-mail to see if you've received the confirmation.

92
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:33,620
So let's just head over to my e-mail accounts and see if we receive those messages so here I am in Gmail

93
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,360
and I've got this welcome to Amazon Web Services message which is telling me that for the next 12 months

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,340
I'll have free access to multiple services within the free to air and you can click on this link and

95
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,430
see a bit more information about what's available to you I also received this email which lets you know

96
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,490
that you've signed up for the basic support plan.

97
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,920
I also received this email which gives some links to tutorials and articles that you might want to have

98
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,580
a look at.

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,680
Let's head back to the AWS Web site and we should now be able to sign into our account.

100
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,550
I'll just choose sign into the console and on this log in screen we can see that we need an account

101
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,800
I.D. a username and password.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,500
Now we don't actually have those yet.

103
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,090
These are part of the Identity and Access Management System and we'll be creating an IAM user shortly

104
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,170
but for now you have to choose sign in using root account credentials.

105
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,120
You'll then be asked to supply the email address that you just signed up with.

106
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,250
You can then choose next and put in the password

107
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,030
and that's it.

108
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:44,150
Guys we're now locked into the AWS management console with our new AWS free tier account.

109
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,540
So that's really exciting you're now set to actually build some services on AWS. What we're going to

110
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,900
do in the next lab is modify the sign in link so we have a more user friendly link that users can use

111
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,510
to log in with and then after that we're going to have a lab on setting up billing alarms so that you

112
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,810
can get notified if you reach certain billing thresholds that you assign.

113
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,780
Hope you're having fun guys see you in the next lab.
