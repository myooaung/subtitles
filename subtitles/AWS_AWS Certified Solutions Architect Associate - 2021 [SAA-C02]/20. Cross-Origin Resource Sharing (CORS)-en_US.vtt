Cross origin, resource sharing or cause can be a little bit of a confusing subject, so I'm going to

2
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.000
try and make it as easy as possible in this lesson for you to understand.

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
So with as free, you do sometimes need to enable cause.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.780
What it means is it will allow requests from an origin to another origin.

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.390
Now that in itself probably sounds rather confusing.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.270
Let's first define what an origin is now.

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.000
An origin is defined by the DNS name that you're connecting to, the protocol you're using, and the

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.980
port that you're connected to as well.

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.790
So if you're connected from a client to a specific domain name using HTP on Port 80, then that's your

10
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.300
origin.

11
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
Let's look at this in a quick diagram to help you to understand.

12
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
So we've got a client who's using a browser and they're connecting to an S3 bucket.

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.400
Now that S3 bucket is configured as a website, in this case for my company dot com, we then have another

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.950
bucket and that bucket is holding some web font assets, which we're going to need to access.

15
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.820
Now, firstly, the browser is connecting to my company dot com, so the DNS name is my company dot

16
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.150
com.

17
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.090
The protocol is http and the port is Port 80, so that now becomes the origin.

18
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.270
And in this case, we're using JavaScript, so a JavaScript web client has been loaded on the browser.

19
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.680
Now we need to actually connect to the free endpoint for the other bucket with the web font assets in

20
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.800
it.

21
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.130
So we're going to issue a connection request.

22
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.730
And what happens is something called a pre flight request is going to check if we are allowed to make

23
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.740
a request to that specific bucket.

24
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.740
So remember, we're connected to one origin, but now our browser is trying to connect to a different

25
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.190
origin.

26
00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.690
Now, whether we're able to do that or not is defined on that bucket with the web font assets.

27
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.300
That's where the cause configuration is.

28
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.960
So you have to add a configuration that's going to allow requests from the other origin.

29
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.730
Now how do we do that?

30
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.670
Well, we enable it through a series of settings.

31
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.270
We've got the access control, allow origin, the access control, allow methods and the access control,

32
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.100
allow headers.

33
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.540
You don't need to use all of these, but these are the available settings and we define these settings

34
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.320
free rules.

35
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.160
The rules are added using JSON files and Amazon as free.

36
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.530
So let's have a look at an example.

37
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.910
Here's an example role in JSON format for a cause configuration and we can see we've got the allowed

38
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.120
headers in this case is star methods is put post and delete, and the origins is dubbed up double what

39
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.410
my company XCOM.

40
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.820
So that would have to be the origin that would allow dub, dub, dub, dub my company dot com.

41
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.090
It might not actually allow my company XCOM, because that's a slightly different domain name.

42
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.220
This is a subdomain, so you'll need to make sure that somebody set correctly.

43
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.350
So that's cause now.

44
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.420
The key thing to remember is that you don't implement your course configuration on the origin, you

45
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.330
implement it on the other bucket that you're trying to connect to.
