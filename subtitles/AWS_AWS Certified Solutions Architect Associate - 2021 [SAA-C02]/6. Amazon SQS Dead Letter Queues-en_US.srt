1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,480
Guys, I told you before that there are two different types of Q the standard Q and the FIFA.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,390
Q There's also something called a dead letter.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,670
Q.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,120
Now this isn't actually a type of.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,240
Q So there are only two types, but it's actually a configuration that you apply to either a stand a

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,300
Q or FIFA Q to configure it for a certain purpose.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,360
So what is that purpose?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,650
Well, we have our website here and it's putting messages onto a Q and then we have our consumers in

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,770
the application to and they're processing those messages.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,920
So they're polling the Q and then they're receiving the message.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,200
Now they may occasionally not process that message successfully.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,860
And in that case, we can specify a max receive count.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,310
So that's the maximum number of times a consumer can receive an individual message.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,170
And if that's exceeded, we can configure a dead letter.

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,650
Q So that that message then gets put into the dead letter.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,700
Q And we'll do that so that we can then analyze what happened.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:13,000
So in this case, Message four has failed to be processed and therefore it gets moved into the dead

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,200
letter.

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,470
Q So a dead letter.

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,320
Q is used for handling message failure.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,080
And it lets you set aside and isolate messages that aren't processed correctly so that you can then

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,540
analyze why that happened.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,650
So it's not actually a cute time.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,730
It's a standard or FIFO queue that specified as a dead letter.

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,450
Q In the configuration of another queue.

26
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:41,840
So, for instance, we have our standard queue and in our standard queue we can set what's called a

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,010
drive policy.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:51,860
And then we can specify another cue called middle cue and specify the number of times that any message

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:58,160
in my standard cue can be received before it gets pushed into the dead letter.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,410
Q So let's go over to the console and have a look at how this works.

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:07,460
And back in the console and what I'm going to do is create a new queue and I'm going to call that my

32
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,120
DL.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,110
Q And just choose quick.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,310
Right.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,860
Q And then I'm now going to go into my stand.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,820
Q And I'm going to go configure Q.

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:26,050
And specify a drive policy, and I'm going to tell it to use my DL cue and I'm going to say maximum

38
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,290
receives is free and that's click save changes.

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,570
So now let's go to our standard queue and send a couple of messages.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,920
So I'm going to send a text message and then I'm going to send another one test, too, and then click

41
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,430
close.

42
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,180
So now we have two messages in our queue.

43
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,660
I'm going to poll for those messages and now I've received them once so you can see there's a receive

44
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,590
count of one.

45
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,410
I'm going to click stop and then start again.

46
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,340
And now I've received it twice and I'm going to click stop and start again.

47
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,020
And now I've received it a third time.

48
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,880
So what's going to happen now?

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,170
Let's say we click on Stop and start and this time they're gone.

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,000
So what's happened is those messages have disappeared from our standard queue and they've gone into

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,500
the DL queue.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,190
So the dead letter.

53
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,320
Q So just to recap, messages are moved to the dead letter queue when they receive count for message

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,920
exceeds the max receive count for the Q and also a dead letter.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,440
Q should not be used to stand accused when your application will keep retrying transmission and they

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,110
also shouldn't be used with FIFO queues if you need to maintain the order of messages because it will

57
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,350
break that first in first hour order.

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,490
So that's it for dead letter queues.

59
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,520
And in the next lesson, we're going to talk about delay queues.
