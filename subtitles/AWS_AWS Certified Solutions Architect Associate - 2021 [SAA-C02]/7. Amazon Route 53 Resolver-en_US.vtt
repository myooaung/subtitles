Hi, guys, so Indians, we have the concept of a Fauda, what a forwarder does is when a DNS server

2
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.330
can't answer a query, but it knows where to go.

3
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.710
It knows where to forward the request onto it will then do so.

4
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.900
It will forward that request and the DNS query can be recursive.

5
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.600
That means it can go through different DNS servers until it finds a result.

6
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.000
And we can use this in a number of ways.

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.850
We can use it in one way so that we can have an internal DNS namespace for our company.

8
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.510
And then we've got the outside world, we've got the internet, so we might point to a DNS server internally,

9
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.580
and it will respond to any of the records in its own database, its own zone file.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400
And those would be internal records for your servers in your company.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.670
But if you put in an internet domain name, it doesn't know the results, but it's able to forward the

12
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.630
request somewhere else.

13
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.550
Now, Route 53 Resolver essentially does these functions, and it enables us to work with our on premises,

14
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.840
DNS service and our Route 53 DNS servers so that we can bring the two together and get resolution of

15
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.360
domain names that are either in hosted zones and around 53 or in our internal DNS servers.

16
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.280
So let's look at how it works.

17
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.100
We have a couple of different types of resolver.

18
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.170
We've got the outbound endpoints.

19
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.970
So here we have a VPC.

20
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.640
We've got a couple of subnet sort of instances and then we've got our corporate data center and our

21
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.430
data center.

22
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.730
We have a DNS server and we've got a VPN connecting the corporate data center with our VPC.

23
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.110
So there's an encrypted connection between those two entities.

24
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.830
So 8:53 can be configured with an outbound endpoint.

25
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.020
What this means is whether these two incidents actually goes to Route 53.

26
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.100
Looking up some specific records which are in your company DNS server, it will return the results to

27
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.820
the outbound endpoint, and the outbound endpoint is configured to connect to your DNS server on premises.

28
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.840
The DNS server on premises will then respond to the query via the outbound endpoints and Route 53.

29
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.460
So you get the result.

30
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.190
The other type of end point is an inbound endpoint.

31
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.350
In this configuration, we have the inbound endpoint configured in of APC.

32
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.040
A client in the corporate data center wants to resolve a record that's in Route 53.

33
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.390
So that's the other way around.

34
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.530
So this time the client is configured with a DNS server on premises, the on premises DNS server, forwards

35
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.830
to the inbound endpoint, and then the inbound endpoint uses Route 50 free to return a result.

36
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.530
So that's how Route 50 free resolver works.

37
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.850
It's essentially about making sure that Eva EC2 instances or clients in your on premises data center

38
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.620
are able to resolve records in both your own premises, DNS server database, the hosted zone here or

39
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.460
in 50 phrase hosted zones.

40
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.130
So that's it for that lesson.

41
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.410
Just wanted to give you a bit of background on Route 53 resolver, and I'll see you in the next lesson.
