Hi, guys, multifactorial fence creation can be a bit of a confusing topic.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.410
So let's break it down and see what it's all about.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.290
So firstly, there are free, different factors associated with authentication.

4
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.980
The first one is typically referred to as something, you know.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.200
So the example being a password.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.540
So you need to remember that password.

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.100
Hopefully you don't write it down.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.620
Hopefully you just remember it and you're able to type the password in whenever you want to authenticate.

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.230
The second is something you have.

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.590
So in other words, you might have a physical token.

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
You might use these for work where you're given a physical token.

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.390
Sometimes they generate a code and you use that code to log in and it proves that the person who's authenticating

13
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.740
owns this device.

14
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.420
And they've been given that security.

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.800
Maybe they were given it at work.

16
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.150
And so it shows that there are the person who they say they are.

17
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.240
But of course, these can be compromised because someone could steal it.

18
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.040
The other type of token is a software based version such as Google authenticator.

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.580
Now, the third method of authentication is something you are also known as biometrics.

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.410
So that might be a fingerprint or it could be a retinal scan or some other biological test to prove

21
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.640
that you really are the human being that you say you are now in a W.S..

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.640
We have what's called two factual fense occasion.

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.120
So firstly, we've got something, you know, and that's the password.

24
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.330
So you have an I am user account.

25
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.310
You have a password that that user must remember.

26
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.340
The second piece is something you have.

27
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.720
So there's no something you are there's no biometrics in A.W. US at the moment.

28
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.400
But there is the second factual authentication, which is something you have.

29
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.470
So now you can have either a physical or a virtual MFA device.

30
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.710
I use the Google fence on my smartphone and you'll see how to use that in this section.

31
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.790
We're going to set this up.

32
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.350
And you've also got this physical option as well.

33
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.420
This costs more money.

34
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.530
And you would then have a physical device that you put into your laptop when you have multifactorial

35
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.090
fense occasion, when you have this second factor.

36
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.690
It means that not only do you have to put in your password so the something you know, but you need

37
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.740
to enter a code from your device or just plug your device in.

38
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.480
And that proves that you have some physical device that was given securely to you.

39
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.590
For instance, only you can access this code on your smartphone now.

40
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.030
Sure, somebody might steal your smartphone, but they still can't get in because I don't know your

41
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.690
password.

42
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.830
Or alternatively, you might have written your password down and someone finds it.

43
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.740
But then they need your smartphone to be at a log in as well.

44
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.770
So by having two factors of authentication, your account is much more secure than just having one.
