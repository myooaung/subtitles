00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.200
Let's look in a bit more detail about how we do routing with the ALP and the NHLBI.

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.880
So let's say we have multiple subnets here and we've launched instances in different subnets now.

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.290
HD subnets is also in a different ISEE.

4
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.710
We then create our target groups.

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.460
So we have TG one, TG two and TG Free.

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.300
The target group is used to route requests to the registered targets, so the instances in the target

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.570
group.

8
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.590
We then have an application load balancer and a roll is configured on the listener, an albee's will

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.320
listen on TCP or HTTPS.

10
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.710
We now have a client and the client slips into their browser example, dot com slash specials.

11
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.710
The connection goes to the ALP and the ALP forwards on to Target Group one.

12
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.060
So the request is actually being routed to the target group based on the path in the URL.

13
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.260
So the path is what comes after the slash here in this case specials.

14
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.640
The user now typed in slash orders and in this case, the connection goes through to the ALP.

15
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.380
It inspects the path in the HTTP layer and then it forwards that connection request onto Target Group

16
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.890
two, because that's configured in path based routing.

17
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.620
So path based routing is one option.

18
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.020
The other is house based routing.

19
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.570
So in this case, the user types in members dot example dot com and the connection gets routed to Target

20
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.170
Group three.

21
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.750
In this case, the request is being routed based on the host field in the FTP header.

22
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.960
So the members dot example dot com, that's the host header, whereas this is the path.

23
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.530
So that's the difference between path base and host based routing targets can be easy to instances IP

24
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.870
addresses, lambda functions or containers.

25
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.070
Next, we have the NHLBI again, we have free subnets, and in this case, we have six instances and

26
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.330
two target groups.

27
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.510
We've got a network load balancer and we're going to assign an elastic IP in each subnet.

28
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.410
So with load balances, this is really the logical load balancer.

29
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.370
The real load balancer is actually the nodes that the NHLBI service will create in each subnet.

30
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.730
So within each day, it needs to have some nodes.

31
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.510
Those are the ones that the connections get forwarded to.

32
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.060
And then on from there to your instances.

33
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.160
So in this case, you can have an elastic IP in each of these subnets.

34
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.070
The NHLBI will listen on TCP, TLC, UDP or TCP UDP.

35
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.730
So again, we have a client, the client puts an example dot com and they get connected to Target Group

36
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.120
one.

37
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.940
The next example the client puts in example dot com, but they put in colon HKT.

38
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.320
That's a different port number.

39
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.840
So the A.P. can't route the way that an Albi can based on the path, like the slash specials or the

40
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.060
members dot example dot com.

41
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.190
But when something comes into a different port number, a different listener can pick it up.

42
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.610
So you have a separate listener on a unique port and then that will get forwarded to Target Group two.

43
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.590
In this case, remember requests are being routed based on IP protocol data.

44
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.480
For the NHLBI, the targets can be easy to instances or IP addresses.

45
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.570
Targets can also be outside of of the APC, so you can have on premises instances.

46
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.040
You might have those connected over a virtual private network or direct connect.

47
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.660
And that's it for this lesson.

48
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.180
I'll see you in the next lesson.
