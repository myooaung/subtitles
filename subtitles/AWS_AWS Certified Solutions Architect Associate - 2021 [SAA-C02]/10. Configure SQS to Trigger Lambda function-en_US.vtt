00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.390
Hi, guys, and this lesson, we're going to practice a bit of what we've learned and we're going to

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.240
set up a simple Q service cue that triggers a lambda function so that when we add messages to the Q

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.380
and we're going to do it manually, the Lambda function is triggered and we're seeing flowerpots logs

4
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.610
that an event is written to cloud watch logs.

5
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.290
So let's head out to the console and build this out.

6
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.100
So I'm here in the console and what I can do is go to my stand.

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.510
Q Q Actions and configure trigger for Lambda function.

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
Now, we don't have any functions at the moment, so I'm going to create a new function.

9
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.410
I'm going to call this my excuse.

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.880
Trigger.

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.710
And we're going to leave that on notice and it's going to create a new role or we can go down and actually

12
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.870
mentally choose LAMDA basic execution role.

13
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.140
Now, we will need more privileges than this.

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.910
So let's choose Krait function.

15
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.690
And now we have our function created, so if at this point you come back here, refresh, find your

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.330
function and then try to save, it's going to tell you you don't have permissions to call the receive

17
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.810
message on us.

18
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.270
So this shows you that Lambda is using the receive message API to actually try and find messages in

19
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.270
your queue and it's unable to do that.

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.540
So let's go back and we're going to scroll down to where our role is.

21
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.810
Choose the roll.

22
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.450
This takes us over to Iame and under permissions.

23
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.250
I'm going to choose a tax policy.

24
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.110
And if you just ask us.

25
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.640
You should get some results and you've got the excuse lamda execution row here, and if you look at

26
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.210
the chase on this allows us to receive message, delete message, get key attributes, and then you

27
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.950
can also create those little groups and streams and put a log event into cloud watch logs.

28
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.990
So that's everything we need.

29
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.420
Will select that and attach the policy.

30
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.510
And now if we head back to us and let's try and configure our trigger again.

31
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.590
And it fills out in the end, and that's just to save.

32
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.940
And so that's done.

33
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.550
Let's click, OK?

34
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.150
And now we want to send a message to the queue, so let's just put test message in the body and then

35
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.640
click send message and close.

36
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.190
And if we head back over to Lamda now and we head over to monitoring Tewes view logs in cloud watch

37
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.300
logs, and let's try refreshing there and not just needed a refresh.

38
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.200
And then I've found that it actually put these log entries in here.

39
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.130
So we've now got a couple of entries.

40
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.250
And if we go back over to us and let's put another message in the queue and send a message.

41
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.620
Then quite quickly, we should find that we have a new response coming into the queue, so that's just

42
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.460
a quick example of how you can configure LAMDA so that it is checking your queue for messages and then

43
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.870
processing those messages.

44
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.810
And if we just go back to LAMDA, we'll see on the configuration page and you probably need to refresh

45
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.170
this.

46
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.390
You should then see that you have a trigger here.

47
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.320
So excuse is a trigger for us.

48
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.870
LAMDA So that's it for this lesson.

49
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.750
And I am going to clean up because I don't need these queues anymore.

50
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.230
We will create another queue in a couple of lessons time when we're looking at S.A.S., but for now

51
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.860
we can just delete all of these queues and then you can go back as well, if you like, and delete your

52
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.370
function.
