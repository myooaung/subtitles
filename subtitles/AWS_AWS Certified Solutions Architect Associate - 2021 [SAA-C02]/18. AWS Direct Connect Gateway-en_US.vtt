Welcome to this lesson in this lesson, I'm going to cover IWC Direct Connect Gateway now, the best

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.980
way to understand the benefits of Direct Connect Gateway is to have a look at an architecture where

3
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.290
we don't use it and how complex it can get.

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.360
And then we're going to look at when we use Direct Connect Gateway and how it can solve some problems.

5
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.040
So here's an example architecture where we're not using Direct Connect Gateway.

6
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.150
Now we have multiple regions and we have an office and we have multiple direct locations in different

7
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.990
parts of the world.

8
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.820
And what we're doing is we're connecting each of those regions to a direct location that's close to

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.890
that region and then into a corporate office.

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.180
And we're doing the same in the EU central one region at the bottom here as we are in U.S. West one.

11
00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.440
So this company now has multiple locations where they then have connections into IWC using DEX.

12
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.640
You then must establish a private vef and that connects to a single VPC in the same region using a virtual

13
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.120
gateway.

14
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.760
We do the same in the second region.

15
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.870
Now Dex is a regional service, so obviously multiple DEX locations have to be used for this topology

16
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.600
and also requires regional offices or long distance expensive links.

17
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.420
So in other words, these customer announcers here have to ever be in one low physical location, one

18
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.590
geographic location, and you've got a very long distance link coming from Europe or the U.S. or these

19
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.680
are multiple offices in different geographical areas.

20
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.180
So when we want to start connecting our offices to multiple regions using Direct Connect, it can become

21
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.490
quite expensive and quite complex.

22
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.530
So now let's look at an architecture where we use Direct Connect Gateway.

23
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.590
So in this case, we have the same two regions.

24
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.910
We have a single corporate office and a single desk location.

25
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.960
And so we now only have that connection in small office from one location and we have a gateway.

26
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.300
And then the DPRK's gateway is actually connecting to multiple regions.

27
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.030
A private Viv is associated with the DCS Gateway, and then the Gateway is associated with a virtual

28
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.920
gateway in each of the regions.

29
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.190
BGP advertises around to all the offices via the DCS Gateway, and the traffic that's going from the

30
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.570
the gateway to these different regions is going over the West backburn, so it's using that consistent

31
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.070
network experience of the IWC global network.

32
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.550
Now, network traffic can go from the office to either region.

33
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.650
So any of the VP picks connected and of course, I'm only showing two here, but you can have many,

34
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.560
many regions that are connected to a DCS gateway.

35
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.450
Now what you can't do is actually route regional traffic from one region to another via the DEX gateway.

36
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.780
It doesn't support that, but you can use it to connect from your corporate office using a single direct

37
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.750
connection into multiple regions around the world.

38
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.300
So that's the gateway.

39
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.410
It's a really useful technology.

40
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.960
If you're a global company, but you don't have global offices or you want a single office location

41
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.690
to have this consistent network experience into multiple regions around the world.

42
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.490
And this is a great technology to use.
