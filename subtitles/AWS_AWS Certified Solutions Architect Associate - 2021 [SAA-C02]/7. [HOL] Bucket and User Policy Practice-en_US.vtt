00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.580
Hi, guys, in this lesson we're going to cover using bucket policies and user policies or user policies

2
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.210
are the I Am policies that we create and attached to our users.

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.090
Now there are a couple of things that you're going to need to set up.

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.890
Firstly, you need a second user account.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.110
I've got one cool pool.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.090
You can call this use of whatever you want.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.040
Now that user will need management console access, at this stage, the user should not be in any groups

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.520
so effectively that user does not have any permissions.

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.480
Now I've logged in as that user into a private window, and that means I'm logged into my main account

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.080
with my own admin privileges in one window and then in a private window or incognito window.

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.190
I'm logged in as pool, so pull at this stage should not have any access if you go into Amazon as free.

12
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.150
What we should say is this you don't have any permissions to list buckets, so the user has no privileges

13
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.770
to ask free at this point in time.

14
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.250
Now we also want to add a couple of folders and some files to our bucket, so I'm going to use the same

15
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.140
bucket DCT cloud storage.

16
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.760
What we're going to do?

17
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.080
We're going to create a folder.

18
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.150
This one's going to be called department.

19
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.380
Just create the folder.

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.150
Then we're going to create another one.

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
This one's going to be called confidential and then going to go into the confidential folder.

22
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.120
Upload.

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.660
At files, and I'm going to choose this file confidential report so you can just create your own documents

24
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.010
and call them whatever you want.

25
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.310
So mine's called confidential reports a word document.

26
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.520
I'm going to upload that file, then close out of here.

27
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.040
Back up a level, choose the department folder, upload at files, and this time I'm going to choose

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.840
this company goes PDF.

29
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.940
So that's the structure set up.

30
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.480
Now, let's have a look at the policies that we're going to use in your course.

31
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.100
Download in the co-direct tree.

32
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.060
Amazon has free.

33
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.790
You're going to have this file user policies and bucket policies, and we've got some numbered items

34
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.110
in here.

35
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.200
So the first one is we're going to attach a user policy to our user, which allows that user to list

36
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.770
buckets.

37
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.110
So the privileges as on buckets and the resources, any.

38
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.800
So that means any IWC bucket that we have.

39
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.650
It's a start.

40
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.480
It's a wildcard.

41
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.040
So what I'm going to simply do is copy this code here from the opening and the closing curly braces

42
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.910
back in, I'm going to choose my second user account lines, call Paul and I'm going to add an inline

43
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.730
policy, click on the JSON tab, remove the existing code and paste my new code in.

44
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.380
Let's click on review.

45
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.670
I'm just going to call this pull in line, and then let's create the policy.

46
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.000
Now, don't worry about this summary here.

47
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.370
We're going to see what privileges this does.

48
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.150
Assigns a pool.

49
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.140
So we've attached that policy.

50
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.820
Let's go over to the other browser window where Paul is logged in.

51
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.740
So now I'm back logged in as Paul.

52
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.570
Let's refresh my screen here and I can now list the buckets so you can see there's an access warning

53
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.100
here of insufficient permissions.

54
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.670
All I have here is the permission to list the bucket.

55
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.190
So if I click on DCT cloud storage, I can't see any objects within the bucket.

56
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.180
I can only list the bucket level, so let's go to the next policy.

57
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
It says See root level bucket items, user policy.

58
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.820
So what does this one do?

59
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.500
So here we have to list all my pockets and get bucket location privileges.

60
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.260
We then have the free list bucket, which is an allow for a specific bucket name.

61
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.180
In this case, it was DCT policy test.

62
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.030
Now I need to change that from my bucket, so make sure you change this value here.

63
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.100
Now, the condition is that the string equals a prefix and at the limiter of slash.

64
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.510
So what this should do is allow us to see the items within the bucket.

65
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.400
So let's copy all of this code to our clipboards and then back logged in as my main user accounts.

66
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.350
I'm going to edit this policy.

67
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.430
Click on Jason, delete all the code and paste this in.

68
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.390
Now remember, I do need to change my bucket name here.

69
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.840
So back on is free with my bucket selected.

70
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.370
I'm going to go to properties and ayorinde.

71
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.090
I can copy that so my clipboard come back and I can start it and so I can replace the entire R9 here.

72
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.070
And let's save this policy.

73
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.770
Now, let's go back over to pull back.

74
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.610
Look, then his pull.

75
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.360
I'm trying to look at the objects were in my bucket.

76
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.600
Let's click on the refresh and you see that now I can actually see these objects.

77
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.830
Can I download an object?

78
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.320
Let's have a look, and I get an access is denied.

79
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.740
What about going in and looking at items in confidential?

80
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.930
Well, now I don't have permissions, so we're getting quite granular here in the permissions we're

81
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.040
assigning to this user.

82
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.770
Now let's move on to the next policy.

83
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.950
This is to view the department folder contents.

84
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.530
Now what you may notice is we've got a lot of the permissions here that we had in the previous policy

85
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.260
and then we have some additional permissions at the bottom here.

86
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.360
So here we have the list buckets.

87
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.570
We again need to replace R-N.

88
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.870
So let me paste my new boyfriend in.

89
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.220
There also has to be back up here, so make sure you do that.

90
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.840
Make sure you change your area.

91
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.970
And what this last policy statement here is going to do is allow us access to the department folder

92
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.740
Slashdot.

93
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.700
So anything within the department folder.

94
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.130
So let's go and copy all of this code.

95
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.560
I'm again going to edit the policy.

96
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.140
Click on Jason, delete everything out.

97
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.100
Paste this in.

98
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.740
Just as a reminder, make sure you've got the correct r.n for your bucket and then let's review policy.

99
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.630
And safe, so backlogged in his poll, let's refresh, but I'm trying to look in the confidential folder

100
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.770
here and we didn't give those permissions, so I'm not getting access.

101
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.750
Let's come back up to the bucket level Troy Department and we can see.

102
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.660
So we've now enabled this user to see right down to the objects within the department folder.

103
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.150
But as you saw before, we haven't given any permissions for uploading or deleting objects yet.

104
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:37.430
So the next policy here is still a user policy, and the first three of these sections are the same

105
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.030
as before.

106
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.620
And then the very last one at the bottom here allows the S3, gets objects and is free, puts objects,

107
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.280
actions.

108
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.330
Now I'm going to go.

109
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.640
It's my previous policy copy.

110
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.420
This R-N.

111
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.740
Let's come down.

112
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.930
There's going to be multiple places.

113
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.860
We need to put this.

114
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.380
As you can see as highlighted, the free places.

115
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.580
So let's change in all three of these locations and be careful with the last one you want to keep the

116
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.290
slash department slash star.

117
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.180
So that's it.

118
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.550
I should be able to copy this code.

119
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.560
Let's again edit our policy.

120
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.580
Go to Jason.

121
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.290
Delete this out.

122
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.070
Put on new code in review and save.

123
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.800
So back in the department folder.

124
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.080
Let's now see if we can download objects that works.

125
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.790
I can see my file downloading and I should also be able to upload objects because I gave the permission

126
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.690
to put objects.

127
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:38.300
So let's just choose any file and try and upload, and that's also a success.

128
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:45.920
The last policy is a bucket policy, and we need to use this in combination with policy two above.

129
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:53.450
Now let's just copy air and again, remember the run up to the name of the bucket and a copy that I'm

130
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:59.270
going to paste it over the ayorinde in my resource section of my bucket policy.

131
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.160
Then we need to use user policy too, so we need to go back up to policy too.

132
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:12.170
And I remember I didn't actually update this one in my file, so I'm going to update my in here as well.

133
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.000
Copy this code.

134
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.700
We're going to edit Paul's policy again.

135
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:23.090
Paste that in, and this will give the user the list level at the top of the bucket again.

136
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.250
So let's just save those changes if we come back to Paul, who's trying to look in the department folder

137
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.010
and refresh.

138
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.640
We should find that soon we get denied access and there we go.

139
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.680
That took a couple of refreshes that can sometimes take a bit of time.

140
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.380
So what about at the bucket level here?

141
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.100
And yes, we can see the objects at this level.

142
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.010
Now what if we go into the confidential folder?

143
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.990
Well, here we certainly don't have permissions because we can only see at the level above.

144
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.680
So coming back to the code now we need to use the bucket policy and the bucket policy is going to allow

145
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.840
the specific user.

146
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:07.430
So you're going to need to go and get the end of your user, which can find inside the user account

147
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.580
here.

148
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.540
Just copy the RNC, a clipboard and then paste that in.

149
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.940
So this principle will be allowed.

150
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:20.390
The action is free star, so any free action on the resource DCT cloud storage.

151
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.890
So our bucket name and then the prefix is under a condition.

152
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.620
So the condition is limiting this access.

153
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:34.910
So any reaction, but only on this prefix, which is the confidential folder and then slash star, which

154
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.340
means the objects within the folder.

155
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:44.660
The slash star indicates that the privileges are assigned to the objects within the folder as well.

156
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.550
So let's copy all of this and now we're going to go and add a bucket policy.

157
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.100
So back in this, I'm in my pocket here and under permissions.

158
00:09:54.110 --> 00:10:00.710
Let's scroll down a little white and click on Edit next to bucket policy, and we're going to paste

159
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.700
our policy in.

160
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.170
And just in case you haven't updated your iPhone, you can get it easily here as well.

161
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.010
You can copy it and then paste it in and make sure you've got the correct Aaron.

162
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.920
So let's save these changes.

163
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.000
Come back to Paul.

164
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.140
Let's click on Refresh.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.720

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.520
so that's how we work with user policies as well as bucket policies.

167
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.490
And as you can see, we can actually use them together as well.
