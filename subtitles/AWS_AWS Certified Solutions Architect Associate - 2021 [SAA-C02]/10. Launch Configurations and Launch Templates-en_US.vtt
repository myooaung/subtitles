00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.360
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.840
In this lab I want to cover launch configurations and launch templates.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.730
This is in relation to auto scaling and you'll remember if you see under auto scaling in the bottom

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.960
left there you have launch configurations and they specify parameters such as the instance family the

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.440
instance type the EMI I.D. to use the key pair security groups and so on.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.470
So there's several parameters that you can specify in a launch configuration that defines what auto

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520
scaling launch is when it launches an instance.

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.140
Now there's a new feature called Launch templates may not be on the exam yet but it will be soon and

9
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.860
it is the way that Amazon is recommending you go because it has some additional features.

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.270
Now what we'll do is we'll cover launch configurations first and then we'll move onto launch templates.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.240
So let's create a launch configuration so we can see it in action.

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.250
The first being is to choose the EMI that we want to use.

13
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.020
I'm going to choose this Amazon lives to aim my you then get to choose the family and type.

14
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.360
So obviously you can select from any of these instance types that you like.

15
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.650
I'm just gonna leave it as the general purpose T2 micro you then put a name on your launch configuration

16
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.540
you can request spot instances and you can specify your maximum bid price.

17
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.140
This is the maximum amount you're prepared to pay per hour for that instance and you can get some big

18
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.910
discounts by using SPOT instances.

19
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.030
You can choose your IAM role so let's just choose the only one that we have available.

20
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.070
And if you wanted to pay a bit more to get more data through cloud what you can enable detailed monitoring

21
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.450
which gives you data in 1 minute intervals whereas by default the basic monitoring gives you for free

22
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.340
in five minute intervals.

23
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.660
There is then some advance detail so for instance you could put your user data in here.

24
00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.950
You could specify to assign a public IP to every instance you can then specify the UBS volumes that

25
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.270
you want to attach.

26
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.300
Now by default this EMI has come of a route volume you could easily just go in and add an E B.S. provision

27
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.810
I OP's volume and you can encrypt that if you like and then you can specify a security group and that's

28
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.510
all the parameters that you can specify so you can see you have the EMI details for instance type the

29
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.680
launch conflict details which includes the IAM role the user data the IP address configuration then

30
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.240
you have storage options and security groups.

31
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.680
And if we just click Create launch configuration we then have to specify our key player as well.

32
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.090
And that said we've now created a launch configuration.

33
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.380
Now one of the things you'll notice about launch configurations is you can't modify it so you can delete

34
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.490
it and you can copy the launch configuration and then make changes to it but you can't modify the existing

35
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.720
launch configuration.

36
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.480
That means that if this launch configuration is attached to an auto scaling group and you need to change

37
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.640
something like the instance type you want to use you can't make this modification it's important for

38
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.670
the exam that you notice because this comes up in questions quite a lot.

39
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.190
So what you need to know is that you would create a new one so maybe your copy of the launch configuration

40
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.760
and you might then go through this go back and change the instance time and we could say well we want

41
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.170
it to be a T2 small because we need a a bit more memory in our instance.

42
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.890
And so yep we'll continue with this instance time skips a review create launch configuration and let's

43
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.660
go back.

44
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.900
And now we have a copy and that copy is using a different instance type.

45
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.080
And what we would do then is we would then attach that new launch configuration to the auto screening

46
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.350
group.

47
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.880
So that's how launch configurations work.

48
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.450
Let's have a look now at launch templates.

49
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.410
So here we are on the launch templates console and like I say this is quite a new feature and it may

50
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.760
not appear on the exam yet but it will do soon and it's definitely something which I WSF promoting.

51
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.300
So let's go clip create launch template and you can use versioning with launch templates.

52
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.720
So here we have the option to create a new template or a version.

53
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.530
So if we chose a version we would have to find an existing template as the basis for that new version.

54
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.760
In our case we would create a new template.

55
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.330
You then give it a name.

56
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.070
You can give it a source template.

57
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.510
If you don't want a version but you still want to use an existing template as a as a source file you

58
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.720
then specify EMI I.D. instance types.

59
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.440
KEEPER So you know a lot of this is the same as with launch configurations.

60
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.740
When we get down to advance details however we'll see there's a lot more here.

61
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.090
Now firstly we can change to spot instances if we like and then we also have a lot more configuration

62
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.050
options.

63
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.350
For instance T2 t free unlimited you can't specify that in a launch configuration but you can launch

64
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.330
template.

65
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.960
So there's lots of information here.

66
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.210
Termination protection can be enabled you can enter license configurations.

67
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.360
So there's quite a lot in there.

68
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.950
Now another way that you can actually create a launch template is from an instance.

69
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.530
So let's just go back and I'm going to launch an instance quickly and I'm just going to go straight

70
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.960
through this wizard fats I'll just go to review and launch launch because I don't need to change anything.

71
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.360
And what we can do now is on the actions menu choose create template from instance and we need to give

72
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.170
this a name so let's just call this launch template one you can give it an optional version description

73
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.270
and it's already got the information filled out that's come from this source instance.

74
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:40.220
So we've got the Amway I.D. the instance type the keeper network interfaces storage volumes and so on

75
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.540
and now we can go down to advance details and do something like enable T2 T3 and LTD We could enable

76
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.060
termination protection and we could enter user data and then we create template for instance.

77
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.660
So now if you go to launch templates we can see we have a configuration here.

78
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.580
Let's go down to auto scaling groups.

79
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.620
And when we go to create and also scale in group the Wizards being changed a little now.

80
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.150
So you can see we have a launch configuration here and then we have launch template new here and Amazon

81
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.380
tell you that launch templates give you the option of launching one type of instant or a combination

82
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.520
of instance types and purchase options launch templates include the latest ATC features and can be updated

83
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.190
and version so they're definitely pushing this as the way forward.

84
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.900
This is the recommended feature to use in the future so you can choose launch template.

85
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.370
Select your launch template go the next step and then just create your auto scaling group.

86
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.930
Now what you'll notice here is that we have a new option fleet composition and we could adhere to the

87
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.470
launch template or we can combine purchase options and instances.

88
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.730
And this way we can mix OnDemand instances with spot instances and multiple instance types.

89
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.880
So let's just call this ASG 1 and let's add in an instance type and let's just choose a T2 small and

90
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.620
we'll go down we'll add a couple of subnets in and then choose next and we'll just keep this group at

91
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.220
its initial size click through go to review and create auto scaling group.

92
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.410
So we have our auto scaling group created and if we go into actions.

93
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.130
Edit We can see some of the information here.

94
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.920
Now if you changed a launch configuration you go back to this old console whereas if you stick with

95
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.770
launch template it changes and you can see some options here.

96
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.870
For instance the combined purchase options and instances and then you also get some more information

97
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:35.130
about spot allocation so you can configure how your instances are allocated and you can also specify

98
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.270
a percentage of instances that are on demand versus spot.

99
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.900
So there's quite a bit more going on here.

100
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.410
And if you scroll down a bit further you can see some more familiar information which you'll see in

101
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.480
both launch templates and launch configurations and we're going to cover that in the next couple of

102
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.030
labs so I won't go into the details of this section here just yet but that was just to give you a quick

103
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.690
overview of the differences between launch configurations and launch templates so you know that launch

104
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.900
templates are coming they're going to be an exam at some point soon.

105
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.130
They're already out there and NWS so you can start using them straight away.

106
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.410
And there's definitely some great advantages to using launch templates over launch configurations.

107
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:22.110
So for now what we can do is just delete are also scaling group and for the sake of cleaning up we can

108
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:29.670
go back and delete our launch configurations and we can also go up and delete our launch template and

109
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:36.930
I definitely outside of the auto scaling group started up an instance so I'm just gonna go and terminate

110
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:42.050
both of these instances to clean things up and that's it for this lab in the next lab.

111
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.960
We're going to go into auto screening health checks.
