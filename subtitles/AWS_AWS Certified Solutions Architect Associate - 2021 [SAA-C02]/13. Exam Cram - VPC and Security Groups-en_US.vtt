00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.590
Hello and welcome to another exam cram.

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.680
So as usual I'm going go quite fast.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.300
There's lots to cover in this exam cram remember you can slow the playback speed if I go too fast for

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.990
you but I do not want to make these too long I want to keep these quite fast so let's get into it and

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.970
remember you can also find all this information on the training notes and in the e-book we provide to

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.410
you as well. So Amazon VPC is a virtual private cloud and it's logically isolated from every other VPC

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.030
in your account on AWS and VPC is a region wide so you always have a VPC created within a region a default

8
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.230
VPC is created in every region with a subnet in each availability zone and those are always public subnets

9
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.130
there's an option to define dedicated tenancy for a VPC and this ensures that instances are launched

10
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.190
on dedicated hardware and that overrides the configuration specified when you actually launch an EC2

11
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.470
instance the default VPC has all public subnets so one VPC in every region and a public subnet in

12
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.770
each availability zone within each of those regions public subnets are subnets that have the auto assigned

13
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.590
public IPv4 setting set to Yes.

14
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.820
So that EC2 instances will get a public IP address and the subnet table must have an attached Internet

15
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.330
gateway so there has to be an entry in the route table pointing to an Internet gateway.

16
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.180
Remember Internet gateways are attached to the VPC not the subnet.

17
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.870
You just put a route table entry to point to the to the Internet gateway instances in the default VPC

18
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.650
always have a public and private IP.

19
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.590
Now AZ names are mapped to different zones for different users.

20
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.840
So in this example I'm saying ap-southeast-2a might be a different underlying availability zone than in

21
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050
my account than it is in your account for instance.

22
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.710
And that's just to try and sort of randomize where people are actually placing their workloads. Components

23
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.750
of a VPC include the VPC itself.

24
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.020
So that's a logically isolated virtual network and you can define the VPC IP address range. A subnet

25
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.640
is an address range so an IP address range where you place groups of resources.

26
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.620
Remember each subnet maps to one AZ.

27
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.270
You can have multiple subnets attached to an AZ but you can't have a subnet span across availability

28
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.250
zones.

29
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.550
You then have the Internet gateway and that's the VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.

30
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.990
You have a NAT gateway so remember NAT devices are doing network address translation and this is to

31
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.310
allow resources, EC2 instances in private subnets to access the Internet.

32
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.200
We then have a hardware VPN connection and that is for setting up virtual private networks between VPC

33
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.100
and a datacenter or home network or colo facility.

34
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.420
So a virtual private network over the Internet you can have a virtual private gateway.

35
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.060
That's the Amazon side of a VPN connection. The customer a gateway is the customer side.

36
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.070
So if you're connecting in your company network the customer Gateway is a configuration that relates

37
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.220
to the customer side, the company side of the network.

38
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.800
We then have the router so the routers interconnect the subnets and direct traffic between Internet

39
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.110
gateways virtual private gateways NAT gateways and subnets.

40
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.830
Then you don't really see the router it's not a component that you create or that you can actually visualize

41
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.330
but you do control it through the route table.

42
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.830
We then have a peering connection.

43
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.170
So this is how you can route private traffic using private IP addresses between different VPCs and

44
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.570
even across accounts. VPC endpoints enable private connectivity to services hosted in AWS from within

45
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.600
your VPC without using an Internet gateway a VPN or a network address translation device.

46
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.820
So that's where you're offering a service as a kind of service provider model and it can be consumed

47
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.670
without using the Internet.

48
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.070
You then have the egress only Internet gateway.

49
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.440
That's a different type of Internet gateway that's for IPv6 traffic.

50
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.890
Now back to routing the VPC router performs the routing between the availability zones it connects

51
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.050
different AZs together and connects the VPC to the Internet gateway as well.

52
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.530
Each subnet has a route table that the router uses for traffic within the VPC. Route tables can also

53
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.360
have entries to external destinations.

54
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.100
And this is a couple of examples of a couple route tables.

55
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.250
So remember you have your CIDR block.

56
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.940
So you will always see this target local and that'll be the side a block of the VPC.

57
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.030
So that means you can route traffic between all of your subnets within your VPC without having to change

58
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.720
the route table.

59
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.420
And then you've got a route table entry here to an Internet gateway and that specifies any destination

60
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.940
IP address and the same here except this is a private round table.

61
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.730
So it actually has a NAT Gateway I.D. to get out to the Internet instead.

62
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.670
So types of subnet if a subnets traffic's routed to an Internet gateway it's a public subnet.

63
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.280
If a subnet doesn't have a route to an Internet Gateway it's known as a private subnet if it doesn't have

64
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.070
a route to an Internet gateway but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway for a VPN then

65
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.070
it's known as a VPN only subnet. For IP addressing within a VPC the VPC is created with a master address

66
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.510
range that's the CIDR block.

67
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.700
Remember CIDR is classless into domain routing so that's the block of addresses and it could be anywhere

68
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.330
from sixteen to 28 bits long and subnet ranges are then created within that range new subnets always

69
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.480
get associated with the default route table.

70
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.670
So watch out for exam questions there.

71
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.930
Just remember when you create a new subnet it will be associated with a default route table.

72
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.010
If you wanted to change the routing in some way you have to create another route table and manually

73
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.150
go and associate it.

74
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.780
You can't change the CIDR block for a VPC once it's created.

75
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.580
You can't create additional CIDR blocks that overlap with the existing CIDR blocks and you

76
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:07.260
can't create additional CIDR blocks in a different see 1918 range. Subnets with overlapping IPs

77
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.880
cannot be created.

78
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.820
Remember the first four, and last one IP address in a subnet are reserved and a subnet is created within an

79
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.670
availability zone so a subnet maps to an availability zone and cannot span across availability zones.

80
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.090
So for internet gateways they serve two purposes.

81
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.500
They provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet routes of all traffic and they perform network

82
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.100
address translation for those instances that have assigned a public IP addresses.

83
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.430
They must be created and then attached to a VPC so they don't attach to the subnet they're attached

84
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.550
to the VPC.

85
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.940
And then you have an entry to a route table and associate that route table with the right subnet.

86
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.700
And then you can route out to the Internet.

87
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.820
And obviously those EC2 instances in that subnet must have public IP addresses.

88
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.850
There's no availability risk or bandwidth constraints with Internet gateways and you can't have multiple

89
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.190
gateways in a VPC.

90
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:07.000
Again the egress only Internet gateway is for outbound Internet access for IPv6 with security

91
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.320
groups.

92
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.110
These act as a firewall at the instance level.

93
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.610
So it's actually attached to the network interface of your EC2 instances.

94
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.490
You can only assign permit rules you cannot assign deny rules. All rules get evaluated until a permit

95
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.790
is encountered or continues until the implicit deny.

96
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.080
So that means if it doesn't find an allow rule then just by default

97
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.170
won't allow the traffic. You can control traffic going into your instances or out from your instances

98
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:39.910
so ingress and egress a security group is stateless so the key thing here traffic comes in for instance

99
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:46.600
on port 80 the return traffic going back to the client with their web browser is going to not go back

100
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:53.070
on port 80 because an ephemeral port will be used which is typically a port above 1024.

101
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.530
Now with a security group it will allow that traffic go back because it knows that it's associated with

102
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.970
the traffic that was allowed inbound to your web server.

103
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:09.070
Now that's very different to a network ACL which we'll see shortly. By default custom security groups

104
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:15.180
do not have inbound allows. If you create a custom security group no traffic will be allowed by default.

105
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.690
You have to explicitly define what you want to allow by default.

106
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.940
The default security groups do have inbound allow rules and they allow traffic from members of

107
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.920
the group itself.

108
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.550
Little bit more security groups all outbound traffic is allowed by default in both custom and default

109
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.590
security groups.

110
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.230
You cannot delete the security group that's created by default in a VPC.

111
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.390
You can use a security group name as a source or destination in another security group.

112
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:47.210
You can use the security group name as a source in its own inbound rules so that basically means that

113
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:54.590
if you attach a security group to a group of instances whatever inbound allow rules are defined that

114
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.610
traffic will be allowed to those instances.

115
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.710
Security group membership can be changed while instances are running.

116
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.260
So you can do it at any time and they take immediate effect.

117
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.400
You can't block specific IP addresses using security groups for that you'll use NACLs.
