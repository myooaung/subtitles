00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.470
In this lesson, we're going to create a service control policy and apply it to our production accounts.

2
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.840
Back in the console, the first thing I need to do is show you how to switch roles so that we're actually

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.930
going to connect in to the production accounts.

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.750
Now I'm going to copy this account number.

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.610
So I'm in organizations.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.740
I've expanded the route here.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.590
We have the production of you and then the production accounts.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.400
And I just want to copy this account number to my clipboard.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.680
And here's a file which is in your course.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.940
Download in the organization's folder and it's called Switch Roles Dot Text.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.240
I'm just going to add this entry into here, so I now have account number and then the account number

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.700
of my account that I want to switch into.

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
And you'll find this file in code organizations switch roles.

14
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.260
The role name is organization account access role, and I've got my display name for that account as

15
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.280
DCT production.

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.480
You can change that if you want.

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.670
So make sure you've got your account number.

18
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.860
We're going to need this to switch roles.

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.710
So back in the console, up in the top right hand corner here, click on us down Arrow and choose Switch

20
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.040
roles at the top.

21
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.590
Here will click on this button Switch Roll Pastebin Account Number.

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.540
Copy the name of our roll paste out in the middle here.

23
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.360
Going to copy the name, the display name and paste that in here and then you can choose a color.

24
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.560
Maybe I'm going to choose red for this one because it's a production accounts.

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.700
I want to be very careful with it, and that's ready.

26
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.000
I can now switch roll.

27
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.250
So we're now locked into the production accounts and we've gained permissions assigned to the role that

28
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.690
we just switched roles with.

29
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.580
And that role has all permissions, so it has full permissions in this account.

30
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.650
Now what I'm going to do is go over to i.am and we're going to create a role.

31
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.140
So let's go to roles, create role.

32
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.880
I'm going to choose the easy to use case.

33
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.930
Click on Next.

34
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.990
And I want to add some permissions, so maybe I'll choose as free and give it as free.

35
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.340
Read only access.

36
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.890
Click on Next Guy to review.

37
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.580
I'll give it a name, deny role, modification test and create the role so that work.

38
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.560
So clearly I have the permissions.

39
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.490
I need to do that.

40
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.110
If I go into the role, I can then add additional permissions.

41
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.600
So maybe I need Dynamo DB.

42
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.310
Full access will attach that policy and that's no problem as well.

43
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.570
So we definitely have the permissions we need to perform those operations.

44
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.430
Now what I'm going to do is copy the and for the role, it's important to copy the role ran, not the

45
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.480
instance profile.

46
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.850
Right now we have this code and what we're going to do is under resource.

47
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.130
We're going to override this iren paste the IRA for our role in there and now we have some JSON code

48
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.840
for our service control policy.

49
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.520
And what this code does is it's a deny policy that's going to deny access to any of these permissions

50
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.500
on this specific resource.

51
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.430
So in other words, we won't be able to attach a role policy.

52
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.320
We won't be able to delete the role.

53
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.900
We won't be able to put a role policy and so on.

54
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.040
So we're going to have a lot of restrictions placed upon us for IAM permissions related to modifying

55
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.580
this role.

56
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.670
So let's copy this information to our clipboard.

57
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.270
We'll come back and we're going to switch back to the management accounts to do that, click on the

58
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.540
down arrow and choose back to and then whatever your username is from the management accounts back in

59
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.210
the management account, I'm going to go over to U.S. organizations in organizations.

60
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.150
Let's click on policies on the left hand side.

61
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.090
You'll see that service control policies are disabled, so let's enable service control policies.

62
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.890
Now you'll notice that the full IWC access policy exists.

63
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.390
That's an IWC managed policy, and it allows access to every operation by the full organization uses

64
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.760
what's called a deny list strategy.

65
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:23.320
That means there's an ACP at the Roots, which flows down to the entire organization and that isn't

66
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.340
allow policy.

67
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.860
You then add your list seeps wherever you need to in the hierarchy.

68
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.190
So if I click on the policy name, scroll down.

69
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.850
You can see that the JSON is an allow for any action, on any resource and on the targets.

70
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.990
You'll see the organization, the organizational unit, production and base, the management account,

71
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.850
as well as the production account.

72
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.910
So let's go up a level to service control policies.

73
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.680
We're going to create a policy.

74
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.470
I'm going to scroll down to where the JSON is.

75
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.140
Let's delete all of this code, paste our code in the includes our ihren.

76
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.970
I'm going to give it a name.

77
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.910
And then come down and create the policy.

78
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.900
So the policy is creative, but it's not attached anyway yet.

79
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.270
So let's go to IWC accounts.

80
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.390
I'm going to choose my production of you, go to policies and then on the right hand side there, click

81
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.110
on Attach and I'm going to attach the deny access to a specific role policy I just created will attach

82
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.170
that policy, and those permissions will now be restricted for any accounts that's in this production.

83
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.060
Oh, you back in IAM?

84
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.920
I'm going to switch accounts again back to DCT production, and here's our role.

85
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.100
So let's go and attach a policy to the role.

86
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.680
Maybe now I need AIDS permissions.

87
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.360
So I'm going to choose Khaled's full access and click on Attach.

88
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.470
And this time it has a words it says you need permissions.

89
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.360
Let's cancel out of there.

90
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.850
Let's try and remove one of these policies.

91
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.560
Again, it's not going to work, so the CCP has now restricted those permissions.

92
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.290
Now, of course, I can create another role.

93
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.210
So let's create another role and just test that it doesn't apply to a different role or choose to allow

94
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.600
administrator access and we'll create the role.

95
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.290
I'm just going to give it the test akpro name and just prove that I can create roles so that worked

96
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.040
successfully.

97
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.460
So really, it's just this specific role because that's the resource specified in the policy for this

98
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.430
specific role.

99
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.420
We cannot modify any permissions, but we can create other roles because we do have IAM permissions.

100
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.120
So that's all I wanted to show you in this lesson.

101
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:52.170
We can go back up to the management accounts and if I switch back to organizations, if you want to

102
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:58.520
detach that policy, you would just go back to policies, choose the policy and then detach.

103
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.250
And that's no longer going to apply to that account.

104
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.080
So you can now delete that role if you want to.
