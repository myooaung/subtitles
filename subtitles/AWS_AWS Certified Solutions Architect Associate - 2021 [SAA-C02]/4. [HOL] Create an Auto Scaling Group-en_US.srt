1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,090
Let's go into a hands on now.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,510
Create a launch template and launch an auto scaling group.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,060
I'm in the easy management console and I've selected the North Virginia region.

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,960
Now, on the left hand side here under instances, I'm going to just scroll down to launch templates

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,980
and I don't have any at the moment, so I'm just going to create a launch template.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,930
I'm going to call it LC one.

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,840
I don't need to give it a version description.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,170
You can choose to have it provide guidance to help you set up a template that you can use with auto

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,630
scaling and that will just filter out some options.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,810
Now I know what to do there, so I'm just going to leave that unchecked now for Amazon machine image.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,400
What we're going to do is select the first option in the list here for the Amazon Linux two Amy, for

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,360
instance, type.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:03,850
I'm going to select to Micro and then for Keeper, I'm going to select the keypad I have for this region,

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,220
which is Cloud Labs Dash and V for VPC.

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,840
We only have one VPC, but we do have a security group called Web Access, and I want to make sure my

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,800
instances all have the web access security group applied to them.

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,070
So I'm going to select that option for storage volumes.

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,330
I'm going to leave the default.

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,340
It's just going to create an eight gigabyte EBS general purpose SSD volume.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,630
I'm not going to tag and I'm not going to add a network interface.

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,400
It will do that automatically for us.

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,610
Then I'm going to click on advanced details.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,230
And this is where you can see there's quite a lot of different options here.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,140
You can request spot instances, add an instance, profile or change the shutdown behavior and so on.

25
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,900
The only thing I want to do is scroll all the way down to the bottom here where we have user data.

26
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,450
Now what I've got here is I've opened up Visual Studio code and I've opened this file, and now this

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,650
is in the course download.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,280
So what you should do is go to the last lesson in section one.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,920
If you don't already have this ready, you'll find a link there to download the course.

30
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,300
Download materials.

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,950
Once you've unzipped your file, you'll have a code directory in that auto scaling and LP and then user

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,840
data easy to assuage.

33
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,010
This user data is going to run as instances launch.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,430
And what it's going to do is it's going to install a web server.

35
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,970
It's going to enable the web server and then it's going to actually find out through the instance metadata,

36
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,080
what availability zone the instance is actually running in.

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,640
Then it's going to echo and it's going to take that variable and put it into the results of what will

38
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,110
actually see is will have an index HDR html file in a bathtub topped up email directory.

39
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,030
So that means all web server is going to display this whenever we connect to the website.

40
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,240
And that file is going to just say this when we display it on the page, it's going to say this EC2

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,660
instance is located in availability zone and then whichever AC is actually located in when we add a

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,320
load balancer later on in this section, this will help us to see how we're cycling through these two

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,050
instances.

44
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:23,920
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy all of this code to my clipboard, come back, paste

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,340
to enter the user data and then create launch templates.

46
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,170
And that's done.

47
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,100
So now let's go back up to the EC2 level, come down to the bottom of the page, and here we can see

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,740
launch configurations and also screening groups.

49
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,510
Now, like I said, launch configs are very becoming deprecated over time.

50
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,250
The launch template is a bit more powerful, so we don't need a launch config.

51
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,830
We just need to create an auto scanning group with our launch template.

52
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,400
So let's create an auto scaling group.

53
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,080
We're going to give this a name.

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,790
I'm just going to call it ASG one.

55
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,660
We're going to select our launch template and we can see a summary of the configuration of that launch

56
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,170
template.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,750
Let's click on next and we can choose the instance purchase options.

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,610
We can either adhere to whatever's specified in the launch template, for instance, on demand versus

59
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,250
spot, or we can combine options here.

60
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,730
Now there you can see you can blend the amount of on demand versus spot instances.

61
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,140
Now we're just going to adhere to the launch templates under VPC.

62
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm going to select subnets now.

63
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:40,030
I want to use public subnets and I'm going to select Availability Zone 1A, 1B and 1C and then click

64
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,570
on next.

65
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,710
Now we could add a load balance, but we're not doing that yet.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,950
We're going to do that later on.

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,710
And you can enable LP health checks, but we don't have a load balancer applied at this stage, so that

68
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,610
doesn't make sense.

69
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,570
And if we wanted to, we could enable that group metrics collection as well.

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,100
So let's go ahead and do that.

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,240
There's no charge for that.

72
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,680
And you get the ISG metrics displayed with one minute granularity.

73
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,750
Let's click on next.

74
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,540
And now we can specify our desired minimum and maximum capacity.

75
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm going to specify the desired as to the minimum as to so I don't want to go below two and the maximum

76
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
is going to be four.

77
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,840
And later on, we'll see how we can scale elastic and dynamically in response to performance data.

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,140
For now, it should just launched two instances.

79
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,150
Let's go down to scaling policies.

80
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,320
We're not going to do this yet.

81
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,180
So we're going to leave it as none.

82
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,920
And let's click on next.

83
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,550
I don't want notifications at this point or tanks, so I can just scroll down to the bottom here.

84
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,100
This is just a summary of what we've configured.

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,820
And let's create auto scaling group so we can see it's gone to the status of updating capacity.

86
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:59,260
And it's showing us the desired is to minimum two max full and we can see the availability zones, which

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,180
instances will be launched in see?

88
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,360
Now we've launched two instances here, so it should put them into different availability zones.

89
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:15,220
If we had over two instances now and we can straightaway see that we have two instances in a pending

90
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,360
state coming back to our auto scaling group.

91
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,060
If you click on the auto scanning group name, you can then go to activity as well.

92
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,300
And here this is a really good place of seeing what's going on so we can see that we have one instance

93
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:39,220
successfully launched and one is pre in-service, so it's on its way to being in service at the top.

94
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,260
Here we can click on automatic scaling.

95
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,940
And this is where we can enable policies.

96
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,610
Now we're going to talk about these in more detail and implement them a bit later on in this section.

97
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,270
But we have dynamic scaling policies, predictive scaling policies and also scheduled actions as well.

98
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,170
On this page, we can perform actions on other instances, such as setting them to stand by detaching

99
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,940
or setting scaling protection.

100
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:10,090
We can configure lifecycle hooks and we can configure what's called a warm pool.

101
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,690
These are pre initialized instances that are sort of ready to go into action when they're needed back

102
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,940
up to the top here under monitoring.

103
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,180
We enabled auto scanning group metrics collection.

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,800
So we should see information about the auto scaling group itself here.

105
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,710
Over time, we'll start seeing some data populates it under two.

106
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,480
These are the metrics from you'll see two instances, so they're not actually doing much at the moment.

107
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,430
So we're not going to see a huge amount of data, but we will later on the last tab at the top here

108
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,800
allows us to refresh all instances.

109
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,320
So that means that we can actually completely replace the instances that are actually in operation at

110
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,770
the moment.

111
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,430
This will reduce the capacity of the auto scanning group, but you can also set a minimum healthy percentage

112
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,820
as well.

113
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,410
So let's just come back up to instances and see how things are going.

114
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,700
These are both now running.

115
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:12,040
So we should also see under activity in our auto scaling group that we have two successful launches.

116
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,950
Now that's all we're going to do at this point in time.

117
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,260
But please leave your resources running.

118
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,980
We're going to work with some of these resources throughout this section.

119
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,490
So it's better to leave them running and continue where we left off.
