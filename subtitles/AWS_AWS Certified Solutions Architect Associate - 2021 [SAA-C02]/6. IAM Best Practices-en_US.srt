00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:02,740
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,150
Another important topic for the exam and just one that you need to know in general for working with

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,490
A.W., US is the I am best practices.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,600
So these are really important to know, not only because they're good Praksis, but in this case because

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,710
they're good for the exam as well as something that can come up on the exam.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,520
So you do need to understand them.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,440
Now the Linkous in the course downloads or you can just search for I am best practices.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,410
And what I'm going to do now is just go back to the slides and go through each of these one by one.

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,860
But it's worth having a read of this whole article because there's a bit more context here that you

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,640
need to understand, I think, for the exam.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,500
So I would just give this a quick read through.

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,750
Shouldn't take you too long.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,990
So the first I am best practice is to lock away your A.W. s account route, user access keys.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,260
So really important.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,410
Remember, you've always got to lock those away.

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,480
They are the keys to the kingdom.

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,440
You do not want people accessing your account using route user access keys.

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,760
If they're compromised, the whole account is compromised until you delete those keys.

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,830
Great individual IAM users.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,620
So remember, this is all about not creating a user account and giving the credentials to multiple people.

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,440
So everyone should have their own individual IAM user account.

22
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,150
And then you give them the permissions they need to do their job.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,030
So use groups to assign permissions to users.

24
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,870
So this means don't apply permissions directly to users.

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:31,830
What you should do is group your users by job rule and then apply the permissions and a policy applied

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,560
to the group.

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,850
That way, it's much more easier for organization.

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,050
Grant Lee's privilege.

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,560
So this is obviously something that you should know, working in I.T. in general.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,830
Never give people more permissions than they need to do their jobs.

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,020
Get started using permissions with a W.S. managed policies.

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,350
So we talked about that earlier in the section A.W. US manage policies are standalone policies that

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,460
are created by a W.S. there in your account already when you create your account and they're pre configured.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,430
So this is an easy way to get started with a W.S..

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,640
It means it's less likely that you're going to make a mistake when creating policies, if you're new

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,810
to creating policies.

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,700
And that caused that mistake could lead to providing more access than you want to.

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,960
You should use customer managed policies instead of inline policies.

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,560
So remember that the A.W., US managed policies and customer managed policies are standalone policies.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,490
So that means they exist independently of the identity.

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,940
The user role or group you attach them to an inline policy is attached directly to an entity like a

42
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,360
user.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,800
So you should avoid unionise as much as possible because it's going to make administration difficult

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,570
to use access levels to review IAM permissions.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,990
Basically means that you just need to keep reviewing your account and making sure that the permissions

46
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:00,110
you've assigned to your users, groups and roles are correct, that you're not giving too much access.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,520
Configure a strong password policy for users.

48
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,170
That's quite self-explanatory.

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,420
You should always try and use a strong password policy so that the passwords aren't easy to guess.

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,830
Enabling multifactor authentication is important.

51
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,930
They used to say just for the rude account.

52
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,180
Then they said just for privileged users.

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,040
Now they just say enable Amethi.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,910
So very simple, enable it for everybody, use rolls for applications that run on easy two instances.

55
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:35,770
So we've seen what happens if you use a W.S. Configure to create a credentials file on your AC2 instance.

56
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,310
The access key I.D. and the Secret Access Key are stored in plain text on your AC2 instance.

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,070
So that's not very good from a security perspective.

58
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,170
Much better to use a role to give your AC to applications the privileges they need.

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,300
Use rolls to delegate permissions.

60
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,200
So that's exactly what we're talking about there.

61
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,370
You should use roles to delegate permissions rather than embedding things in your E.S. two instances

62
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,750
or in your code somewhere.

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,370
So don't embed access key I.D. and secret access keys in your code.

64
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,060
Use rolls instead because they use temporary security credentials.

65
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,500
So it's much more secure.

66
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,310
Never share access keys.

67
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,370
So again, that's quite self-explanatory.

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,820
It's basically saying these are very security sensitive things.

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,360
Don't share them around and rotate your credentials regularly.

70
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,470
So those access keys.

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,490
Make sure you regularly rotate them in case I compromised and always remove unnecessary credentials.

72
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,580
So I don't have any more credentials than you actually need.

73
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,440
Use policy conditions for extra security is about adding conditions into your policy.

74
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,430
For instance, we saw a policy earlier in the section where there was a condition for the source IP

75
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,830
address, and it basically meant that the policy would only apply if the IP address that you were connecting

76
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,210
from was a certain value.

77
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,150
So if you weren't using the machine that had that IP address, the policy would deny your access monitor

78
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,100
activity in your A.W. account.

79
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,830
Again, quite self-explanatory.

80
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,790
You just need to monitor what's going on in your account to see if anything is happening that shouldn't

81
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,000
be.

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,580
So that's it for that I am best practices.

83
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,140
Again, I would recommend that you go back to that Web page that I showed you and just read through

84
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,650
these and make sure you understand them.
