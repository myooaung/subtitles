00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.920
Welcome to another hands on lab.

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.100
So in this lab, what we're going to do is create an IWC global accelerator and we're going to create

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.090
two instances of an application in two different regions and then direct some traffic and see what happens.

4
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.790
So what we're going to create is very much like what you see here will actually create a region in US

5
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.000
East.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.160
One with an Albi will create a region in AP, Southeast two with an LP.

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.700
And behind each of those albums will just be a single, easy to instance with an FTP website, running

8
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.110
will then create a global accelerator with the two regions attached.

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.970
And then we're going to connect to it now.

10
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.970
I'm actually in Australia, so I'll be connecting to it from Australia.

11
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.540
So what I should say is I've got directed to AP selfies too, and then we're going to cause a failure

12
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.490
and we're going to see if we get directed all the way over to us S1 automatically.

13
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.780
So that's how it works.

14
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.750
And optionally, you can also use Route 50 free.

15
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.340
You don't need to for this lab.

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.930
It doesn't make a huge amount of difference.

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.230
We can just use the DNS name with the global accelerator.

18
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.300
But if you want to, you can also create a entry if you already have a hosted zone.

19
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.860
So just create an alias record like we did in the Ailbhe and NHLBI lessons and pointed instead to a

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.650
global accelerator rather than a load balancer.

21
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.970
So this is what we're going to do.

22
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.370
Let's head over to the console and start building it out.

23
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.830
I'm in the easy to management console in Norfolk, Virginia, and what I'm going to do is launch an

24
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.370
instance.

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.770
As always, it's going to be a Linux two, am I?

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.580
I'm going to use a T2 Micro.

27
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.640
Now what you do need to do is I'm happy with the D4 VPC.

28
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.140
We don't need to change anything there.

29
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.450
I'm just going to come down to I am roll.

30
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.210
We've got this S3 read only role that we used earlier, and we're going to use some user data again.

31
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.850
So as we before, this is the stuff that we use from the Route 50 free section of the course.

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.410
So go into your course.

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.580
Download code about 50 free user data, around 50 free, and the only thing you need to modify is this

34
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.010
Hey, you need to make sure that you change your bucket.

35
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.800
So here are my buckets called DCT labs.

36
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.690
You need to change your bucket names or whatever you created back in that section and make sure you've

37
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.620
still got that index locked 60fps on in that all from the course download.

38
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.450
So let's copy this code.

39
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.460
Come back, paste the code in and click on next.

40
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.940
We need to make sure we have a security grade we've poor open.

41
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.830
I'm just going to call this web access, and let's add a rule for HTP and that's going to come from

42
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.280
anywhere.

43
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.130
So that's good.

44
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.750
And I'll just copy this for making it neat and tidy, and then let's just review and launch and launch

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.500
this instance.

46
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.280
That's the instance being launched.

47
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.160
Now let's head down to load balancers, and we're going to try to load Balancer.

48
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.750
I'm going to create load balancer.

49
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.820
It's going to be application load balancer.

50
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.220
I'll call it my Albi.

51
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.120
It needs to have a HTTP listener.

52
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.780
So we just accept the defaults.

53
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.710
I'm not sure which availability zone instances in.

54
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.980
So I'm just going to have all of these in, and it's only one subnet in the default VPC in each of these

55
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.060
availability zones.

56
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.200
So that's all fine.

57
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.620
Now we can actually create the accelerator right here.

58
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.110
So let's just choose create an accelerator, and I'm going to call this my guy.

59
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.310
Let's click on next.

60
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.610
Go through the security and make sure we choose that web access security group under routing.

61
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.370
We're going to create a new target group called Tag One.

62
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.430
If you already have one in this region, then just call it something else and you can see that we've

63
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.370
got the protocol selected as HTTP or 18.

64
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.060
That's all good.

65
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.980
No need to change anything there.

66
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.710
I will change the health check settings.

67
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.610
Now, the healthy threshold is the number of successful responses to a health check request that are

68
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.160
required before the incidence is considered healthy.

69
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.660
I want to speed things up.

70
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.040
I'm going to put that to two and the interval is going to be 10 seconds.

71
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.970
Unhealthy threshold is two as well.

72
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.530
That's fine.

73
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.880
Let's click on next.

74
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.790
And here we can see we have a target.

75
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.430
If we select it, click Add to registered and it should pop on to the the box at the top here.

76
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.280
And then let's go through and create the load balancer.

77
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.790
So that's good, and we're going to do the same in another site in a moment.

78
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.020
Now allow us to just check that my instance is successfully working.

79
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.420
So let's just copy this public IP address.

80
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.080
And what we're going to do is just check that we can access the web page and it's been generated successfully.

81
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.690
So we know that the code worked.

82
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.700
It loaded the website and configured this page for us, and we can see that this particular instance

83
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.190
is running in US East one e.

84
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.130
So if we come back to two, we should find if we go to target groups that we've got a healthy instance

85
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.030
and we do.

86
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.210
And so our load balances should now also be working and we should be able to connect to the DNS name

87
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.170
of the load balancer.

88
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.760
So again, let's check that out.

89
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.120
And yes, that works was still going, it's not easy to instance.

90
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.870
So now let's set up our second site for this.

91
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.130
We're going to head to Sydney.

92
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.370
Now you can use a region that's closest to you.

93
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.370
I'm just using one that's closest to me, Amazon, and it's to teach you my cry again.

94
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.340
Make sure you change your eye and roll, paste your user data and then it's click through to security

95
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.700
group.

96
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.130
Again, we need to make sure we've got a security group.

97
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.330
We don't have one here, so let's create one called web access.

98
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.910
And then we're just going to add that rule for FTP, and that's coming from anywhere.

99
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.680
That's great.

100
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.970
And it's go through launch the instance.

101
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.900
In this case, I don't have a keeper, so I'm just going to call this one.

102
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.270
That's what they the KP Dash, MGM see.

103
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.200
So I know which accounts it's from and it's launch those instances.

104
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.120
So just one instance, actually.

105
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.740
So we've got that instance.

106
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.110
Let's come down to low balances.

107
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.740
Try to load balancer application load balancer.

108
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.740
Call it my Albi.

109
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.310
Same thing.

110
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.670
We're going to enable the availability zones or the ones we have ATP protocol.

111
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.540
That's all good.

112
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.220
We've already got a global accelerator.

113
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.510
We don't need to create another one.

114
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.220
Let's click on next.

115
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.160
Go through the security, select our security group, get a routing new target group TG one again.

116
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.470
We leave all the defaults there, and I'm just going to change these health checks settings reduce my

117
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.390
healthy threshold to two, my interval to 10 registered targets.

118
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.580
We've got a target here.

119
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.130
Let's select it as a registered and then go through and create the load balancer.

120
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.120
So that looks good.

121
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.650
Let's come back up.

122
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.580
I want to test my instance again, so let's just copy it.

123
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:03.260
So I p paste that into our browser and we've got an instance in AP selfies to be and then I want to

124
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.760
do the same of my load balancer.

125
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.290
But it's still provisioning, so I'll give it a minute or two and then that should be provisioned shortly.

126
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:16.130
Now, while that's happening, we can go to Global Accelerator, so let's search for global accelerator.

127
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.340
Open this console and we can see that we have a global accelerator called my G8.

128
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.880
We can see it static IP addresses and also its DNS name, and it's deployed.

129
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.090
Let's click on the name on the left here and now you see a bit more information and you can see the

130
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.540
listener.

131
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.570
So we've got a listener on Port 80 and we have an endpoint group for us East one, so that's where we

132
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.590
already have a instance running behind a load balance, and that's healthy.

133
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.170
So let's actually go into the listener.

134
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.440
And what we want to do is add an endpoint group.

135
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.200
You can see at the moment we've got one endpoint group for us East one and the traffic dollars 100 percent.

136
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.990
So you can play around with weightings using these traffic doubles to send certain volumes of traffic

137
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.700
to one region or another.

138
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.250
We're going to add an endpoint group.

139
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.480
We're going to choose the region in this case.

140
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.060
For me, it's AP Southeast two for you.

141
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.600
It's whichever region you deployed your second instance into.

142
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.210
I'm going to leave the traffic dial as it is.

143
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.590
Click on next.

144
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.760
And that's safe.

145
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.150
So we now have multiple endpoints configured to go back up to our listener.

146
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.460
Let's just have a look at the status.

147
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.040
It says that all healthy.

148
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.940
So what I'm going to do is copy this DNS name.

149
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.220
This is the DNS name for global accelerator.

150
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.130
This DNS name will resolve to these static and cast IP addresses.

151
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.180
Let's put this into a browser, and let's hit it.

152
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.850
Now I've been directed to us East eight, but I'm in Australia, so that's a long way from where I am.

153
00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:00.590
So I suspect that that just means that we don't actually have endpoint fully ready yet for the app southeast

154
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.220
to region.

155
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.370
So what I'm going to do is give it a minute and then we're going to try again.

156
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.210
So I'm giving it a minute, and it still seems to be directed me to us each one.

157
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.490
So sometimes it will just stick you to wherever you resolve to as long as that endpoint is healthy.

158
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.760
Now what I want to do now is actually simulate a failure.

159
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.300
So what we're going to do is back in North Virginia here, I'm going to go to security groups, choose

160
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.540
the security group associated with my default VPC, the one that I just created for this particular

161
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.260
exercise.

162
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.850
So that should be this one here.

163
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.650
I'm going to edit inbound rules.

164
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.960
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to remove this rule that allows HTP using IPV four months

165
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.070
will remove that one as well.

166
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.110
So that's to save those rules.

167
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:51.470
Let's go down to target groups, and what we should find is that our target becomes unhealthy fairly

168
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.890
quickly.

169
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:58.550
So we set an unhealthy threshold to two and the interval to ten seconds.

170
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.840
So within the next 30 seconds or so, we should find that this turns unhealthy.

171
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.200
That instance is now showing as unhealthy because the health checks have failed because the port is

172
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.960
not open, so let's go back and see if we can connect to a different global accelerator endpoint.

173
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.310
I've just hit refresh.

174
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.710
And as you can see, there's nothing on my screen.

175
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.820
It's literally just hanging.

176
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:24.340
So this means that even though the target group has an unhealthy incidence, which means the load balancer

177
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.180
isn't going to be directing traffic to it, it seems global accelerates.

178
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.230
It's not aware of that yet.

179
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:35.170
So we need global accelerator to pick that change up, and then it will start directing us to the other

180
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.530
site.

181
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:36.820
So let's try that again.

182
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:44.980
And now we do get redirected to the instance in AP selfies to be so I can take a little bit of time

183
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.050
to file over, which is why you do need to make sure you configure your health checks properly.

184
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:59.530
So we have the listener here, we have the endpoints for each of our regions and if we go into the endpoints,

185
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.760
click on Edit.

186
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.030
You'll see we did have some health check information here as well.

187
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.390
So again, we've got a health check interval here.

188
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.920
You can play around with that.

189
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.560
You've got the health check for your target behind your application load balancer and then you've got

190
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.580
the health check here.

191
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:21.490
So you need to make sure you configure your insulin and your threshold counts accordingly to make sure

192
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.590
that your applications can file over quickly.

193
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.450
So that's it.

194
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.880
We've finished in this lesson, and all we need to do now is go in and delete our global accelerator,

195
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.750
click on Delete.

196
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.850
What you have to do is disable the accelerator and then you need to wait for several minutes.

197
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.170
Once it's disabled, you can then type, delete and delete your accelerator.

198
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.780
So that's my accelerator disabled.

199
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:49.320
I'm just going to type, delete and delete, and that will be deleted for me.

200
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:55.600
And the only thing to do now is make sure you go back in and delete your application, load balancers

201
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.110
and terminate your instances and then you'll be all cleaned up.
