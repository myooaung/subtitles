00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,040
Hi, guys, there's an exam crime lesson for most sections in this course, so I just want to explain

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,150
quickly what they are before we get started.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,940
Exam crimes are a quick run through of important facts, and I will go quite quickly.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,270
You can always change the playback speed if I'm too fast for you.

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,920
You should use these after going through the section for revision and cramming.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,060
Mainly, I'm going to be reminding you about things rather than explaining.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,850
Now that being said, there may be some facts that are covered here that weren't covered in the lessons

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,110
or vice versa.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,020
Some topics are quite suitable for this bullet point format, and I prefer to keep it as visual as possible

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,440
and as engaging as possible throughout the main lessons in the course.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,530
Now, most lessons in this course are highly visual, but exam crimes are absolutely not violent death

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,460
by bullet points.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,610
I deliberately make sure that I have everyone covered.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,940
No matter what your learning style is, some people are more visual.

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,590
Some people like to read and some people hands on is the most important way to learn.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,130
So whatever way you learn best, you're covered in this course.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,180
And exam crimes are an additional tool which is going to be useful for most people.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,750
This entire slide back is offered for download with a white background so suitable for printing as well,

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,800
so you might want to print it out and then just keep it as a reference so you can remind yourself of

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,460
certain things.

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,670
Make sure you also use the cheat sheets.

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,280
That's another place where there's some important information.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,890
I haven't put everything into the exam crimes.

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,120
They would just get too long.

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:39,950
So let's get started with the exam cram for I am I am is used to security, control individual and group

26
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,990
access to AWG resources.

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,050
It makes it easy to provide multiple users with access to resources and with IAM.

28
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,050
You can manage users groups, access policies and roles and also user credentials.

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,090
User password policies can be configured in IAM as well.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,890
We can also enable multifactor authentication, and that's definitely recommended.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,630
We can also generate API keys for programmatic access to IAM.

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,880
By default, all new uses are created with no access to any services they can only log into IWC, but

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,470
they can't actually do anything.

34
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,040
Permissions must then be explicitly granted to allow users to access an IWC service.

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,190
I am uses are the individuals who've been granted access to an AWB accounts.

36
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,740
Now I am is a universal or global service, so it doesn't apply to specific regions.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,450
I am is eventually consistent.

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,470
What that means is if you make a change and then you immediately try to read from IAM, you might not

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,250
see that change.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,670
It might just take a bit longer for forensics and methods.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,520
We've got console passwords for logging into the management console, access keys for programmatic access

42
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,300
service certificates, which can be used for some services as well.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,630
I am users are the entities that represent a person or a service.

44
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,870
By default, they cannot access anything in the account.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,640
The root user credentials are the email address used to create the accounts.

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,490
And there's a password associated with that account.

47
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,440
The root account has full administrative permissions, and they cannot be restricted.

48
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,640
I am users can be created to represent applications, and those are known then as service accounts.

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,780
You can have up to 5000 users per IWC account.

50
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,500
I am groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them.

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,680
A group's not an identity in itself, so it can't be identified as a principle in a policy.

52
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,680
So where you have a policy statement and you put in the R.N of a principle like a user, you can't do

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,310
that with a group.

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,460
You use groups to assign permissions to users, and you should always follow the principle of least

55
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,590
privilege when assigning permissions.

56
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,800
You can't newsgroups, so you can't create a group within a group.

57
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,700
I am.

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,780
Roles are created and then assumed by trusted entities.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,880
And there a way of delegating permissions to resources for users and services.

60
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,690
Users and services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials, and those are issued

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,750
by the Security Token Service to SDS service.

62
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,770
I am.

63
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:30,550
Policies are documents that define the permissions and they can be applied to users groups and roles

64
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,630
and include key value pairs that consist of an attribute and a value.

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,230
All permissions are implicitly denied by default.

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,450
The most restrictive policy is applied if there's multiple policies with conflicting statements.

67
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,640
Now what are the types of policy?

68
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,440
We've got identity based policies which you can attach to users groups or roles.

69
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,630
We've got resource based policies.

70
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,020
They get attached to resources like S3 buckets, and you can define permissions for principals accessing

71
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,090
the resources using a resource policy.

72
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,340
We then got permissions boundaries.

73
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,880
These set the maximum permissions that an identity based policy can grant to an IAM entity.

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,960
Permissions Boundaries aren't really covered at the associate level, but they are at the professional

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,260
level.

76
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,880
We then have organizations service control policies, these specify the maximum permissions for an organization

77
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,900
or in view.

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,940
And lastly, we have session policies that are used with assume role API actions.

79
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,180
Now onto the IAM best practices, lock away your account route user access keys.

80
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,900
Create individual users use groups to assign permissions to users, grant lease privilege, get started

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,590
using permissions with AWB, manage policies and use customer managed policies instead of in line policies.

82
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:54,100
Use access levels to review I am permissions always bearing in mind that list privilege and configure

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,440
a strong password policy for your users.

84
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,350
Enable multi-factor authentication.

85
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,890
Use roles for applications that run on easy to instances and use roles to delegate permissions.

86
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,350
Do not share access keys.

87
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:14,020
Always keep them to yourself and use them only for your accounts and wroteI or credentials regularly

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,110
and remove any unnecessary credentials.

89
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,390
You can use policy conditions for extra security when you're writing your own policies.

90
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,040
And lastly, monitor activity in your account to see what's actually happening.

91
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,040
And that's it for this exam crime.
