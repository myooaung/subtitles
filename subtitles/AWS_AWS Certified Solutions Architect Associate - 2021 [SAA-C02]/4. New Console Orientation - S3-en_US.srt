00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,740
Hi, guys, this is a quick orientation video to show you around the new S3 management console.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,180
Now, at this point in time, the changes are ongoing, but I wanted to record this video just to help

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,540
you to navigate around the console.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,760
So I'm in the console here.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,080
And what you'll notice, I've got a bucket and this one is a public bucket.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,720
Let's just go into the bucket.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,260
Now, here you'll find that things are very similar and other properties you can enable versioning.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,700
It's enabled for this bucket.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,430
Select tags, set your encryption.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:41,000
I've enabled encryption for this bucket, set up intelligent sharing server access, logging cloud data

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,480
events, event notifications, transfer acceleration, object log request lipase and static website

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:47,930
hastings'.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,290
And that's all under this menu properties.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,070
You've then got permissions.

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,430
So here we've got block public access.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,430
In this case I've turned blocked public access off.

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,250
So this is a public bucket.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,980
You apply your policies here when you apply a policy.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,780
An interesting thing to note is there's now a nice little tap there where you can just copy your ayran

20
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,160
so that you can then paste it into the policy edits at all.

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,480
You can get some policy examples and use a policy generator as well.

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,450
Under the bucket policy, you can set objects ownership, configure Ackles, in this case, openable

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,650
public access for list and read and you can set course settings as well.

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,200
On the metrics page, you can see some information about the bucket.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,430
This is a brand new bucket, so there's no data to see here.

26
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,080
Under management.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,650
We then have the lifecycle rules and the replication rules.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,590
So lifecycle would be, you know, what you want to do in terms of moving your data between different

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,640
storage classes.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,520
Replication rules are where you then create your replication between buckets.

31
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,240
So Eve across region or single region replication.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,060
And this particular menu is fairly straightforward to follow.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
And we'll be doing this later on in the section.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,220
Now, let's go back to the main page.

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,560
And what I want to show you is what it's like creating a bucket now because the menu is slightly different.

36
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,870
So when we create bucket, we give it a name.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,480
I'm just going to call this orientation test DCT too, and then you select your region as normal.

38
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,040
Now, this is a new feature.

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,600
You can now choose a bucket.

40
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,490
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the settings from this other bucket.

41
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:31,640
Now, note before I do that, that block public access is off, versioning of encryption is off.

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,630
But I want to copy the settings from my other bucket, so I'm able to do that here.

43
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,370
So that's quite a handy little feature and that's changed the settings for my bucket.

44
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,750
And that's all.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,780
We can then go down and make an override the settings if we like, or just accept those and create the

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,170
bucket.

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,760
In this case, I have to acknowledge that the settings are going to enable public access and then create

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,110
a bucket.

49
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,810
So that's bucket creation.

50
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,020
Now let's go into a bucket and we can upload an object.

51
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,170
You can actually drag and drop files straight onto this interface or click add files or add folder.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,390
Let's add a couple of files and we can see a summary of where the objects are going to be uploaded.

53
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,730
So this is the destination bucket and then what the versioning encryption and object lock statuses.

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,240
You can then also expand for additional options where you can choose storage class, service side settings,

55
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,600
ECLSS settings, object lock tags and metadata.

56
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
So, you know, these aren't new settings.

57
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,530
These are the same settings that we had before.

58
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,540
It's just a slightly different interface.

59
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,200
So it's click on upload and those files are now uploaded.

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,730
At this point, it's sometimes not obvious, but you have to go up to the top right hand corner here

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,770
and click on exit and then it takes you actually back to the bucket and the main navigation page.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,470
That's all I wanted to show you in this video.

63
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,050
There are some new features, but mainly it's just different menus for creating buckets and uploading

64
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,560
objects.

65
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,760
So I hope that is useful.

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,170
I'll see you in the next lesson.
