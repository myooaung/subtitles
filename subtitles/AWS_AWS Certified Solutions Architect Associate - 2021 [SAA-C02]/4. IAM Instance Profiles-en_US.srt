00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,540
I am instance profiles are something that you definitely need to know for the exam.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,730
They come up in a few questions here and there.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,790
So we've used Encinas profiles quite a lot in this course with our AC two instances to give them the

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,600
permissions they need for certain scenarios.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,140
Now, an instance profile is a container for an I am role that you can use to pass roll information

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,730
to an easy to instance.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,540
When the incident starts, an instance profile can contain only one I am role and are although a role

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,210
can be included in multiple instance profiles.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,310
Now this is what it looks like.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,770
So you have your easy to instance and there's an instance profile within that instance.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,100
And that's what has the I am role attached to it.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:54,570
So when your application needs permissions, for instance, to talk to S free, it speaks to the instance

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,450
profile, gets the keys that it needs to then access asri.

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,300
Now you can use some CLIA commands to work with innocense profile.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,130
So we're going to do that in this lesson.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,290
So we've got the crate instance profile command at a role to an instance profile.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,410
We can list our instance profiles and so on.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,510
So let's head over to the console.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,150
And first off, I just want to show you where instant profiles are in the EU management console.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,550
So I'm on the AWB management console.

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,940
I said, oh, it's easy to.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm going to launch an instance where I'm gonna start the launch.

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,470
Wizzit click, select, click next.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,720
And then here we have I am wrong.

25
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,550
So if I click the arrow, then I can see that I have several roles here.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,490
So these are instant profiles.

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,690
And what happens is each of these has a role attached to it.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,450
And so this is an instance profile.

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,140
It has a role attached to it.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,790
And then you attach the instance profile to the instance.

31
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,130
So let's go to the command line and we're going to create a new instance profile from the command line.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,690
So before we head to the command line, I just want to show you a file, which I've got.

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,090
And this is the commands that we're going to run.

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,270
So we can run each of these commands, create instance profile, add roll to instance profile and then

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,820
to delete it.

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,980
You have to remove the role from the instance profile and then delete the instance profile.

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,780
So let's head up into the command line.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,320
And actually the first thing I can do is run a W.S., I am list instance profiles.

39
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,460
And so we should now see a whole list of profiles and you'll see the name of these actually matches,

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,130
the instance profiles that you saw in the console.

41
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,190
So we've got each of these instance profiles.

42
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,900
We've got the ones you're very familiar with, the S3 full access, the S3, READ-ONLY and so on.

43
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,270
So those are the profiles that exist at the moment.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,600
So let's take our first command and it's going to create a profile called my test instance profile.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,840
So let's head over and paste it in and hit enter.

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,610
And that was very quick.

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,860
So now let's go back to the console.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,210
And if we just reopen so refresh the wizard, we should now see that we have my test instance profile.

49
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,980
So that's great.

50
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,430
But it doesn't actually have a role.

51
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,800
So you can see if you try and use it, it says that it doesn't actually have an associated I am wrong.

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,640
So back in our commands, I'm going to copy this next command, which is going to add an I am role and

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,370
it's gonna be the S3 read only access role.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,890
So I paste that in and that's been created.

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,000
And now if we head over and I'll just refresh by starting the wizard again and this time I should be

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,780
at a select the my test instance profile and I don't get an error.

57
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,710
So we actually now have an instance profile with a role attached to it.

58
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,820
So that's great.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,370
But now that I finished with it, I want to delete it.

60
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,550
So what you can do then is you have to come in and remove the role from the instance profile.

61
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:58,050
So you run this command and that's complete and then you can come back and delete the instance profile

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
with this command.

63
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,660
So that should now be deleted.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,480
And if we go back in and have a look again.

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,700
And now our instance profile is gone.

66
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,990
So that's just to help you understand incidence profiles a bit better because they can come up in the

67
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,910
old exam question.
