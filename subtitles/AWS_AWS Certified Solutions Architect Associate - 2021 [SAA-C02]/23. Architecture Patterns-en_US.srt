00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:05,670
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,250
Welcome to another architectural patterns, and this time it's Amazon virtual private cloud.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,770
So let's have a look at our first requirement.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:21,020
An Amazon S3 bucket must only allow access from two instances in a private subnet using private eyepiece.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,110
Well, in that case, you can create a VPC endpoint and configure a bucket policy that restricts access

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,800
to the VPC Endpoint ID using the condition elements.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:39,360
Malicious traffic is reaching some EC2 instances in a public subnet from a few identified public IP

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,930
addresses.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,410
Well, in that case, the best way to handle this is to use a network ICL to deny access based on the

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,670
source IP addresses.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,530
Of course, you could use the web application firewall WAF as well, which we cover later in the course,

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,000
but that might be more costly, so this is an easy way to implement this very quickly.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,520
A company wants to connect their on premises data center to IWC and requires consistent performance

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,810
and encryption.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,340
Well, remember you don't get consistent performance over the internet.

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,370
That's never the case.

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,250
So you need a direct connect connection, but you can't get encryption on a direct connect connection,

18
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,820
so you have to run a site to site VPN over the top.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,350
A company requires private connectivity between sees in different regions with full redundancy.

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,290
Well, you can try to VPC pairing connection between the sees, and that gives you that private connectivity

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,470
and it can be across accounts and across regions.

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,730
Several remote office locations should be connected to an Amazon PPC and to each other over the internet

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,110
with full encryption.

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,430
Well, in that case, you can create a VPN and attach multiple remote locations in a hub and spoke topology,

25
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:59,570
and that's an IWC cloud hub topology, and they get to route between themselves as well as into an ounce

26
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,410
of the BPC.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,350
Micro Services app requires instance level firewall with different rules per application component.

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,460
Classic case for security groups for each application component.

29
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,520
And you just need to make sure you configure the appropriate rules.

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,260
A company is using IPv6 addresses with Amazon easy to a needs to enable outbound internet connectivity.

31
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,830
Well, in that case, rather than a internet gateway, you need an egress only internet gateway that's

32
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,880
for IPv6.

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,310
A subnet must be configured that allows internet connectivity using IPv4.

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,320
We've also address assignment.

35
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,620
Well, in that case, you should attach an internet gateway to the.

36
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,730
Update the roundtable table for the new subnet and then enable the auto assigned public IPv4 setting

37
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,780
for the subnet as well.

38
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:57,820
And on premises data center needs to establish site to site VPN connections to several VPNs and a full

39
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,080
mesh architecture.

40
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,980
Well, then you might want to deploy an eight U.S. transit gateway.

41
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,550
Attach the VPN connection from the on premises and then attach it also to each VPC.

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,920
And that will give you that full mesh architecture.

43
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,050
And it's a very simple way of implementing this topology, and that's it for this architecture patterns.
