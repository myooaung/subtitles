00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,290
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,620
This is a lesson on the AWS global infrastructure.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,400
So in this lesson this is purely going to be theory.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,910
I'm not actually going to take you into the console and show you any of this at this stage but what

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,840
I will do after this slide the next are gonna be visually based.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,850
So want to keep things visual as much as possible in this course but just need to go over a few facts

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,670
with you before I get to that.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,990
So these are some of the components of the AWS global infrastructure.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,640
The most important ones you need to know at this stage.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,800
So there's a region and a region is a geographical area with at least two Availability Zones in it and

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,060
each region is isolated from other AWS regions.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,780
And there's about 23 of them around the world at the moment.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,380
And that changes all the time.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,290
So by the time you watch this you may find that there's you know 24 or 25 or more so don't quote me

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,250
on the exact number.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,730
Have a look for yourself.

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,410
I'll provide some links as well in the course download so you'll be out to go and have a look.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,620
We then have Availability Zones.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,680
So as I mentioned a region will have at least two Availability Zones within it.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,970
Sometimes they have five or more an availability zone actually is comprised of one or more data centers

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,260
and these are physically separated from other Availability Zones.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,070
So you can consider each availability zone as being isolated from other Availability Zones.

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:33,320
That being said they're connected with low latency highly available high bandwidth links.

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,430
So what you can do with Availability Zones is deploy your resources within a region but into separate

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,540
Availability Zones for high availability and redundancy.

26
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,000
And that means if there's an outage or one availability zone your resources in the other one aren't

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,920
affected and you've got networking connectivity between all of the AZs as well.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,360
We then have edge locations and regional edge caches.

29
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:05,060
Now these are both part of the cloud front network cloud front is all about caching content and it caches

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:13,150
content around the world and a lot of locations and those kind of locations are closer to your users.

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,550
So the idea is to reduce latency when accessing cached content.

32
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,420
There are two concepts here, the edge location and the regional edge cache with the edge location

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,530
there is about 176 of those at the moment around the world.

34
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,180
And with the regional edge caches there's about 11 and they're just a bit bigger they have a bigger

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:40,700
cache bandwidth and they're set between the services that you have in a AWS and the edge locations

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,750
themselves.

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,610
So you don't need to know any more about those at this stage you really just need to understand what

38
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,810
are the constructs of the global infrastructure.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,700
So this is what makes up  AWS, of course there's a global network.

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:00,560
And this is a private global network which AWS manage its highly available, its low latency, and..

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,090
it interconnects every datacenter availability zone and a AWS region.

42
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,630
Let's have a look at a slide now with a bit more information about regions in this slide you can see

43
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:18,190
three regions one's in U.S. East one, one's in EU West one and the other is an AP Southeast-2.

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,210
These are actually Norfolk Virginia, Dublin in Ireland and Sydney in Australia.

45
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,880
In this diagram each region has three availability zones.

46
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,840
In reality they might have more or less but they'll have at least two and they might have five or more.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,930
Each region is completely independent however they're all connected by this global network which is

48
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,830
a private global network managed by AWS which has high bandwidth low latency and is fully redundant.

49
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,020
Regions enable you to deploy your resources in whatever location is closest to you.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,770
So for instance for me I'm in Australia so it makes most sense for me if my customers are also in Australia

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,890
to use this region.

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,850
However if I have a business that runs straight out of North America I might just choose to use U.S.

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,400
East one and deploy my resources here.

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
This slide shows the current state of regions around the world.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,450
The red ones are new ones which will be coming online soon and the remainder of all existing regions

56
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,920
on this slide we have regional edge caches and edge locations.

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,510
As I mentioned these are all over the world and there are currently 176 of them.

58
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,280
Your users therefore can be around the world and the location should be close to your users.

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,630
And that means a shorter network distance and therefore lower licensee for your applications and you

60
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,940
might use this for storing media or web files.

61
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,650
And in this case for instance we have Amazon EC2.

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,450
Perhaps this is a web server running on the elastic compute cloud up Amazon S3 which is object storage

63
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,560
so you could have media files for instance on here and the locations enable you to cache those objects

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,430
closer to your users the regional edge caches set between the locations and these origins.

65
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,110
Now you don't need to know any more than that at this stage we'll go through a lab later in this course

66
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,180
and I'll show you in detail how cloud front works.

67
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,530
This diagram just shows you the edge locations around the world today with all the blue are existing

68
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,900
locations where it's purple.

69
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,180
It means that there's multiple locations in that region and then these big circles with the orange Rim

70
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,680
Regional edge caches.

71
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,220
That's it for this lesson guys.

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,880
I just wanted to take you through with a high level what the AWS global infrastructure is in the next

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,420
lab.

74
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,580
We're going to discuss virtual private cloud.
