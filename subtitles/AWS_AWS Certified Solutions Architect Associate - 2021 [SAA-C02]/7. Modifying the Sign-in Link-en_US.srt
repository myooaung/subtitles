Hi guys.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,520
If you followed through the previous lab you should be logged into the AWS management console with your

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,950
new AWS free tier account.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,020
Now what we're going to do in this lab is going to be very very simple quick lab just to modify the

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,690
sign in link and that is the U.R.L. that users will use to log into your AWS account and you can modify

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,170
that to be a bit more user friendly.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,270
Now the way we find services in the management console is even you can choose the fine services option

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,830
here and you can put in the name of the service or just click with your left mouse button and then you

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,220
can scroll down and see all the different services.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,150
Alternatively you can go to the services menu at the top here and then you get a list of all IAM services

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,620
organized into categories.

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,620
You can also search again in the bar at the top end.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,680
Now the service that we want to use is called Identity and Access Management or IAM often known as

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,640
"I am" and this is under the security identity and compliance category.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,530
So I'm just gonna choose IAM.

16
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,170
We're now in the IAM dashboard and you can see at the top here we have the IAM users sign and link and

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,210
this is composed of the account number dot sign in dot AWS dot Amazon dot com slash console.

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,690
So users can use this to log in but what we can do is we can actually modify this sign and link so that

19
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:40,870
this section the account number is replaced by another value that we want to assign.

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,840
The way we customize this is by choosing the button customize.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,820
And then we just type in the alias that we'd like to use.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm going to call this DCTLabs and I choose yes create.

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Now this does need to be unique.

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,240
So you need to make sure that you've chosen a name that isn't already used and that's all we need to

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,220
do for now when we create an IAM user.

26
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,300
And we actually log in with a user account rather than the root account we'll actually be able to assign

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,450
this alias as the account name when we sign in.

28
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,880
So that's it for now guys.

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,440
In the next lab we're going to set up a billing alarm to make sure you don't get any surprise bills.
