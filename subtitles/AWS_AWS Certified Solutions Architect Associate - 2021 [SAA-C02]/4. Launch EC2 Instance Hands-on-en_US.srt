1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,780
Hi and welcome to this lesson.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,070
So in this lesson, what we're going to do is we're going to do some hands on, we're going to launch

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,770
an easy instance in a public subnet.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,090
So let's just have a look at how this works.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,970
So remember, Ishita is a regional service, so we're going to deploy within a region.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,200
We need to choose the region where we want to deploy are easy to instance.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,550
We're in a region.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,610
We have a VPC, which, as you know, is a logical boundary in which we can create our own resources,

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,280
we can create our subnets within a VPC and then launch our resources within those subnets.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,790
So that's the next thing.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,120
Now, in this case, just depicted here, you can see one availability zone with two subnets.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,610
Of course, there are multiple availability zones in every region, but this is just to make things

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,030
simple.

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,470
So within our availability zone, we have a public subnet and we have a private subnet.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,930
So remember, the key difference being that with a public subnet, instances receive public IP addresses.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,130
So we're going to launch an easy to instant's into a public subnet because it's a public subnet.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,700
That instance will pick up a public IP addresses, so they're automatically assigned to instances that

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,080
are launched in the public subnet.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,070
Now, the other thing, remember the key ingredients for a public subnet.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,770
You need to have a public IP.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,080
You also need an entry in the round table for the public subnet that points to an Internet gateway.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,450
So let's see, how do we connect from the outside world?

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,330
That's what we want to do.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,050
We're going to launch an easy two instance.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,630
And then from our own PC's, we're going to connect into our AC2 instance.

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,720
So the way we would do this is the Internet client that's our computers is going to connect to the public

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,150
IP of the instance, and it does so via an Internet gateway.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,060
So we need to have an Internet gateway and those devices are attached to the VPC.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,330
So you have one Internet gateway attached to each VPC that you want to enable Internet access for.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,340
And then via the Internet gateway, we can connect to our ACSU instance.

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,960
So that's what we're going to do now.

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,100
We're going to launch an easy to instant's running the Linux operating system.

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,320
That's going to be the same for everybody.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,090
Now, depending on what client you have, the instructions are slightly different.

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,270
I'm going to show you both ways.

36
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,090
So there's two ways.

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
One is for Mac and Linux users.

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,850
That's what we're going to do first.

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,760
And then the second way is for Windows users.

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,320
If you've got a Windows computer, it's a slightly different way of connecting into your instance.

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,490
But once you're connected, everything's the same.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,770
So let's head over to the console now and will launch an initiative instance.

43
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm on the AWB management console and on the services.

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,430
We can click the dropdown and then choose easy to underneath compute.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,640
Now note that I have a region specified.

46
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,520
I've got the region specified as Sydney because that's the closest region to where I am.

47
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,220
You can choose whichever region you want for this exercise.

48
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,930
Typically you just choose one that's closest to where you are physically.

49
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,950
So I have my region selected.

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,360
Now let's just have a quick look over the console here.

51
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,720
Now, the first thing to note is you'll notice up here we have new easy to experience.

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,380
If you flick this off this little switch here, it takes you back to the old console.

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,600
We're actually in the process at the moment.

54
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,150
We are in the process at the moment of changing from the old console to the new one.

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,820
And really, this is a layout difference.

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,460
There's nine different features or functionality.

57
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,860
It's really just how everything is presented to you.

58
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,300
So, for example, if we go under instances here, this is where you will see your instances and this

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,460
is going to look a bit different in the new console.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,400
So the actions menu here has several different functionality underneath it.

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,820
And when we go to new experience, you'll see the layout is slightly different.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,050
So let's go back to the new experience.

63
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,580
We are going to use the new experience.

64
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,380
Now, one other thing to note, this is still changing as I record this course.

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,870
It's changing daily almost at the moment.

66
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,060
So it's been going on for quite a while.

67
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,400
So it's hard to actually keep up with the changes.

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,330
But when you look at the interface, there might be some differences.

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,740
If there are, just be patient and look through and try and find what you're looking for.

70
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,020
The layout might be slightly different, but overall, the functionality in the features and the settings

71
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,060
should be the same.

72
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,650
So you can see that the layout has changed a bit.

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,670
Now, I'd like to draw your attention to a few things over on the left there.

74
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,220
So we've got instances that's where we are now.

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,260
You can go to instant's types and this shows you the various different types of instances.

76
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,570
Talk about more about that in a moment.

77
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,950
We then got something called launch templates, spot request savings plans.

78
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,850
There's lots of stuff here.

79
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,590
We're going to talk about this throughout the course.

80
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,030
I'm not going to go into detail now.

81
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,450
We got Amazon machine images.

82
00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:00,900
These are images of the Ebb's volumes, the volumes that are actually attached to the easy to instant.

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,260
So.

84
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,840
I worry about that we're going to actually gets Ebb's volumes a bit later on, of course, and you'll

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,150
understand in more detail, but essentially think of this as the operating system so you can actually

86
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,420
have a package that includes the operating system and you use that when you want to deploy an instant

87
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,950
so you can pre configure them and you can also find some that are public.

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,800
So here we can look at public images and people have already created these.

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,130
And for instance, they might have some software installed on them.

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,760
We then got Ibbs, as I mentioned, this is the volumes, the disks.

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,990
Think of them as virtual hard drives that are attached to the E2 instance.

92
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,650
And we'll talk about more about that in another section.

93
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,110
We have networking and security here.

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,440
Now, security groups are really important.

95
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,400
These are essentially firewalls that are attached to our computer, to our easy to instant's.

96
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,950
So they're an instant level firewall.

97
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,650
Really important to understand these and you'll actually see them in use very soon.

98
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,520
We then have elastic IP addresses.

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,880
So these are static public IP addresses, placement groups beyond the scope of what we need to talk

100
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,050
about now and then.

101
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,940
We've got key players here now.

102
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,410
Keepers are a public and private key pass.

103
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,140
So it's using what's called public key cryptography.

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,290
Now, we do need to actually use these to connect to our instance.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,770
When you create a keeper, it creates a public key and a privately the public is on Adewusi.

106
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,530
The private key is something you download to your machine and then you use that when you want to connect

107
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,400
to your instance.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,370
Now, you can see here that there are two different types.

109
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:44,840
If you're using windows, then you can choose PPK and it will create one that you can use with Putti

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,350
if you're using Linux or Mac or your computer has an open access client.

111
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,460
So you're going to use a secure shell program to connect in.

112
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,080
Don't worry if you don't understand this yet, we're going to do this soon.

113
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,220
So you'll understand it then.

114
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,310
But then you can use a PM now, a profile can be converted to a PPK file.

115
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,890
So don't worry if you choose this option and then realize you want to connect from Windows and we'll

116
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,630
see this in the hands on very shortly.

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,240
We then have low balancing down here and also scanning big subjects that we're going to come a bit more

118
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,410
later on in the course.

119
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,870
So let's go back up to the top now.

120
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,800
Let's go to instances and we're going to launch an instance.

121
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,570
When you launch an instance, the first thing that you need to do is choose the Amies.

122
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,850
Remember, I mentioned this is a pre configured package, including your operating system.

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,610
So you can see here we have several options.

124
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,080
Now, three tier eligible just means that it is a part of the free tier.

125
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,260
So if you have a free tier accounts, then you can run these instances without paying up to a certain

126
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,590
limit.

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,420
So, for example, we can run one of these constantly for throughout the month in the freezer.

128
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,380
If you run several of them at a time, then you might end up paying.

129
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,750
We're going to choose Amazon, Linux to Amite.

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,540
But I just want to show you, you can have your own Amies.

131
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,230
We don't have any.

132
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,720
Now, there's also a marketplace.

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,620
So in the marketplace, you can find Amyas to have software preinstalled, stuff like Trend Micro here

134
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,610
at Juniper Networks.

135
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,020
So these are going to be networking and security devices, open VPN and so on.

136
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,030
So you can actually go into the marketplace and you'll pay a little bit more for these because they

137
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,210
actually have the software licensed within them.

138
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,950
So let's go back to QuickStart.

139
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,390
We're going to choose Amazon, Linux to Amoy, click on Select.

140
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,850
We now need to choose the instance type.

141
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,520
Now again, we want to make sure we're in the free tier.

142
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,710
So we will use this to micro.

143
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,070
It only has one CPU and one giga ram.

144
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,540
So it's a very basic system, but it's good enough for what we want to do now.

145
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,810
Know that there are lots and lots of different types of instances.

146
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,600
You don't need to understand all the differences for this particular exam, but it's worth having a

147
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,450
look at these just to understand, you know, what you can do.

148
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,410
You can see here we have some instances that have very large amounts of CPU and also RAM.

149
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,650
And as we go down in fat, it gets much, much bigger than that.

150
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,840
So you'll find that there's some absolutely huge instances, 498 giga ram here.

151
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,980
So they are also optimized for different use cases.

152
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,740
So if I just scroll back up here, the ones we've seen in front are what are called compute optimized.

153
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,530
So the ratio between the number of CPUs and RAM is a bit higher and then you might have storage optimized

154
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,500
where it's optimized more for storage throughput.

155
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,440
So that's a bit beyond the scope of what we need to do now.

156
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,180
But I just wanted to show you, we're going to choose to micro click on next.

157
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,270
Now in here, you can choose the number of instances.

158
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,380
We're going to keep it as one.

159
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,410
You can choose to use spot instances, if you like.

160
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,630
That's another method of using unused capacity on AWB at a much cheaper right.

161
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,190
We're going to choose our network.

162
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,560
In this case, the default VPC is selected.

163
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,720
The subnet says no preference.

164
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,260
It's just going to use one of the.

165
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,040
Subnets in an availability zone, and it's also going to enable public IP.

166
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,160
So this means we're going to deploy our instant's into a public subnet with a public IP.

167
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,210
We don't need to change anything there.

168
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,150
Now, most of these other options are things that we're going to cover a bit later on in the course.

169
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,650
So I'm just going to click straight through here and go to add storage under add storage, you can see

170
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,920
a single volume is selected.

171
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,710
This is what's called the root volume.

172
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,020
Now it's eight gigabytes in size, which is fine for what we need to do.

173
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,880
Now there are several different types of volume and these have different performance characteristics

174
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,720
and different costs.

175
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,820
We'll talk about that in the storage section of the course.

176
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,560
For now, we can leave it as the default volume type, which is general-purpose SSD.

177
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,090
And note that by default, when you delete your instance, the volume will be deleted.

178
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:00,420
If you deselect that, it means that the volume will be stored so you can delete the instance, you

179
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,420
can terminate your instance and the volume will always be there.

180
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,030
So you can actually use that then to restart the instance at a later time.

181
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,290
You can also enable encryption, if you like.

182
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,060
We're not going to do that for now.

183
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,530
And if you wanted to, you could add an additional volume that's just delete that one.

184
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
We don't need any more volumes for now.

185
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:26,380
Now, under Tagg's, this is where you can enter some metadata associated with this particular instance.

186
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,990
So, for example, we can write in here department and then we could say that this is perhaps I.T. and

187
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,260
that just adds some metadata that you can then use for various purposes.

188
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,150
We'll talk about that again later in the course.

189
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,950
Next up, security groups.

190
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,760
So here what we need to do is create or attach a security group to our instance.

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,390
I'm going to create a new security group because we don't have one yet.

192
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,010
And I'm going to call this Web access.

193
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,880
I'm going to copy that and paste it in the description.

194
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:03,270
We then need to define the rules for the network traffic that we need to allow to reach our instance

195
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:10,290
by default here because it's Linux, it's come up with S.H. and that means the SNH protocol is going

196
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,550
to be allowed, which uses what's called Port 22 on the TTP protocol.

197
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,940
And the source can be any source.

198
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,230
This IP address means any source.

199
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,520
Zero zero zero zero zero means it can come from anywhere if you want it to be more secure.

200
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,060
You could change this to my IP and it will identify your IP address and now only you can connect to

201
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,460
this instance for our purposes.

202
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,380
We'll leave it on anywhere which puts it back.

203
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,610
So this zero zero zero zero last year.

204
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:46,470
And note that what it's done now is it's also added this other address at the end.

205
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,630
Now, that's actually the same as this first part, but using a different protocol, IP Version six

206
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,090
rather than IP Version four.

207
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,260
That's all good.

208
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,480
So let's click on review and launch.

209
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,970
And here you can see a summary of what you've configured.

210
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,270
If you click on launch, it now needs a key piece.

211
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,330
Remember I mentioned these are public and private keeper.

212
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,960
Adewusi stores the public key and you download the private key and you need that to connect to your

213
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,500
instance.

214
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,560
Now, we don't have any, so let's try to keep it.

215
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:23,390
I'm going to call it Sedney Dash Kipen and I need to click on Download Keepa, so now I've got to copy

216
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,570
that which will need shortly.

217
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,380
So last thing to do is just launch our instance and that's it.

218
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,180
Now if we click on view instances we can see our instances launching here.

219
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,950
Let's just click on View Instances and that takes us to this screen.

220
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,930
And if we select this button on the left, it will now get all this information.

221
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,890
We can see that our instant state is pending.

222
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,580
We can see the instance type.

223
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,590
We can see the status checks here.

224
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,790
There's no information yet.

225
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,660
And then we get lots of details so we can see lots of information about our running instance.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,190
And then there are several times.

227
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,610
So you got security information, networking, storage, the status checks, which in this case appear

228
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,440
to be running now.

229
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,500
So things are looking good.

230
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,650
We've got monitoring here where you can see some operational information about your instance and then

231
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,950
you can see the tags that are assigned to the instance.

232
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,060
So that's it for this lesson.

233
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,430
What we need to do next is actually connect to our instance and we're going to do that in the next lesson.
