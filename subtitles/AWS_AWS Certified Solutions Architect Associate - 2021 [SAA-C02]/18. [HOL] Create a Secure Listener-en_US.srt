00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,160
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to create a secure listener for our load balancer.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,940
Now to do that, we're going to need to register a certificate in the Certificate Manager service.

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,150
And for that, we need to have a hosted zone in Route 53, which means we need to register a domain

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,420
name.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,360
Now, I haven't done that yet in the course.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:32,690
So if you do want to follow along and it is optional, then you can go forward to the DNS caching and

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,770
performance optimization section and you'll find a lesson called Register Domain with Route 53.

8
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,890
Now it does cost somewhere between five and $12, typically to register a domain name, but it will

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,200
be useful for some lessons in this course.

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,410
So if you want to follow along, then skip forward, do that lesson and then come back here and then

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,130
we can carry on.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,290
Otherwise, you can just watch what I do.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,370
So let's get started back in the easy to management console.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,710
I'm going to open certificate manager.

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,530
You got a services, scroll down to security, identity and compliance, and you'll find certificate

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,940
manager here in Certificate Manager.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,430
I'm going to click on Get Started.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,650
Request a public certificate.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,920
And then I'm going to add in the domain name.

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,550
Now this must correspond to your hosted zone.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,970
So what you need to do there is go down to networking and content delivery Route 53.

22
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,250
And for this lesson, if you're going to follow along, you need to go to hosted signs and you should

23
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,820
have a domain name minus DCT Cloud Labs dot com.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,980
So I'm just going to copy that name, come back and paste it in, and you can add alternate names as

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,510
well, but I'm happy with that for now.

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,010
So let's click on next.

27
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,860
Now here, what you would want to do is use email validation and then you'll get an email and you have

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,840
to approve the request.

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,580
Now please, please don't use DCT Cloud Labs dot com.

30
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,010
This is a domain that I've registered.

31
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,400
You will not get the email and you will not be able to register a certificate.

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,370
I get lots of emails from there, so please don't do that.

33
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,160
So make sure you use your own domain name that you've registered and that you have an email address

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,150
registered as your contact details for your domain registration.

35
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,030
That's the address that the confirmation will go to.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,800
So if I click on next?

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,460
Make sure email validation is selected next.

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,540
Review and confirm and what a fine now is.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,590
I have an email.

40
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,130
I need to click on a link in that email and then when I refresh this page, the certificate should be

41
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,820
registered.

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
So I've done that in the background.

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,910
Now let's refresh.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,730
And the certificate has been issued successfully.

45
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:55,100
So what I can do now is come back to my load balancer, go to listeners and we're going to add a new

46
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,550
listener.

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,670
And it's telling me I can't use your AC again.

48
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,980
But of course I don't want to because I'm going to create a secure listener using Port 443.

49
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,760
Now you can see the default SSL certificate is going to be from ACM by default.

50
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,260
And so I'm going to select my certificate here for default actions.

51
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,380
We need to set up a rule for how our traffic is routed.

52
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,220
I'm going to forward it to my TG Dash Alb.

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,090
Now know that you can add additional target groups and specify a weighted distribution, and you can

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,160
have what's called group level stickiness.

55
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,220
In this case, what it means is we essentially have something like sticky sessions, but at the target

56
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,910
group level.

57
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:44,120
So for a period of time that you can specify anything that's routed to one target group, those connections

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,250
will remain going to that target group.

59
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,260
They're not going to get routed across to a different target group, even if your traffic distribution

60
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,430
would otherwise allow that.

61
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:59,180
Now I just want one target group, so I'm going to OK this and add my listener and that's it.

62
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,790
If we come back now, we should have two listeners.

63
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,160
So that's the lesson I set up correctly.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,470
But of course, we need a DNS resolution.

65
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,490
So the way we're going to do that is we're going to add an alias record in Route 53 back in round 53.

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,350
I'm going to select the hosted zone.

67
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,160
And we're going to add a record, and this record is we're not going to put anything here, it's not

68
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,960
going to be a dub dub dub or anything like that.

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,260
It's going to be straight for the cloud loudobbs.com.

70
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,720
It's going to be an alias record.

71
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,830
And when we choose Alias, we can choose an end point.

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
And these are IWC services.

73
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,980
It's an application load balancer.

74
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:46,200
The region in this case is USC's one, and then I can find my load balancer, and that's it.

75
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,540
That's how you create a record in Route 53.

76
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,910
So what this means is when we try to get a resolution for DCT Labs dot com that should then get resolved

77
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,070
to the DNS name of our application load balancer.

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,630
Now, another thing we need before we're going to be able to make any connections to our load balancing

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,840
using HD TPS is to make sure we have the right security group rules in place, so let's select Web Access

80
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,130
Security Group and down here under inbound rules.

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,460
I'm going to select edit inbound rules and then I'm going to add a rule and let's just type in each

82
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,250
step and we'll find HD CBS and that also fills the protocol in the port range.

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,690
And what I'm going to do is any IPv4 say from any IPv4 address and then save rules.

84
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,800
And that's it.

85
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,660
Now we have our security group rules set up to make sure we allow inbound connections.

86
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,340
So let's now try and connect to this domain name using HTTPS.

87
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,910
So I've entered TPS colon slash slash.

88
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,780
I'm going to put in DCT cloud labs, dot com and hit enter.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,500
And of course, I do get directed to my in-situ instance and I can cycle through my instances.

90
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:11,820
As with before, the key difference is this time we're connected over HTTPS and that means we have a

91
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
certificate and we can see that certificate here.

92
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,230
And that was issued by Amazon.

93
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,140
So that's how we create a secure listener.

94
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,800
Now, I don't need my entry in Ralph 5:3 anymore, so I'm just going to come back in here and choose

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
this record.

96
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,690
Don't delete the NSA or the CIA, and I'm just going to delete this record.

97
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,380
And that's gone.

98
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,030
And that's it for this lesson.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,250
And all we're going to do in the next lesson is clean things up to make sure that you don't leave anything

100
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,580
running.

101
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,390
So I'll see you there.
