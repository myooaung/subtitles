00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.530
We're now going to cover versioning.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.650
So as AWS web page mentions versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.330
in the same bucket.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.970
So what that means is that every time you upload and change a objects the previous version and the current

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.770
version are retained.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:31.770
And that means that you can go back to a previous version if you need to.

7
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.560
It also means that if you delete an object a delete marker is put on the object and you can then delete

8
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.160
the delete marker and actually retrieve the objects again.

9
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.290
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the console and actually set this up.

10
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.950
The first thing to know is that buckets can be in one of free states.

11
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.270
So beautiful a bucket does not have versioning enabled.

12
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.630
You can then enable it and then you can suspend it.

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.240
You cannot return back to the original state.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.930
So let's go over to S3 and we're going to create a bucket and I'm going to call this DCT test versioning

15
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.240
and we're going to click Create

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.450
now to make things a bit clearer.

17
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.140
I'm going to enable public access and I need to confirm

18
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.800
and then I'm going to add a bucket policy which allows that public access.

19
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.590
This is so that we can actually retrieve the files publicly

20
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.040
so that should give us public access to the bucket.

21
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.540
So versioning is enabled through properties and we can click here and enable versioning and then afterwards

22
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.730
we can suspend it again.

23
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.150
But like I said you cannot get back to the original state.

24
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.920
So we're going to enable versioning for this bucket.

25
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.670
So again to upload a file now and it's just a simple text file

26
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.750
and you'll see we have this version's information now and we can click show versions and we only have

27
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.250
one and it shows us the latest version.

28
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.100
And if we click on that file we can open it up and it just says My name is Dot dot dot.

29
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.300
So let's go back and we're going to go into our buckets and we're going to upload the file again.

30
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.250
But just quickly I'm going to change the file.

31
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.850
I'm going to add my name into it on another screen and I'll just save that file.

32
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.890
And so I'm going to upload the new file which is still using the same file name

33
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:57.280
and so let's go into the file now and this time it says My name is Neal so let's head back and see the

34
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.550
bucket level we can look at the versions so we can now see that there's the older version and the newer

35
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.090
version

36
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.610
and what will happen is if we delete the newer version

37
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:25.310
and head here and open the file again we've turned back to the previous version and then the other thing

38
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.070
we can do is we can delete this file

39
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.950
and then if we click on Show we can see that the file the original file is here and then there's a delete

40
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.190
marker and I can delete the delete marker

41
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.740
and now the file is back again so that's how versioning works.

42
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.140
Now if we come back to this Web site one of the other things that's important to know about versioning

43
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.490
is the difference between versioning and MFA delete so you can optionally add MFA delete as well and

44
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.130
MFA delete is used to add additional security sites using multi factual friends location.

45
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.690
In other words a device such as this one.

46
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.270
So you can pair that up with versioning and not only does that enable MFA for when you delete object

47
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.350
versions but also if you wanted to change the versioning states of the bucket.

48
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.670
So those are a couple of security features that you can use to try and protect your objects from deletion

49
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.720
and to be able to go back to older versions of documents.
