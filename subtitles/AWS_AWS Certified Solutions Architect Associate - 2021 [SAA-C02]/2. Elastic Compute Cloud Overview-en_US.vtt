00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.350
Welcome to the first lesson on EC2.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.530
EC2 is the Elastic Compute Cloud and it's an elastic service that allows you to launch compute resources

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.570
on the AWS cloud.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.870
Now in the AWS world we call these instances and they're very similar to virtual machines that you

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.950
might have on your VMware or hyper-v infrastructure on-premise.

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.270
Each instance has an operating system some storage and a certain amount of virtual hardware associated

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.290
with it including CPU ram and network capabilities.

8
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.630
If we go in and try and launch an instance we can see that we have a few options as to what type of

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.420
image we choose. An Amazon machine

10
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.750
Image is a template that contains the configuration for your instance and you can choose some predefined

11
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.700
images here and what you can see is that you can choose the operating system.

12
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.600
So we've got Amazon Linux, Red Hat, SUSE Linux and Ubuntu and there's many more. We've got windows

13
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.960
on here as well.

14
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.940
And once we've chosen the image we want we can then choose the virtual hardware platform we're going

15
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.400
to put it on to.

16
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.240
But just while we're in here I'll show you that under the AWS marketplace you can also find Amazon

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.840
machine images that come with third-party software such as firewalls and load balancers pre-installed

18
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.590
and you pay a slightly higher cost for these because they include the usage of the actual software as

19
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
well. And you can also see community AMIs.

20
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.410
So these are ones that have been shared by people for public use and you can see a list of operating

21
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.140
systems that you can filter by on the left here.

22
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.690
So if we go back into the quick start and choose select we then get to choose an instance type.

23
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.110
Now you'll see here that there's lots of different instance types and they're optimized for different

24
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.280
use cases.

25
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.850
So you might need an instance with more compute or more memory or storage optimized or you might need

26
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.770
a GPU for instance.

27
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.270
So you can select from all of these different instance types to get the correct virtual hardware configuration

28
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.330
that you need and that includes the CPU, the memory, storage, and the network performance.

29
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.640
Now we're not actually going to launch an instance right now we're going to do that in the next lesson.

30
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.780
Now before we go any further I just want to point something out to you.

31
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.110
You may notice that sometimes the console looks slightly different on your screen.

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.120
And the reason is AWS change the console over time.

33
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.300
Now usually it's just a cosmetic difference but sometimes they do make material updates that are quite

34
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.380
significant.

35
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.860
If you can't find something or you believe it's changed in a big way please let me know and I'll try

36
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.160
and help you and I'll also update the video.

37
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.770
This particular video has been updated because there were a couple of changes that I wanted to include.

38
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.640
So you may notice that it's slightly different to the other lessons in the rest of the section.

39
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.770
You may also notice I've got this new EC2 experience up here.

40
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.110
And by the time you watch this you might not have this but at the moment you have the option to choose

41
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.620
a new experience.

42
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.220
And when you flick that toggle switch you actually get directed to a slightly different version of the

43
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.050
console.

44
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.950
Now it's not massively different.

45
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.650
The items on the left here I think are pretty much the same but they've changed the layout in the middle.

46
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.970
Now I'm just going to switch it off for now and we'll continue.

47
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.130
Now if you go under limits you can see here the limits for what you're allowed to run in the AWS cloud

48
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.270
by default.

49
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.630
Now almost all of these limits are extendable if you contact AWS but by default you'll find that

50
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.590
for instance you can only run a certain amount of a resource on a AWS.

51
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.220
Now it used to be a per instance basis for how many instances you could run.

52
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.970
They changed that recently to a per vCPU.

53
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.680
So now you can see that you've got a limit here of 1280 vCPUS.

54
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.190
If you want to run an instance of one of these families on the left here you can see the instances that

55
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.860
are running, at the moment we don't have any.

56
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.530
And you can also then look at the instance times which we saw before.

57
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.870
And this will give you the full list of all the different instance types and families that are available.

58
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.220
Now I want to quickly cover some of the pricing models we see too.

59
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.140
If I go here and launch an instance it's called launching an on-demand instance and you don't get any

60
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.140
discounts but it's very flexible you can just launch these and terminate them whenever you want to.

61
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.060
But there are a couple of other options.

62
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.560
So one of them is reserved instances.

63
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.470
And in this case you can purchase a Reserved Instance and you can choose the amount of time that you

64
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.640
want to reserve this for.

65
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:06.250
Now the options are 12 months or 36 months so one year or three years and this means that you're committed

66
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.330
to paying for these instances for that period of time.

67
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.290
Now in return for this commitment you get a big discount can be up to 75 percent of the on-demand price.

68
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.120
But of course he'd only use this for steady state workloads that you know you want to run for that period

69
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.000
of time.

70
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:31.060
We also have spot requests where spot requests what you are doing is purchasing some spare capacity

71
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.920
for my AWS at a much discounted rate.

72
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.940
So what happens is AWS often have some capacity that's not being used and they'll give you the opportunity

73
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.990
to use some of that capacity at a discounted rate.

74
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.110
Now the caveat with this is that at any point in time when somebody wants to pay the full rate for that

75
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.710
capacity AWS can shut down your instances you do get notified but you need to know that.

76
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:04.300
So people use this for instance for large compute jobs that are very expensive normally and they really

77
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.030
need that sort of reduction in cost.

78
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.410
So think of large computing jobs that are doing some kind of batch processing.

79
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.910
It's very important that your applications can withstand being shut down and terminated when AWS

80
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.650
need that capacity back.

81
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.550
So you have to make sure that whatever you're running on a spot instance the data or the state of that

82
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.590
application is being saved somewhere.

83
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.650
There's a new feature called savings plans.

84
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.060
This is very recent.

85
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.760
I haven't seen this coming up on the exam yet but it may well come up on the SAA-C02 version of the

86
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.370
exam.

87
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.670
Now this is similar to reserved instances but it gives you the option to choose different compute models

88
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.490
such as EC2 and Fargate which is a container service.

89
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:54.160
Another option that we have is dedicated hosts a dedicated host is a physical server in EC2 that you

90
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.520
can use the capacity of and it's dedicated for your use.

91
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.970
That means even though EC2 is typically multi-tenant so you're sharing the underlying hardware with other

92
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.080
customers.

93
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.830
If you use a dedicated host you're not sharing the underlying hardware.

94
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.150
It's dedicated to you.

95
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:18.790
We also have scheduled instances and this is where you can purchase some capacity on a recurring schedule.

96
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:26.110
So if you run certain workloads on a recurring basis but not constantly then scheduled reserved instances

97
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.280
might be the way to go.

98
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.070
Another thing we have is capacity reservations.

99
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.440
In this case you're actually reserving some capacity to ensure it's available for you when you actually

100
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.720
need to run some resources.

101
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.570
Now AWS have a lot of capacity available but occasionally they can run out of capacity so this can

102
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:49.090
be useful if you have a highly critical workload and you need to make sure that you can run it at a

103
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.080
certain time.

104
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.250
Now we covered AMIs before and here you can see the public images and the private images.

105
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.020
We don't have any at the moment but you can see those that are shared publicly.

106
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.110
So these are the templates for the software configuration for your instances.

107
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.960
We then have the elastic block store. Elastic block store is the underlying storage that's used with

108
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:18.550
EC2 instances, this is block based storage and you can choose from a few different types of EBS

109
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:24.070
volume. So you can choose from SSD and you can choose from hard disk drives.

110
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.290
So magnetic style.

111
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:32.470
Now with the SSD especially with the provision IOPS you can actually choose the amount of IOPS you want.

112
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.780
You can specify the amount of performance you need.

113
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.880
Now we're going to cover EBS in much more detail later in the course.

114
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.170
We then have some networking features.

115
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.560
So we have networking and security.

116
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.320
We have security groups which are instance level firewalls.

117
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:55.720
We have elastic Elastic IPs which are static public IP addresses that you can allocate to your account.

118
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.790
And if you do so Amazon will provide a static IP to you and you actually need to use it. If you don't

119
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.150
use it

120
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.410
you have to pay and if you do use it you don't pay for these.

121
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:11.530
And that's just Amazon incentivizing you to make sure you use public IPs that are in demand.

122
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.810
We can also see something called placement groups that we'll cover later in this section and network

123
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.040
interfaces where you can create what are called elastic network interfaces.

124
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.740
So think of it as being a virtual network card that you can move between instances.

125
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.960
Now load balancers and auto scaling these are a couple of concepts we're going to cover in great detail

126
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.890
in this course but we don't need to go into that now.

127
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.660
So that's it for a quick overview of EC2.

128
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.930
And we're now going to go into much more detail and actually start launching some resources in the next

129
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:44.590
few lectures.
