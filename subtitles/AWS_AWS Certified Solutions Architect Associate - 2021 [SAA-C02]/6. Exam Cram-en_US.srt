1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:13,610
This is the exam cram for IWC organizations with IWC organizations, you can consolidate multiple IWC

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,470
accounts into an organization that you create and then centrally manage.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,660
It's available in two feature sets consolidated billing and all features.

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:31,840
It includes the root accounts and organizational units, policies get applied to root accounts or use,

5
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:38,350
and consolidated billing includes a paying account, which is independent and can't access the resources

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,870
of other accounts and then linked accounts and all linked accounts are also independent of each other.

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,340
We've consolidated billing.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,350
You get a single payment method for all the IWC accounts in the organization.

9
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:57,040
You get a combined view of charges incurred by all accounts and you get pricing benefits from the aggregated

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,580
usage.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,290
There's a limit of 20 linked accounts for consolidated billing by default.

12
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,570
It can help with cost control through the volume discounts with consolidated billing.

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,960
Unused reserved instances are applied across the group, and paying accounts should be used for billing

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,100
purposes only.

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,620
Moving on to service control policies, these manage the maximum available permissions.

16
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,640
You must have all features enabled in the organization and that can be applied to accounts or IOUs.

17
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:35,050
Policies can be assigned at different points in the hierarchy, and KPIs affect only IAM users and roles,

18
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:40,690
not resource policies and KPIs affect the root accounts in member accounts.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,430
CEPS do not affect any action performed by the management accounts.

20
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,800
We then have the different strategies.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:56,830
The denialist strategy uses the full US access CPA that's attached to every IOU and accounts and overrides

22
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,150
the implicit deny.

23
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,330
It explicitly allows all permissions to flow down from the roots that grants full access to all permissions.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,930
You can then create additional steps to explicitly deny permissions anywhere in the hierarchy.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
You then have to allow less strategy.

26
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,350
In this case, you removed the full IWC access MCP.

27
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,370
No APIs are permitted anywhere unless you explicitly allow them, so you have to create steps to allow

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,240
those permissions.

29
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,100
The steps must be attached to target accounts and every IOU above it, including the routes.

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,600
Full migration accounts can be migrated between organizations.

31
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:45,640
You must have Root or IAM access to both the member and management accounts, and you can use the organization's

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,330
console if it's just a few accounts or use the API or see a line if there are many accounts to migrate.

33
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,220
And that's it for this exam crime.
