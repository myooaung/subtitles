00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.570
In this lab we're just going to set up a couple of health checks for our resources so we can go into

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.230
health checks in the 50 free console and create a health check.

3
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.950
So we get a few options here and we need to give it a name.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.610
So first off I'm just going to go back to my screen here where I've got some my IP address is recorded

5
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.130
and I'm going to take our instance in Singapore.

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.480
So we're going to come and call this Singapore easy to and I'm just going to paste the IP address.

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.670
Now of course you can choose domain names here IP addresses.

8
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.640
You can change your port and your path for the health check.

9
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.980
I don't need to do anything else so I'm just going to click next and create a health check.

10
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.990
You could create an alarm as well using SARS.

11
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.740
So let's just go back now.

12
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.590
I'm going to get the IP address of my North Virginia instance

13
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:11.670
and I'm just going to call this one North Virginia easy too and paste in the IP address

14
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.240
and again I'm just gonna leave the defaults.

15
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.850
Now the next thing I want to do is go back and get my load balancer DNS name and comeback and create

16
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.200
a health check.

17
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:37.160
And this time we're going to call it our Sydney dash A or B and we're going to change to domain name

18
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.310
and instead of an IP we're going to put in the domain name which is the DNS name of our load balancer

19
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.750
and click next and tray health check.

20
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.060
I'm just going to do one other thing with see these have already gone to healthy.

21
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.570
I'm just bringing up a command prompt and I'm going to do dig Amazon dot com and what we should see

22
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.030
is we get some records back.

23
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.470
So I'm just going to copy one of these records.

24
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.210
And the reason I'm doing this is just to show you example external.

25
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm just gonna paste in that IP address.

26
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.600
Obviously this is not a server which I've provision that's nothing that I have any control over but

27
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.590
it is a web server.

28
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.940
So is listening on port 80 and therefore we should get a health check back from that one.

29
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.360
So there's a few health checks that we're going to give those a couple of minutes and make sure they

30
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.640
all go healthy so I just gave that a couple of minutes and now we can see that all our health checks

31
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.720
are healthy including the one which is hosted on Amazon.com.

32
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.520
So just to show that that's all that we can do is for external records I want to delete that health

33
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.760
check because we don't need that anymore.

34
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.100
So if you look in your health checks you can see a bit more information about them you can see some

35
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.210
of the configuration parameters we left a lot of these defaults.

36
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:05.400
You can do some things like latency graphs to see the latency that's associated with a specific health

37
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.280
check and you can also choose the health check in regions and then we've got a monitoring tab where

38
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.370
you can see the status of the health checks.

39
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.760
You can set alarms at tags and see hear the status codes 200 which is a hasty T.P. status code that

40
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.470
says that things are good.

41
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.190
So you can see that all the health checks regions have returned a status of 200 for this particular

42
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.780
instance.

43
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.710
And then if you had a licensee grass a neighborhood you'd see those there.

44
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.290
So that's it.

45
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.940
We just needed to set these up because we'll be using them in some of the lamps within the section.
