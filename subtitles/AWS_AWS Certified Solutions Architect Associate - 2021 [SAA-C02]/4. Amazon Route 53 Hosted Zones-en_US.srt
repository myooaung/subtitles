00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,080
This is a fairly basic overview of Route 53 hosted zones.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,520
So let's have a look.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,330
Firstly, we have Route 53 and we have a hosting zone and this one is called example dot com.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,600
And in that hosted zone, that's where we can create all DNS records, things like an AA record here,

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,510
for example, dot com that resolves to an IP address and has a time to live associated with it.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,440
So 60 seconds is how long your browser is going to cache.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,220
The result before ends up actually going out and asking DNS again to give it a new record.

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,330
So always important to make sure you set your titles properly.

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,460
If that's too long and something changes, your clients are still trying to connect to the old address.

10
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:58,240
So we have a hosted zone, which is essentially a file that contains these DNS records, and those records

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,630
all belong to the domain in this case, example dot com.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,100
So in this case, we have a client who's trying to resolve example dot com that computer asks the Route

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:17,740
53 DNS service Rule 53 responds with the address is 8.1.2 Dot one, and the client can then perform

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,610
an HTP get to a web server that's running on that address.

15
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,490
So this is how we have a public hosted zone working for public addresses.

16
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,040
Now what about the private hosted zone?

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,110
Well, in this case, it can be any domain name you want because it's not in the public space.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,610
So you might choose something like my company dot local, whatever your company name is.

19
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,620
We then have our resources in our public subnets and our private subnets.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:52,210
And what we do is we associate the private hosted Zone two of APEC, and then we need to make sure that

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,930
we've enabled DNS hostnames and DNS resolution.

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:04,300
And that means that all instances will actually receive a DNS hostname and the DNS resolution will work

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,350
now by default.

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,280
Using the standard DHCP options your computer.

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,800
Your instances will pick up a DNS address, which is the Route 53 resolver, so Route 50 free will result

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,540
in these names.

27
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,440
You can always change that if you want to use your own DNS service, but then you might want to have

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,130
a forwarder and the forwarder would forward any requests for US services to rule 50 free.

29
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,680
So let's say in this case, we have DNS resolution working using Route 53.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,030
We've got our records created in this case for our app.

31
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,370
My company, Dot Local and our DP.

32
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,080
The app server asks Root, 53, for the address of the database.

33
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,800
It responds with the IP address and then the connection can be made.

34
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,070
So that's an example of a private hosted zone.

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:03,980
Now you can migrate your hosting zones to Ralph, 53 or from Route 53 to another provider so you can

36
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,930
migrate from another DNS provider.

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,140
And you can import records so you can export a file with your records from another provider and then

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,060
import that into Route 53.

39
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,750
You can also migrate a Route 50 free hosted zone to another AWB account.

40
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,110
You can migrate from Ralph 50 free to another registrar, so that's another DNS registrar, an external

41
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,340
third party service.

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,660
And you can associate a round 53 hosted zone with a VPC in another account.

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,380
And as a tip, this is something that comes up in an exam question.

44
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:48,230
The way you must implement this is you authorize an association with the VPC in the second IWC accounts.

45
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,890
You then create an association in the second account.

46
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:59,870
And that means that resources using Route 53 in that second IWC account are able to resolve records

47
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,250
in the hosted zone in the account that you've just associated.

48
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,840
Those are the core facts you'll need to know for Route 53 hosted zones.
