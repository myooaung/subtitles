00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,750
Hi, guys, so let's have a look at versioning and replication.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,210
I'm locked into Amazon is free.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,190
Let's go into our DCT cloud storage bucket here in my pocket.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,150
I'm going to go to properties and we've got bucket versioning.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,590
Now you can simply enable bucket versioning and then you can suspend it.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,950
Now, in our case, what we need to do is click on Edit and we're going to change from suspend to enable

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,540
and click on Save.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,860
Now let's go back to objects, and what we're going to do is upload an object.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,660
So I'm going to add files, not simply got a word document here called Versioning Dash Test.

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,920
Now you won't be able to see this potentially, but it says first revision.

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,290
So what I'm going to do is upload this word document and that's click on Close.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,450
Back in the document here, I'm going to simply change this to say second revision.

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,900
Save the documents and then back, it's free.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,220
I'm just going to do the same thing and upload exactly the same file again.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,190
So the files being uploaded and as you can see, there's a toggle switch here for showing versions if

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,020
I click on show versions.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,230
We'll see that we've got versioning test and then we've got versioning dash test underneath it as well,

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,570
and those are two different versions of the object.

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,460
So for example, if I want to download this object here, the old version and I've just opened that

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,650
document and it says first revisions so we can see that we can get back to the older version.

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,570
We can access the old version if we need to.

22
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,450
Now, let's try something else.

23
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,230
It's upload another file.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,590
Just choose one of these other files we've got, like our confidential reports, and let's upload.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,210
Now, what I'm going to do is simply delete this file, so let's delete the object, and that's gone.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,550
So it's been deleted now.

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,470
Let's have a look at show versions.

28
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:04,400
Now, when you click on show versions, you can actually see that the object is still here, but there's

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,450
a delete marker.

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,950
So we've got the object, the actual version of the object before we deleted it.

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,630
And then we have it delete marker.

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,930
Now what happens if we delete that delete marker?

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,010
Well, let's try that.

34
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,080
So let's delete our delete marker.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,430
Click on Close.

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,500
And now I'll report is back again.

37
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,670
So when you delete something, a delete marker is put in place.

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,070
It doesn't delete the object version itself.

39
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,380
And that means you can restore that object.

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
So that's versioning.

41
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,710
Now we want to set up replication.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,350
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a bucket.

43
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,720
Let's just give this a unique name.

44
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm going to call it DCT cloud backup and just put two x x on the end just to make sure that it's unique.

45
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,480
So now I want to choose a different region.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,090
Maybe I'm going to choose US East two, and that's where I want my copy to go.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,230
So what I'm going to do is scroll down now I do need to enable versioning.

48
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,470
If I don't do that, I won't be able to set up the replication role.

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,130
You need versioning on both the source and the destination buckets.

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,140
So let's create this bucket.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,970
Now, let's go back to our original bucket DCT cloud storage.

52
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,250
Click on management at the top here, and then let's create a replication rule.

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,750
We can give this a name.

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,490
Choose a status.

55
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,050
It's going to be enabled in this case, and then we can choose a rule scope.

56
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,510
So limit the scope of this rule using one or more filters or choose to apply to all objects.

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,360
We're going to apply the rule to all objects in the buckets.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,700
Now we need to specify a bucket in another account or in this account.

59
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,910
We're going to choose in this account and then browse.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,490
Let's choose our backup bucket and then you click on Choose Path on the right hand side.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,230
That all looks good now, if I am wrong, you can actually choose this create new role at the top here,

62
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,970
and it's going to do it all for us.

63
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,800
You can choose to replicate objects in crypto with cams.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,840
We don't have any, so I'm not going to enable that.

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,170
And you can even change the storage class for the destination.

66
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,200
So maybe you don't want to pay for standard.

67
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,510
There might be a cheaper tier for your back up.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,910
I'm going to leave mine on the defaults.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,250
There's now a few additional options.

70
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,810
You can set up replication time control metrics and notifications.

71
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,910
You can replicate the actual delete markers, which we looked at earlier on in this lesson.

72
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,120
And you can have a replica modification sync as well, and that will replicate massive data changes

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,870
made replicas in this bucket to the actual destination bucket.

74
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,810
So I'm happy with all these as defaults.

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,100
Let's click on Save.

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,680
So we can see we now have a replication rule, and it's in an enabled state and we can see the destination

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,740
bucket where the copies of our data are going to go.

78
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,400
So let's go back up to the top level here.

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,760
Let's go to our destination buckets and let's see what's in there.

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,620
And there's nothing in here.

81
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,360
So was there nothing?

82
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,400
Well, the thing is when you add a replication roll, it doesn't replicate the objects that already

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,020
exist in the bucket.

84
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,140
It will only replicate objects that we add to the bucket.

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,480
So let's go back up a level, choose our sauce bucket and let's add an additional object.

86
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,080
So I'm going to upload a file and something which I know is not in this bucket at this level.

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,350
That's upload that file close out of here.

88
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,420
Then let's go and have a look in our destination buckets.

89
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,030
And now it won't be instant, so you will need to give it a couple of minutes and then refresh and that

90
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,770
just took a couple of minutes and you can see that the new fall, I added, has been replicated to the

91
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,230
destination bucket in the second region.

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,520
But all the other falls haven't, so that's working exactly as expected.

93
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,630
Now I'm going to remove my rule, and that's simply going into management, clicking on the rule here

94
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,370
and then we can delete that rule.

95
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,940
So it's going to stop replicating data to the destination bucket.

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,800
And that's it for this lesson.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,750
In the next hands on lesson, we're going to have a look at lifecycle rules.
