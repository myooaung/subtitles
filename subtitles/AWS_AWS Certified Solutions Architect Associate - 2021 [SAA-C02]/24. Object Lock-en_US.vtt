00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.140
Another feature I want to cover is object lock.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.360
This was announced that reinvent last year in 2018 so it's been around for several months now.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.170
Could well be appearing on the exam object lock is used to prevent objects from being deleted.

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.970
So this is another tool in your arsenal so you've got versioning, you've got multifactor authentication

5
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.850
delete protection and then you've got object lock.

6
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.880
Now we can see here that if you try and enable object lock for an existing bucket it tells you that

7
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.090
you can't you can only do it when the bucket is created.

8
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.120
So you actually have to go create a bucket.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:50.140
Call this DC to test objects lock and then you're gonna go next.

10
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.510
We need to go to advanced settings and before we can enable that we have to enable versioning so you

11
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.860
do need versioning before you can enable object log and then you just enable it for the bucket.

12
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.690
And it tells you that this is a permanent thing.

13
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.530
You can't turn this off at any point and then you just go next and finish.

14
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.160
Now there's a couple of articles which talk about how you can use object locks so there's a couple of

15
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.530
key reasons for this as there's compliance reasons that you need to keep data for a certain period of

16
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.410
time there's legal reasons where you need to make sure that people cannot delete certain data.

17
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.360
So have a look through this and understand how it works.

18
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.550
Another article that's good is how do I lock Amazon S3 objects.

19
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.250
So even though you've configured the bucket and you've enabled object log you then need to specify information

20
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.270
with your request to store data or update existing data in order to lock it and then you can choose

21
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.540
the relevant retained retention modes.

22
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.510
So you have here the governance mode the compliance mode and then the legal hold which can be enabled

23
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.070
as well.

24
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.440
So a couple of things to note on this you can see that the compliance mode cannot be disabled by any

25
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.040
user.

26
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.010
So that's a pretty major thing.

27
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.710
And then also with the legal hold this prevents the objects from being deleted regardless of its retain

28
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.760
until date.

29
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.770
However that can be removed by certain AWS users.

30
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.950
So I would just familiarize yourself with this.

31
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.100
I didn't want to actually set anything up here because I thought when you guys lock in objects and finding

32
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.280
that you've got problems deleting them so maybe just keep this as a theoretical exercise just read these

33
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.490
articles and understand what objects look is and when you might use it.
