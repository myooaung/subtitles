00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:09,930
My guys in this lab we're going to cover VPC flow logs so VPC flow logs enable you to capture information

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:17,580
about the data that's going into and out of your easy two instances and you're able to log that to cloud

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,630
watch logs and Amazon is free.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:27,330
Now the diagram here is showing that there's three different places where you can enable flow logs.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,780
You can do it at the VPC level and you can do it at the public so you can do it at the subnet level.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,800
Doesn't matter if it's public or private.

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,220
And then you can do it at the easy to instance level which means that it's actually attached to the

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,510
elastic network interface of the easy to instance.

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,370
So we're going to go for a lab and we're just going to enable flow logs in a couple of places and see

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,530
what data we can capture so in the IWC management console.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:04,100
I've already launched an AC DC two incidents and what I need to do now is to go to identity and access

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,240
management and create a role.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,920
Now what I'm doing is I'm pretty much following along with this article from.

14
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,180
So if you have a search for a publishing flow logs to cloud which logs and this gives you the instructions

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm about to follow.

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,190
And one of those things is I need to have this Jason statement which I'm going to attach as a inline

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:33,620
policy to the role and it gives the permissions to create a log crew credit log stream write the events

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,700
and then to be able to list those events.

19
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,300
So.

20
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:46,370
So we need to copy this to a clipboard and this is a restrictive policy so it means that we're giving

21
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,890
the minimum rights we need to which is a security best practice.

22
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:58,380
So let's head back to I am and go to roll's great role and I'm gonna come down here and choose easy

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,190
to and then select your use case.

24
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:07,910
I mean I choose easy to and I pretty much just go through and finish this off by giving it a name.

25
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:18,050
I'm just going to call it flow dash logs and I can create that roll so I haven't given any permissions

26
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,290
yet.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,460
So let's go into your flow logs and I'm going to add an inline policy change to Jason.

28
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,190
I'm going to get rid of the Jason code that's in there and I'm gonna put in my restrictive policy.

29
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,250
Now we can hit review give it a name

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,370
just called it flow lock policy and create policy so that's done.

31
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,390
And what we need to do now is oh there's one more thing we need to do here so we have to go to trust

32
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,140
relationships.

33
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,120
Edit trust relationship.

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,350
And if we come back here we can see there's this code here that we need to change so we can grab this

35
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,470
copy it to the clipboard come back over and paste this in

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,190
does make sure I got rid of all the code.

37
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,480
Yeah that looks good.

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,620
So and then we just hit update flow policy and all it's done is it's changed easy to do Amazon to IWM

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,100
stop come to BPC flow logs so that's uptight the trust policy.

40
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,330
So we've created our role and what we need to do now is head over to cloud watch.

41
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:38,380
So cloud watch performance monitoring for all resources and we want to go to logs and create a new log

42
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,920
group and we're just going to call this my flow logs

43
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,240
so that's very easy.

44
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,700
We just head over to the easy to console now and I've launched a single instance running a public submit

45
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:02,710
within my custom VPC I'm going to copy its IP address and we're now going to enable the flow log.

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,830
So we come down to network interfaces because you're actually going to attach this to the network interface.

47
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:15,850
So we're going to click actions create flow log and you can choose except rejects or all in this case

48
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:23,350
I'm just gonna filter to log packets that are accepted and we drop down into the dropdown box here when

49
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:31,030
we choose our destination log group and we can come down now and choose our role that we've previously

50
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,760
created and it's click on Create.

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,300
So now you can see that we have a flow log and see under flow logs here you can see that it's going

52
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,870
to filter to accept what I'm also gonna do is create an additional flow log.

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,230
So you can create multiple flow logs with different parameters.

54
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,880
This one is gonna be filtering for reject.

55
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,920
So I just want these to go into a separate look file but they're going to be in the same log group.

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,960
And you need to know that if you ever need to make a change to a flow log you just gotta delete it and

57
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,820
create a new one.

58
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,900
You can't modify it.

59
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,320
So we've got those flow logs set up correctly.

60
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:21,370
Let's go to a command prompt and what I want to do is use the Net cat utility which is NC I put in the

61
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,870
public IP address and first name when to choose a port which I know I have access to.

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,850
So net cat just creates a connection to the host that you provide or IP address on a port that you specify

63
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,110
just tries to create a network connection so that data will definitely hit a WS.

64
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,660
So if I click on answer it we can see the.

65
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,120
We get some return traffic here it tells us it's open SSA so we know that support that's open on our

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,240
Amazon land it's easy to instance I can break that connection and come back and let's go to cloud watch.

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,870
And we're gonna go to logs my flow logs.

68
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,550
So that took a few minutes but we've now got a log stream for accept and reject.

69
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,340
So we see that they're in two different log streams so let's hit the accept and we can look in here

70
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,530
we can see some information you get an I.D. you get the account number you get the elastic network interface

71
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:27,300
I.D. you get the source IP address and then you get the destination IP address which is always the private

72
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,310
IP address of the instance.

73
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,810
And then you can see the port source and destination ports some information about the protocol and the

74
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,070
bytes and then accept.

75
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,780
So we can see that this is a package that's been accepted.

76
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,380
So if we look towards the bottom of the file to the newer entries we should be at to see some entries

77
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,530
here and we can see Port 22.

78
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,810
And those are packets that have been accepted.

79
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,030
Port 22 again.

80
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,730
So that's the SSA connection so we now want to have a look in the regex stream.

81
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:03,720
And I've waited a few minutes because the events update about every 10 minutes or so in the meantime

82
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,940
what I did was I just tried to connect on a few more well-known ports to this instance.

83
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,970
Now if it looks a bit different to your console you even have this row format or text.

84
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,540
I prefer text.

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,700
So if we head down for instance I tried to connect on port 21.

86
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,780
So there we see a regex.

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,110
That's the FDA port which is an open on our server.

88
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:34,980
So what we're able to see from this then is that even if a security group is rejecting it we still get

89
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,480
the log here despite the fact that it hasn't actually reached the operating system.

90
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,830
So you can use this to identify how your security groups are configured and whether they're accepting

91
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,250
or rejecting the right traffic.

92
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,070
So the other thing I want to show you is let's go back to VPC and I want to show you where else you

93
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,980
can create a flow log.

94
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:08,370
So in the VPC dashboard you can choose your VPC highlight it and then you can go create flow log and

95
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:19,500
this will then capture flow logs from all the resources annual BPC so all network interfaces in your

96
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
VPC.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,600
The other place you can do it is at the subnet level.

98
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,070
So then it will just capture flow logs for all traffic in your subnet.

99
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,380
Again from the network interfaces in your subnet.

100
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,690
So again you just go in and create flow log and it's the same screen whichever way you go.

101
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,180
So that's it for this lab.

102
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:49,660
We can we can stop this by going back so easy to head down to network interfaces and you can always

103
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,870
just delete your fly logs from here.

104
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,810
Of course we're going to we're going to terminate this instance anyway.

105
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,670
So I don't really need to do that but that's where you can go in and manage those flight logs if you

106
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,120
need to.

107
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,470
So we can just terminate our instance we've got rid of our flow log.

108
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,700
And if you'd like to you can also remove your IAM role and we can also head into cloud watch go to logs

109
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,850
and just remove this log group

110
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,370
so that's it the flow logs key thing to remember is that you can create them at the VPC level the subnet

111
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,850
level or the network interface level and that they're going to log traffic even if that traffic is rejected

112
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,460
by a security group you'll be able to see that in the flow log.

113
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,220
So it's a great way of testing and seeing what's hitting your security groups and then being either

114
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,720
accepted or rejected.

115
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,200
And the one other thing for the exam is to make sure you remember if you need to modify a flow log you

116
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,720
need to delete it and recreate that you can't change it.
