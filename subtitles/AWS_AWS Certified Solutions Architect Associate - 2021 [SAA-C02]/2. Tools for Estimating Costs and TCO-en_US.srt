1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,400
I just want to bring a few tools to your attention, which are useful if you're performing a migration.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,010
Now, these aren't necessarily covered on the Solutions Architects exam, but I just wanted to mention

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,020
them because I thought it would be remiss not to.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,210
And the reason being that if you're doing the migration to the cloud and your solutions architect,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,260
you're going to need to do some calculations to work out what is the cost going to be in Adaba US and

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,590
also what is the cost of your existing infrastructure and new applications on premises so that you can

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,880
do that comparison and work out what are the cost savings on a W.S.?

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,320
So there's a few tools that you can use.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,480
The first one is the W.S. Simple Monthly Calculator.

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,020
This has been around for quite a while and I'll show you it, but it is actually being replaced by the

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,660
A.W. as pricing calculator, which is new.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,710
We've then got the A.W. W.S. Total Cost of ownership calculator.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,690
The TCO calculator.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,690
So that's the one where you can actually plug in your on premises costs and then see how much that is

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,350
costing you.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,660
And then what are your savings going to be in the cloud?

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,060
So just a little bit more on the TCO calculator.

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,390
Because this one requires a bit more explanation.

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,060
So this is about looking at your on premises costs and then comparing those to the cloud.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,310
So it gives you that directional guidance on what cost savings you might achieve.

21
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,920
So you put in your cost elements of your current or estimated on premises, data center resources.

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,930
And then you can compare those cost requirements with what is it going to cost you on a W.S.?

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,990
And you can add and modify things as you go through.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,430
So what does it include?

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,450
Well, it includes things like the RAC infrastructure costs, your virtualization costs, your facilities

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,720
costs, because remember, these are the things that go away when you move from your own premises into

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,220
the cloud and then your networking, your data transfer and those kind of things.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,440
Now, of course, you do pay for those in the cloud as well, but you just need to understand what the

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,020
costs are.

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,100
On Prem vs. A.W. as cloud.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,870
And then for labor now, you know, you might have fewer admins looking after your databases on a W.S..

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,040
So you have to consider what's going on today.

33
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,510
And once you're using a managed service in a W.S. instead of your on premises data sensor, what are

34
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,830
those savings going to be?

35
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,680
And obviously things like data center and power and all those things that do go away once you move to

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,190
the cloud.

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,140
So that's just a basic overview.

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,830
And what I'll do now is our just briefly show you those calculators.

39
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,480
So what we're gonna do is just go to Google and a search for a top U.S. calculator and you'll see the

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,420
ones that come up after are Amazon Web Services, simple monthly calculators on an open that one.

41
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,980
And then also this is the new one here.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,250
So the A.W. s pricing calculator.

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,080
Let's also then look for the TCO calculator.

44
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,760
And I going to open that one as well.

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,300
So this is the simple monthly calculator and you can see they are telling you that it's being deprecated.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,280
So, you know, we don't spend too much time on this because they're trying to get you to go to the

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,190
Nutile now.

48
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,510
But this was the old tool and you went for your services and you just added those in and then you were

49
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,910
able to estimate the costs in a W.S..

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,060
So let's ignore that one, because that is being deprecated.

51
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,890
And now we have this neutral and we can create an estimate.

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,980
And then, for instance, we could put in E.S., too.

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,060
We could can we can click on Configure and then we'll be able to input our specifications so we can

54
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,370
choose, you know, what operating system we're gonna have, the CPA use we need and so on.

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,370
And then in reservation terms as well.

56
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:02,140
So you can choose a reservation term if you're using a reserved instance and or you can just go back

57
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,280
easy to savings and then it shows you how much it's going to cost.

58
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,590
So it's it's really as simple as that.

59
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,250
And you can then obviously go in and create a more advanced estimate as well, if you like, which includes

60
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,410
other things like data transfer costs.

61
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,020
And you can see add lots of different services in and then see what your costs are going to be.

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,290
So that's the pricing calculator.

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,250
And then you've got the total cost of ownership calculator so you can launch it.

64
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,890
So this is the TCO calculator.

65
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,410
You can choose whether you're on premises or co locations.

66
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,560
So whether your sharing your data center or whether you've got your own dedicated data sense that you

67
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,280
can choose where it is for geographical requirements.

68
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,310
You can choose virtual machines or physical servers.

69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,280
And then you can add in your rows here and you can give each application a name, choose whether it's

70
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,510
a database or not.

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,860
Operating Systems hypervisor is the number of VIMS, the number of calls per VM and the amount of memory

72
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,340
as well.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,570
And then you can put in your storage here.

74
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,630
So sand nasal objects and put that in and then calculate TCO.

75
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,390
And when you get the report, NWS break it down in quite a bit of detail, showing you the various assumptions

76
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,350
that have gone into it.

77
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,530
So that's just a basic understanding because as I say, it's not mentioned in the Solutions Architects

78
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:23,980
exam.

79
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,710
But if you are a solutions architect, you will be looking at these tools when you're thinking about

80
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,710
migrating workloads into the cloud.
