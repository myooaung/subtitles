00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.650
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.190
So in this lesson, we're going to go in and do some hands on with AFEs, what we're going to do is

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.680
we're going to create an Air Force filesystem and then we're going to launch instances in two different

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.470
availability zones and connect those to the filesystem and just see that we can actually see data on

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.490
the filesystem from each instance.

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.340
So let's head over to the console and build this out.

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.770
I'm in the management console.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.170
Let's go to Services EFS and here I am in the EFS management console.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.630
And interestingly, you can see that as I learn more notice up here saying that you can reduce your

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.690
storage price with AIFS lifecycle management.

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.360
So that's another feature which is worth understanding.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.190
And this is where you move stuff to the Eephus infrequent access storage class.

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.750
I'll just close that off and we're going to create a file system.

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.610
I'm just going to call this my EFS and we can choose the VPC here.

15
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.940
And then if you click on Customize, we get a few more advanced options so we can choose to enable or

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.920
disable automated backups.

17
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.670
You see that the lifecycle management is set to 30 days since last access.

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.490
So after 30 days of a piece of data not being read or written to so it's not being accessed, it will

19
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300
be moved to the infrequent access storage class.

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.410
So I'll leave that as a default.

21
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.700
Then we have the performance mode.

22
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.530
I'll leave that on general purpose, the throughput mode.

23
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.800
I'll leave that on bursting.

24
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
And then we have encryption, which, as you can see, is enabled by default.

25
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.720
And if you want to, you can go in and customize your encryption settings here and you can add tags.

26
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.280
But I'm not going to do that for now.

27
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.840
Let's click on Next.

28
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.710
And now you can see that it's going to create some mount targets for me.

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.190
And by default, it's actually found a security group.

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.060
And what we'll do is when we finish, we'll have a look at the security group and see what rules are

31
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.470
in there.

32
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.650
Now, the availability zones are two way to be in to see it's found the subnets in those availability

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.980
zones.

34
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.690
I'm going to leave those as defaults.

35
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.990
I'll leave IP addresses to be automatically assigned.

36
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.970
And then it's click on next.

37
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.200
So this is where if you want to, you can assign a filesystem policy in the next lesson, I'll show

38
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.240
you some examples of policies that you can apply at the resource level.

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.050
So here against the filesystem itself and you can control NAFS access or of clients access, for example,

40
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.570
with a resource based policy.

41
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.590
But we're not going to do that for now.

42
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.440
If we did want to add some settings, you can also use these pre configured ones.

43
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.040
So this will enforce in-transit encryption encryption for all clients.

44
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.480
So you remember I mentioned that you can configure encryption at rest and then encryption and transit.

45
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.760
So this is how you could enforce encryption in transit.

46
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.680
You can also enforce read-only access by default as well or prevent routes access.

47
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.280
So there's a few options there.

48
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.780
Let's click on next.

49
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.060
I'm happy with all the settings, so let's just create this file system and I should just take a few

50
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.930
minutes to deploy.

51
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.090
It's in the creating state right now.

52
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.900
And if we click on the name of the file system and go across to network here, this is where we can

53
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.690
see the different map points.

54
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.250
They've got IP addresses now in our IP subnet ranges and the targets are creating.

55
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.830
So we won't be able to attach anything until that's complete.

56
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.910
So while that's happening, let's launch a couple of Ekta instances.

57
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.950
What I'm going to do is launch two instances, but I'm going to do it separately to put them in different

58
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.150
availability zones.

59
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.110
So to micro, it's got to be Linux.

60
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.380
Remember, I'm going to put the first one and the to a subnet.

61
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.720
Let's click on next, just go through and we'll talk about security group shortly for now or use the

62
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.660
Web access and then I'm just going to repeat that and put my second instance in the to be availability

63
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.960
zone.

64
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.870
Once your instances are both running, I want you to then connect into your two instances from a command

65
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.170
line.

66
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.600
And what we're going to do once we've connected into our instances is then see if we can connect to

67
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.400
our file system.

68
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.190
So I have my two instances here on one screen on the left, I've got my instance into a and on the right

69
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.010
I've got my instance in availability zone to be.

70
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.440
Now, there's also some code that you can use here in the actual course download.

71
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.260
So I'm going to copy this first command and we just need to run this on both of these instances.

72
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.740
And then at this point we can create a mount directory.

73
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.950
So we've installed the utilities with the last command.

74
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.230
And then this command will actually make a directory into which we're then going to mount our file system.

75
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.030
So I'm just going to make that directory and on this one here, the same thing.

76
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.330
So that's done.

77
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.990
And the last command is here to connect to our file system.

78
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.970
And what you need to do is change out this file system ID here.

79
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.010
So let's go back to the console and find our file system it back in the AFS management console.

80
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.870
I'm going to copy my file system right there and then I'm going to paste that into my code here.

81
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.200
So now I have this command which should mount the file system using this idea to my local mount point

82
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.490
here.

83
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.870
So let's come back and paste it in and let's see what happens.

84
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.350
Now, I'm not getting an immediate response here, and that usually tells me that there's a security

85
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.040
group issue.

86
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.140
If there was a configuration issue, you'd expect to get an error message straight away, but instead

87
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.160
it's kind of just hanging.

88
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.520
So I suspect that there's a problem with the security group.

89
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.190
So let's go and check out the security group permissions.

90
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.010
So firstly, we have the file system here.

91
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.680
What we need to do is go into the file system.

92
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.580
Click on network, click on Manage, and then we can see the security groups, so we got this security

93
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.970
group here.

94
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.020
This looks like the default security group.

95
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.580
So let's head back to the new management console and have a look in the easy to management console will

96
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.720
go to security groups and we're going to look for this security group.

97
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.580
And that's the one there, so the default security group, so let's have a look at the rules.

98
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:23.900
So the rules actually allow inbound MySQL, Aurora from the Web Access Security Group.

99
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.260
And that's because of a previous exercise that I've done now for this particular exercise.

100
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.250
That's not going to help.

101
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.950
What we need is inbound Neff's.

102
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.510
So I'm going to add a rule.

103
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.810
I'm going to type Nafs choose this.

104
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:44.390
It's port to zero four four nine and I can actually use the security group of my web access.

105
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.130
So that's the security group, my instances, and that will lock this down to a best practice configuration.

106
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.390
So we're going to allow the manifest protocol going to our file system from our Web access security

107
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.840
group.

108
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.580
And that's where our instance isn't running.

109
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.500
So I'm going to save that ruleset.

110
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.720
Let's come back and try and rerun that command.

111
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.170
And this time it's mounted successfully.

112
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.190
So what I'm going to do is just copy that command again and run it on the second instance.

113
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.640
So let's run it on the second instance.

114
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.540
And that's worked.

115
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.770
And now I'm going to change directory to slash MNC, slash FS.

116
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.120
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to touch test fall.

117
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:39.140
And what I need to do is use pseudo pseudo test fall, and what I should have done is put pseudo touch

118
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.530
test.

119
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.750
And so that's going to create that file.

120
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.770
So we've now got a file called Test File.

121
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:51.140
So if I change directory here to the FS treachery and just else, we can see the same file.

122
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.990
So what we've done is we've quite simply created two easy two instances in different Azeez and we've

123
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.240
connected them to one file system and we created a file and then we could see that file from each instance.
