00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.740
That is quite a short section.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.440
But as I said before, it's not a big part of the exam, but it is worth understanding at a high level

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.310
these services.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.850
You need to know the use cases so that if you get a scenario that says that some data or applications

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.680
are going to be migrated from one site, then you know which tools you might want to use for that.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.990
So let's get started with the exam crown.

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.020
First, we had the VM import export.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.680
So this is used for migrating virtual machines from on premises environments into Amazon.

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.300
Easy, too.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.220
You can also export the easy to instances and move them back on premises as well.

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.020
Now, there's no additional costs.

12
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.290
You basically pay for.

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.580
S free because you're uploading your virtual machines to us free and then easy to once you start using

14
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.200
AC to.

15
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.010
You can import Windows and Linux themes and the source platforms can be VM where ESX and also Workstation

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.160
and Microsoft type of V and such rigzin.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.470
The process to import a virtual machine from on premises.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.290
Too easy too is that first you export your VM to an overlay file.

19
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.430
Or it can be VM decays, be HD or raw.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.380
You upload to Amazon as free and then you import to create an IBS backed EMI.

21
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.940
You can then create your easy to instant's from the EMI now to export.

22
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.190
You the easy to API tools.

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.860
You select the VM file format you require.

24
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.040
And then you export it to a bucket and you can download it from there.

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.830
We then had the database migration service.

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.450
This is used to migrate databases from on premises from AC to or from audience.

27
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.510
It supports homogeneous migration.

28
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.850
So Oracle to Oracle as well as heterogeneous migrations.

29
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.810
So something like Oracle to Amazon, Aurora, the data is continuously replicated while the application

30
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.290
is lives that minimizes downtime and you pay based on the compute resources used during the migration

31
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.630
and any log storage that might be used.

32
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.840
It's a fully managed migration process.

33
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.720
Once you start it up, it manages that process for you.

34
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.990
You can also use it with these schema conversion tool for converting your schemas when you're moving

35
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.310
from different types of databases or from one type of database to another time.

36
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.690
Sources that are supported include CVO, Oracle Sequel's Server, Mya's Cowell, Maria DBE Postgres

37
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.580
Sequel DB to El UW, SJP, Mongo DBI and Amazon Rora.

38
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.080
So lots of different databases there.

39
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.970
Most of the main databases that you're going to deal with and Target supported include Oracle, Microsoft,

40
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.200
Rescuable, Postgres Sequel, My School, Amazon Redshift, SAP, ISC, Amazon, Asri and Dynamo DBI.

41
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.820
We then have the server migration service.

42
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.330
So this is a service from migrating servers rather than databases.

43
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.790
It's agents and you can migrate on premises and cloud based themes.

44
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.040
So the platforms are Fiamma and High V and Microsoft Zeer.

45
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.660
Those are the only ones supported at the moment.

46
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.860
The Server Migration Service Connector is installed on your source platform and then server volumes

47
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.790
are replicated.

48
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.070
They're encrypted with tearless and they get saved as semis that you can then launch easy.

49
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.750
Two instances from you can use application grouping's and s.A.

50
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.900
Mass will launch servers then in a cloud formation stack and that uses a template that it automatically

51
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.860
creates for you.

52
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.150
You can also replicate your on premises servers for up to 90 days per server, and it provides automated

53
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.760
Leive incremental server application.

54
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.530
Next stop.

55
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.860
We've got Snowbowl and snowmobiles.

56
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.780
Remember, this is when you have large amounts of data to move into Amazon and you don't want to transfer

57
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.210
over a network because it's just going to take too long or it's going to saturate your links so you

58
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.450
can transfer hundreds of terabytes or petabytes of data.

59
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.450
And it goes into S3.

60
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.570
It uses a very secure storage device for transportation and you get a client and the client is installed

61
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.850
on your local computer and that identifies, compresses, encrypts and then transfers the data onto

62
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.660
the snowball device, which you then ship in to Amazon.

63
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.090
It uses 256 bit encryption and a W.S. Kamus keys, and it's a temper resistant enclosure.

64
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.600
So you've got two versions for Snowbowl.

65
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.030
You've got the 80 terabyte and the 50 terabyte.

66
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.890
So if you wanted to migrate a couple of hundred terabytes, you could have, you know, four of the

67
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.510
50 terabyte ones, for instance, and it's known as petabytes scale.

68
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.210
So that wording sometimes comes up in exam questions.

69
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.200
So just remember that.

70
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.590
Will snowball edge.

71
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.710
This is the hundred terabyte device, and that's known as being petabytes scale as well.

72
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.730
And but it also comes with onboard storage and compute capabilities.

73
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.170
So slightly different.

74
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.850
The snowmobile is the exabyte scales that has up to 100 petabytes per snowmobile.

75
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.930
So that, remember, is the truck that has a great big container on the back and it's the shipping masses

76
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.410
of data.

77
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.290
So that's snowball and snowmobile.

78
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.190
And then you've got data sync.

79
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.520
And this has a software agent that connects to on premises now.

80
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:34.030
So network attached storage devices and the NAS can use the NFL, FSL, SMB protocols.

81
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.970
And it was synchronized data into a W.S..

82
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.810
It uses scheduled and automated data transfer.

83
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.430
Also, we've encryption and your destination for the transfer of the data can be Amazon as free HFS

84
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.400
or Amazon SSX for Windows File Server.

85
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.640
It can apparently improve performance for data transfers up to ten times faster than with traditional

86
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.970
tools just based on the protocols that it uses.

87
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.940
And the the way that it can scale as well.

88
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.830
The permissions and metadata are preserved and you pay per gigabyte transferred.
