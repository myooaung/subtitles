00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,600
In this lesson, I'm going to give you a very brief overview of what an AWB account is in the next lesson.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,430
We're going to get started with a hands on and actually create a free to air account that we're going

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,810
to use throughout the course.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,450
So before I do that, I want to give you a little primer on what made up U.S. counties and how we go

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,590
about setting one up.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,930
And all of the concepts I explain in this lesson will be explained in a lot more detail later on.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,160
So firstly, what we need to create an account is a credit card.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,240
We also need an email address, and that has to be a unique email address.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,250
In other words, it's not being used with another eight U.S. accounts.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,010
So as long as you have these pieces of information, you can then create an IWC account.

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,970
And when you do so, a root user is created.

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,780
The root user is the only user in the account at this stage and has full control over the accounts.

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,720
The root user signs in with the email address that you supplied when you created the account.

14
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:12,600
We can then use a service called Eight of US Identity and Access Management, or IAM.

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,670
That service is used to create additional users groups that we can put the users into roles that we

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,830
use for services and policies, which define the permissions that we assign to the users, the groups

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,540
and the roles.

18
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,120
So that's something we'll do a bit later on.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,320
We're going to create users groups, roles and policies using IAM because the user account is so privileged.

20
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,930
It's one that you don't want to use unless you really need.

21
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,420
So it's much better to create individual user accounts for the people in your organization, including

22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,150
yourself, and use those for logging in.

23
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,680
Now, when we log ins, IWC will initially be logging in using the IWC management console, and that's

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,830
a web based console that you can access through a web browser.

25
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,730
The Identity and Access Management Service is the services used for authentication, so logging in.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,330
So when we create our own individual user accounts and log in with those, we'll be using the IAM service

27
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,520
to log in to the console or the API or the command line interface, all of which you'll learn about

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,120
later on.

29
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:25,340
Once a principle such as an IAM user has logged in, they're then able to create resources in different

30
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,380
IWC regions around the world.

31
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:35,330
So, for instance, you can launch EC2 instances, audience databases as free storage buckets and elastic

32
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,650
load balances as well.

33
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,100
And those are all resources that you'll learn a lot about in this course.

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,210
So that's a very brief overview of IWC accounts.

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,890
And in the next lesson, we're going to create a free to air account that we can use for the course.
