00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,070
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,440
What we're gonna do in this lab is we're going to enable multi AZ for the database that we configured

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,630
in the last lab.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,650
But before I do that I need to explain to you what multi AZ is and also how it compares to

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:22,660
read replicas as these are two ways that you can enable high availability and also offloading of performance

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,520
from your master database.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,480
So let's look at the two, multi AZ

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:36,430
What this means is you enable multi AZ on your database and it creates a standby copy of your database

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,810
in another availability zone within the same VPC.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,220
So it's within the region within the VPC.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,040
It's just in a different availability side.

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,910
It's always going to be in a different availability zone and the replication is synchronous.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,100
So synchronous means that before

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:03,370
before a replication event came complete it needs to the database needs to check that it has successfully

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,470
been written to the database.

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:12,790
So that's different to asynchronous where there's no checking so the data is replicated but there's

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,620
no check to prove that the transaction has been committed before carrying on.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,840
So with a read replica you have asynchronous replication. Now read replicas are a different use case.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,330
So multi AZ you have a primary database and a secondary database.

20
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,170
Let's have a look at a diagram.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,700
So you've got your RDS master.

22
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,280
You create an RDS replica of it not a read replica.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,300
This is a standby copy of your master database your application servers will then connect to the master

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,520
instance and synchronous replication happens to the standby.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,530
Now there's no endpoint address on that standby.

26
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,000
So you'll remember from the previous lab we get a long endpoint address like this.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,050
And that's the address that your app server connects to.

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,090
But the replica doesn't have an endpoint address because what happens is when you failover the same

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,150
address is mapped to the standby instance.

30
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,850
That means that you can't use this instance except for in a scenario where you failover from the master

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,050
and that can be an unplanned event or it can be a planned event so read replicas are different because

32
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,520
with a read replica

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,780
what happens is you create a replica copy of your database but it has a separate endpoint.

34
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,570
So with a read replica.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,000
What happens is you have this separate copy with its own endpoint and you can have different application

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,020
servers connecting to that database but it's only four reads.

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,750
So what this is doing is it's off loading reads from your master database or in this case in this diagram

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,940
the one on the bottom is the master.

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,870
So you can read and write to your master database.

40
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,490
You can't write anything to any standby copies of your master database multi AZ copies but you can

41
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,690
read from an RDS read replica.

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,410
So if you've got a lot of read traffic and your master database is having a performance implication

43
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,870
it might be worthwhile a neighboring read replicas

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,810
so as I mentioned only the database engine on the primary instance is actually a multi AZ whereas

45
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,050
with read replicas all read replicas are accessible and can be used for read scaling. With multi AZ

46
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,240
backups are taken from the standby.

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,820
And that's good because it means that your primary production system that's live isn't getting any performance

48
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,730
implication from actually performing the backup.

49
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,430
There are no backups configured by default for a read replica.

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:54,290
So a multi AZ deployment always spans two aces within a single region whereas a read replica can be

51
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:02,300
within the same AZ it can be across different AZs or it can even be across regions with multi AZ

52
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,470
the database engine version upgrades happen on the primary whereas with a read replica the database

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,650
engine version upgrade is independent from the source instance.

54
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,970
With multi AZ failover to the standby is automatic, if a problem is detected then you can do it manually

55
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,420
as well.

56
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,540
Read replicas can be manually promoted to a standalone database so you can promote a read replica to

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,260
become a writer or database.

58
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,650
So that's the theory.

59
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,030
Let's get on with the lab.

60
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,490
So what we're going to do is we currently have our EC2 app server which in this case it's a wordpress

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,600
server and we've got a database but we don't have a replica.

62
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,420
So we just have what's going on in the top here.

63
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,210
Let's go over to the console and we're going to head into RDS

64
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,870
and if we just choose our database here we can then click modify and all we need to do is specify yes

65
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:15,450
under multiple deployment and we can leave everyone else's defaults and it's going to warn us that you

66
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,360
may experience a significant performance impact when converting this database instance to multi AZ.

67
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,120
This will impact, this impact will be much more noticeable on database instances with large amounts of

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,340
storage and write intensive workloads.

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,450
So of course the data needs to be replicated.

70
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,080
So it's going to have a performance implication because it needs to be read from the current master

71
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,100
database and transferred to the new one therefore you can leave it as the default which is to apply

72
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,190
the change during the next scheduled maintenance window.

73
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,460
In our case we want to choose apply immediately.

74
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,860
So we just collect modified DB for instance and if you just go back to databases and we refresh our

75
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,890
and it now says modifying so I got to leave that a few minutes until it becomes available again.

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,590
So that took 10 minutes or so but it's now available.

77
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,220
So I'm going to go into my DB and we now have multi AZ enabled.

78
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,370
What I want to do is simulate a failover and the way that we can do that or actually cause a failover

79
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,060
and the way we can do that is we can choose reboot and then we'll reboot with failover.

80
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,470
Now let's just check.

81
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,910
So we've got our WordPress sites.

82
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,410
And if you remember from the diagram we have our master database server.

83
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,070
We have our WordPress instance connecting to it.

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,890
And what we've just done is we've created a replica.

85
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,600
So this is a standby replica.

86
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,530
And the endpoint is currently mapped to our master.

87
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:55,370
So what's going to happen is when we click reboot and cause a failover, the endpoint address will be

88
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,920
remapped to the RDS replica.

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,890
And this will then become the master and things flip around.

90
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,830
So this then becomes the standby in the synchronous replication goes in the opposite direction so let's

91
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,570
head back and let's do it guys.

92
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,900
RDS we're going to choose the option reboot with failover and hit reboot

93
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,880
and now let's go to our WordPress database or WordPress site and click refresh and you can see that's

94
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,870
not working and if we open a new tab we'll get the same thing so that's timing out and it's going to

95
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,700
take a little bit of time while the address gets remapped to the new RDS instance.

96
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,820
And that didn't take long.

97
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,890
I just hit refresh again and this time I got the results.

98
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,920
And this one appears to be hanging but let's just hit refresh and there we go.

99
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,930
So that really didn't take more than a minute or so maybe two minutes.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,420
So it's quite a fast failover and that's all we're going to do in this lab and what we've done now

101
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,870
is we've got our RDS master in this other availability zone and we've got our replication going

102
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:12,040
to the availability zone where the master used to be and what's happened is our server is now just connecting

103
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,300
to that endpoint over here and what we're going to do in the next lab is we're going to create this

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,470
configuration.

105
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,600
So we're actually going to create a read replica.
