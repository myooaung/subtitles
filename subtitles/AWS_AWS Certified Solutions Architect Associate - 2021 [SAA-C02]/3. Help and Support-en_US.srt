1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,020
I just want to give you some pointers as to how you can get help and support as you go through the course

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,970
now if you have any problems with the YouTube platform itself.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,960
So, for example, video playback problems or performance problems, please take these up with you to

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,920
me directly as instructors, we don't have any access to the platform and we're unable to submit support

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,110
tickets on behalf of our students.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,840
So please just go to the help and support menu and submit a support ticket to you to meet directly.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,230
If you're having trouble with a hands on labs, the best thing to do is if you can't find a resolution

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,130
to your problem by working through it, then just row yourself back to the beginning, change your environment

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,200
back to the state it was in at the beginning of the lab, and then just go back through it again, following

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,380
the instructions very carefully to make sure you don't make any errors.

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,660
There's a Q&A form that you can submit questions to as well.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,020
The Q&A form is a great place to submit questions, but I would urge you to please search the forum

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,420
first to see if your question has already been asked and answered previously.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,780
Also, please try finding an answer to your question by using Google search.

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,880
Often a simple search will turn up.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,700
A great answer to your question, Awista.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,890
Do a great job of writing some detailed articles and tutorials on their products.

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,390
So they're a great place to find information and get your questions answered.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,280
And often that will be faster than waiting for somebody to respond on the Q&A forum.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,380
Another great place to get assistance is on our workspace.

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,300
We have channels for each of the certification courses that we have and there's also a general channel

22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,710
for general questions.

23
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,510
Now, why hang out there quite a lot?

24
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,420
And there's also lots of engagement from other students.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,270
So that's a good place to look for assistance and to ask questions and share your knowledge with others

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:54,750
as well.

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,050
Between those resources, there's lots of ways to get help.

28
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,220
So you shouldn't find that you get stuck on any questions throughout the course.

29
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,530
Please make sure you use all those resources that are available to you and I'm sure you'll get on just

30
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:07,890
fine.

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,110
One last thing before I go.

32
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,780
At some point, Udemy is going to ask you to leave a rating and review on the course if you're not ready

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,170
at that point in time, because it can be quite early in the course sometimes.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,180
Then you can always do it later on.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,020
But if you're ready to leave a rating, it would be really appreciated.

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,380
It really helps us as instructors and it also helps other students when they're making decisions about

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,870
which courses to enroll in.

38
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,340
So I would really appreciate it if you did.

39
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,330
Thanks for doing that.

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,040
And I'll see you in the next lesson.
