00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.790
We've already talked about virtual private network connections, VPNs now VPNs typically run over the

2
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.570
public internet, and that means that we are subject to the bandwidth constraints and the potential

3
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.730
latency issues on the internet.

4
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.160
We can't control the internet.

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.550
We don't know from minute to minute, hour to hour what's going to happen.

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.760
We can get a good service provider, but still, sometimes there's a long way between us and our services

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.040
on IWC.

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.310
And that means somewhere along that path, we could have congestion or latency.

9
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.820
So one of the solutions to that is using Direct Connect, or D D X means that you have a private connection

10
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.470
into a WC.

11
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.340
That means it's not shared, it's not public, it's dedicated to you.

12
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.040
It's a connection all the way into your IWC data center and into your Amazon BPC.

13
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.890
So let's have a look at how we set this up.

14
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.430
So let's say we have a VPC with a couple of subnets and then we've got our corporate data center or

15
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.360
it could be your office.

16
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.850
Now in the middle, here is something called a direct connect location.

17
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.340
These are different to IWC regions and there's lots of these around the world, so that could well be

18
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.300
direct connect locations in the data center where your equipment is or somewhere nearby in your city.

19
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.310
In the direct connect location, IWC have a cage, so they have a rack full of their own equipment.

20
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.580
And then there's the customer or partner cage.

21
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.210
So either you have a rack with some equipment in that data center or you leverage an IWC partner.

22
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.090
Now both of these cages will have a router, so we got the direct connect endpoint on the IWC cage and

23
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.310
then in the customer or partner cage.

24
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.860
We have the customer or partner router and you must use certain types of connectors.

25
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.580
A port is actually allocated for you.

26
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.840
And then what you do is cross connects between the customer or partner around to an AWP.

27
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.150
We then have a customer outside, actually in your data center and direct connects in IWC, and we can

28
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.640
form the Direct Connect connection.

29
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.070
So now from your customer router, you need to have a physical connection into the customer or part

30
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.670
in the cage.

31
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.730
So that might be something you need to speak to your local ISP to get that connection from this point

32
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.350
into your data center.

33
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.870
Unless you happen to have all your equipment in a direct connect location, which can often be the case,

34
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.060
then from there we have the cross connecting to IWC and then a physical connection all the way into

35
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.210
an IWC region where your VP is.

36
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.420
That's a physical fiber connection, running even one or 10 gigabits per second.

37
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.590
Now, 100 gig has just been released recently for some locations.

38
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.530
If you want slower speeds, you can talk to a partner and they can give you speeds from 50 megabits

39
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.700
per second upwards.

40
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.730
So let's have a look at some of the benefits.

41
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.100
You've got private connectivity between IWC and your data center or office.

42
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.710
You get a consistent network experience.

43
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.960
You can control the network path.

44
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.810
It's not like on the internet where you just don't know what's happening.

45
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.320
That means you can increase the speed, improve latency, get better bandwidth and throughput for your

46
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.840
connection.

47
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.640
DEX can be quite expensive for many customers, but for those who transfer a lot of data from their

48
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.910
data center in the IWC, it can be cost effective.

49
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.190
Now, let's go a level deeper.

50
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.160
So we've got the same configuration here, and you can see some of the IWC services that are in the

51
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.700
public space at the bottom of this box.

52
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.660
So how do we provision connectivity across this private line?

53
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.140
Well, we have to create something called a private a is a virtual interface, a private.

54
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.480
This is the way that you connect into your VPC in the same region using a virtual gateway.

55
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:24.260
So there's a virtual private gateway attached to your VPC, and the private vef will send data across

56
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.260
the the connection into your BPC.

57
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.710
AVF is a virtual interface that uses eighty two point one CU virtual local area networks, VLANs and

58
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.390
a session as well.

59
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.030
Now what about connecting to the public space?

60
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.470
You don't connect to the public IWC services via a private vef.

61
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.910
Instead, you need a public face, a public that will allow you to connect to IWC services in the public

62
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.910
space that are in any IWC region.

63
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.390
But you can't connect to the internet via the public fifth.

64
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.460
Now what if you want to connect to multiple VCs in the same region?

65
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.880
Well, in that case, you have multiple virtual private gateways and multiple private lifts to connect

66
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.890
to each VPC.

67
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.980
You can also create something called a hosted vef, which means you can share a vest with another IWC

68
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.650
account as well, as I mentioned a bit earlier.

69
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.300
You can get lower speeds from APM partners, so these are partners in the IWC partner network, and

70
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.530
those speeds can then be from 50 to 500 megabits per second.

71
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.900
100 gig is also featuring in some select locations.

72
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.290
Those are the.

73
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.250
US direct connect locations, so that could be where you are, might not be probably won't be on the

74
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.840
exam yet.

75
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.810
It's very, very new.

76
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.230
Something that is really important for the exam is to remember that the connections are not encrypted.

77
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.500
You cannot encrypt at the connection, so there's no way that you can select the checkbox and enable

78
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.670
encryption in transit.

79
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.350
It just isn't a feature.

80
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.470
So what do you do if you want to encrypt your traffic?

81
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.710
Well, you can then create an IP SEC site to site VPN over the top of the connection.

82
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.160
So you have your direct connection and you're basically running a VPN over that connection.

83
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.620
So now your traffic is private.

84
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.410
It's on your private connection.

85
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.500
You've got the licensing and bandwidth features and you're also encrypting your traffic as well using

86
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.400
a VPN tunnel.

87
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.770
So that's really important to remember.

88
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.140
It does come up in a lot of exam questions.

89
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.320
Now that's it for the Cole Ferry around Direct Connect.

90
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.030
And in the next lesson, we're going to look at another feature called Direct Connect Gateway.
