00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.850
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.380
In this video, I'm going to cover the exam guide for the SAAC 02, so the new version of the Solutions

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.790
Architects Associate Exam.

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.330
Now, this has been around for a few months now.

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.500
I've done the beta exam and I also retook the exam a couple of weeks ago.

6
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.570
So I've done this exam twice.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.150
And I can tell you that the questions are pretty well written compared to the previous version of the

8
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.510
exam.

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.140
I think better and though there are some extra topics that you need to learn, I definitely prefer to

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.610
take this exam myself.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.160
And I think you should definitely be studying towards this, even if you're watching this video at the

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.970
time when the SEO one is still available for a few more weeks.

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.390
So the format is multiple choice, multiple answer.

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.720
Its associate level, as with the SEO one at the moment.

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.810
You can even go to a testing center if it's available in your area at the moment, or you can go and

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.550
do an online proctored exam.

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.740
Now you get to ask ten minutes.

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.390
So one hundred and thirty minutes.

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.700
You have to pay 150 USD.

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.190
And it's available in these languages.

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.820
So the same as with the SEO one A.W. US have some recommended experience.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.720
One year hands on and a bit more than that will look into the exam guide in a minute.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.150
And there are a couple of A.W. s white papers that are worth looking at.

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.240
They provide a generic link to the white paper repository.

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690
So from the exam guide you'll find that.

26
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.680
So time allows.

27
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.990
Hundred and thirty minutes.

28
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.790
Sixty five questions.

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.060
The scoring is between one hundred and a thousand points and you need 720 to pass.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.520
Now the question format is that you have multiple choice, which means there's one correct response

31
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.880
and free incorrect responses or multiple response where you have five options and two of them are correct.

32
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.140
Now, let's have a look at the domain, so the first one is about designing resilient architecture.

33
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.820
So it's all about resilience.

34
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.070
In this case, you're looking at designing multi-tier architecture solutions, Heidi, available fault

35
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.330
Solomon architectures, decoupling mechanisms, using NWS services, and you need to be able to choose

36
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.640
the appropriate resilient storage.

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.500
The next one is designing high performing architecture.

38
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.310
So this is performance related.

39
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.420
You have to identify elastic and scalable compute solutions, high performing and scalable storage solutions

40
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.150
and high performing networking solutions.

41
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.520
You also need to choose high performing database solutions for a specific workload.

42
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.760
The third, the main is security related.

43
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.770
This is designing secure applications and architectures.

44
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.380
You need to know how to design secure access to resources, secure application tiers and select appropriate

45
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.880
data security options.

46
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.970
And the last domain is domain full.

47
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.960
This is designing cost optimized archive sections.

48
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.000
So it's all about being cost efficient.

49
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.120
You have to identify cost effective storage solutions, compute and database services that are cost

50
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.780
efficient and cost optimize network architectures.

51
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.030
So Domain five is gone.

52
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.030
So this used to be in the SAAC zero one about operational excellence and that is no longer present.

53
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.250
So there's only four domains in the new version of the exam.

54
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.100
And this is the weighting.

55
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.050
So you have 30 percent for resilience.

56
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.150
Twenty eight percent for performance.

57
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.610
Twenty four percent on security and 18 percent on cost optimization.

58
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.040
So that's a breakdown of the exam guide.

59
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.350
And I'll take you over to A.W. W.S. now and we'll find the actual exam guide and have a quick look for

60
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.440
it.

61
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.440
So on Google, I'm just gonna search for SCA C02 Exam Guide.

62
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.470
And this is D-Link come looking for him.

63
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.280
So this is taking me straight to the exam guide.

64
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.830
You can see a bit more about the recommended knowledge.

65
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.170
Now, again, I don't think you need all of this, so you don't need to have a year hands on experience.

66
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.950
And this course is being put together to give you hands on experience.

67
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.720
So if you do all the laps in this course, you're going to gain a ton of experience and you're gonna

68
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.350
be able to sort of demonstrate that when you're answering questions.

69
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.520
For exam preparation, they also give you some A.W. as training options and then the white papers link

70
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.300
that I mentioned.

71
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.420
And then it talks about the different response types.

72
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.770
And if you come down a bit more, we then get the concept outlines.

73
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.930
So this is what you saw in the slides.

74
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.790
So that's it.

75
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.360
So you know where to go now to find the exam guide if you need a bit more information.
