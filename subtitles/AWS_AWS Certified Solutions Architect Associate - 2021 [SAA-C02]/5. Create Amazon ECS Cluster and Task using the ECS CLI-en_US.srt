1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,680
In this lab we're gonna create an ECS cluster using the EC2 launch type and we're also gonna create it

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:16,510
using the ECS-CLI in this course. I want to show you how to use the ECS-CLI as well as the AWS CLI.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:23,200
And also how to create ECS clusters through the console as well and that will give you a better more

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,280
rounded experience and knowledge of ECS.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,280
The configuration that we're going to create is going to be very similar to the one that you see on

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,340
the screen here.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,610
We won't be using the elastic container registry but we will be using its task definition that uses

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:44,030
WordPress containers and mySQL containers and those images will be pulled from the Docker Hub.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,080
We'll have two container instances and we'll have an ECS cluster.

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:55,900
We're going to use the docker compose method of creating our cluster.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,990
And that means we need these two files docker-compose.yml and ecs-params.yaml.

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:09,490
So you do need to use these exact file names and you'll find these files in the course downloads if

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,150
you want to change the cluster name and the region

14
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,450
you can do so within this file and you need to do so both the WordPress and the mySQL images.

15
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,210
other things you'll notice that there's the host port and the container port here and you can see that

16
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,220
we've got the WordPress image and the mysql image and that there's a link so that the WordPress

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,500
image is linked to the mysql image.

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,530
There's also a place where you can specify a password in the acs-params.yml file.

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:50,390
Here we specify CPU shares and memory limits for each of our services: Wordpress and mysql.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,260
So you'll need to copy these files into a directory make any changes you need to make around your region

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,850
and cluster name and then open a command line and change to that directory.

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,980
Now I'm already in the correct directory so I can just type ls and I can see that I have those files

23
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,930
so you need to make sure that you're in the correct directory and you can see these files and then going

24
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,790
to paste in this command.

25
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,790
So this is the ecs-cli configure command and we specify a cluster name and we're going to call it

26
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,040
DCT ECS cluster. A region

27
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,420
and I'm using ap-southeast-2 you can change it to whatever you want.

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,170
You can change the cluster name as well.

29
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,650
And then we've got a default launch type which is EC2 and the configuration name which is the same

30
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,650
as the cluster name in this case.

31
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,330
So I'm going to have to answer and it's safe.

32
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,440
The cluster configuration we now need to run this configure profile command says ecs-cli configure

33
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,610
profile.

34
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:01,410
We need to provide an access key and a secret key and then a profile name which is DCT ECS cluster.

35
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,990
So that's now being saved the next command brings the cluster up.

36
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:15,630
So as ECS comes up we provide a VPC I.D. So this is my custom VPC I've copied the ID and pasted

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,670
it here.

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
We then specify a key pair.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,880
So I'm using my Sydney-KP, we specify the number of instances I've got to add the instance type

40
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:35,880
which is t2.micro we then specify the cluster config which is DCT ECS cluster and we specify two subnets

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,340
with a comma in between.

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:47,690
So you can take these IDs from the VPC management console and we're going to press enter and what's

43
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,090
happening now is cloudformation will create this stack for us so it's going to bring up the cluster

44
00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:01,400
and if we head over to the cloudformation console we can see the ECS-CLI setup and our cluster name

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:11,150
and as it's "create in progress" and we could go here and see what's happening if we go to East yes we

46
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,610
may have a cluster yet we've got a cluster.

47
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,580
So you can see the cluster but nothing is going to get started yet.

48
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:22,430
So we're actually bringing up the cluster configuration and any supporting infrastructure but we won't

49
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,420
be running a service or a task through this command.

50
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,500
I paused the video for a couple of minutes and we can now see that our cluster creation has succeeded

51
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,850
and if we head over to the ECS management console we can see that we have two instances running.

52
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,240
So these are the ones that have been created by cloudformation and if we had over to ECS we've got

53
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,770
a cluster.

54
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,820
And if we have a look at instances we can see that we've got these two instances but we don't have any

55
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,750
tasks running yet.

56
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,270
So what we need to do is come back over here and run another command and this is going to deploy our

57
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,310
compose file so the file that's the docker-compose.yml and the ecs-params.yml.

58
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,990
These are both going to be used now.

59
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:18,210
To create our tasks the command ECS-CLI compose up create log groups and then cluster config.

60
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,500
And the name of our cluster

61
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,340
so it's starting now we can see it as a failed to create log group because it already exists.

62
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
That's okay.

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,830
But the containers are appearing to stop.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,720
So let's have a look.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,810
While this is in progress.

66
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,440
Let's head over here and hit refresh and sure enough we've got our WordPress task definition running

67
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,360
and the last state was in pending, desired status is running, so we should see these both be running

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,050
soon and it will go, it will turn green as well.

69
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,440
And we can see that this is still working at the moment creating the second task definition as well.

70
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,450
So that's completed.

71
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,640
Let's head back and we have a running task.

72
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,960
And if we go into that task we can see some information about it.

73
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,410
And if we head down to WordPress we can get the external IP.

74
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,070
So this is the public IP address that we're going to use.

75
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,060
So just before we go there you can see the instance say that it's running on.

76
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,050
You can see the container instance ideas as well.

77
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:39,880
I can see the task definition has been launched from and then what you're saying here is then can the

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,280
information that you can associate with a container.

79
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,340
So there's lots more information that's not being configured.

80
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,130
And then under mySQL again here there's not much information is being configured in this other

81
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,980
than the password.

82
00:06:53,410 --> 00:07:00,670
So let's take this IP address and I'm going to open a tab and here's our WordPress site.

83
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm just going to call this site one.

84
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,700
Give it the user name of digitalcloud.

85
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,050
I'm going to use that for the password as well confirm that it's a weak password.

86
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,810
I'll give it a fake email address and let's just install Wordpress and say That's it.

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,310
We now have a working WordPress instance running on a container back on the command line.

88
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:35,880
We could also use ecs-cli ps and then give it the cluster type that currently and this will also

89
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,220
give us some information about what's running on the cluster so we can see that we have a single instance

90
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,320
of this task running Wordpress and minus Q Well and you can see the public IP address.

91
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,560
So that's all we're going to do in this lab.

92
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,940
We're going to leave the resources running and then in the next lab we're going to see how we can scale

93
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,480
our cluster.
