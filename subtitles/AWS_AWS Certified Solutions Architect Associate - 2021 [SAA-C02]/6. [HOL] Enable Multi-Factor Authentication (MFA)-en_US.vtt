00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.330
In this lesson, we're going to add multifactor authentication to our own individual user accounts.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
So let's head over to us.

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.680
I'm in the identity and access management console.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.580
And as you can see, we've already got a couple of security recommendations.

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.080
It's saying that we should add M.F.A. for the root user and for ourselves.

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.940
Now what we're going to do in this lesson is add a method for our own user accounts.

7
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.030
Now, the process is very similar, but slightly different for the root user of actually added a link

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.450
to an IWC article that you can follow if you want to log out and log back in his roots and add M.F.A.

9
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.810
Root.

10
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.050
So that's something you could potentially do after this lesson.

11
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.270
Now it's important to note that we've iam we never need to select a region, so that's something that

12
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.190
pops up in exam questions quite a lot.

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.130
Where you get some kind of scenario, where users are being added to some other geographical area in

14
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.300
the world and you need to know what to do with their accounts and how to set up their accounts.

15
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.020
Well, with IAM, you only ever have the accounts in one place and you can use those accounts with any

16
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.100
region around the world.

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.740
So let's set up M.F.A. for our user account.

18
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.910
I'm going to click on users, select my user account, then click on security credentials and we can

19
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.890
see towards the middle of the screen here.

20
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.200
Next to assigned MFA device.

21
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.190
We don't have any assigned devices, so either technical manage.

22
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.700
We're going to use a virtual MFA device now.

23
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.880
For this, you will need an authenticator app installed on your mobile device or on your computer.

24
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.170
Now I personally use the Google Authenticator app on my phone.

25
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.560
So if you don't already have one installed, install the Google Authenticator app and then click on

26
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.130
Continue.

27
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.950
The next thing to do is click Show QR code.

28
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.020
You'll need to point your phone's camera to the QR code, and it should open Google Authenticator.

29
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.690
Once you've done that and you've got Google Authenticator open, it should be generating a code and

30
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.070
displaying that on your screen.

31
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.760
So what you need to do is add the code that's on the screen right now.

32
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.200
I've added mine and then you need to wait for that code to expire and it'll generate a new code and

33
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.390
you need to add that into the MFA code to box and then click on a sign MFA.

34
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.940
And that's it.

35
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.150
You've now got MFA enabled for your accounts, and you can see that we have an R.N. for the virtual

36
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.840
device here.

37
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.740
So next time you log in, you will also be asked to supply the code from your Friends Occator app.
