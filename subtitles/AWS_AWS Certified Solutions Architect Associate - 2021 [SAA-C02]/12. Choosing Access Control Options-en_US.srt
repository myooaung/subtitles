1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,570
So we've now learned about the different access control options.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:15,220
And I just want to do a quick lab to talk about the choices around when you would use one over another.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,430
So we know that the identity based policies are where we use policies that are attached to roles, users

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:29,230
and groups and then we have bucket policies which are policies that are applied at the bucket level.

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,460
We then have the ACLs and the ACLs apply at the bucket and object level and have less granularity especially

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,610
in terms of the permissions that can be assigned and the uses that they can be assigned to so the account

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,470
level not the user level.

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,390
So those are some key differences.

9
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,440
And then it's even the account or one of these predefined groups as I mentioned before.

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,850
So authenticated users, all users, or the log Delivery Group.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:02,460
Now I want to take you to a Web page where AWS talk about the guidelines for using the available

12
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,810
access policy options.

13
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,950
So that's the title of the article.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,030
And if you come down here there's really a couple of areas that are worth highlighting.

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,930
And that is the use cases for using ACL based policies because there's a few of them and then pretty

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,830
much everything else falls into the category of use a policy applied at the identity level or the bucket

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,000
level.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,960
So with object ACLs there's a few use cases.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,780
One is that an object ACL is the only way to manage access to objects that aren't owned by the bucket

20
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,610
owner.

21
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,850
So you might own the bucket but you provide another account access to upload objects and then as

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,470
the bucket owner you don't actually control or have permissions to those objects and it says here the

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,760
AWS account that created the object must grant permissions using objects ACL.

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,670
And so the restriction here is that the bucket owner cannot grant permissions on the objects that it

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:09,440
doesn't own so there are some use cases where you might want to apply this configuration so Another

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,770
use case is when your permissions vary by objects.

27
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,200
And so you want to manage your permissions at the object level but each object may have a different

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
setting.

29
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,130
So in this case you could use a policy.

30
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,130
However if there's a large number of objects that may become impractical and your bucket policies are

31
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,120
limited to 20 kb so you may find that trying to do that through statements in a policy becomes

32
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,130
unwieldy.

33
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,250
And in that case you can use an ACL.

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:47,350
It does state however that even the object ACL is limited to a maximum of 100 grants. And then the third

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:54,180
use case is when object ACL is control only object level permissions.

36
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:02,080
So you've got one bucket policy but each object has different permissions so in this case rather than

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,370
providing too much permission to another account to actually change the permissions you grant the write ACL

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,320
rights access control permissions on a subset of the objects.

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,600
And that means that that account will then be able to create and write the permissions for those objects

40
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:30,890
without having the access to do that with any other objects and then the bucket ACL level the only recommended

41
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,710
use case is to grant right permission to the S3 lock Delivery Group to write access logs.

42
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,700
So that's it really there's a few use cases for ACLs

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,400
But mainly you're gonna be using policies, identity based policies or resource based policies.
