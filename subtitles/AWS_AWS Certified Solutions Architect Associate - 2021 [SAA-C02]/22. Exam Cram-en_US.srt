00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,840
Welcome to the exam cram for Amazon VPC, so a VPC is analogous to having your own data center inside

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,070
IWC as you get complete control over the virtual networking environment.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:26,370
And if EPCs, logically isolated from other VCs on IWC BBQ's and regionwide, a default VPC gets created

4
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,750
in each region and that always has a subnet in each availability zone.

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,410
By default, you can create up to five APKs per region.

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:43,800
Public subnets Subnet STAT have the auto assigned public IPv4 address setting configured to yes, and

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,460
the subnet route table must have a route to an internet gateway.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,670
When you create a VPC, you specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a side.

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,300
A block of VPC will span all availability zones in the region, and you get full control of who has

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,120
access to the resources inside the BPC.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,180
The names of availability zones are mapped to different zones for different uses, so you can use the

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,900
AC I.D. to identify the actual physical zone.

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,690
So what are the components of a VPC?

14
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,680
We've got subnet.

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,340
These are segments of a VPC IP range where you can place groups of isolated resources and they map to

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:31,380
a single AC internet gateway is the VPC side of a connection to the public internet, and that Gateway

17
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,860
is a highly available managed network address translation service for enabling access to the internet

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,670
from private instances.

19
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:46,290
The VPC router performs all the routing functions in your VPC appear in connection connects you to enough

20
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,340
of a PC using private IP addresses and VPC endpoints.

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,820
Enable private IP addresses to be used to connect to services in the public zone and egress only.

22
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,620
Internet Gateway is used by IPv6 addresses to access the internet and its outbound only.

23
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,400
A hardware VPN connection is a virtual private network that you can connect to your VPC to your data

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
center, your home network or your co-location facility.

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,900
The virtual private gateway is the VPC side of the VPN connection, whereas the customer gateway is

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,310
the customer side in terms of the rules for your IP side of blocks.

27
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,520
The size can vary between 16 and 28.

28
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,300
The side of block cannot overlap with any exist inside a block that's associated with the VPC, and

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,050
you cannot increase or decrease the size of an existing site or block.

30
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,880
The first four and last IP addresses in a subnet are not available for use, and I recommend you use

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,250
the RC 1918 ranges.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,340
A few additional considerations that ensure you have enough networks and hosts big insider blocks are

33
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,350
often better and smaller subnet.

34
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,330
So usually OK, consider deploying your application tiers into subnet.

35
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,800
Split your high availability resources across subnet that are assigned to different Azeez and VPC pairing

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,110
requires non-overlapping side of blocks.

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,390
Consider that in your design, and that's across all the pieces in all regions and accounts.

38
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,230
So in summary, avoid overlapping silo blocks as much as possible.

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,220
What about security groups versus network schools?

40
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,910
Security groups operate at the instance level they support allow rules only the stateful and all rules

41
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,650
get evaluated, and they apply only to instances that are associated with the group.

42
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:46,010
A network ICL operates at the subnet level, supports, allow and deny rules, it state less rules get

43
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,490
processed in order and automatically applies to all instances in the subnets that it's associated with.

44
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,090
Let's go through the various methods of connecting to a VPC.

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:03,050
Firstly, we've got the IWC managed VPN, so this is an IP SEC VPN connection over the internet.

46
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:10,580
It's a quick and easy way to set up a VPN tunnel to a VPC, and it can also be used as a redundant link

47
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,370
for some other connection, like direct connect and support, static routes or BGP pairing and routing.

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,490
And it is dependent on an internet connection.

49
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:25,340
So and it's also subjects, of course, to the performance and the licensee issues associated with the

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,760
incident.

51
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:34,340
You create a AWG managed VPN by creating a virtual private gateway, also known as a V.W on a WC and

52
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,950
a customer gateway on the on premises side.

53
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,930
Next, we have direct connect.

54
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,660
This is a dedicated network connection over private line straight into the IWC backbone.

55
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,410
It requires a large network link into WC.

56
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,220
It's useful when you have a lot of resources and services being used by corporate users in your data

57
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,480
center or your office.

58
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,270
You get predictable network performance and potential bandwidth cost reduction if you use the right

59
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,630
volume of traffic and you get up to 10 or 100 gigabits per second of provisioned connections and also

60
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,880
supports BGP pairing and routing.

61
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,000
Now, on the downside, it may require additional telecom and hosting provider relationships and network

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,810
setups so that can take a bit of time and cost to configure.

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,810
In terms of how you do it, you'll have to work with your data center networking provider to connect

64
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:34,280
into the AWB locations and then you create virtual interfaces for accessing services on IWC.

65
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,560
You can combine direct connect and a VPN connection.

66
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,230
In this case, you're actually using a VPN connection over your direct connect link.

67
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,280
Why would you do that?

68
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,340
Well, you get an encrypted tunnel over your direct connect connection, so it's more secure in theory

69
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,590
at least than Direct Connect alone.

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,190
Of course, you are adding a little bit more complexity.

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,930
And again, you'll have to work with your data center networking provider to set up the Direct Connect

72
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,500
connection.

73
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,750
Next, we got VPN cloud up.

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,680
You connect your locations in a hub and spoke manner using US Virtual Private Gateway, so it's VPN

75
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,690
connections from multiple office locations or multiple data centers that you might have.

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,310
So you're linking your remote offices for backup or primary when access to AWG resources and to each

77
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,170
other because it will route between them as well.

78
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:35,540
It reuses existing internet connections and supports BGP routes to direct traffic in terms of the downsides

79
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,610
is dependent on internet connections again.

80
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,000
And there's no inherent redundancy with cloud type.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,420
You need to assign multiple customer gateways to a virtual private gateway, each with their own BGP

82
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,520
ehsaan and unique IP ranges.

83
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,860
Next, we have a software VPN.

84
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,860
Hey, you're providing your own VPN endpoints and software you have to manage by friends of the connection.

85
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,090
It's a software layer.

86
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,120
It's not a top us provided, but it's something that gives you more flexibility and manageability options.

87
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,080
Of course, you need to design for any kind of redundancy as well.

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,890
So that's up to you.

89
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,260
And that could be a downside in terms of actually deploying a software VPN as lots of different options

90
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,990
out there, and you can also use the marketplace to find an instance with pre-packaged software.

91
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,900
Next up, we have a transit VPC.

92
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,320
This is a strategy where you're connecting geographically dispersed the pieces in a hub and spoke manner

93
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,360
with us, manage VPNs.

94
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,750
So then you have one VPC that's configured as the network transit center for the other VPNs.

95
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,310
You have to define any redundancy that you need across the whole chain.

96
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,000
And there are some third party providers that also offer equipment that can be used with your VPNs and

97
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,250
help you to configure a transit VPC.

98
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:01,050
We then have APEC pairings, so this is when you need to provide connectivity between vehicles and they

99
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,260
need to have that connectivity via a private IP addresses.

100
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,580
You can use the IWC backbone without traversing the internet in this case.

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,550
There's no transdev pairing supported, and we've seen how to actually create a VPC pairing connection

102
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,360
in the hands on.

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,330
We then have VPC endpoints.

104
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,230
There's two different types interface, end point and gateway endpoints.

105
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,940
We have an interface endpoint.

106
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,270
It's an elastic network interface with a private IP that uses DNS entries to redirect traffic.

107
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,700
And you can use it with many services, including API Gateway Cloud Formation and Cloud Watch.

108
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,920
And you have security groups, which you can assign as well, so you can apply your security groups

109
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,740
to your interface with a gateway endpoint.

110
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,100
This is a target for a specific round, which uses prefix lists in the routes able to redirect traffic.

111
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,700
And this is for Amazon as free and Dynamo DB only.

112
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,050
You can't use security groups, but you can use VPC endpoint policies.

113
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,120
Lastly, we have flow logs.

114
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:06,660
These capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces and the VPC.

115
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,890
The Flow Log data is stored using cloud watch logs or Amazon free, and the flow logs can be created

116
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,850
at different levels.

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,290
The VPC level subnet level or the network interface level.

118
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,240
And that's it for this exam crime.
