Hi, guys, welcome to the Advanced I Am section, so I've put this towards the end of the course because

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.940
I wanted you to use I am lots before you actually got to this point, because that means you now really

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.570
understand.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.300
I am you should understand users and rows and groups and how to use policies as well and how to apply

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.510
them.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
So now we're gonna delve mostly into the ferry behind a lot of that and get to a few more the facts

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.770
that you need to understand for the exam.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.540
So it's a bit more slide based, this section.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.020
But I really need you to make sure you understand these facts for the exam, because, again, you can

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.220
have some quite tricky questions coming up on security related topics.
