00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.450
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.550
In this lab we're going to create a high availability WordPress solution with Elastic Beanstalk

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.590
.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.540
Now everything that you can see inside this orange rectangle is the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.200
So that means it's going to be provisioned by Elastic Beanstalk.

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.270
The RDS database we're going to create manually through the console and there are some advantages

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.900
to doing that.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.990
You can then use the RDS database with multiple environments and manage it independently of Elastic

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.950
Beanstalk so when we create our Elastic Beanstalk environment it's going to provision an application

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.050
load balancer and auto scaling group and EC2 instance.

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.930
And once we've uploaded our code which we're going to create on on a developer client or in this case

12
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.040
we're actually going to use an EC2 instance it will then provision WordPress install the WordPress

13
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.020
into the RDS database and create an elastic file system a mountain that file system and that's where

14
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.210
it's going to store its code.

15
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.570
So that's what the solution looks like.

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.590
And we're going to create exactly the solution with the only difference as I mentioned before is we're

17
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.650
going to use an EC2 instance on Amazon rather than an external clients.

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.880
And the reason being just that I don't want students coming from a Windows machine and some from a Linux

19
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.710
machine and some from the Mac machine and maybe the commands don't work or you know some utility is

20
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.420
not installed.

21
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.440
So let's just use an Amazon Linux 2 AMI and then the commands are going to be the same for everyone.

22
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.620
Up to you, you can choose whatever you want.

23
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.730
So that's the environment we're going to build out. Now I am actually going to be working through an

24
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.670
AWS article and the plus for you is that that means that you can refer to that article if anything goes

25
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.180
wrong.

26
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.810
Of course there's still support through the forum as well and you can contact me if you need some specific

27
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.430
help.

28
00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.340
But using an AWS article and tutorial from AWS really helps because that means that you can reference

29
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.290
back and work out what went wrong if something went wrong.

30
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.780
And this one can be a little bit tricky if you make any mistakes anywhere it's not going to be very

31
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.990
forgiving for you.

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.890
So let's get over to the console and start building this out.

33
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.520
This is the AWS article that referred to before and obviously the link will be available to

34
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.920
you in the course downloads.

35
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.770
So we're going to follow this quite closely.

36
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.130
There'll be a few differences but we're largely going to follow through this article.

37
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.330
And the first thing we're going to do is launch a DB instance in RDS. We're in the RDS management

38
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.650
console and I'm just going to choose create database.

39
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.820
I'm going to choose mysql and I'm going to choose free tier.

40
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.410
And the reason being what I would do is it will actually stop us from doing a multi AZ deployment and

41
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.380
a few other things but it keeps it within the free tier for you so reduces cost.

42
00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.790
Now we can change this to multi AZ later on. For the other settings we need to call the database

43
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.790
DB and you do need to call it that.

44
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.860
And I'm just going to put in my master user name is digitalcloud and I'm going to save that as my password

45
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.310
as well.

46
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.290
I'm going to leave this one in my default VPC and I'm going to let it create a new VPC security group

47
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.330
and all other settings are going to stay the same except the database name which should be DB And the

48
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.780
port is going to be 3306 because this is mysql so that's all the options I'm going

49
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.750
to remove deletion protection and create database while the database is being created let's head over

50
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.870
to EC2 now the thing I want is to show you is I've already created an instance and this is where

51
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.450
we're going to be running our commands from.

52
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.300
So I've given it S3 full access because I do need to move some data into S3 and I've given

53
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.410
it access to my Web access security group so that I've got ports wanting to open for SSH. If we

54
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.080
now go down to security groups we'll see this security group called RDS launch wizard.

55
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.250
Now this was created by the launch wizard and it allows port 3306 from my IP address this is

56
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.380
my public IP address at home.

57
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.930
Now what I want to do is I want to change this.

58
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.970
And the reason being I'm not going to connect into this database is actually going to be my elastic

59
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.730
beanstalk environment that connects to this database.

60
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.230
So what we could do is we could give it the IP of our elastic or the security group of our elastic beanstalk

61
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.240
instance but we don't actually have that yet.

62
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.380
The other way of doing this and this is what is actually shown in the article by AWS is to use the security

63
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.690
group itself.

64
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.330
So we're going to select RDS launch with a security group and now anything that's a member of this

65
00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.670
security group will be able to send data on Port 3306 to other instances in the security group.

66
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.620
In this case our RDS instance.

67
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.480
So what we will need to do is add this to Elastic Beanstalk and environment and we'll be doing that

68
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.960
shortly once we've created it.

69
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.000
So I'm just gonna click save that and let's head back to RDS and see how we're getting on.

70
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.040
So it looks like we now have our endpoints and port and you can see the RDS launch was a security

71
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.080
group in here that we've just edited.

72
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.430
So the next task is to go over to our EC2 instance that we're going to use for running commands.

73
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:39.680
I've always already SSH'd into my EC2 instance and I've also logged in as root user what I'm gonna

74
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:49.350
do is make a directory called WordPress dash beanstalk. I now need to run a command to download Wordpress

75
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.440
and all these commands are going to be in the article we're now going to download some code from get

76
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.090
and we should now have these directories so let's just clear the screen to make it easy for you to see

77
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:09.030
what's going on and we now have this source code which came from get hub we've got our WordPress tar

78
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.650
file and what I need to do is extract wordpress so I'm going to run ... WordPress

79
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:27.370
... and so now what we should have is our WordPress directory and we'll now going to move

80
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.830
the WordPress contents

81
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.840
into all WordPress beanstalk photo.

82
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.070
Now bear in mind what I've done here WordPress slash style if you want to get this right you have the

83
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.350
data.

84
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.200
If you follow the article directly it doesn't do that and you just end up moving your directory into

85
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.740
the WordPress beanstalk folder and it doesn't work.

86
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.010
So make sure you put the command line is in just as I have here

87
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:03.010
we can now change directories to that photo and we're going to run this command to unzip these files

88
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:12.220
from the get files that we downloaded into this directory along with the WordPress folder or the contents

89
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.250
that we extracted from the WordPress directory.

90
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:25.050
So I'm going to run this and then we can run this command to see if the directory structure looks the

91
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.710
way it should do.

92
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.660
And that looks good to me that looks like it does in the article.

93
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:36.770
If you don't have tree just run yum install tree dash why we're not gonna go to the elastic beanstalk

94
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:45.000
console and create so elastic beanstalk environment now if I just go over to this article what you'll

95
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.790
find is if you scroll down to launch an Elastic Beanstalk environment there's a link here and you can

96
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:56.730
open that and it just takes you straight to the wizard and actually fills out the application name and

97
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.410
environment named for you.

98
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.980
So that's good to make sure that you get it right.

99
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.690
We then needs to choose the platform and in this case PHP is the option because this is Wordpress and

100
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:12.300
we can leave sample application because we're actually going to upload our code later on and we can

101
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:20.160
choose review and launch and we now need to choose crates app and now it's gonna go off and actually

102
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.090
create our environment.

103
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.210
And that would take several minutes to complete.

104
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.110
So that took several minutes to complete and we now have a healthy environment.

105
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.010
And if we want to we can have a look at this link here and open this up and sure enough we've got our

106
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.150
congratulations

107
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:39.540
message saying that we've got our PHP app running and what we want to do now is you remember that

108
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:48.480
we updated RDS security group so that it would only accept connections on Port 3306 from

109
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.220
members of that security group.

110
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:57.360
So what we need to do now in order to enable our instance to attach to RDS instance is we need

111
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.450
to add the RDS launch wizard to the list of security groups that it's a member of and we can choose

112
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.050
apply.

113
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:10.080
Now what you'll notice is it tells us that each of your existing EC2 instances will be replaced

114
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.570
and your new settings will take effect then.

115
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:20.400
So we can confirm this and if we now go across to EC2 just choose instances and we can see that

116
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.760
we've got this tutorials environment one that's running and so we'll keep an eye on this and it should

117
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.560
get terminated and then a new instance will be replaced we'll replace it.

118
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.580
And that instance will have the new settings and of course in your Elastic Beanstalk environment when

119
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.770
this Elastic Beanstalk environment is complete you'll have your code stored somewhere and it doesn't

120
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:46.410
matter if your instance is replaced because the code is stored outside of the instance and Elastic Beanstalk

121
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.990
then gets your environment back up and running again.

122
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.410
So that's all good.

123
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.600
Now let's click refresh.

124
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.360
It's still not happened yet.

125
00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:00.630
We could go back to our environment here see what's happening now and we can see the information events

126
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.740
happening and suddenly very quickly change to environment update completed.

127
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:11.440
So let's go back and see what's going on in EC2 and we can see we have another one being initialized.

128
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.050
So we now have the replacement instance being initialized and I think very soon the other one will get

129
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.750
shut down and there we go it's time to shut down already.

130
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:27.310
So while this is happening you'll find that your environment changes to warning in a minute because

131
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.110
obviously there's no instance running in the new instance will take a while to register with the load

132
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.230
balancer.

133
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.410
Sure enough they go a hit refresh and it says it's helped Environment Health is transition from green

134
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.200
to yellow and it tells us the elastic low bouncer has no healthy instances.

135
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.630
So we had over here we can see load balancer.

136
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.880
Well let's go to our target group and choose targets and it's now healthy.

137
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.710
So that didn't take very long.

138
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.450
Let's just make sure that it's the right one.

139
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:55.810
Yeah.

140
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.220
So that's good.

141
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.910
It's it's healthy now so it shouldn't take long for this to go back to green.

142
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.710
There we go.

143
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.780
Environment is transition from yellow to green.

144
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.500
So that's great.

145
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.220
So that's completes it.

146
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.510
That was pretty fast.

147
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.910
Go to instances now we should see that we have this healthy instance running the next thing we need

148
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.340
to do is configure our environment to connect to our RDS instance.

149
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:23.200
Now you will need to go to RDS and you'll need to make sure that you get a copy of this endpoint address

150
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.240
and you need to know your port.

151
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.140
You also need to know your username and password for your database.

152
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:35.890
So what we do is we go to tutorials environment in plastic beanstalk we choose configuration software

153
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.100
and we collect that modify button then we come down to environment environment properties and what we're

154
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.870
going to do here is we're going to enter these environment properties.

155
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:54.600
First one is RDS underscore DB underscore a name and this should be a DB then we've got RDS underscore

156
00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:01.740
hostname and this should be the endpoint of database instance.

157
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:10.310
We then have RDS underscore port and this should be 3306 if you chose mysql then

158
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:18.810
RDS username which in this case should be digitalcloud and I'm going to just copy that

159
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:26.950
to my clipboard and then we have RDS password and that should also be digital cloud

160
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.450
so we can click apply and it's going to update the settings and while that's happening what we're going

161
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:39.140
to do is head back over to our command line where we actually need to make some modifications to a couple

162
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.380
of files so we're back on the command line.

163
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:49.550
I'm just going to clear the screen and what we need to do is nano dot Eby extensions slash dev and it's

164
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:55.960
dot config and what we need to do in here is we need to scroll down to here where it says my IP and

165
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.110
that's the loop back address.

166
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.820
We don't want to use to loop back address.

167
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.450
We want to specify the address we're going to connect from.

168
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.470
In my case I'm just going to open this up so we can connect from anywhere you can make this more secure

169
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:16.700
by specifying your IP address and we can save this file and then going to edit the file dot Eby extensions

170
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:26.020
slash ESFs dash create config and what we need to do in here is we need to specify the VPC I.D. and

171
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.100
the three subnets.

172
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.790
So what other days just backspace this head back to the console.

173
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:42.030
Let's go to virtual private cloud I'm going to look at my VPC and I'm gonna take the idea of my default

174
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.260
VPC and I'm going to pace that in and then I'm gonna come down here and I'm going to backspace this

175
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.310
one out.

176
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:56.670
Go back to go to subnets and these three subnets are all part of that VPC.

177
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.050
So you need to take the ID of each subnet

178
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.310
paste that in and then do the same.

179
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.650
Again

180
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:16.060
and that's all three subnets and we don't need to change anything else so let's just save this file and

181
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:22.330
we now need to run this command to create a zip file with all our code in it and that's created that

182
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.640
file in the directory above.

183
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.780
So we just change to the directory above.

184
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.150
And we've now got this WordPress dash beanstalk dot zip.

185
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:39.830
Now I'm just gonna copy this to a bucket on S3 so that I can then just download that to my machine

186
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.880
and upload the zip file from there to beanstalk.

187
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:54.740
So I'm going to copy WordPress dot dash beanstalk dot zip to S3 colon slash slash DCT company and hit

188
00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:01.710
enter and that's all file uploaded go over to S3

189
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:11.620
and we have the DCT company folder here and the wordpress that's dash stored far that I just downloaded

190
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.780
so I'm just gonna download that to my machine.

191
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:20.470
We can now head over to our elastic beanstalk environment and let's just hit refresh here and it's gone

192
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.120
back to green.

193
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.430
So that's all good.

194
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:28.630
Let's upload and deploy our code and I'm going to choose this WordPress dash beanstalk dot zip file

195
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.940
and choose deploy.

196
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:37.810
So what's happened is we've now uploaded our code from our client which happens to be an EC2 instance

197
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:45.280
but could be anywhere into elastic beanstalk and it's then going to deploy that code onto our environment

198
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:51.610
and that includes putting WordPress on this instance and connect it into a database deploying an air

199
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.880
force file system and mounting it to our instance.

200
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.350
So let's go back to the console and have a look and see in EFS what's going on.

201
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:05.770
So I'm just going to choose EFS and sure enough we've got a file system here and we can say it's

202
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:12.550
got three different availability zones and it's in the state of creating and if we go over to our EC2

203
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.040
management console we should see that we've now got our tutorials environment running. Well that's

204
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.060
been running for a while so that's nothing new there.

205
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.250
But let's go to cloudformation and see what's going on.

206
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.220
So in cloudformation we have an update in progress.

207
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:33.120
We can go to events and we can see what's going on and so far so good.

208
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:39.210
So that took several minutes but the update is complete now so we can see everything's completed successfully.

209
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.410
Let's go to our environment.

210
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.520
And I just refreshed out a second ago and it all looks green so everything is healthy.

211
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:52.000
Let's try going to this link so this takes us to the WordPress set up and we should now be able to put

212
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.590
in some information systems.

213
00:16:53.590 --> 00:17:05.020
Call it my WP Eb site for elastic beanstalk and we're just going to use the we're just gonna use using

214
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:09.160
a nail and then I'm going to leave the password as it is.

215
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.200
Copy it to my clipboard.

216
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.730
... testing dot com and install Wordpress

217
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:29.370
and sure enough that's worked so we should now be able to log in our password, and there we are in WordPress.

218
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.360
So that's really great.

219
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.070
It looks like it's all worked well.

220
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.860
I hope it's worked well for you.

221
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:40.790
Let's just go back over to the diagram to have a look at the logical view of what we've just created.

222
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.310
So what we've done is we've created an elastic beanstalk environment.

223
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.600
It's provisioned a load balancer an auto scaling group and an EC2 instance.

224
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:55.370
We've then manually created an RDS database and then we've created some source code and that source

225
00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:01.490
code has been uploaded loaded to beanstalk and beanstalk is then deployed that source code which had

226
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:07.280
WordPress in it and it also had the directions to create an EFS file system to store the source

227
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.680
code on and that's all worked.

228
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.000
So that's fantastic.

229
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.010
I hope it works well for you guys.

230
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.740
Now remember you do need to follow this step by step.

231
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.810
So just go through my guidance in this video.

232
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:24.980
If you've had any problems look into cloudformation that's usually where you'll find some some good

233
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:31.640
information about what's failed or if not go into the event log within elastic beanstalk and you can

234
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.050
often find some task events there that may have failed for some reason.

235
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:41.300
If you have any other problems of course go to the forum or message me directly and hopefully we'll

236
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.880
get you working now if you'd like to there's a few additional tasks you can do that are in the article.

237
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.460
So for instance you can modify your auto scaling group through elastic beanstalk so that you have multiple

238
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.800
instances running so feel free to go and play around with that you could also enable multi AZ for your

239
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.210
database and play around with failing over and stuff like that.

240
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.830
But otherwise the only thing that's left to do is to clean up our environment.

241
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:10.730
So let's head over to the console and what we can do is in our elastic beanstalk where we can choose

242
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:20.140
actions and terminate environment and we'll need to copy the name of the environment paste that in and

243
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:26.890
click terminate and if we're going to cloudformation now and refresh we should see a delete in progress.

244
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.970
Now don't forget that we provisioned something separately.

245
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:38.470
So we'll have to also go back into RDS and delete our database.

246
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:46.620
And if you have enabled deletion protection you're first going to modify, choose to remove deletion

247
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:53.020
protection, save it, and update immediately. And then you can go in and delete. In this case we just choose

248
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.490
that we acknowledge and type "delete me"

249
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.650
and that should delete all the resources as always.

250
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.800
Best advice is to go into EC2 just make sure that everything's been deleted.

251
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:12.510
In cloudformation as well and make sure you don't have any extra resources.

252
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.340
So hope you've had a lot of fun guys.

253
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.300
See you in the next lab.
