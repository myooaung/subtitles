00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,500
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,720
This lesson, we're going to look at cash and behavior settings, and we're going to go into cloud front

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,610
and create our own distribution.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,770
I'm locked into my account.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,650
I've got cloud front open, which you'll notice is global.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,230
And then I've also opened up.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,490
As right now, the first thing we're going to do is create two buckets.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,890
I'm going to call this one origin one.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,630
And then I'm just going to give it some random letters and numbers.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,720
And I want this to be us east one.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,250
So you should do the same.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,520
And click on Create Bucket, and the reason we use U.S. East one is when we create our cloud for distribution.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,140
If we've just created our buckets, it can take time for the DNS names to propagate.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,140
So if you use East one, that's fine.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,070
But if you use of regions, sometimes you'll find that cloud front starts redirecting you to the.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:07,150
S3 bucket, rather than retrieving the falls, so that's because the DNS names on updated, so now I'm

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,180
creating another bucket.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,700
This one is origin, too.

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,130
Again, it's going to be in US East one.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,140
So let's create that bucket.

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,510
Now, let's go back into the origin one.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,870
I'm going to upload a file that files Choose My Beach or JPEG.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,420
Upload that file that's come out of here.

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,950
And then it's go to Argentina and we're going to upload a different file.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,920
So in this case, I have a copy for file here, so let's upload that file.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,390
And that's done.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,460
So that's great.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,500
Let's go back up a level and we're not going to change anything else, we're not setting any permissions.

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,390
Let's create a distribution.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,010
Click on Get Started.

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,880
So origin domain name.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,120
We now choose our bucket name.

33
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,520
So this is why you can choose your origins and you see the various types and you got free elastic load

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,190
balancers, media package and media store.

35
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,830
We're going to choose our origin one bucket.

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,710
I'm not going to put in a path and I am going to restrict bucket access.

37
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,250
So this is where we can use origin, access identity.

38
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm going to choose, create new identity and it's going to create one for me, and I wanted to update

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
the bucket policy as well.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,270
So it's going to do that automatically.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,560
We'll have a look at the policy in a moment.

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,870
Who scroll down this is where the viewer protocol policy is, so we can enable HDTV and HD https redirects

43
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,820
any HDTV connections to HD tapes or force HDTV only, and it gives us a warning here because that means

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,630
you will block any traffic coming in over HDTV.

45
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,580
I'll leave the default to scroll down a bit.

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,980
You can change things like the cache policy policies say we'll look at that a bit later on.

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,350
And also the origin request policy.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,940
We're going to leave those for now.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,880
This is where you restrict viewer access.

50
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,180
You can use signed you URLs or sign cookies.

51
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,470
We'll leave that off for now coming down.

52
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,370
You can also choose the price clause so you can change between the best performance or just have certain

53
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:10,910
regions.

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,050
I'll just go with us, Canada and Europe only now.

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,710
A.W. SWF comes up quite a lot in the program.

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,770
So you know that Aswath is a web application firewall.

57
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,350
You can create access control lists and you can attach those to cloud front.

58
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,940
So it's a great way of preventing known malicious attacks and doing so right at the edge there, where

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,650
the connections are coming in from the internet.

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,640
You can also specify a C name here so you can have your own alternate domain name rather than using

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,040
the default domain name of cloud phone.

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,240
You could also specify certificates and import through ACM.

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,730
You can specify a default route object, so if you have like an indexed or HDL file, you can specify

64
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,310
that here and that would be returned by default.

65
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,680
We're not going to do that.

66
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,390
We're just going to come down and create our distribution.

67
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,800
We'll see now that the distribution is in progress, so it can take a little while for that to actually

68
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,350
complete.

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,720
And then once that's complete, we're going to test and see that we can access our beach or JPEG file.

70
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,980
So I gave it a few minutes and we now have a state of enabled.

71
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,970
And let's go over now and see if we can connect to our distribution.

72
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,830
So I'm going to copy the domain name paste site into a new tab and then put in South Beach Dot JPEG,

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,210
and then we actually have a JPEG file.

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,430
Now, if you do try it without beached or JPEG, what you will find is probably there's nothing there.

75
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,860
And that's because we don't have a default document.

76
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,580
But the good thing is that beach shot JPEG is working, so that means origin one is actually the one

77
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,810
where we have that JPEG file and that is actually serving this content.

78
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,670
So let's head back over on the origins page.

79
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,390
We can create an origin, and in this case, I'm going to choose Origin two.

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,110
And then you can enable some of the other options here like we did before.

81
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:15,250
Now what we do want to do is restrict market access, create a new origin, access identity and also

82
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,600
update the bucket policy.

83
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,410
So just make sure you got those free selected and click on Create.

84
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,490
Now let's have a look at the buckets and see what's happened there.

85
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,080
If we go to Origin one permissions, scroll down and you'll see that cloud font has automatically updated

86
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,320
the policy, so it has the origin access identity.

87
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,340
It's an allow statement for the S3 gets object on this specific resource, so that looks good.

88
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,060
Now let's go and check Origin two permissions.

89
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,290
Scroll down.

90
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,970
And sure enough, it also has its own Origin Access Identity statement.

91
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,620
So coming back, the next thing that I want to do, I have an origin now, but I need to specify a way

92
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,950
of directing certain requests to that origin, and we're going to do that through behaviors.

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,140
So I'm going to create a behavior and this behavior is going to be four star MP full and it's going

94
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,490
to go to origin to.

95
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,400
We can then specify the protocol policies and HTTP methods.

96
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,070
All of these other settings, if we want.

97
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm going to leave all of those as defaults.

98
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,070
Click on Create.

99
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,910
So we now have a path pattern defined, which means the default is going to go to S3 or June one.

100
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,740
But if we have an MP for fall requested, then it's going to go to origin too.

101
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,850
So the next thing to do is go and check if that actually works.

102
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:50,100
So back on our page here, I'm going to backspace this beach dot JPEG and put in DCT or MP for and hit

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,460
enter.

104
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,420
And sure enough, it's going to load this video.

105
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,880
So that works.

106
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:03,330
It successfully loads the video, but then it also will go back to the JPEG that comes from a different

107
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:03,750
bucket.

108
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,250
If we want it to as well.

109
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,950
So that's part patterns in action, and this can come up quite often on the exam, which is why I wanted

110
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,810
to show you practically how to use it.

111
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,640
So we've cloud front.

112
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,620
You can also generate error pages.

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,160
You can set up restrictions such as geo restrictions.

114
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,400
So if we click on Edit here, you'll see that you can restrict and use a whitelist or blacklist based

115
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,000
approach based on country cancel out of their.

116
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,000
You can also invalidate, so this is where you can invalidate in objects.

117
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,580
And this means it's going to remove it from the cache.

118
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,290
You do have to pay for these requests.

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,610
So I'm actually done with this now, so I'm going to come back and I'm simply going to disable my distribution.

120
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:53,450
Now, if you work with Cloudflare before you'll know that it then takes several minutes for the distribution

121
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,350
to be disabled.

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,220
And then once it's disabled, you're able to go in and delete it.

123
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,030
So don't forget to come back and delete your origin.

124
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,710
And that's it for this lesson.
