00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:08.150
We're now going to launch an instance into a different subnet and a different availability zone.

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:16.480
So let's go here and we're going to choose the ap-southeast-2b availability zone and everything else is

3
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.070
going to be left as defaults

4
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.660
and I'm going to click launch.

5
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.780
And while that's launching Let's go down to

6
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.680
snapshots and we have this these snapshots now we've named them.

7
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.990
So we've got the data volume and the reef volume.

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
And what I'm going to do is I'm actually gonna create a volume from one of these snapshots.

9
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.830
So I'm going to copy the snapshot ID, go to volumes and create volume and I'm going to leave

10
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.630
the default volume type and size.

11
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.410
I mean I could reduce that down but that's okay.

12
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.020
And in this case we're going to put this in 2B and then for here I can paste in my snapshot I.D. and

13
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
I searched for and found it and we can see our label on their base of volume.

14
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
So I'm going to choose that snapshot I.D. and then click Create volume.

15
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.560
So we now have our additional volume here which is 100 gigabytes in size that we've just created from

16
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.090
our snapshot.

17
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.790
And that's in availability zone 2B the same as our new instance.

18
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.830
So what I'm going to be able to do now is attach this volume and it will come up with this instance

19
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.010
because it's running in the same availability zone.

20
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.690
If I only had an instance running in 2A we wouldn't find any options here.

21
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.740
So again and we're just going to leave the default and that's attached.

22
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.630
Now we could obviously go and log into this instance and mount the file system and log onto that directory

23
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.360
again but I think you get the idea we would see the same data that we had from before as we took the

24
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.720
snapshot after trading those files on the slash data mount point.

25
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.020
So we're just going to go back and terminate our instance.

26
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.230
Now that was just a very quick lesson just to show you how you use a snapshot to migrate an EBS volume

27
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.120
into another availability zone.

28
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.890
And that's the key.

29
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.930
That's what we've done there we've basically said well we want to move in and EBS volume from one AZ

30
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.900
to another AZ.

31
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.390
So how can we do that.

32
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.870
Well, we'll take a snapshot of the EBS volume and then we'll create a volume from that snapshot.

33
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.750
And what we're actually leveraging there is the fact that the snapshots are stored on S3 which

34
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.040
is a regional service.

35
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.340
So even though EBS volumes only exist in a specific availability zone, because our snapshots are

36
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.220
on S3

37
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.910
we're then able to restore the snapshot to any availability zone within the region.

38
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.290
So let's just terminate this instance and in the next slide what we're going to do is create an AMI

39
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.930
from our snapshot of the volume that we took earlier and then launch an instance from that AMI.
