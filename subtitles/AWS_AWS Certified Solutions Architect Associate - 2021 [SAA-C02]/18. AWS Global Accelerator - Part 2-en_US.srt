1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,920
I'm in the AWS management console.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:10,820
Let's go to services and we go down to networking and content delivery and choose Global Accelerator.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:17,090
So before we start configuring global accelerator what we need to do is launch our instances so all

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,870
application endpoints.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,480
The first one I'm going to do is in U.S. West 1 North California.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,430
And what I'm going to do is launch an instance it's gonna be a Linux 2 AMI.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,630
It will be a T2 micro and I'm going to put in this user data.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,480
So what I'm going to do here is all I'm gonna do is just update this to us west 1.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,870
So this instance is in us west 1.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,940
And that's that's basically what's going to be on the index.html when we connect to this web

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,330
server.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,700
So let's us know which endpoint we're connecting to and let's just go through to security groups.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,120
I need to give it web access which in this case all I need is port 80.

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,220
Let's launch and now we're going to do the same with us east 1 .

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,510
So Linux 2 AMI.

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:14,440
And then let's put in us W to into this user data and again just make sure you've got a inbound rule

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,990
for Port 80 your security group.

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:22,540
And that instance is now going to launch so we can go to our accelerator just before I do that.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:32,110
I want to search for eight AWS Global Accelerator rates pricing and let's just have a look at the pricing

20
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,090
for global accelerator.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:40,000
Now I don't know if there's any credits for the free tier but what you will see here there's a fixed fee

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,650
for every hour you have an accelerator running and that's $0.025

23
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,280
hour.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,870
The other component of the pricing is the per gigabyte pricing so how much data you put through accelerated.

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,820
So we're really not going to generate much traffic at all.

26
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,100
It's gonna be kilobytes if anything.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,920
So I wouldn't worry too much about this pricing but you will pay a small fee for each hour that you

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,300
have you accelerator running.

29
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,840
So just remember to disable your accelerator at the end of the lab.

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,810
So let's go and create our accelerator.

31
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,200
Now I'm just gonna call this my accelerator choose next.

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,630
We create a listener it's gonna be port 80 HTTP.

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,610
It's gonna be TCP.

34
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,100
You can choose to set up client affinity but we don't need that for now.

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,860
And we now need to set up our region.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,100
So the first one was US West 1.

37
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:44,590
And we're also going to set up US West to now the traffic dial controls how much traffic you send to.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
Different regions.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,140
So it's kind of like a waiting and you say I want to send this amount to this region and this amount

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,710
to this region.

41
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,940
Now we're not going to change that.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
So what that will mean is you would be directed to the region that's healthy.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,010
That's closest to you choose next.

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:07,250
And we can now go and add our endpoints and you can choose from an ISP and it'll be an EC2 instance

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,600
or an elastic IP so let's choose EC2 and let's find our endpoint.

46
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,810
So you can see that the instance we just created is actually present here.

47
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,480
And as you can see you have a wait here and the dial that we looked to in the previous screen that controlled

48
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,270
how the traffic is sent to the region but then within a region you can have a weight assigned to each

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
instance that you have.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,930
Now we've only got one instance in each group so that doesn't matter so we'll just leave it as default.

51
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm going to set up my EC2 instance endpoint in U.S. West 2 and there's one EC2 instance and

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
that's all we need to do.

53
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,740
So we can just create the accelerator.

54
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
Now just close that out.

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,020
I did delete an accelerator that I set up a few minutes ago and we can now see that our latest accelerator

56
00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:01,430
has been created and it's an in progress status but straight away we can see that we have our static

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,560
IP addresses.

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,830
So these IP addresses even one of these will direct you to whichever endpoint is...

59
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:16,040
that has to be healthy but is closest to you unless you have those dials set in some kind of way

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,130
to deliberately control traffic one way or the other.

61
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:28,490
Now while this is being set up what I want to do is just go to Route 53 open this in a new tab and

62
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,820
I'm going to set up those records in Round 53. So I'm just going to copy these IP addresses we've

63
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:42,410
got Route 53 go to hosted zones and choose dctlabs.com and I'm gonna create a record

64
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,420
set.

65
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,590
Now if you haven't registered a domain name just use the IP address as you don't have to do this.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,750
But I just want to set it up anyway to make this look like a more complete solution.

67
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,180
So I'm gonna leave this blank up here because I just want the name to be dctlabs.com.

68
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,480
It's gonna be an A type of address that means resolving a domain name to an IP address and we're going

69
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,350
to put these IP addresses on separate lines.

70
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,870
Now we're just going to leave as simple routing policy that means that we'll use round robin.

71
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,290
So it will sort of basically give even these as a response and it kind of just cycle through let's choose

72
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,500
create and now we have our record set.

73
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,100
So that took a few minutes and the accelerator is now showing is being deployed.

74
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,880
And if we just click on accelerator here we can see that we have our end points in U.S. West 1 in and

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,180
U.S. West 2 and they're all healthy.

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,720
That's great.

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,850
So we've got Route 53 set up with the IP addresses of the Global Accelerator.

78
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,390
So what we should be able to do now is let's just go to http:/dctlabs.com and we get

79
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,210
directed to the instance in the US West 1.

80
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:52,890
So that's great.

81
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,040
We know that we've set up Route 53 properly.

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,370
We've set up our Global Accelerator our global accelerator has an endpoint which is healthy and we've

83
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,930
connected to that endpoint so going back to our diagram this is basically where we're at.

84
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,170
We have a couple of IP addresses we resolve dctlabs.com to those IP addresses and we've connected

85
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,000
to an endpoint in our case it's us West 1.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Now what we want to do now is simulate the failure of one of those instances so that we then get directed

87
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,100
to our other instance or other application endpoint just like in the diagram here.

88
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,180
So let's go back and we're gonna terminate one of the EC2 instances so that we then get a fail

89
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,640
over.

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,420
So I'm in us west 1 and what I'm gonna do is this is my instance I'm just going to terminate my instance

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,650
and choose terminate and so that instance is no longer available if we come back and refresh the screen

92
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,620
we can say it's kind of timing out because there is a period of time by the full it's maybe 30 seconds

93
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,790
for the health checks.

94
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:05,050
So the global accelerator needs to identify that the endpoint is unhealthy before it starts routing

95
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,080
traffic to the other end point.

96
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,870
So if we head back in and have a look at our accelerator we can see the endpoints are still all healthy.

97
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,540
So just refreshing to make sure that that's current.

98
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,900
Now once we see that at least one endpoint is unhealthy in this case it will only be one endpoint then

99
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,410
at that point the Global Accelerator will direct us to the other endpoint so we can now see that we

100
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,980
have an unhealthy endpoint.

101
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:38,040
And if we just look ahead into the listener and going to US West 1 and we can see that US West 1 is

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,270
definitely unhealthy.

103
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,770
So let's go back and refresh our page.

104
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,650
And now we go to the instance in US West 2.

105
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,140
So that's exactly what we're expecting in the lab.

106
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:57,510
We've basically gone from this point where we had one healthy instance and that healthy instance then

107
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,700
became unhealthy and using the same IP addresses.

108
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,940
We then were redirected to the second instance.

109
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,130
So that's the way global accelerator works.

110
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:14,730
Just remember this is really good when you want to static ip addresses so even the question in the exam

111
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:20,070
might say something like you need to be out a white list to IP addresses only and you want to be at

112
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,390
a fail over between endpoints in different regions.

113
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,130
That's where a global accelerator is really good.

114
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,680
Another way it's really great is that it directs traffic over the AWS global network.

115
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,860
So wherever you hear about having multiple endpoints and you need to reduce the latency between them

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,770
then because it's using edge locations and the global network then it's actually lowering the latency

117
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,880
for that traffic to your endpoints in different regions.

118
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,550
So those are the kind of things that might come up in the exam.

119
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,200
Now let's just head back one more time to the console because what we need to do now is just go back

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,890
in and delete our accelerator.

121
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,510
Let's go back up to accelerators and going to choose the accelerator and delete and you have to click

122
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,310
on disable and then that takes a few seconds while that's happening.

123
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,390
I've got to go and terminate my second instance.

124
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,040
So just don't forget to clean this all up that's done ran 50 free.

125
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,230
It's just a matter of deleting the record you know going to pay for that anyway and then once the accelerator

126
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,080
is disabled you can go back in and choose Delete.

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
So I hope you enjoyed that.

128
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,270
The AWS Global Accelerator is something that's definitely going to be showing up on the SAA-C02

129
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,180
version of the exam.

130
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,420
So make sure that you are fully aware of what it is and how it works before you sit the exam.
