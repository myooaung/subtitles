Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'm going to cover easy to use the data and metadata.

2
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.950
These are both really important features of two.

3
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.390
So firstly, let's have a look at what user data is.

4
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.480
So let's say we go into the management console and we're going to launch an instance now.

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.810
When we do so on the configuration page, we're able to enter some code.

6
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.550
And this can be our code.

7
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.070
Now, don't worry, you don't need to understand this particular code here, but this particular code

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.900
is actually installing a web service.

9
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.370
Now, the point is that you're able to run this code and it runs the first time the instance starts

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.640
up.

11
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.210
So you can configure certain things to happen through these commands on your instance when it first

12
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.690
boots.

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.330
So in this case, it's actually going to install a web service on our EC2 instance.

14
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.540
Now, easy to use, the data is limited to 16 kilobytes, so there's a certain amount of code that you're

15
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.320
able to run.

16
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.580
If you're using a Windows instance, then you can run batch scripts and PowerShell scripts as well.

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.170
And what we're doing here is, as you can see, we're entering the text.

18
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.360
You can also upload a file as well.

19
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.590
So that's user data.

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.210
Now what is metadata?

21
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.400
Metadata is some information about your EC2 instance, and it's available at this particular address.

22
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.240
So this address, you can run this from a command window on your computer, and it's a local address.

23
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.260
This IP address corresponds to your local computer.

24
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.660
It doesn't actually connect over a network.

25
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.630
It's just finding this information on the computer that you're actually running this on, on your EC2

26
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.200
instance.

27
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.870
So the path is HTP colon slash slash one six nine two five four, and then it repeats one six nine two

28
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.560
five four slash latest slash meter dash data.

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.050
Now, don't worry, you won't have to remember that for the exam, but it's a very useful path to note.

30
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.370
So what do you find when you actually put in this URL?

31
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.780
Well, this is some of the information you can return here.

32
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.040
We're using a command called Curl, which just checks this URL, and if we just put in this path here,

33
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.690
we get a list of information.

34
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.660
And this is data about our instance so we can query any of these different pieces of data and we'll

35
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.890
find some information.

36
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.460
So let's have a look at some examples of what you might find.

37
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.390
Well, in this case, we're putting in the path we saw before, and then we're adding local dash IPv4

38
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.760
on the end and then actually returns the IPv4 private IP address of this instance, and you can see

39
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.390
it here just before the command prompt.

40
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.790
If we run another commands here, you can see this time we're asking for the public IPv4 address and

41
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.100
it's showing us the public address.

42
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.540
So remember the difference between user data and metadata?

43
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.670
User data gives you the ability to run commands when the system is starting and metadata can return

44
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.910
information about the instance that's recorded locally.

45
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.880
And that's really about as much as you need to know for the exam.
