00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.550
Now, as you know, S-3 is an object based storage system.

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.690
Now, sometimes it might be really advantageous to use SQL, the structured query language to query

3
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.360
data and actually find something and retrieve a single object from, for example, a zip file.

4
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.740
So for that, we can use either Free Select or Glacier Select, depending on where objects are actually

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.430
located.

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.800
So let's have a look at a couple of examples.

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
Let's say we have an S3 bucket and we have a zip file in it.

8
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.570
Maybe it's a very large zip file and we don't want to retrieve all of the contents.

9
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.190
But we have a lambda function, and that lambda function needs to look for a specific file within the

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.820
zip file.

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.980
So what we can do is issue an expression which is an equal expression to try and retrieve an individual

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.270
file out of the zip archive and the file gets retrieved.

13
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.980
So it's a simple way of using eskdale expressions to access falls within an actual zip archive in this

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.810
case and retrieving that individual objects rather than the entire zip file.

15
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.370
So that's S3 select.

16
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.490
Now we can do the same with a glacier archive.

17
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.820
So again, we might have a zip file, a lambda function, and we have a similar Esquibel expression

18
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.800
and we get to retrieve a single file.

19
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.210
So the key is to remember that S3 selects and glacier selects are two methods of using SQL expressions

20
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.550
to access objects and objects within objects like a zip file on S3.
