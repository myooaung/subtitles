00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.260
Moving on to Cognito this is about a enabling Sign Up Sign in an access control for web and mobile

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.920
applications. So it provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.880
apps.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.760
Users can sign in directly with a username a password or using a third party provider such as Facebook

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.530
Amazon or Google.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.670
The two main components are user pools and identity pools. So a user pool is a directory that provides

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.860
the sign up and sign in options for the application users.

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:41.880
The identity pools enable you to grant users access to a AWS services you can use them together or separately

9
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.670
called meto works with external identity providers that support simple or open I.D. connect social identity

10
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.140
providers such as Facebook Twitter and Amazon incognito.

11
00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.030
Identity pools provides temporary security credentials to access your apps back in resources in AWS.

12
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.720
So with Cognito you're getting temporary security credentials to access application resources

13
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.210
in AWS and also behind API gateway.

14
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.050
We're now moving on to the key management service so this is a managed service that enables you to easily

15
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.100
encrypt data so it's a highly available key storage management and auditing platform for you to use

16
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.190
and encrypt your data within your applications and you're able to control the encryption of data that

17
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.690
stored across AWS. With KMS you can centrally manage and securely store the keys and they're

18
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.720
also known as customer master keys or CMKs. You can generate the same keys in KMS you can also

19
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.950
do so in cloudHSM or you can import them from your own key management infrastructure on premise. The

20
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.700
master keys in KMS are protected by hardware security modules and we'll see cloudHSM is also an

21
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.300
implementation of a hardware security module.

22
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.490
The difference is or one of the differences is that KMS is more of a sort of managed multi tenant solution

23
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.340
whereas cloudHSM is a dedicated solution.

24
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.570
We'll see that in a minute.

25
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.600
You can submit data directly to KMS must be encrypted or decrypted using the master keys and you can also

26
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.230
set usage policy on the keys that determine which users can use them to encrypt and decrypt data and

27
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.680
under which conditions. So cloudHSM is a hardware security module as well.

28
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.810
But this is a dedicated device for you so it's single tenant so you might use this because you have

29
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.810
some kind of corporate contractual or regulatory compliance requirements that dictate that you need

30
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.900
to have that single tenant solution that's hardware based for storing your cryptographic keys.

31
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.850
So in HSM provides a secure key storage and cryptographic operations in a tamper resistant hardware

32
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.630
device they're designed to security store your cryptographic key material and use the key material without

33
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.380
ever exposing it outside the cryptographic boundary of the hardware itself.

34
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.170
You can use this for lots of use cases such as you know whatever encryption database encryption, digital

35
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.680
rights management, public key infrastructure, authentication and authorization documents, signing and transaction

36
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.280
processing.

37
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.280
So let's look at cloudHSM versus KMS.

38
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.510
So again cloudHSM is a single tenant HSM and KMS is multi tenant.

39
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.100
Another key thing to note here is that the root of trust is customer managed with cloudHSM and it's

40
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:41.270
AWS managed with KMS and the security FIPSv140-2 specification, cloudHSM has level

41
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:49.430
three, KMS Level 2, and in some areas level three and cloudHSM might be used for more third party support

42
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.930
whereas KMS is definitely designed to be worked to be used in the AWS ecosystem with broad AWS service

43
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.790
support. Services we're going to cover now are AWS WAF and Shield.

44
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.120
So we've got the Web Application Firewall and AWS Shield and these help protect resources from web

45
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.870
exploits and the DDOS attacks so Web Application Firewall helps protect web applications from exploits.

46
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.750
Shield provides Distributed Denial of Service attack prevention and you can get 24/7 support from their

47
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:33.450
DDoS response team and is tightly integrated into cloudfront and application load balancer. If you

48
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.420
use WAF the rules run in the edge locations located around the world.

49
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.710
Shield is about managed distributed denial of service so it's preventing attacks or mitigating attacks

50
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.490
that might come your way that's DDOS attacks.

51
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.150
It provides always on detection and automatic inline mitigations to minimize that downtime and latency.

52
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.170
With Shield

53
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.040
there are two tiers.

54
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.470
There's the standard and advanced. So standard

55
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.100
everybody benefits from the standard and it gives you a sort of minimum set of features advanced provides

56
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.690
much higher levels of protection but it also costs more money as well.

57
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.580
So that's it for this exam cram and this is the last exam cram of the course as well.

58
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.980
So I hope you've got lots of value from these and really it was just about bringing some more that information

59
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.090
that you need to go and read into the course.

60
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.160
As much in the course as possible.

61
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.270
Hopefully that's given you some really valuable information to help you prepare for your exam.

62
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.840
And please do go and have a look in the training notes and the e-book as well.

63
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.780
And it's also always worth having a look on the AWS Web site looking at the FAQs and just making

64
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.260
sure if there's any weaknesses in your skill set that you go and identify what those are and then try

65
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.660
and do a bit of extra study on those areas.
