00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,770
In this lesson I'm just going to cover a quick overview of a few application integration services offered

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:15,300
by AWS so starting at the top of the table we've got simple notification service and we use this a few

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,400
times where we've actually used it to send email notifications when a cloudwatch alarm was triggered

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,330
you have topics with SNS, and publishers and subscribers, and we'll go into that in more detail in the

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,800
lesson on SQS which will be next.

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,230
We've then got step functions.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,150
This is a relatively new service it's been around a while but it's it's newer than the simple workflow

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,820
service which is next in the list and I'll talk about that in a second. Step functions provides out of

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,840
the box coordination of AWS service components.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,400
Now you can even use code or you can use a visual workflow editor and it's all about processing workflows.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:02,560
So think of it as a kind of orchestration service. Simple workflow service known as SWF has been around

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,300
for a long time now. For new use cases AWS are recommending that you use step functions wherever

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,430
you can.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,890
However there are some specific use cases for SWF and that is for instance in human enabled workflows

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,150
like order fulfillment.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,320
So think about Amazon.com.

17
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:27,310
They've got people picking up parcels processing them and then putting them back into an automated system.

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,390
And so there are those steps in the workflow where things go from automated to humans doing something

19
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,120
and then you automated logic continues.

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,250
So that's where SWF comes in useful. We've then got the SQS service. Now

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,870
SQS does get covered fairly heavily on the exam or at least there can be some fairly tricky questions

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,160
so we're going to go into that one probably in more detail than the others on this list and it's all

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,800
about message queuing so it's a way of decoupling your applications by being able to place messages

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,980
in a queue and then have other parts of your application infrastructure polling that queue and pulling the

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,830
messages from the queue. Amazon MQ is very similar except that it's based on Apache MQ

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,830
which is open source.

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,450
The key use case for Amazon MQ is when you have an existing environment on premise or in some other cloud

28
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,600
that's using Apache MQ message brokers and you want to migrate that into AWS. That's just a quick

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,900
overview of these services and a few examples of use cases.

30
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,200
What we're going to do now is go into more detail on each of these in the subsequent labs.
