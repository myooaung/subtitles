00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:10.670
And now we're going to cover VPC endpoint services. VPC endpoint services enable you to connect to services

2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.200
that are shared in other accounts or from other VPCs and those services can be private services

3
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.280
that are created by users of AWS or they can be AWS services such as S3 which are publicly

4
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.580
available services which normally you would need some routes over the Internet to connect to them over

5
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.830
a public IP.

6
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.830
So what endpoint services do is they enable you to connect and consume shared services using the AWS

7
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.820
private link backbone which is a secure network connection that doesn't traverse the Internet.

8
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.260
So what we're going to do in this lab is we're actually gonna create our own service.

9
00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.390
So we've got a service provider and this is gonna be a VPC within our account and we're going to create

10
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.480
a web service on it and we're going to create a network load balancer which is essential for an endpoint

11
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.870
service and what we will then do is publish that service and then in our other VPC, our default VPC, we're

12
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.420
then going to create an endpoint which enables us to then consume that service privately.

13
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.860
So this is gonna be an EC2 instance and a private subnet.

14
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.500
And we're going to connect from our instance here in a public subnet so this could just as easily be

15
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.990
in a private subnet because we're only using private IP addresses to connect to the service.

16
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.470
It's purely within Amazon.

17
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.760
Nothing goes to the Internet.

18
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.210
So let's go to the console and we're going to create our endpoint service

19
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.850
so we're in the AWS management console and we're going to go to VPC and here you will find endpoint services

20
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.370
and we can click creates an endpoint service.

21
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.990
Now the first thing it's going to do is ask you to create a load balancer and we can just click on the

22
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.830
link here to create a light balance and opens a new window.

23
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.760
Now this has to be a network load balancer.

24
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.180
Now we're just going to call it myNLB and I want this to be an internal load balancer and port 80

25
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.610
is fine and I'm going to just select the ap-southeast-2a subnet.

26
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.240
In fact this one excuse me this one should be in the custom VPC so make sure we put this one in your

27
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:45.170
custom VPC because this is the service provider and in here I'm going to select my private subnet and

28
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.800
click on Next.

29
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.410
And we'll now create our target group just going to call it TG1 and the protocols TCP I'm going

30
00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.290
to change the health check to port 80 and put it in my index.html

31
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.960
and we'll just change the healthy thresholds to now we don't have any targets yet we're just going to

32
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.370
create so the load balancer is being created and we need to create our instances so the first one I want

33
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.220
to create is going to be the service provider the web server.

34
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.460
So I'm going to go in and select my custom VPC.

35
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.400
I remember we put this in the private to a subnet because that's where our load balancer is gonna be

36
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.190
looking for this instance.

37
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200
And I'm going to select the S3 full access.

38
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.690
I am wrong and we're gonna go down to advanced details and we're going to paste in the same code we've

39
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.400
been using for quite a few labs now to set up a web server and give it a name

40
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.890
so with the user then data enter.

41
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.310
Let's click on Next go to security groups and let's select our web access security group which gives

42
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.390
us the HTTP inbound from any source which we need and we'll click on launch

43
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:28.060
so that's our private instance we now need to just put a simple Amazon Linux instance in a public subnet

44
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.660
and all of them are public in way a default VPC here.

45
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.190
And I don't need to do anything else

46
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.850
and let's just go through we'll need to connect to this over the Internet.

47
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.660
So I need to assess each access I'm a click launch instances.

48
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.360
And so we have these two launching I just want to go down to target groups and register my instance

49
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.190
in my target group.

50
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.170
So they would go back to that one in and that's registered and that's just going to take a few minutes

51
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:08.850
now to connect but we have the load balancer in now so if we come back here I'm just going to refresh

52
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.030
this page by basically starting again and we can now see the load balancer and there's a few options

53
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.790
here we can see only one availability zone is included.

54
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.970
AWS recommend that you select all of your availability zones

55
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.880
require acceptance for endpoints that means to anyone who wants to consume the service we actually they

56
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.470
actually have to put through a connection request and then we have to accept it and I'll leave that

57
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.940
defaults and create the service

58
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.280
so just going back to the diagram quickly we've just created our web server that's going to be running

59
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.220
Apache and it's going to have a web page that we can connect to using curl from our instance here and

60
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.800
it should show us a bunch of data from the index.html with the name at the end and we've put

61
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.500
our load balancer in front of that and created this endpoint service.

62
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.240
So what we need to do now in our default VPC we need to actually create this endpoint so that our instance

63
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.910
in the public subnet here can connect to this endpoint service.

64
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:22.220
So let's go back here and we go to endpoints create endpoints and we're going to create needs as select

65
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.840
by name.

66
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.480
So let's just go back quickly to endpoint services.

67
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.500
And here we have the service name and I'm just going to copy that's on my clipboard and then so this

68
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.730
is where we create our endpoints.

69
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.170
Now there's a couple of different types there's an interface endpoint which is powered by private link

70
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.830
that uses an elastic network interface as the entry point for traffic destined to the service and then

71
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.680
you have the gateway endpoint which means you end up with a target in your round table for traffic destined

72
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.840
to the service rather than an Ina.

73
00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:00.640
And I so if you look at AWS services here you can see quite a lot of services and their user interface

74
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.620
or gateway type.

75
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:10.500
So if you select DynamoDB for instance here it will tell us that a rule will be created in our route table

76
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.700
and if we select an interface type such as EC2 just which availability zones we want to enable

77
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.280
this endpoint for, what we want to do here is we're going to create we're going to find our service

78
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.620
by name I'm going to paste in my service name I'm going to click verify it's been found we can see only

79
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.980
has the one subnet available and we can come down to security groups and just choose our web access

80
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.800
security group and create endpoints

81
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.920
so we need to go to the endpoint services and in here we need to look for endpoint connections and we

82
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:02.380
can see that the state here has pending acceptance so we can go in and accept this connection request.

83
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.890
So now when we come back here it's still saying pending sometimes it takes a few minutes to update.

84
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:18.270
So meanwhile let's go back to our instances in EC2 and I just want to get the public IP address of

85
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.130
this instance that we can connect to

86
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:32.240
so I'm in the console now and I'm going to SSH into our public EC2 instance

87
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.750
and let's go back.

88
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.020
So we want to grab the DNS name of the endpoint service.

89
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.230
So I'm going to copy this to my clipboard and then we're going to head back to the command line and

90
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:55.680
I'm going to hit and paste in the VPC endpoint service DNS name.

91
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.280
And there we go.

92
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.400
So this is the index.html file on our web server.

93
00:08:59.580 --> 00:08:59.810
We've got.

94
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.230
Hi this is Tricia.

95
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.750
At the end.

96
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:07.230
So that's the instance that we just created and what we've done is we've connect since that instance

97
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:16.890
over the private backbone directly from one VPC into another using a VPC endpoint and connects into

98
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.850
an endpoint service.

99
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.920
So that's creating an endpoint service.

100
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.840
Now let's just go back to the console.

101
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:35.180
It's probably worth understanding the different types of services that are available as interface or

102
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.730
gateway endpoints for the exam.

103
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:45.740
So I just understand the different services that you are likely to see and hear and what we can do now

104
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:54.720
is I'm just going to cancel out of here and we can delete our endpoints and we can delete our endpoint

105
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.350
service

106
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.560
and then we can go for and delete instances

107
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.640
and load balancer

108
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.140
and of course our target group and that's everything reset.
