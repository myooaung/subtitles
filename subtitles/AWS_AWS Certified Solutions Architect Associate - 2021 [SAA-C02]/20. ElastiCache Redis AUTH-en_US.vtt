This is just a very short, very lecture, there's a particular fact you do need to know for the exam

2
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.300
about redis so you might see an exam question that pops up that asks you how you can password protect

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.070
a Alastor Cash Radice cluster.

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.720
And the way you would do that is using what's called the Orff command.

5
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.620
So there's a duty up here.

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:33.080
So it uses tokens and it enables readies to require a token, which can be a password before allowing

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.720
clients to execute commands, improving security.

8
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.780
You can require that users enter the token on the token protected server so it can be forced, you can

9
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.300
make sure that the only way to access that ready server is by entering the password.

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.500
Now, you probably don't need to know the specific API parameters, but these are the apre API parameters

11
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.940
that need to be used.

12
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.370
And you use these when you create your replication group or cluster.

13
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.140
But you can also enable authentication on existing Redish cluster also by using the API.

14
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.460
So just watch out for that one.

15
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.080
It can pop up in the exam.

16
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.550
So you'll know that if a question comes up asking how you can password protect a server, think about

17
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.900
tokens, think about redis auth because some of this terminology might come up as an answer.
