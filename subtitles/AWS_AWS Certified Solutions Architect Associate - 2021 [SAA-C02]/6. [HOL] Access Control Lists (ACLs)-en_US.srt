1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,320
In this lesson, we're going to have a look at access control lists on Amazon S3 and the S3 console.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:18,880
I'm going to click on my Buckethead DCT cloud storage and under permissions, we can see the access

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,980
control list just a bit further down here.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,620
Now, as you can see, there's a warning telling me I can't actually enable public access because it's

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,240
disabled at the bucket level.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,540
So the first thing I want to do because what I want to do as an exercise in this lesson is actually

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,780
enable public access for my objects.

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,290
So what I'll first need to do is unlock public access.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,450
Now let's just check the behavior at this stage.

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,210
Let's go to one of our objects.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,800
Copy the URL and then put it into a browser window.

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,880
And I get an access denied message and that's completely expected.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,270
So what I need to do is go back up to my bucket level here.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:06,430
Choose permissions, click on edits under block public access and d select this option.

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,890
Click on Save and then confirm.

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:17,110
So now it's been confirmed if we just scroll down to Access Control List and let's edit the access control

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,470
list.

18
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:25,240
Now, note that there's a few different options here for the grantees, so a grantee is either the bucket

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,390
owner, everyone or authenticated users.

20
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:35,800
So anyone with an IWC account who has authenticated or the free lock delivery great for storing log

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,250
files.

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,870
So those are the only options and then we have list and read and so on.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,650
So there's a few permissions and a few options for grants.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,290
It's not hugely powerful, like a bucket policy or an identity and access management policy.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,280
Now this is the ACL at the bucket level.

26
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,980
Remember, there's also an ACL at the object level, so I actually don't need to enable list access

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,670
to my bucket to enable direct access to my object.

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,130
So in fact, I'm going to leave this as it is.

29
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,260
Let's click on objects.

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,840
Choose one of my objects.

31
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,800
Go to permissions and then edit here.

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,970
Here I can enable read access for everyone.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,460
That's public access for my objects.

34
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,130
I have to click on a checkbox here to understand what the impact is of this change and then click on

35
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,610
Save.

36
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,740
Now, let's go back and refresh our screen, this time I can see the object, so it's now public.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:43,200
Now another way you can achieve the same outcome is you can select an object, go to actions and make

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,680
public.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,750
Click on Make Public.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,440
And that's done.

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:55,450
So now if I go into this object, what you'll be able to see under the Permissions tab is that we've

42
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,690
given Reed access exactly the same thing.

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,790
So just as with the other file, we should now be able to access this one and we can see the image.

44
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,810
So that's how you work with ACLs.

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,420
Now let's just go back up to our bucket level and permissions.

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,060
And another thing which is worth noting is the cross accounts access.

47
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,830
So let's click on Edit.

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,180
And at the bottom, you can see access for other IWC accounts, this is a common use case for using

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,960
an ACL.

50
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,870
In this case, you can add the guarantee and you can enter the canonical I.D., which is essentially

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,830
a form of the account's I.D., and then give some basic permissions to anyone within that account.

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
So that's all I want to show you for this lesson.

53
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,710
One thing I am going to do is just go back up and put the block public access back on again.

54
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,690
And now the configuration of our pocket is back to the way it was at the beginning of the lesson.
