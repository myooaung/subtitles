00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.460
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.130
Over the next few labs we're going to create some resources using CloudFormation and then Elastic Beanstalk.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.230
So for this lab we're going to use CloudFormation to create some infrastructure.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.530
Now I'm in the CloudFormation management console here and we can see on the left we've got stacks and

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.810
stacks sets and then we got exports and design and we'll talk about those in a minute.

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.380
But before we talk about stacks you need to understand the concepts of templates.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.070
So a template is your architectural design for the infrastructure that you want to build.

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.950
You can create update and delete resources using templates and these are written in JSON or YAML

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.600
languages. CloudFormation can determine the order of provisioning of your resources.

10
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.260
And so you don't need to worry about dependencies it handles that for you.

11
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.900
And there's actually a couple of ways that we can create our template files.

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.260
You can even write them manually or you can actually use a visual designer which is what we see on the

13
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920
left there and we'll have a look at that in a minute.

14
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.420
So what I want to do is just create a couple of stacks in this lab.

15
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.910
So for starters let's just create a stack and have a look through the options here.

16
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.620
So if we have a template already we can choose this option and we can find our template on S3 or

17
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.580
we can upload one.

18
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.820
It's actually got a year earlier when I was looking at previously you can alternatively go to use a

19
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.480
sample template or create a template through the designer.

20
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.750
What we're going to do is choose the sample template and has few options here.

21
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.370
We're going to do the wordpress blog and this is the simple wordpress blog.

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.460
There's also a multi AZ one which we're do in the next lab but I just want to choose wordpress blog

23
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.290
and let's have a look in the designer.

24
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.640
So in the designer it's just sort of crept off screen there.

25
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.950
I'm just going to drag this up

26
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.310
but here are the resources so very very simple.

27
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.200
There's an instance and there's a security group and you know if you had more complexity you could take

28
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.260
components from the left hand side here like you might want to take a some auto scaling and you could

29
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.200
you could pull the resource in so you can take an auto scaling group and pull it in here and you see

30
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.960
straight away it starts creating the code for you and then you would be able to link in your auto scaling

31
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.540
group and configure things up and you do the same for load balancers and pretty much anything you can

32
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.840
you could do you can see the list of services here and it's very very long.

33
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.600
So I'm just going to delete that because I don't need that resource so you can see down here we've got

34
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.880
components and template and this is just organizing the code and you can have a look frame and everything

35
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.700
that you're going to try is defined here including you have some options.

36
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.400
So for instance you can see that there's some allowed values and through the wizard you'll get the

37
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.880
option to choose which instances you want and we can choose between JSON or YAML and it just changes

38
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.100
the code for us in the edits here.

39
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.370
So I don't need to change anything here so I'm just going to close it down by the way a couple of things

40
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.930
you can do.

41
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.180
You can hit this link here actually exports of.

42
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.980
So you get an image of your infrastructure and you can also create the stack here and you can save your

43
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.630
template out.

44
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.210
What I want to do is just close the editor and come back and I'm just gonna do that again.

45
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.920
So then we go here and choose wordpress blog click on Next.

46
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.990
I'm going to call this simple WP and I'm just going to copy this family.

47
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.330
So here the premise is that we can define I'm going to put in the password and I'm going to paste the

48
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.400
same value in all of these and I'm gonna change the instance to t2 micro and you then choose you key pair

49
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.510
and you can modify the SSH location if you want to lock it down to certain IP or IP ranges.

50
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.810
I'm just gonna leave it open it.

51
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.320
It's a come from anywhere you can then choose an IAM role if you want to define permissions for a role

52
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.040
otherwise that we use your user credentials which in my case is fine so I'll continue and you then get

53
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.640
a bit of a summary it tells you what it's going to create.

54
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.900
You can estimate the cost and you can see here the parameters that are going to be passed into the stack

55
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.660
creation process and we don't need to change anything else.

56
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:35.340
So I'm just going to click Create stack and so we can now see that it's in progress and you can see

57
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.390
some of the definition of the stack here.

58
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.660
You can go into events and you can see what's happening and click refresh will you also get an updated

59
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.790
view of what's happening.

60
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.220
You can see the resources that are being created here.

61
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.520
And if there are some outputs then you'll see the outputs.

62
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.900
And again we can look at your parameters and you can look at your template file change that's something

63
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.170
that we're going to cover in another lab but this is a way that you can test and visualize the changes

64
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:17.850
that you're going to make to your infrastructure before you actually put the changes into effect.

65
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.580
So we just need to wait a few minutes now for this to complete and what's happening.

66
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.280
Let's just head over to EC2

67
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.680
and we should be able to see our resources running.

68
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.330
Now the top two here are actually things that I've just got running from some some other work that I'm

69
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.650
doing.

70
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.790
But this bottom one here that's initializing This is the one that's being created now.

71
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.150
So we've got the IP address is being initialized we should be had a copy of that and secure shell into

72
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.360
this instance.

73
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.130
So I want to come online and I just want to secure shell into this instance.

74
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.970
And there we go we can go in Change to route if we want to just to show you that you know with cloud

75
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.480
formation you have full control. You know these resources are yours.. all that's happening is you

76
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.770
are defining the resources that you want to create.

77
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.400
But you take full control of those resources.

78
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.250
So the other thing we should be able to do now.

79
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.590
Let's see if this instance is is ready.

80
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.670
So I put it in the IP address and there's a Linux test page coming out so we know that Apache's installed

81
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.520
and we should be out to access WordPress by going to slash Wordpress and we get this area says the PHP

82
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.400
is the wrong version.

83
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:38.260
So for some reason the template is not updated so it doesn't install a version of PHP which we need

84
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.850
for wordpress.

85
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.360
Now what we could do is we could just use the command line we could uninstall PHP and we could update

86
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.870
it to the latest version and you know that would fix our problem we get WordPress working.

87
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.790
But what I want to show you is how you do that through CloudFormation.

88
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.980
So what we can do for now is we don't need this now let's just kill off this stack.

89
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.820
So we just delete.

90
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:11.990
And I'm going to go back to Stack's, create stack, and I want to find this template and I'm gonna visualize

91
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:18.890
it in the designer and what I want to do is I'm just going to search for PHP and I know that I can change

92
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.980
these values so I'm just gonna change this to PHP 7 0.

93
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:31.500
I'm going to change page PHP bash mysql to page PHP 70 dash mysql and then

94
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.780
D on the end. And I also need to change HTTP to HTTPD24.

95
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.980
So there's a couple of changes that I need to make and everything else stays the same.

96
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.070
And what I can do now is I can actually save this file.

97
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.810
Now I can save it into an S3 bucket or I can save it locally.

98
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:59.690
So I'm just gonna say this locally as simple WP and click on save.

99
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.880
So we have our template files saved.

100
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:09.320
I can now choose create stack and this time I can choose template is ready and then upload a file and

101
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:15.290
I'm going to choose this simple WP file here and it does a quick check on it and then then we can click

102
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.460
next.

103
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:25.730
So what I'm gonna do now is just call this simple WP dash PHP 7. Just so I remember that this is the

104
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:33.530
one that's been changed and I'm gonna copy and paste that password again and change my instance to t2

105
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.390
micro select my key pair and then click next and that's it.

106
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.190
Let's click Next again and then create stack.

107
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:49.050
So it's been a few minutes and it looks like our crate is complete and I just wanted to show you the

108
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.040
outputs.

109
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:56.310
So in this case we have an output and it's actually given us the public DNS to our website.

110
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.090
So if I click on that link this time we've resolved the PHP problem.

111
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.890
So really I just did that to show you how you can then go into the code and make some changes and then

112
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.610
obviously that's had an outcome of fixing the application in this instance.

113
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:19.040
So that's a very simple introduction to CloudFormation and what I'm gonna do in the next lab is actually

114
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:27.600
go into using that complex or highly available scalable wordpress installation using the template that's

115
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.440
available.

116
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.630
And we're also gonna make a few modifications look at change sets and updates.

117
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.540
So what we can do now is we want to just delete this stack.

118
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.410
So again we just go in and click delete and it will clean up all the resources for us.
