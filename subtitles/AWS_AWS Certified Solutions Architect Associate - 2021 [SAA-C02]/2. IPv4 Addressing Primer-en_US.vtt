00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.200
Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'm going to cover a basic primer on IP addressing, and we are specifically

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.390
talking about IP version four, not version six.

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.700
I'll cover version six a bit later on in this section.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.160
Now, what I want to do here is assume that you don't have much knowledge of IP addressing at all,

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.620
if any, and I'm going to start right at the basics now.

6
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.420
It is a really complex subject, so I'm only going to go as far as what you need to know in order to

7
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.190
be competent working with Amazon VPC and with IP addressing in general with IWC.

8
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.650
Now there will be some areas of the subject matter where you may want to go deeper and has lots of resources

9
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.690
on the internet for doing that.

10
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.730
If you wish to to kick off the lesson, let's start with what is an IP address.

11
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.900
Now, let's say we have a web server on the internet and you want to communicate with that web server.

12
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.950
Now, the web server is likely to have some kind of network interface, and attached to that network

13
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.080
interface will be an IP address.

14
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.950
And this is going to be a public IP address in this case because the web server is available via the

15
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.430
internet.

16
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.860
IP addresses are the addresses that computers use to communicate with each other.

17
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.790
So you've got your computer at home and you've got a web browser open and you type in example, dot

18
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.040
com, the address of our web server.

19
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.870
Now what happens now because you've put in example dot com?

20
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.510
But like I said, the computers communicate using IP addresses.

21
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.070
So this is where a domain name system or DNS server comes in.

22
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.780
Your computer will speak to a DNS server, and it's going to ask that DNS server.

23
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.120
What is the IP address, for example, dot com?

24
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.860
Once your computer has the result, it's then able to connect to the web server using the IP address.

25
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.280
So this is domain name resolution where you're resolving a name, a nice, friendly name that you can

26
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.730
remember easily into an IP address, which is less easy to remember, but it's the way computers actually

27
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.020
communicate with each other.

28
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.560
Let's move on to the structure of an IP address.

29
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.610
Now you very likely see an IP address as we've already worked with them in this course.

30
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.920
So an IP address might look like this one nine two dot one six eight dot zero dot one.

31
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.390
This is known as dotted decimal notation, and it's a simple way of actually representing an IP address.

32
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.100
Now, each of these parts between the dots is actually a binary, OK?

33
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.850
So that's where things get a little bit more complex, but you do need to know this.

34
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.550
So what is a binary octet?

35
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.890
Well, octet means that you have eight values, and those values can even be a one.

36
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.420
Or they can be a zero.

37
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.970
Those are the only two options.

38
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.500
It's binary in this small table here.

39
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.600
You can see that in this case, we have ones eight ones, all in a line.

40
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.920
Now, on the left hand side, we have what's called the most significant bets.

41
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.580
That means if a one is in this left most place, it's going to have a value of 128.

42
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.180
If you have a one on the right hand side, that's the least significant bit, and its value is only

43
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.580
one if you have a zero anywhere.

44
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.720
It just means zero.

45
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.490
So, for example, in this address, the third Octa is a zero.

46
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.880
So that means all of the eight bits are zeros.

47
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.660
The one means that all seven bits are zeros and we have a one on the right hand side.

48
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.920
And that equals this least significant bit here on the very left.

49
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.170
We have one nine two well, one nine two is 128 plus 64.

50
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.250
So we have a one and a one and the remaining values of zeros.

51
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.820
And then for 168, we have a one.

52
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.380
So that's one hundred and twenty eight.

53
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.860
Then we have a one and the third place here, which is thirty two.

54
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.060
And then we have a one in the fifth place here, which is eight.

55
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.060
So we have 128 plus thirty two plus eight equals 168.

56
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.120
The reason it's important to understand this binary is when we get to sub messing with variable length

57
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.890
subnet mask, that's coming shortly.

58
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.860
So firstly, let's understand the network and host portions of an IP address.

59
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.580
Every IP address has a network I.D. and a host IP.

60
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.250
The free blue boxes on the left that represent the network IP.

61
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.420
This value will be the same for every computer on this network.

62
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.650
The host IP will be unique for every computer on this network.

63
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.010
As I said before, every IP address will have a network and host IP, but how this is configured does

64
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.430
vary.

65
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.160
Now, how do we know which piece is the network I.D. and which is the host IP?

66
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.010
Well, that's where the subnet mask comes into play.

67
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.680
Where we have two, five, five in this case, essentially where we have a bit.

68
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.380
That is a one that represents the network I.D..

69
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.920
So here we have eight bits that are one, eight bits that are one, an eight bit set of one.

70
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.420
So those first three octopus are all representing the network I.D..

71
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.280
Now, the last October in the orange box is going to be the host I.D..

72
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.780
That's why it's a zero.

73
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.490
So every bits in the subnet mask that is a zero means that's where we have values that can be assigns,

74
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.140
a hosts and every bit.

75
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.890
That's a one.

76
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.720
Those are values that are going to be exactly the same for every computer on the network.

77
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.560
So a subnet mask is an easy way to see which bit is the network and which portion is the host I.D..

78
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.660
So let's look at an example.

79
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.350
We have a one nine two one six eight zero zero network with a subnet mask that looks like this.

80
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:12.200
Now this is 24 bits, a 24 bit subnet mask because we have eight ones in those first free boxes, and

81
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.500
that means it's a 24 network.

82
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.290
It's another way of representing the subnet mask.

83
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.130
And that's the format you'll often work with in IWC.

84
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.080
So on this network, we might have several computers and we can see that they each have different host

85
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:38.000
IDs, but the same network I.D. In this case, the host IDs are one two three four five six and the

86
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.650
Network ID is one nine two one six eight zero for all of the hosts on the network.

87
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.340
We also have something called classes with IP addresses.

88
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.000
Class II looks like this 10 zero zero zero and two five five zero zero zero.

89
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.870
Essentially, you have an eight bit subnet mask, and that means the first assignable dress is going

90
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.590
to be a one.

91
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.910
You can't ever assign zero as an address for a computer on the network.

92
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.590
And the last assignable address is going to be 254 because you can't use 255, which is what's known

93
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.270
as the broadcast address.

94
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:21.990
Now in IWC, there's also a few other addresses that are reserved with a Class A subnet mask.

95
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:30.090
You can have up to 126 networks and each of those networks can have a huge number of hosts.

96
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.470
Six million seven hundred seventy seven thousand two hundred fourteen.

97
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.030
And that's because we have all of these bits here to play with for the host IP.

98
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.760
We then got Class B, which has a 16 bit subnet mask.

99
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.660
First assignable address is one seven two six zero one for this example, and the last address would

100
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.740
be the two five four.

101
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:59.400
Here we have sixteen thousand three hundred eighty two networks, so a lot more networks and the usable

102
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.510
addresses per network has reduced to sixty five five three four.

103
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.730
Lastly, we have a Class C.

104
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:13.560
This has a 24 bit subnet mask and as you can see, the number of networks has now really increased,

105
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:20.610
but we don't have as many addresses available per network, so those are the standard classes.

106
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:27.150
Now there's also something called a private IP address range does a few of these that are reserved for

107
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:27.990
private use.

108
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.530
That means not on the internet internally within your company.

109
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:40.110
We have 10 triple zero to 10 two five five two five five two five five one seven two six zero zero two

110
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:46.500
one seven two three two two five five two five five and then one nine two one six eight zero zero three

111
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.140
two one nine two one six eight zero two five five.

112
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:55.170
These addresses are reserved for use in private networks, so not internet facing.

113
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.330
You can't use these on the public internet.

114
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.120
Things now get a little bit more complicated.

115
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.780
Sometimes we want to vary the length of our subnet masks, and we don't want to stick to those standard

116
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.530
classes.

117
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:14.040
So we use something called classless into domain routing, and this helps us optimize the IP space.

118
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.200
Let's have a look at some examples.

119
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.360
Let's say we have this network here.

120
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.850
We have a 24 bit subnet mask.

121
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.800
We have eight high spits and 254 possible addresses.

122
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.590
The first addresses Dot one, the last is Dot to fly for pretty standard so far.

123
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.100
We then have a 16 bit subnet mask.

124
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.550
So with the same network, we're using a different subnet marked a non-standard one in this case because

125
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.210
one nine two one six eight is typically a Class C network.

126
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:53.480
With a 16 bit subnet mask, we have 16 host bits and up to 65000 534 addresses.

127
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.240
And it looks like this.

128
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:03.500
But what about a 20 subnet mask will here, as you can see, we have a blue slash orange box.

129
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:11.750
And that's because we borrowed some bits from the network I.D. to share them and use them for the host

130
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.200
I.D..

131
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:20.240
That means we now have 12 host bits and 4000 and 94 addresses, so sometimes that's a better configuration

132
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.670
for the number of computers you need to have on the network and the number of networks you actually

133
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.060
need.

134
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.970
And the addresses for this network would start zero one go up to 15 to five four.

135
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:38.990
So that's classless into domain routing or cider, and it's using variable length subnet masks.

136
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.900
In other words, breaking away from the standard and optimizing the amount of networks and hosts that

137
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.690
we have now, I know that's quite complex and hopefully it will make more sense as we go through the

138
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.230
section.

139
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.630
So that's it for this particular lesson.

140
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.810
I hope you got lots of value from that, and I'll see you in the next lesson.
