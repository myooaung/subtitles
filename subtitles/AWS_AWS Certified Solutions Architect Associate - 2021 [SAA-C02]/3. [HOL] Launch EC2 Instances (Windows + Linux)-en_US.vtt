00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.360
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to launch a couple of instances into IWC.

2
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.900
We're going to launch a Windows instance and a Linux instance.

3
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.610
Now what we're going to do is launch them in what's called a public subnet.

4
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.410
Now, the public subnet means that we're able to connect from the internet to our two instances.

5
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.740
So we have within a region, a virtual private cloud and a virtual private cloud is a virtual data center

6
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.160
in which you can actually have your resources.

7
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.810
Now, your resources are essentially private within the VPC.

8
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.600
But accessibility can be public.

9
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.880
So within an availability zone, we have something called a public subnet.

10
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.810
You can also have private subnets, and those mean that you can't connect from the internet with a public

11
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.170
subnet.

12
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.770
You can.

13
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.810
So let's say we have the AWB management console, and what we're going to do is launch an active instance.

14
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.460
We'll create one with windows and one with a Linux operating systems.

15
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.660
Now each instance has a hard drive.

16
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.840
In this case, it's a virtual hard drive, and that's where the data is stored, and that's known as

17
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.630
an elastic block store volume EBS.

18
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.180
We also need a security group.

19
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.970
This determines which ports, protocols and IP addresses we can connect from.

20
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.100
So it functions as a firewall, securing access to our instances.

21
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.450
Security groups can control inbound and outbound traffic.

22
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.960
We also need something called an internet gateway.

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.650
This is attached to a VPC, and it's the way that we can connect to the outside world to the internet.

24
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.210
So when we want to connect in to our EC2 instance, we're actually connected to the internet gateway

25
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880
and then from there to the easy to instance.

26
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.220
So that's just a little bit to help you understand what's going on on the back end.

27
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.780
Now let's go and launch EC2 instances on IWC.

28
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.020
So this is the easy to management console.

29
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.300
Now there's quite a lot going on here.

30
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.890
Firstly, I just want to point out the easy two is a regional service, so we have to select the region

31
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.340
where we want to run EC2 instances.

32
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.750
So I'm in the US east North Virginia, which is US East one.

33
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.290
So on the left hand side here, there's quite a lot of different features, you can launch instances

34
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.390
and view your instances here.

35
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.520
You can look at instance types, launch templates, what requests?

36
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.230
Now there's quite a lot going on.

37
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.730
You don't need to know about all of it now, but we're going to learn about it all in this course.

38
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.440
We've got the images.

39
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.970
The AMA is the Amazon Machine Images, Elastic Block Store, which is the storage volumes that the two

40
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.120
instances use.

41
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.200
And then there's some network and security load balancing and also scaling all stuff we're going to

42
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.590
cover.

43
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.290
So let's not get too deep into that now.

44
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.940
I want to start off simple, and we're just going to launch a couple of instances.

45
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.480
We can launch an instance by choosing this button here.

46
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.930
And once we do that, we have to first select the Amazon machine image.

47
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.040
So remember, this determines the operating system, any pre-installed software and configuration for

48
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.740
your operating system or applications.

49
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.360
Now, to start off, you see a whole list of emails that come from Amazon themselves.

50
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.340
We've got the Linux two AMA.

51
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.020
You can see there's Mac OS, there's Red Hat, Enterprise, Linux, Susie Buntu and Microsoft Windows

52
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.370
Server and many more.

53
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.490
Now also on the left hand side here you can see if you've got your own emails.

54
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.140
We don't have any at this stage.

55
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.970
There's also a marketplace where you'll find some software preinstalled on an am-I and you'll pay a

56
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.310
bit more in your hourly rate for these.

57
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.200
So, for example, you've got Juniper Networks, which provides a firewall or trend micro for security.

58
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.210
So there's a lot of AMS and there's also community AMS, and these are ones that have been shared by

59
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.860
other IWC users.

60
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.820
We're going to go back up to a quick start and we'll be using the Amazon Linux two mine.

61
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.160
So we click on select on the right hand side.

62
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.310
On this page, we need to choose the instance type.

63
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.150
The instance type determines the hardware profile.

64
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.710
So how many CPU's, how much RAM, what type of storage as well.

65
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.830
In this case, the T2 Micro is selected by default, and that's free to eligible, so it's not going

66
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.800
to cost us anything as long as we stick within the limits.

67
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.040
If you want a more powerful instance, then there's lots of options and as you can see, there's different

68
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.700
categories.

69
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.420
We've got the tattoos, then you've got the tea freeze, T 4s, c fours and so on.

70
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.230
Now these are all optimized for different use cases.

71
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.610
For instance, the C range optimized for compute.

72
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.640
And then there's other instance types that are optimized to have more RAM or better storage performance.

73
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.110
So what we're going to do at this stage is just keep with the T2 microarray, because that's fine for

74
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.890
our purposes.

75
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.510
Let's click on next.

76
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.090
And here there's quite a lot that you can configure, but we don't need to change anything.

77
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.950
So all of this will be explained later on.

78
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.970
We're going to just leave the defaults at this stage and then click on next for storage.

79
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:06.100
We have a single volume, which is eight gigabytes in size, and it uses a general purpose volume type.

80
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.320
Again, this is something we'll cover later on in the course, but this is your elastic block store

81
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.740
volume.

82
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.660
Let's just choose next.

83
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.540
We don't need any tanks at this stage.

84
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.460
Let's configure our security group.

85
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.180
I'm going to create a security group called Web Access, and I'm going to put that in the group name

86
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.110
and the description.

87
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.570
So a security group is basically a firewall.

88
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:37.290
It determines the protocols that we can use to connect to our instance, for our Linux instance.

89
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.620
We'll be connecting over the secure shell associated protocol, which uses Port 22, and the source

90
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.360
is any IP address.

91
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.210
So the 0.0.0.0 slash theory means any source address.

92
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.590
So that means we'll be able to connect from our computers at home.

93
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.480
I'm next going to choose review and launch and launch.

94
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.410
At this stage, we don't have a keeper, so we need to create one key pairs I use for connecting securely

95
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.430
to all instances.

96
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.740
So we're going to choose create a new keeper, and I'm going to call this one Cloud Labs Dash Envy.

97
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.330
So I know that it's for the North Virginia region, and then I'm just going to download the keeper.

98
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.350
Now you do need to keep this somewhere securely.

99
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.200
You're going to need to use it to access your instance.

100
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.410
So then we can choose launch instances.

101
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.520
Once the instance has been launched, we can choose view instances.

102
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.550
And here we can see that it's actually being launched.

103
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.520
We're now going to launch our Windows instance, so we choose launch instances at the top right.

104
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:54.340
This time, I'm going to scroll down until I find Microsoft Windows Server 2019 base, which again is

105
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.390
free to eligible.

106
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.810
I'm going to select Stick with the T2 Micro.

107
00:07:59.170 --> 00:07:59.890
She's next.

108
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:06.070
And again, we don't need to make any changes at this point in time so we can click all the way free.

109
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:14.230
And this time under security group, we choose select an existing security group and we choose web access.

110
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.140
Now, Windows actually uses a different protocol for us to connect to it remotely called the Remote

111
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.530
Desktop Protocol, so SSL is not going to be sufficient, but that's OK.

112
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.100
We can click, review and launch.

113
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.600
It's going to warn us that we don't have Port Free, Free eight nine open.

114
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.250
We're going to do that afterwards.

115
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.640
So we just choose Continue launch.

116
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.210
We can acknowledge the existing keypad here and then launch instances.

117
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.730
And now we have our second instance being launched.

118
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.840
Now we do need to make sure that we can connect to our Windows instance.

119
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:58.630
So what I'm going to do is scroll down to security groups, find my security group, choose inbound

120
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:04.210
rules, click on Edit, and I need to add an inbound roll.

121
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.850
And this time I'm just going to type in ADP.

122
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:14.830
It will pre configure the port range for me so that now I'm able to connect to using the remote desktop

123
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.760
protocol, and I want to be able to connect from anywhere.

124
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:26.170
So I choose anywhere, and it will automatically include the ability to connect from any IP version

125
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.640
four or six address.

126
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.650
I don't need version six, so I just keep this one and click on save rules.

127
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.800
So that will now enable the two roles that we need to be able to connect to, for instance, in another

128
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.190
lesson.

129
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:45.640
Now I'm going to come back up two instances, and just so I remember what is what, I'm going to give

130
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.320
these names.

131
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.700
So this one is going to be called Linux.

132
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.640
And then this other one will be called Windows.

133
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.640
So now it's easy to identify in the console.

134
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.480
That's it for this lesson.

135
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.920
We now have a Linux instance and a Windows instance running in the cloud.

136
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.030
And in the next lesson, we'll see how we can connect to them.
