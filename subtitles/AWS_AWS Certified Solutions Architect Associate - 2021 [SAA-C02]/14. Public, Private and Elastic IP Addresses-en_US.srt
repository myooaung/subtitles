00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,560
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,180
You've already seen that there are different types of addresses assigned to our active instances.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,550
So we have public addresses, private addresses and then there's also elastic IP addresses.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,100
So I want to go over the differences between these.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,030
So we have our IWC accounts and in that there's an availability zone.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,700
And let's say we have two subnets within that availability zone and we have an instance and that instance

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,760
has an interface in one of the public subnets.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,280
That interface has a private IP address, and it also has a public IP address.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,890
It then has another interface in another subnet within the same A-Z.

10
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:49,480
It also has an interface and another subnet with a private IP, so a public IP address is a dynamic

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:49,880
address.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,150
What that means is it might change.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,230
So when you stop your instance and start your instance again, it will pick up a new IPv4 public address.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,340
The private address stays the same, but the public address will change.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,550
So that means you got to make sure you don't use that IP address in application code because it could

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,630
change at any time.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,070
So another thing we can do is a sign something called an elastic IP.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,330
Now an elastic IP is also a public IP, but it's a static address, so it doesn't change now.

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,460
Elastic pipes can be assigned to our network interfaces as well.

20
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,990
So what we can do is associate the elastic IP with this network interface here.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,770
So this second address, this public address is an elastic address, and that means it's static and

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,990
it won't change so we can stop our instance.

23
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,840
We can start our instance again as many times as we want.

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,060
That address will always be the same.

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,280
Now what if our instance fails?

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,250
And let's say we have some applications that are pointing at this IP address, what we want to do is

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,710
a sign that IP address to another instance.

28
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,140
So what we can do, we have two options here.

29
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,500
One of the things is we can move the Elastic Network adapter because remember, we can move these between

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,870
different instances within this same availability zone.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,220
So both ionize and IPRs can be remapped to a different instance.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,610
So once we've done that, that means the second instance is now responding to any requests that are

33
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,190
coming in to this IP address.

34
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,520
And of course, you can automate this programmatically as well.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,280
Now, another option is what if you have a failure, but you want to be able to fail over between availability

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,850
zones so you want to be able to protect in case that availability zone fails?

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,600
Well, now we have an instance in a separate availability zone.

38
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,780
It also has two network interfaces.

39
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:57,240
And what we're going to do is move the elastic IP address so IPRs can be remapped across availability

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,630
zones.

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,750
But remember, the elastic network interfaces cannot there within an availability zone, so you can

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,210
remap them to a different subnet in the same A-Z or different instance in the same subnet.

43
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,250
But you can't remap them across availability zones, but you can do that for the elastic IP address.

44
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,670
So let's just summarize the key differences public addresses are dynamic that lost 20 instances stopped

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,410
they used in public subnets.

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,020
You don't pay for them, and they are associated with a private IP on the instance you can't move them

47
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,310
between instances.

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,530
Private addresses are retained when the instance is stopped and they used in both public and private

49
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:34,890
subnet.

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,520
So you always have a private address and then elastic IP addresses are static public addresses.

51
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,950
You get charged if you're not using them.

52
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,970
So if they're allocated to your accounts for unused, then you will pay a fee for them.

53
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,600
They're associated with a private IP on the instance, and they can be moved between instances and elastic

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,530
network adapters.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,980
That's it for this lesson.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Now there is a little bit more ferry, and then we're actually going to get on with using elastic IP

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,760
addresses in the console.
