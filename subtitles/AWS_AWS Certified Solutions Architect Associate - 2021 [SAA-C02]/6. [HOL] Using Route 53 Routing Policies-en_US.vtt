00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.160
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to use a latency based routing policy with Route 53.

2
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.530
Now you're going to need to launch a couple of instances and configure them as a website.

3
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.320
And then what we're going to do is use a VPN so that we can move ourselves around the internet and then

4
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
refresh a web page and see where we get directed.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.390
So the first thing to do is launch a couple of instances minor in Frankfurt, which is in EU Central

6
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.260
one region.

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.850
And I've also got one in US East one in both cases.

8
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.870
What I've done is used this code here as user data.

9
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.020
This is the same code we used earlier on in the course.

10
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.380
And what it will do is create a web page that actually displays the availability zone, so we'll see

11
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.880
where we're actually getting directed.

12
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.120
Now I've already created mine and I've got the IP addresses, the public IP addresses here and I've

13
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.320
tested, and I know that both of these will return the web page.

14
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.980
So all we need to do before we start testing is go to around 50 free and create our latency based routing

15
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.490
policy.

16
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.190
So before I had over there, I'm going to copy the IP address of my first instance, the one that's

17
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.450
in US East, one in Route 53, I'm going to go to my hosted zone.

18
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.390
And of course, you will need a public hosted sign for this.

19
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.270
So I'm going to choose DCT Cloud Labs dot com.

20
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.770
And I'm going to try to record the record, it will be a record.

21
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.760
And the Valley will be the IP address and then for routing.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.890
We need to change to licensee.

23
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.810
And then it's going to ask for the region.

24
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.070
So I'm going to change that to U.S. East one for record.

25
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.150
I'm going to call this US EC2 and create the record.

26
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.380
Next, we need to take the IP address of the other instance, create another record based in the IP

27
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.890
address.

28
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.930
Change routing is a licensee.

29
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.670
This one is in Frankfurt, U.S. EU Central one.

30
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.400
And so I'm just going to call this one EU EC2 and create that record.

31
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.670
So what we can do now is test by checking if we can connect to DCT Cloud Labs dot com.

32
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.070
Now I'm connected to a VPN and my VPN is connected to Mexico, so I should be a lot closer to us east

33
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.460
one.

34
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.740
So let's add a window here based in DST Cloud Labs dot com hit.

35
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.500
And we get sent to US East one.

36
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.980
See?

37
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.260
So now let's just change.

38
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.630
And what I'm going to do is connect somewhere in Europe, so let's connect to Belgium.

39
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.560
And that's it.

40
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.670
We're connected to Belgium.

41
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.810
So let's refresh.

42
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.600
And now we go to EU Central one, see?

43
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.530
So that's simply the latency based routing policy working.

44
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.340
It now knows that I'm closest to EU Central one.

45
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.560
See, so it's sending me to the endpoint, which has the lowest latency.

46
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.920
If I now go back in and maybe I change to Canada, refresh the page and straight away I get sent back

47
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.250
to the U.S. East one S. So that all works as expected, and you can actually also use health checks

48
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.610
as well.

49
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.420
That's optional.

50
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.280
If you have health checks enabled, then that means it's going to check that your endpoint is healthy

51
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.780
before sending traffic to it.

52
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.440
So that will help you to avoid any service not available.

53
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.450
OK, that's it for this lesson.

54
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.320
Now, all we need to do is just go back in and delete all my records and then don't forget to then go

55
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.290
ahead also and terminate your active instances.
