Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:08,690
This is just a very quick lab to actually show you around the eight up U.S. migration hub.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,350
So under migration and transfer, we've had a look at these services.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,400
And what I want to do now is just show you the actual migration hub itself.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,270
And you can see, you know, what it does and what it integrates with.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,950
So we're on the migration hub and you can see you've got the option here to discover.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:32,330
So you can import data, deploy discovery tools and then group your servers as applications so you can

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:39,380
find, you know, groups of servers that are related in their application architecture and group them

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,620
together so that you've got a better understanding of what you need to do with them.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,930
You can then assess so you can get recommendations.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,180
And then you can migrate.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,900
So you can connect your migration tools and then actually migrate your servers and your applications

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,610
and also your data.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,510
And so at the bottom here, you can see what it's integrated with.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,640
So we've got the A.W. as discovery connectors, the IWC discovery agents.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,180
Then we've got the actual migration tools, the DMSO, the estimates, the cloud and GM migration and

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,520
this eighty-eight data, A.S.A. motion.

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,550
And then there's just a mention of some of the migration programs that are available and the documentation's

19
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,060
of Paul.

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,480
So you can on the left hand side here, find the integration's with the different tools, so you got

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,920
service here where you could start importing some service to migrate.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,870
You've got applications.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,600
You've got your data coaxes.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,090
So if you had some connectors out there, then you might be out to see your connectors and their status

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,390
here.

26
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:48,680
And then you've also got some tools where you can import and you can connect your discovery connectors

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,020
and deploy your discovery agents.

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,000
So that's all in discovery.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,080
Then you've got the access.

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,840
So this is where you can actually look at your US assessment tools so you can rightsize your instances,

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
try and work out, you know, what type of instance types you should be using.

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,550
Look at some recommendations and export those details.

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,230
And then down here, we have the actual migration.

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,620
So now we can actually use these services to migrate your applications.

35
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,110
And if you just head down to tools here, you can see this is where you can then connect in the server

36
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,050
migration service and the DMSO Database Migration Service as well.
