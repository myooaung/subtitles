Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,860
So next up, we have these surfer migration service.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,360
So this is what you would use to migrate your virtual machines from on premises into the W.S. Cloud.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,540
Now, the source can be VM where Hyper V or as you're at this stage.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,650
So the source has to be one of those different providers.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,920
And then what you do is you install something called the Server Migration Service Connector.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,770
So that's actually an overlay appliance.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,430
So a virtual appliance which you install on your farm.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,100
And then once that's installed, that then communicates with the server migration service.

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:51,010
Now, the great thing about estimates is it does automated and incremental migrations and it can also

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,990
you can use it to schedule your migrations as well.

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,150
So you can specify when they're going to be migrated.

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,920
Now, this means that you can sort of incrementally migrate your services.

14
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,090
Now, if you've ever done a server migration like this, I've done lots of them in the past.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,710
Same with databases.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,620
You know, you don't want to have to take your database or your server down while you're migrating,

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,100
because sometimes that can be very large quantities of data.

18
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,890
And the network pipe into a W.S. might not be fast enough to do it quickly.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,840
So you want to try and do it automate in an automated and incremental manner.

20
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,330
And that means you can do a lot more testing so you can test the code over process.

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,510
You can cut over to E.S., too.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,970
You can see what you need to do to modify those instances to make them run properly and make sure your

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,050
application works.

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,110
And and then you can sort of repeat.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,920
And you can keep migrating.

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,560
You can keep replicating the data until the point in time when you're ready and confident that you can

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,660
cut over your application successfully.

28
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:02,170
So this can be running sometimes for periods of, you know, days or weeks while you're slowly getting

29
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,900
ready to that point where you're ready to actually cut over your application and go live on a W.S..

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,870
So that's a really cool tool.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,750
So it does these scheduled automated incremental migrations of your life servers from VM where Hiep

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,610
of yours, you're and what it will do is it will create an am I for each of your migrated servers and

33
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,410
then you can launch instances from those itemise.
