There are a couple of ways you can do access control in S3.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.450
One is by using policies and the other is by using access control lists.

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.680
We're going to cover the access control list or ACLs a bit later on in this section.

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.330
However first I want to cover policies so on the left hand side of your screen here you can see a policy

5
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.680
and this is written in JavaScript object notation.

6
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:34.460
JSON, and you can see the version and then you get a statement and there's a security identifier or

7
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.270
identifier for this particular statement.

8
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.200
There's an action which in this case is S3 list for my bucket.

9
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.980
So that is the actual privilege and then the effect is allow and the resource.

10
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.090
And that means the resource that this is applied to, is S3*.

11
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.270
So that means everything in S3.

12
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.590
So if you are granted this privilege by having this policy applied to you you would be able to list

13
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.490
all the buckets in S3 within this account.

14
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
So that's an example of what a policy looks like.

15
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.140
So you can then apply a policy to different ways.

16
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.930
One is identity based policies and the other is resource based policies.

17
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.250
So have an identity based policy you're applying the policy to a user a role or a group.

18
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.390
In the case of users and roles you can directly apply the policy and it's called an inline policy which

19
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.690
means that you write a statement or you write a policy specifically for this role is attached directly

20
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.110
to this role.

21
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.620
The same for the user and the other ways you can create a policy which is a stand alone policy which

22
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.370
can then be used by groups one or multiple groups.

23
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.810
And if you apply a policy to a group that means that every user in that group has that policy applied

24
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.580
to them.

25
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.100
In other words whatever is allowed or restricted through that policy will apply to the user who is a

26
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.350
member of that group.

27
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.620
So that's just a really high level overview of what resource based on identity based policies are.

28
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.200
And what I'm going to do now is we're going to go through some labs and we're just going to you do a few

29
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.270
different use cases for both identity based and resource based policies to show you how this actually

30
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.750
works.
