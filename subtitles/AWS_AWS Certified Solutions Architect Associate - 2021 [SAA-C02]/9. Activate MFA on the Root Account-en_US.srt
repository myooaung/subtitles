Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,940
I mentioned before about the importance of the root account in AWS. The root account has all privileges

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
including to billing.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,010
So even if you create an IAM user and give them full administrative privileges to your account there's

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,810
still a few privileges that they don't get.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,550
But the root account has everything.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,660
So the root account is an extremely important account and it's one that you really need to secure what

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,490
we're going to do in this lab is activate MFA on the root account.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,710
Now in some cases you might see that there's also this option to delete your root access keys.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,840
In my case it's ticked if it's not you can go into managed security credentials choose access keys and

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,770
you'll see an access key here and you'll need to delete it.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,940
There'll be an option on the right hand side to delete it.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,920
We'll talk more about what access keys are later but for now what we want to do is actually go to multifactor

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,790
authentication.  When we talk about multifactor authentication.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,300
We're talking about using more than one type of tool for indication and those different types of authentication

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,640
this can be something you know like a username and password something you have which is a physical device

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,340
of some sort or something that generates a code and then there's something that you are.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,400
Which means biometrics for instance retina scans or fingerprints.

19
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,990
In the case of AWS we need to we're going to use two factors of authentication.

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,260
One of them will be something that we know that's our username and password.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,570
And the other will be something that we have and that's going to be a multifactor authentication device.

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,680
If we choose activate MFA we can see here that we have a few options.

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,750
One of them is a hardware device which will produce a token which you then enter into the console when

24
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,370
you log in.

25
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,770
Alternatively you can use a virtual MFA device and this is what we're going to use today.

26
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm gonna use Google Authenticator.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,010
So I've chosen virtual MFA device and I'm going to choose continue.

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,950
We now get a QR code on the screen.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,780
We have to click show QR codes to get it and what you need to do now is install Google Authenticator

30
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:21,130
on your phone and then you choose the plus and then you choose scan barcode and you hold this up to

31
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:28,060
your monitor and very quickly it's added in your account to the list and you you're now able to generate

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,290
codes what you need to do then is enter the first code that you see on the screen.

33
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:42,520
In my case us eight hundred and then six five to you then need to choose the second code which is shown

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,770
on the screen once the first one expires.

35
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,900
In this case it's eight to seven free free free and then you choose a sign MFA and that's it.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,980
We've now successfully assigned the virtual MFA device and you can always go in and manage this device.

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,060
You can remove it and you can resync it.

38
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,430
Now what we want to do now is see how this thing works.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,350
So I'm going to choose sign out and then I'm gonna sign back into the console and I need to enter my

40
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,010
password

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,870
and to sign in.

42
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,240
And it now asks me for the MFA code so I'm going to type the one that's on my screen at the moment which

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,320
is 0 7 7 5 4 1 and to submit

44
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,420
so you now have the extra factor of authentication on your account.

45
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,520
Even if someone finds out what your password is they're not gonna be able to log in without also having

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,230
your phone that has Google Authenticator installed on it. Back in the IAM console.

47
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,990
We can see that under our security status that we've activated the MFA on the root account and there's

48
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,080
a few more things that we can do to secure our account.

49
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,420
The next thing we're going to do in the next lab is create individual IAM users.

50
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,380
So in this case we're going to create a user that has full administrative privileges to the account

51
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,240
so we can use that for the rest of the labs without having to log in as the root account.

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,340
So remember this is important for the exam as well that the root account is something that you shouldn't

53
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,040
be using on a daily basis.

54
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,820
You only use it when you need to.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,240
You secure it you get rid of the root access keys you activate MFA on the root account and that's going

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,530
to really secure that account.
