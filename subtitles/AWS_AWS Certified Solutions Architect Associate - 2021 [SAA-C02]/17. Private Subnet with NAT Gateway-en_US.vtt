00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.470
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.080
In this lab we're going to create a NAT gateway and we're going to create a E2 instance in a private

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.900
subnet and we're going to see how we can use the NAT gateway to access the Internet.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.510
Now one of the things you may have noticed when we showed this slide in the last lab is that the NAT

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.530
gateway is in a public subnet so to get the elastic IP that it needs to access the internet it must

6
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.610
be in a public subnet.

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.300
So that's the key thing to make sure you get right.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.640
Let's head over to the console and create this configuration so I'm in the VPC dashboard and what I'm

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.290
going to do is go down to Nat gateways.

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.850
She's that Gateway and I'm gonna choose my subnet.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.480
So as I mentioned you want to put this into a public subnet so these free here are definitely public

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.910
subnet.

13
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.720
So I'm just gonna choose one of these and then it asks for an elastic IP.

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.590
Now we don't have one allocated to our account if we did we could just choose it here instead.

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.570
We're just going to create a new elastic IP and create that Gateway and that's it.

16
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.450
You can now see that we have the NAT gateway I.D. so that's awesome.

17
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.180
That's what we're going to use in our roundtable.

18
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.870
Let's click close and we can see that the status is pending so will take a few minutes to actually get

19
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.820
this up to a status where we can actually use it.

20
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.070
And while that's happening let's go and configure our round table.

21
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.020
So what I want to do is go to my round table here.

22
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.240
Aarti 1 So this is the one that's associated with my private subnets.

23
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.040
So these two guys here are my private subnets private subnet 1 and 2.

24
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.200
And what I want to do is go to roots edit roots add rails and I'm going to provide the 0 0 0 0 slash

25
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.560
0 which basically means any address.

26
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.180
So as I mentioned before you have your site a block which is routed locally using the VPC router and

27
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.250
this address range says that for any other IP address if the destination is any other IP address not

28
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.590
within this site a block send it to and we can choose the net Gateway and it's going to send it to the

29
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.960
net Gateway and that's all we need to do.

30
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.300
We can click save rounds so that's done.

31
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.670
Let's head over to the easy to management console.

32
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.730
So I'm just going to open this in another tab head into here and I'm going to choose create instance.

33
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.770
Now I terminated by instances from the previous lab.

34
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.050
So let's just choose to create a new one.

35
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:48.190
And I'm gonna put this into my private subnet 1 choose next next next and let's just give it the Web

36
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.280
access and review and launch.

37
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.580
So that instance is launching now cause we need to be at a connect to that instance.

38
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.960
So I am going to still need a instance and a public subnet if you left your instance is running from

39
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.850
the previous lab.

40
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.530
You should be able to use those but all I'm going to do is make sure this one goes into a public subnet

41
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.430
click free to select existing security group and Web access and then launch so just going back to this

42
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.680
diagram what we've done is we've created and that Gateway we've created an entry in our roundtable to

43
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.590
point to it and we've launched a instance in a private subnet.

44
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.900
Now the only difference from this diagram is we've also launched a bastion host and jump post in the

45
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.740
public subnet.

46
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.520
So what we're going to do now is we're going to SSA each into the jump post SS H from there to our private

47
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.820
instance and then we're going to try and pin something on the Internet to see if it works.

48
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.750
So let's get the public IP of our instance in the public subnet.

49
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.370
This is our jump post and we're going to do SSA Dash 8 for Agent forwarding and put in that address

50
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.960
and we're into that instance.

51
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.310
And now we're going to SSA reach into the instance in the private subnet.

52
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.080
So let's go and get the private IP address and connect in and we're in.

53
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.890
So that's great.

54
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.610
Let's see if we can now paying Google dot com and we can we get a response.

55
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.790
We could do pseudo yum update.

56
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.710
That's why we get all our updates.

57
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.100
So we're on the Internet now.

58
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.470
We can access resources on the Internet from the instance in our private subnet using our Nat gateway.

59
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.450
So that's awesome guys.

60
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.280
Now you know how to use a Nat gateway.

61
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.330
These are definitely recommended by AWB us.

62
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.290
So in most instances you're going to choose a Nat Gateway instead of a NASA instance because of the

63
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.980
advantages we went over in the ferry lesson.

64
00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.180
So let's just go back to our console and what we need to do now is we're going to leave these two instances

65
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.180
running because we're going to be able to use these in the next lab.

66
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.810
But what I want to do is go back to VPC and we need to get rid of our NAT gateway.

67
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.980
Now you do pay for that gateway so you do pay for them being used.

68
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.720
So what I want to do is just delete my NAT gateway.

69
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.530
It does have an elastic IP address.

70
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.490
So what we'll now find is that we have elastic eyepiece and we need to actually release this elastic

71
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.530
IP so we can try and disassociate it.

72
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.710
It might not work because it's actually associated to the Nat gateways.

73
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.990
What you'll have to do is just wait for the NAT gateway to be deletes it and then make sure you remember

74
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.120
to get rid of your elastic IPC don't pay any money so that's it for this lab guys we've covered Nat

75
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.570
gateways and in the next lab we're going to cover Nat instances.
