00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,490
In this very quick lesson, I'm going to show you how you can create your own custom password policy

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,050
for your U.S. account.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,180
So back in the Identity and Access Management Service, on the left hand side, I'm going to choose

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,100
account settings and here I can choose to change the password policy.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,400
Now, note that there is a default password policy.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,690
So even if you don't have your own custom password policy, IWC will still enforce the default password

7
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,260
policy.

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,070
And that says that your minimum password length is eight characters.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,760
You must have a mixture of different character types, and it cannot be identical to your U.S. account,

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,620
name or email address.

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,070
Now, if that's not good enough for you, you can then change the password policy and change it to whatever

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,690
settings you want to apply.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:01,250
So you can increase, for example, the minimum password length you might want to enable password expiration.

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,670
You might want to grant the permission for users to change their own passwords and prevent password

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,360
reuse.

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,550
So that's very simply how you are able to create your own custom password policy.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,370
Now, it's important to note that the ability to change your own password is something that's supplied

18
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,960
through IAM permissions.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,560
So here we have a permission to allow users to change their own password, and that will apply to everyone.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,810
If you don't enable that, you can selectively grant permissions for individual groups of users to change

21
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,530
their password.

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,330
You would do that through permissions policies that you attach to a group or two users.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,450
Now I'm not going to apply a password policy, I'm just going to cancel out of here.

24
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm quite happy with the default password policy for my accounts.
