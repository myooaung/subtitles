00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,220
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to create an IWC organization and add an account using the

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,620
organization, so it's going to look like this.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,660
We have our management account, that's the account that we've been using so far.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,290
In this course, it's going to become our management account because that's where we're going to actually

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,470
create the organization using the management console.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,890
So once we've done that, we have our organization, our management accounts is at the roots of the

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,430
hierarchy now will then create a production account, and that production account is then going to get

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,360
organized into a production a year and later on, we'll be adding a service control policy to our own.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,280
But we're not going to do that in this lesson.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,220
So how do we access the accounts now?

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,100
When you create an account through organizations, you don't actually set a password for the root account.

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,480
You have to go through a process to get access via the root account, which we're not going to do.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,430
Instead, what you do when you create the account is you specify the name of a role.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,370
That role gets created in that account.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,970
We're going to call it organization account access role.

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,330
That account has full permissions in that account.

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,400
So important to understand that when you assume this role, you get full permissions in that account.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,550
Then we've all user in our management accounts will be able to assume that role.

19
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,330
And when we do that, we're using the SDS Assume Role API.

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,310
This can be done through the command line or through the console.

21
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,560
We'll do it through the console in this lesson in the management console.

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,200
Let's go to services and under management and governance, you'll find IWC organizations.

23
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,270
If you don't already have an existing organization, then this is the page you'll see.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
And to create an organization is really, really simple.

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,310
All we have to do is click on this button, create an organization, and that's it.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,840
The organization has been created, and as you can see, we have the route here.

27
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,580
That's the root of the hierarchy.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,380
And this is the management account.

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,030
That's the account we're already logged in with, which is now the management account because this is

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,250
where we created the organization.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,410
So the billing for consolidated billing will take place from this account.

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,320
So the credit card linked to this account will pay for all the resources in the other accounts that

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,980
are linked to it.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,740
So how do we create an additional account?

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,800
Well, we simply click on add an IWC account.

36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,150
We need to give it a name.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm going to call my DCT production.

38
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,410
We need to give an email address that needs to be unique.

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,090
It cannot be the same email address you used for the route account.

40
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,800
Next, you need to specify the I role name or accept the default.

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,610
We can accept the default organization account access role.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,230
This is the role that gets created in the account that's being created now.

43
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,750
So the role will have administrative permissions and we'll be able to assume the role to be able to

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,330
access this particular account.

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,290
Now, another thing you can do is invite an existing IWC account.

46
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,620
So, for example, maybe you have some developers and they have their own accounts and you've decided

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,450
you want some kind of centralized governance management control.

48
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,160
Maybe you want to apply service control policies to them.

49
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,440
So you'd invite them to your organization and then an email is sent to the account owner of that account.

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,800
And if they accept it, their account gets joined to the organization.

51
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,680
Now, in this case, we're creating an account, so let's just go down here to create a WC account.

52
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,340
Now, while this is happening, one thing you'll have to do is go to your email and just check if you've

53
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,640
received a verification email for your organization.

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,640
You will need to verify your IWC organization, and once you've done that, you can sit back and relax

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,770
and wait for your new account to be created.

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,030
I just refreshed my screen and I now have my new account.

57
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,340
So I now have two accounts the management accounts and then my DCT production accounts.

58
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,830
The next thing I want to do is create an organizational unit that I'm going to put my production accounts

59
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,010
in.

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,050
So if I click on route, go to actions and under organizational unit, create new and I'm going to call

61
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,530
this one production and create organizational units.

62
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,090
So now we have a child 0U called production.

63
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:32,700
And what we can do is take our DCT production account and we can move it into the production organizational

64
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,030
unit.

65
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,200
So now we can see the under production, we have our DCT production account.

66
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,630
So what will next be able to do is add service control policies to the production.

67
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,660
Are you to apply some constraints on the permissions available in that account and more on that in the

68
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,230
next lesson?
