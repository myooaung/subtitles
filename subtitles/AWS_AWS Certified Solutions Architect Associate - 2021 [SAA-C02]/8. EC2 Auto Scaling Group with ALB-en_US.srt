00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,680
In this lab we're going to create an auto scaling group and application load balancer and we're going

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,080
to attach the auto scanning group to the load balancer.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,050
So let's head into the console and build out the architecture that you can see on your screen here.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,710
I mean the easy to management console and what I need to do is go down to auto scaling and auto scaling

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,510
groups.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,460
Now you need a launch configuration but if you go to the wizard for creating an auto scaling group it

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,470
actually just starts you off anyway.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,290
So it says step one is to create or select a launch configuration and then step two is to create the

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,670
auto scaling group.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:46,390
So if you choose get started you then have to choose your Amazon then it's 2 am I and you then have

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,960
to choose your instance type and we're going to choose the T micro and you need to call this something

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:58,450
so I'm just going to call the LC 1 I am going to use my I am wrong and I am going to specify some user

14
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,860
data so as with the previous lamps we're going to paste this user data in.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,320
That actually gives our instance a name.

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,590
Now you'll notice under IP address type the default is to only assign a public IP to instances launched

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,050
in the default VPC in subnet.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,650
Well in this case that's what we're doing we're going into the default VPC as it's the only one we have.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,270
So I can leave that as it is.

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,920
I can then go to security groups and choose my web access security group.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,910
And if that's I do have a custom BPC so I'm going to choose this one here which I know it's the web

22
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,150
access security group in my default VPC we can then choose review and we can then create the launch

23
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:44,740
configuration so you can see that the launch configuration defines the EMI you use the instance type.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:53,140
And then some additional details such as the IAM role the tenancy and the IP address type and also storage

25
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,730
and security groups.

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,610
So you define this stuff in your launch configuration.

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,320
Now you can't change your launch configuration you can always delete and create a new one but you can't

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,250
actually modify it.

29
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,670
So let's choose create launch configuration and we have to specify the keeper.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,610
And now we get thrown straight into the wizard for tracing the auto scaling creep.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,630
So I'm going to call this ASG one and we can specify the amount of instances we want to start with.

32
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm going to choose two.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,050
We can choose our VPC and then we can choose our subnet.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,740
So I'm just going to choose two subnets in my default VPC.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,630
If you wanted to you could then go down to advance details and you can attach a load balancer.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,140
We haven't created our load balancing yet so we can't do that.

37
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,290
You can specify the health check grace period which is the amount of time auto scaling weights before

38
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,040
checking in instances health you can see information about monitoring.

39
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:54,550
And it tells us that we're basic monitoring is going to be enabled and we can have incidence protection

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,770
if we want to protect certain instances from scale in events where instances are terminated.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,710
So we don't need to change any of that at this stage.

42
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,900
Let's choose next.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,640
And you now get to configure your scaling policies so you can even keep this group at its initial size

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,180
and what that will mean is we specified two instances.

45
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,820
If an instance becomes unhealthy it will be replaced.

46
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:22,660
So there'll always be two instances or you can use a scaling policy and you can say well let's scale

47
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:31,480
between 2 and 4 instances and let's do it based on CPC utilization and other options include the network

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,410
in and out and the request count per target.

49
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:42,940
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to specify a value of 70 percent and what that means is auto scaling

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,470
will try and keep the utilization at or close to the target value of 70 percent.

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:57,310
You can also use different types of scaling policies such as step policies and when you use these you

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,160
have a bit more granularity in how you can scale out and scale back in again.

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,910
And in this case you can create alarms and you can choose from several different metrics so you can

54
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,710
include disk Io network and CPE utilization.

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,010
Let's go back to our target tracking policy.

56
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,320
So let's go forward and we can configure notifications.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm not going to send one.

58
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,300
We can add tags.

59
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm not going to do that even.

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,280
So let's just go to review and create auto scaling group.

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,650
So the auto scaling group is being created.

62
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:38,140
We can see here that we have a desired capacity of two instances a minimum of two and a maximum of four

63
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,630
and you can look through the activity history here you can see that it's telling us that two instances

64
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,060
are being launched and those instances are not yet in service.

65
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,500
You can look at your scaling policies here and you can edit them.

66
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,420
You can have a look at the instances that are being launched.

67
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,690
There are a whole series of metrics which you can monitor and you can configure notifications as well

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,960
using the simple notification service.

69
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,930
So just cancel on that one.

70
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,060
There is also scheduled actions where you can create scaling policies that happen at specific times.

71
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,860
So you might want to scale just at the time that you know load is going to be increased so if you have

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,620
an event that's happening and you know a specific time that you need to be able to provision or launch

73
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,610
new instances you can use a scheduled action.

74
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,960
So let's go up to instances and we should see are two instances being launched there we go and they're

75
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,230
already in the running state so we can now go and create our load balancer I'm going to create an application

76
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:52,900
load balancer it's gonna be called My Alby I'm gonna specify two subnets in fact and then specify free

77
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,280
just because I'm not sure which subnets might instances were launched into so I'll specify all to make

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,840
sure and let's go to security groups choose web access and for routing I'm going to create a new target

79
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,880
group called T one we're gonna use the instance target type and we're going to leave our settings except

80
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,600
with healthy threshold will be reduced to two and we're not going to register our targets because we

81
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,810
don't want to add the individual targets in we want to connect the auto scaling group and that means

82
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,350
that when additional instances are added to the auto scaling group by auto scaling the low balance it

83
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,700
will automatically know about them you don't have to manually add the men so let's go to create and

84
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:48,670
our life balance is being created we can now go back to our auto scaling group choose actions.

85
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:58,030
Edit and under target groups we can choose target one target group one so that will connect us to our

86
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,340
load balancer.

87
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,670
Classic low balances can be found here or target groups can be found for network low balances and application

88
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,890
load balances while we're in here.

89
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,710
You can see that there's a health check type and it's easy to.

90
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:19,090
You can also have a health check type of EOP which means that the low balance is going to perform the

91
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,430
health checks and we're going to have a lab and go into the details of these and how they work a bit

92
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:32,850
later on in the section so I'm just gonna choose safe and let's have a look at our instances so we can

93
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,410
see that these are in service and they're healthy.

94
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,610
So from the auto screening Group's perspective it sees these as healthy instances they've passed their

95
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,240
easy to status checks and let's head over to low balances.

96
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,940
In fact what we want to do is go to target groups targets and we can see that our targets are in an

97
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,030
initial status so they're going to need a few minutes to become healthy.

98
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,910
So that didn't take very long.

99
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,660
The instances are now both in a healthy status so if we go back to load balancer and get our DNS name

100
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,700
we should find that we're able to connect all our instances and we've got Frida and Mammy.

101
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,680
So there we go we can cycle between these two easy two instances.

102
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,660
So that is our architecture set up it's quite simple really.

103
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,470
We've got our auto scaling group.

104
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,270
We've actually only got two easy two instances at this stage but we could have a maximum of four.

105
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,670
And we have an application load balancer that's connected to the auto screening group and distributing

106
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,170
connections.

107
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,380
What I want to do in the next lab is just explore the scaling policies and a bit more detail and actually

108
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,630
put it into action and show you what happens when we generate some load on the easy two instances and

109
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,370
cause a skating event.
