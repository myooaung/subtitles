I just want to quickly cover off a couple of ways that you can both connect with me and also get support

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,220
as you go through the course, the Q&A forum is a good place to ask questions.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,400
We do have a team of teaching assistants who were there to make sure that all the questions do get answered.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,700
We have a Slack channel, which is a really great place to both connect with me and ask questions of

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,180
the group.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,460
There's quite a few people in there, so there's always answers coming in for whatever question gets

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,850
asked.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,030
Another way to get support is to join our Facebook group IWC Certification Kua.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,870
We've got well over 50000 members in that group and it's a very active place to go and get your questions

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,320
answered.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,200
Lastly, please feel free to reach out over LinkedIn.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,250
It's great to connect my students and I love to see your certifications, so please share them on LinkedIn.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,090
Thank me.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,950
And that way I can share in your success.
