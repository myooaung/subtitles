Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,570
Another method of authenticating in S3 that we haven't spoken about yet is using query string authentication

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,440
which is also known probably more often known as pre signed URLs.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,050
So the use case for this is that let's say you have an object going got jpeg file here.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,140
But let's say you had some videos and we've got a video file there.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,010
So just imagine you have this video file and you want to share that with some people but you don't want

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:41,110
to give them credentials in order to authenticate against AWS and you don't want to allow this file

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,850
to be available to the public.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,520
So you want to keep it secure.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,310
Just this group of people.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,200
So one way of doing that is that you create a presigned URL and then that URL will enable

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:01,520
anyone who has the URL to use it and access the object you can generate pre signed you URLs even manually

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,120
which is pretty tedious or you can do it programmatically.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,720
So in most cases you would programmatically enable your application to generate these URLs.

15
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,300
And what you can do is you can have an expiration on it as well so you can say that it will expire within

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,520
24 hours or whatever it might be.

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,760
So let's just have a look at a Web page here.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,570
And so you can look this up authenticating requests using query parameters and it gives you lots of

19
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,090
detail about how this works.

20
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,320
Now one of the things is it takes an access key ID and a secret I.D..

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:46,040
So in other words it takes the credentials of a user or role from IAM and it uses those credentials

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,580
to authenticate.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,200
So it's quite important to be careful which credentials you use which access keys and secret I.D. you

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:02,240
actually use the other thing as I mentioned before is that you can put a date and then you can put an

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,260
expiry so you can expire this after a certain period of time and it says here that the maximum amount

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,990
of time is seven days.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,680
So that's one to remember.

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,400
So what we want to do in this lab is we're just going to use the command line to generate  a

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,630
presigned URL

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,290
So we actually have this audit document here.

31
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,920
And I would like to access this document.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,950
So let's just say if we can do that straight off so I'm just gonna copy this year I'll open a new tab

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,650
and put it in and we get the access denied message because this object is not publicly available.

34
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,420
So what we're gonna do now we've got to come online here.

35
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,630
I'm just going to first I need to go and get the IP address of my instance

36
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,620
and then we're going to SSH into this instance

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,530
and now if we if we try to list S3 we don't have the option here.

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,330
So we've got a couple of options we can either use a role or we can configure our credentials.

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,180
It's a lot more secure to use a role.

40
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:29,500
So let's just go back and I know I have a role which I can apply to this service so let's just go into

41
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,930
instance settings attach IAM role and go to S3 full access

42
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:45,870
so let's try and reissue that command and we're sure we can see the bucket now and if I want to list

43
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:53,800
inside the bucket just to see my file name I can do this command with the bucket name

44
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,560
and now can see my file name as well.

45
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,140
So what I want to do is I'm going to run a command called aws s3 presign

46
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:13,300
and then going to give the path to the bucket and the object within the bucket.

47
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,110
And then I'm going to add on the parameter expires in sixty.

48
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:30,740
Now this is in seconds so it's a very short timeframe for this URL so we get this huge URL here.

49
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:39,730
And I'm going to copy that and let's head back to safari and I'm going to put this in my new tab in

50
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,230
my browser.

51
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,920
So there we go.

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:51,790
We can see the image file and we've been able to do that even though this is not a public object.

53
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,750
Now we know that this is going to expire in 60 seconds.

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,260
So let's hit a refresh next.

55
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,090
I've given it a bit of time and sure enough it says access denied request has expired.

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,560
So that's set ready for pre signed your URLs.

57
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:13,300
So just remember query string parameters or query string authentication pre signed your URLs so different

58
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,050
terms for the same thing.

59
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,360
And the typical use cases as I mentioned before are going to be where you need to provide secure access

60
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,080
to some objects or buckets within your account to users who don't have an AWP as accounts that they

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,000
don't have an account in

62
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,910
IAM

63
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,270
And you don't want to allow it to be publicly available.
