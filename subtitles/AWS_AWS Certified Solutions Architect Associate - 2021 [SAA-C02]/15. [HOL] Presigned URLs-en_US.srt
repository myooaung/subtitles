1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:13,770
And Free Press on URL is a method of allowing access to users to a specific objects for a limited period

2
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,370
of time.

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:21,180
So maybe you have a certain group of users and they don't have IWC account, so you can't authorize

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,900
them that way.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,200
But what you need to do is just give them a limited time access to some important update, a video or

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,190
whatever it might be.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,970
So S3 priest signed URLs are a good choice there.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,470
You can use the API or the SEELYE to create your free, free signed URLs so you might build an application

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,410
to do it automatically through the API.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,760
Or what we're going to do in this hands on lesson is used to see a line.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,580
And this is the command that you might issue.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,510
So you literally run the command for free priest sign and then you give it the bucket name and the object

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,670
that you want to share, and that will generate the priest on URL, which will look something like this.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,550
You can also specify the amount of time in seconds that you want this URL to be valid for.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,000
Otherwise, it has a default, which I believe is about an hour.

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,650
So let's go to free and we'll see how we can create a priest signed URL.

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,820
So back in my DCT cloud storage bucket, I'm going to upload a file.

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,350
The file is known as Priest Sign Test or HD HTML.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,050
It's in your course.

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,560
Download.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,350
Let's add that file, and by default, we won't be able to access this publicly.

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,340
So if we just choose the file copy, the object URL, go to a new browser window and hit Enter.

23
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,530
And of course, we get an access denied.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,260
Now we want to allow a certain number of users to access this particular objects.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,090
So let's go and do that now.

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,080
Let's run a command using the Seelye and generate a priest signed URL back on the Seelye.

27
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,240
I've already created my command and I'm just pasting it in.

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,650
So the command is IWC as free priest sign as free colon slash slash, whatever your bucket name is,

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,650
slash and then the file name that we just uploaded.

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,870
And mine's going to expire in 60 seconds so I can show you that it's going to work and then it's going

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,920
to stop working again.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,330
So let's say it ends up.

33
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,360
And you can see we get this massive URL.

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,980
We're literally going to copy all of this to my clipboard and back in my browser window.

35
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm going to paste this in and hit enter.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,530
And we can see that we can see this object.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,610
The object is a simple HDMI file that gives us a quick message.

38
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,100
So that's a very simple way of creating a pre signed URL using the Seelye.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,270
Now, of course, this one is time limited to 60 seconds.

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,050
So if I try and refresh now, let's see if we still got access.

41
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,050
And there you go.

42
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:55,190
I refreshed a couple of times and eventually I got an access denied after it is expired so we can see

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:02,000
the request has expired and gives us a bit of information on the expiry time for that precise and URL.

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,860
So that's it.

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,410
It's very simple to use pre signed URLs using the Seelye.
