00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.370
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to create a VPC pairing connection between two pieces in two

2
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.980
different accounts, so the configuration is going to be pretty much what we see on the screen here.

3
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.080
We have our management account in our U.S. organization and our production accounts.

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.250
And we're going to have a VPC in each using these side of blocks.

5
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.830
And then we're going to create security groups and we're going to specify these particular rules now.

6
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.730
Firstly, let's have a look at how we establish the connection.

7
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.710
We need to establish a parent connection between the VP sales, and we can do that in the console.

8
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.090
Then we need to update the roundtable really important that you have a route to your target.

9
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.340
So the root table for this PPC must specify as a destination the site, a block of the other VPC and

10
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.210
the parent's target.

11
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.720
And then the reverse is true over on the right hand side.

12
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.190
Security group rules will ensure we can use S-H and ICMP to connect, and the way we'll test the connectivity

13
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.390
is to ping from one instance to the other using the private IP address.

14
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.740
And that will show us that we're using the VPC parent connection and not the internet.

15
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.430
Now there is a bit of background work you need to do before we get started.

16
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.610
So unless you want to use the default VPC in your production account, you should create a new VPC using

17
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.650
the same ranges I just showed you.

18
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.110
So from the VPC management console, you're going to want to change to DCT production.

19
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.440
Go to your VP CS and then create a VPC.

20
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.100
Now I've already created mine and I have the values for you in a file.

21
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.570
So just open the code Amazon VPC Custom VPC Dash Perraud file and this is the information you need now.

22
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.490
You know how to do this.

23
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.410
You've done it earlier on in this section.

24
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.580
So just create this VPC and add these subnets at your internet gateway your private roots table, and

25
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.390
then we're good to go.

26
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.910
Now, we don't need all of this for this particular exercise, but let's just create a standard as per

27
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.010
the VPC in our management accounts, and then we might use some of these subnets later on.

28
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.540
So let's get started.

29
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
Now I need a couple of pieces of information with my PPC selected in my product counts.

30
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.730
I'm going to copy this on, right?

31
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.920
That's the accounts already, and I'm going to put that into my file.

32
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.870
Next, I need the VPC ID.

33
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.550
And let's put that in the file.

34
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.630
Now we're going to switch back to the management account.

35
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.400
Let's go to pairing connections.

36
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.870
Great pairing connection.

37
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.950
We need to give it a name, let's just call it my peer.

38
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.870
Select the local BBC, which is my BBC.

39
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.630
We can choose another account rather than my accounts, and copy this account like they were pasted

40
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.840
in.

41
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.780
We're going to stick to the same region, but we need the VPC I.D. on the upper end as well.

42
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.910
So that's the one that we copied here.

43
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.160
So let's copy that to our clipboards, paste it in and create the pairing connection.

44
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.240
So it says here a VPC pairing connection PC and that it's got a number.

45
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.370
My here has been requested.

46
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.800
The owner of the remote VPC must accept the pairing connection.

47
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.020
So let's go back and do that.

48
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.790
Let's go to DCC production.

49
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.370
Go to pairing connections and we can see the request pending acceptance.

50
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.140
So just select sit on the left and then go to actions except request.

51
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.680
And we can accept that one, and that's done.

52
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.110
Now, one of the things we're going to need to test is going to be an easy two instance.

53
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.750
So let's launch an easy to instance.

54
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.430
But before we actually launch that one, I'm going to create the security group.

55
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.110
The security group is going to be called VPC Dash Prod.

56
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.400
And these are the rules we're going to set up.

57
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.650
So let's create a security group.

58
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.610
Give it a name.

59
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.890
Let us put that in the description as well.

60
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.720
Choose the correct VPC, and the outbound rule is fine.

61
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.840
For now, all we need is the inbound rules to be set up.

62
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.370
The first rule I'm going to set up is ICMP IPv4, so all ICMP that's going to allow ping requests and

63
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.080
it's going to come from send out 0.02 zero slash 16.

64
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.270
The next rule is S-H.

65
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.850
You can even do custom TCP and put it in the port range or choose a and it'll do it for you.

66
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.010
And same as the one above.

67
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.950
We just want to give it the same addresses.

68
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.230
So this should allow inbound connections from the VPC in the other account and the management account

69
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.070
using from any IP address in the entire side of block.

70
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.440
So we can save the security group.

71
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.530
Now let's launch an instance that uses that security group.

72
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.630
So I'm going to launch an instance.

73
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.700
It's going to be then it's two.

74
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.620
Am I to micro?

75
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.120
Make sure you select your VPC.

76
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.710
I'm going to put it into my public subnet public one.

77
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.450
I let's click on next.

78
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.170
Go through two security group and we're going to select a security group and that's going to be VP of

79
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.620
product.

80
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.230
Click on review and launch and launch.

81
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.210
If you don't have a keeper for this region, which I don't at this stage, then I'm going to create

82
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.660
a new one.

83
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.480
I've called it fraud and they all download that keeper and then launch my instance.

84
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.530
So now let's go back in the U.S. to management console, to the management account, in the management

85
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.850
account.

86
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.930
We need to set up this security group, and we're going to assign that to one of all instances in the

87
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.680
public subnet.

88
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.010
So in this account, we've got two instances running.

89
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.850
Let's go to security groups.

90
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.250
Create a security group.

91
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.340
It's called VPC pair.

92
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.190
That's MGM.

93
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.440
Say I'll put the same in the description.

94
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.420
Select the correct VPC and then let's add the same rules as before.

95
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.940
This time, the block is going to be 10. 1.0 2.0 slash 16.

96
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.540
So now we have the same protocol specified, so we should be able to connect from the prod VPC to the

97
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.450
management of using these protocols as well.

98
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.610
So let's create that security group.

99
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.270
Go back to instances public one a actions security, change security groups and we're going to add in

100
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.730
VP Dash, MGM say.

101
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.310
And the reason I'm not going to remove public web is because we have a role in there allowing access

102
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.910
from the internet support port 22, which we need, for instance, connect.

103
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.150
So with those two added, let's save the security group configuration, and the very last thing that

104
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.410
we don't want to forget is all round tables.

105
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.750
So let's go and do that now back in the VPC console for my management account.

106
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.090
I'm going to go to my main roundtable, choose routes, edit, add.

107
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.960
This one's going to be ten point 1.0 8.0 slash 16.

108
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.680
And it's going to go over a period connection.

109
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.320
We've only got one of those and it's called my PR..

110
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.450
So let's save that switch across to the DCT production accounts.

111
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.730
We need to choose the main mount table.

112
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.780
I didn't label this one.

113
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.140
Let's do it now, but I can see that it's attached to my VPC.

114
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:23.470
So let's go to routes, edit routes and and this one should be for 10 dot 0.00 slash 16.

115
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.310
And again, we're going to specify pairing connection.

116
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.420
It's going to see the same pairing connection and we can save changes.

117
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.150
So that's it.

118
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.840
Hopefully, it's all set up now.

119
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.860
We've updated our route tables.

120
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.580
We've got these two security groups with rules so that we should be able to use these protocols based

121
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.960
on our private IP addresses.

122
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.030
So that's that's the real test here is to use private IP addresses to see if we can connect.

123
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.910
We can definitely ping via the public IP, so if we got our security group rules set up correctly,

124
00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.550
but we want to do it by private IP because that shows that rather than going out to an internet gateway,

125
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:07.930
we're sticking within the private space across the peering connection back in easy to let's select the

126
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.730
instance idea.

127
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.140
We want to copy the private IP address.

128
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.470
I'm going to just put that into my file here and coming back here.

129
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.570
Let's switch to the management accounts.

130
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:23.680
Choose the public one I instance, connect by instance, connect and let me just try and remember this

131
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.530
IP 10 one one two two one.

132
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.990
So let's ping ten point one to one two two one and hit enter.

133
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.130
And then we go.

134
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.590
We get a response that's across accounts.

135
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.560
And it's also across regions and it shows we've got this bi directional traffic going between these

136
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.490
two pieces.

137
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.220
The other protocol we enabled was S-H.

138
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:52.900
So let's just make sure that we can create an SSL connection, send all 1.1 Dot two to one and we can.

139
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.270
Now, I'm not actually going to log in because I would need my keeper and I'd need to specify some more

140
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.170
details as well.

141
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:05.080
But I just want to see that the port is open, and that shows that the security groups are set up correctly,

142
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.300
as well as the underlying networking to allow this traffic over private IP addresses.

143
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.280
So that's really it for this lesson.

144
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:17.650
Now, the only other thing you might want to do is you could practice by doing the same thing and extending

145
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.670
this configuration through to your instance in your private subnet.

146
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:27.430
Use your public subnet instance as a bastion host, you might have to use agent forwarding and then

147
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.030
make sure you can connect buy directly from there as well.

148
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.270
So that's just an additional bit of fun that you might want to have if you want to practice a bit more.

149
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.960
So now that we've finished with this lab, we can actually terminates all instance in the private subnet.

150
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.340
We didn't use that in this lab unless you carried on with the configuration, but we will leave the

151
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.440
public instance running for now.

152
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:53.380
So let's terminate this instance, and then you should go over to your production environment as well

153
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.840
and terminate your in-situ instance there.

154
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.950
And then we're all cleaned up.
