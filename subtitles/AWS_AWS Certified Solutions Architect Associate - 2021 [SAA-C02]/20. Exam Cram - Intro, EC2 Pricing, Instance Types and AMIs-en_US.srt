00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,650
Hello and welcome to the first exam cram of the course.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,080
Now this is a new addition to the course.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,510
Previously I've been giving you links to the training notes on our website and also I provide you an

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,330
e-book.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,300
And both of those resources provide a collection of facts that you need to know for the exam.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,410
Now it's really hard in a purely lab based course to be able to make sure that you remember every single

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,300
individual fact that you need to know.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,900
It's very hard to cover it.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,380
So those are really important notes to read.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,290
But what I wanted to do is bring some of that back into the course so you're not completely reliant on

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,970
actually going out to the training notes and the e-book which we provide to you.

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,340
However I do still recommend that you definitely read those documents there is still a bit more in those

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,090
that I didn't cover in the exam cram.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,490
But these are just a way of trying to bring in some of the key facts you need to know for the exam.

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,350
And there's going to be an exam at the end of each section.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,730
It's relevant to that specific section and it's going to be a pretty fast paced run through of facts.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,440
Now the other good thing about this is it means that you're ready with the information that you need

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,220
to know for the quiz which I'm adding after each exam cram.

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,980
So after every exam cram there's gonna be a short quiz.

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,410
Sometimes it's only going to be a few questions or seven or eight questions and I'm gonna add to those

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:23,970
over time.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,920
But it's just about giving you some knowledge checks to make sure that your remembering the information

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,310
you need to know for the exam.

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,310
Another quick note about the quizzes.

25
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:40,570
The question format in the quizzes is not similar to the exam so they're not the same difficulty and

26
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,180
they're not the same format as the real exam.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,780
However when you get down to the actual practice tests later in the course all of those questions are

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,370
exam difficulty and exam format but the quizzes are really just there to test your knowledge. So that's

29
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,120
it for the intro.

30
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,720
Let's get on with the exam cram, so Amazon EC2 or the Elastic Compute Cloud is a Web service that

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,630
provides re-sizable compute capacity in the cloud.

32
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,750
You have full control of the operating system with EC2 you use key pairs to securely connects your

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,310
instances.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,140
So it's really important to remember what these are and they actually consist of a public key AWS stores

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,160
and a private key.

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,540
And that's what you store on your machine.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,680
Now for Windows AMIs you use that key pair to obtain the password to log onto your instance whereas

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,000
for Linux AMIs the key file allows you to securely connect over SSH and user data is the data that's

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,530
supplied by the user at instance launch in the form of a script we've already used it so we're going

40
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,710
to use a lot more for the course.

41
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:51,040
So remember this is a way that you can run some scripts at startup time for that instance.

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,730
Instance Metadata is information about the instance so you can use this to configure or manage a running

43
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,450
instance.

44
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,050
Now remember we looked at some examples and you can find out what availability zone an instance is in

45
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,240
or what IP address it has in that kind of thing.

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:13,600
Metadata is available at this you URL and user data is available at this URL.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,390
Now there are three key pricing models for EC2.

48
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,750
We've got on-demand, reserved and spot so remember On-Demand is where there's no upfront fee it's charged

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,010
by the hour or second.

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,330
The second is for Linux there's no commitment whatsoever.

51
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,580
So you can launch an instance and terminate it straight away.

52
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,140
And so that's really good for short term needs or unpredictable workloads.

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,830
Remember there's no discounts for on-demand.

54
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:46,120
With reserved you actually commit to a one or three year term and in exchange for that commitment you're

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,460
actually then going to get charged a lower amount.

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,950
So you get quite a big discount.

57
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,220
You can also choose to pay nothing upfront partial upfront or all upfront so you can choose how you

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,490
pay.

59
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,470
You can pay the whole lot upfront is going to be a bit cheaper or you can pay on a monthly basis but

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,740
just pay a small bit upfront or we can pay nothing upfront and just pay on a monthly basis.

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,200
So this is for steady state workloads and predictable usage.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
So workloads that you know you're going to be running over that year or that three year term. With spot

63
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:22,080
there's no upfront fees you're charged by the hour or second as well and there's no commitment.

64
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,340
Now remember the spot is where you have some kind of cost sensitive workload and maybe it's very compute

65
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,460
intensive and you have to be able to withstand interruption because your instances can be terminated

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,960
whenever EC2 or whenever AWS need that capacity back.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,050
So remember this is all about using capacity that's not being used so it's about taking advantage of

68
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,520
unused capacity and getting a cheap rates on it.

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,570
But AWS might take that back and terminate your workload so your application needs to be okay with

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:58,600
that needs to be able to store its data somewhere else store it state somewhere else so that if an instance

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
is terminated it doesn't matter.

72
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,740
We then have dedicated hosts and instances.

73
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,280
So here's the differences between the two.

74
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,300
Both of them use dedicated physical servers.

75
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,180
So you know that the physical server on which you're EC2 instance is running is dedicated to your

76
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,050
account.

77
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:22,060
Now with instances you get per-instance billing whereas we have dedicated hosts who get per-host billing.

78
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,850
Now most of the rest of these features are relevant to dedicated host so you get stuff like visibility

79
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:35,780
of the sockets, host ID affinity between a host and an instance and targeted instance placement

80
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,020
and you can add capacity use an allocation across.

81
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,660
Now these ones are really interesting so you can see the sockets and the cores and you can you can actually

82
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,910
place your instances on specific hosts.

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,590
So why would you want to do that.

84
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,020
Well you might have an application absolutely must have two components of it running on different hosts.

85
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,730
Maybe it's some kind of clustering or high availability or it might be that you need to do that

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,290
because of your socket base licensing for let's say a database service.

87
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,840
So those are the kind of things that can come up in exam question.

88
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,520
Now you don't need to remember all the instance types just remember that there are different instance

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,530
types for different purposes.

90
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,630
So that can be optimized more for compute for memory for accelerated computing for storage and so on.

91
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,630
So the EC2 AMI is the Amazon machine image and this provides the information required to launch

92
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,200
an EC2 instance.

93
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,950
And the AMI includes the template for the root volume the launch permissions that control which accounts

94
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:41,310
can actually launch the AMI, will launch an instance from the AMI, and then the block device mapping so

95
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,890
that specifies which EBS volumes should be attached to the instance or which instance store volume

96
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,390
should be attached to the instance.

97
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:59,100
So the volumes are either instance store or EBS. EBS is persistent storage and in this case EBS snapshots

98
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,830
which reside on S3 are actually used to create the volume.

99
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,350
So when you take a snapshot of an EBS volume it's stored on S3.

100
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,730
So when you create an AMI the AMI uses the snapshot and builds the volume from the snapshot. With instance

101
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,570
store volumes which are ephemeral so non persistent data.

102
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,790
And that means the instance data will be lost.

103
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,210
The data on the volume will be lost when you shut down the instance.

104
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,290
And in this case a template is stored on history and used to create the volume.

105
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,420
Remember that AMIs are regional.

106
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,170
And that's because they use S3.

107
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,000
So because they're stored on S3 the EBS volumes or the snapshots rather that that are backing the

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,070
AMIs are stored on S3.

109
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,260
That means you can launch an AMI from the region in which it's stored so into any availability zone

110
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,170
and you can also copy AMIs to other regions.
