Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.980
In this lesson we're going to talk about monitoring and logging.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.450
So there are two services for performing monitoring and logging within your account.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.950
There are others but these two are the ones which I'm going to talk to you about now.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.010
So those CloudWatch and CloudTrail. We've used CloudWatch quite a few times throughout the course.

6
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.780
So far we've used it for logging.

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.080
We've used it for collecting metrics and sending off alarms so that we know when an instance for instance

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.000
reaches a certain amount of usage of CPU or or some other metric.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.140
So we've used that a little bit but we haven't used CloudTrail.

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.140
Now what I want to do first is just give you an overview of what these two services are and compare

11
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.260
them against one another so CloudWatch is all about monitoring. CloudWatch is about collecting metrics,

12
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.700
log files, and setting alarms.

13
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.800
And there's also a function for events as well so that you can monitor event changes in your account

14
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.690
and we'll look at these shortly.

15
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.030
So it's all about monitoring monitoring your application performance and monitoring your operational

16
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.390
health. CloudTrail

17
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.040
on the other hand is about recording who does what on your account.

18
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.700
So it's auditing and you can therefore think of it as more being in the security space whereas cloud

19
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.490
Watch is more in the operations space. CloudTrail gives you visibility into user activity by recording

20
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.060
the actions that are taken.

21
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.960
Now it's not just users as in people who are logging on with their own individual user accounts it's

22
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.200
also logging what AWS services are doing as well.

23
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.290
So you might have services like Elastic Load balancers or Elastic Beanstalk and a user might have initiated

24
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.630
those but then functions that are taking place as part of the application are also recorded.

25
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.570
So with CloudTrail you're getting an API history.

26
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.820
So that is if you think about any kind of API action that is performed on AWS as you're getting a record

27
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.230
of that activity.

28
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:17.390
So think about creating an instance for it for example when you create an instance you're actually using

29
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.140
an API.

30
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.950
Now it doesn't matter whether you're doing it through the console or whether you are doing it through

31
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.840
one of the other methods like the command line or an API, excuse me, or an SDK, you are still generating

32
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.370
an API call which instructs Amazon as to what to do.

33
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.520
Now all of that activity is therefore logged.

34
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.170
So you are able to keep a complete record of what's happening in your account. With CloudWatch logs

35
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.100
are stored indefinitely.

36
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.710
Now the information that comes through the metrics, not all of it is, and I'll talk about that a bit more

37
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.250
in the next lesson as to the amount of data that's actually recorded and how long it's recorded for.

38
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.210
But when it goes into the logs in CloudWatch it is actually stored indefinitely and in CloudTrail

39
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.210
you can then integrate with CloudWatch and export your logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch and store

40
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.670
them in CloudWatch and you can also perform analysis on those logs as you can see on the bottom there

41
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.780
the alarms take place in CloudWatch not in CloudTrail but you can use CloudWatch alarms for cloud

42
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.290
trial.

43
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.110
And again that's about the integrations between CloudWatch and CloudTrail.

44
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.780
So what we're going to do in the next couple of labs is I'm going to show you through the consoles of

45
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.700
CloudWatch and CloudTrail, we're going to set a few things up and get you familiar with these services.
