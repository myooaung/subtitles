00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.550
We're now going to cover the weighted rounds in policy so the weighted routing policy is similar to

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.890
simple except that you can apply a weight to each record.

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:20.600
So what you do is you create a record so let's call it weighted DCC labs dot com and you create multiple

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.900
records within rule 53.

5
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.950
Each with a corresponding value an IP address of the server but you then specify the weight and what

6
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:39.950
this does is it means that this is the percentage of traffic that's going to be sent to that target.

7
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.890
So in other words Route 50 free is going to respond.

8
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.690
In this case they total 100.

9
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.880
They don't have to but in this case we've got 60 percent 20 percent and 20 percent.

10
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.670
So that means that 60 percent of the time Route 50 free is going to provide this value wonder wonder

11
00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:04.380
wonder one and then 20 percent of the time it's going to provide one of the other values.

12
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.360
Now you can configure health checks but they are optional.

13
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.280
So the way this works then you've got your DNS query to whatever that might be use a machine an application

14
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.910
sending a request for weighted DCT and absolute com.

15
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.650
The response comes back and 60 percent of that time that response is going to send you to the instance

16
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380
in this region here.

17
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.720
Now of course these could be in the same region or they could be in multiple regions.

18
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740
That's not really a problem.

19
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.780
You can set that up however you want and then 20 percent of the time it's going to send to each of these

20
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.960
two resources so let's go back to the console now and we're going to set this configuration up.

21
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.130
So I mean my hosted design and I'm going to create a record set I'm going to call this weighted and

22
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.450
the first one I'm going to do is an alias so I'm going to select my load balancer as the target and

23
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.630
then I'm going to select weighted and I need to give this a weight of 60 and I need to give it an I.D.

24
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.420
now evaluate target health comes up when it's an alias type we can choose to enable that or not.

25
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.860
So it says that it checks the health of the records set that the 80s record points to

26
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.710
now associate with health check is optional for of record types but because this is an alias record

27
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.710
it is actually mandatory.

28
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.040
So we need to actually associate this with a health check and we actually have Sydney based

29
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.820
and it's just given us a warning to say that the health checks specifies the endpoint by domain name

30
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.250
and just confirm that the resource records isn't the same as the right name in the associated health

31
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070
check which we know is okay.

32
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.200
So let's just create this record and what we want to do now is we're just going to go back to where

33
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.590
I've recorded these addresses and I'm now going to say that 20 percent of my traffic goes to Norfolk

34
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.310
Virginia so we come back in and we create a new record set we call it weighted again.

35
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.900
So it's the same name.

36
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.030
It's in a record.

37
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.140
I'm going to specify the.

38
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.110
I didn't copy that out pieces just go back and make sure I copy it properly.

39
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.630
There we go.

40
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.130
So I'm going to remove that piece the IP pin and we're going to have waited and this time we're going

41
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.580
to give it 20 percent and I'm just going to call this and the waited and this time will leave the health

42
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.870
check off and you see that works fine and so we've got another one now.

43
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.740
It's gonna be weighted.

44
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.300
It's going to get the IP address and this third one.

45
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.370
It's gonna be our instance in Singapore.

46
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.010
So we price the IP address and change the way to it and put in 20 percent.

47
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.290
Again

48
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.760
the created those free records and so now you can see that they're all called weighted DCT labs dot

49
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.900
com they're all playing records one points to a load balancer and it has a health check specified.

50
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.360
The others just point to IP addresses.

51
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.490
So and we can see here the wait.

52
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.590
So this shows us the way is 60 percent should go to the load balancer and then 20 percent and 20 percent.

53
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.270
So let's open up a new tab in our browser window and let's go to weighted DCT

54
00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.320
maps dot com and so of course we get our responses as expected.

55
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.500
This is easy to instance in AP SD to be.

56
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.870
And let's refresh that so we can say that we're cycling free.

57
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.360
That doesn't mean that rule 50 frees doing this.

58
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:21.720
What around 50 free is done is it's given us the IP for the load balancer in AP Southeast 2 and then

59
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.390
the load balancer is just going to keep cycling as free.

60
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:33.090
So so really that just shows that we've gone to the Sydney region first and if we open up a command

61
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:45.760
line just going to clear the screen let's do dig weighted DCT labs dot com.

62
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.550
And so what we see now is we have two records it looks like they're about to expire and the two records

63
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.290
are both going to correspond to the low balance so they don't actually correspond to the back end instances.

64
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.420
They're going to respond to the actual load balancer itself.

65
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.530
And let's just run that command again and we've got a new response.

66
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.130
But of course it's the same IP because 60 percent of the time this is what we're going to get.

67
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.630
And if we just keep rerunning this and you might want to do that in your lab and you you will see after

68
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:27.940
a while that you do get a different response so that's really it for weighted routing policies.

69
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.800
Just remember you can have health checks that optional unless you've got a load balancer in which case

70
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.130
you do actually need to specify a health check.

71
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.630
And really it's all about having a weighted response.

72
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.860
So you might want to use this in circumstances such as you're releasing a new version of your application

73
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.170
and you don't want to cut all your traffic across to it.

74
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.700
So you might pay say have 80 or 90 percent your traffic going to your main web site and then you have

75
00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:02.230
10 or 20 percent going to another site with the latest version and then you can see how that goes before

76
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.500
you cut across the changes to your main website.
