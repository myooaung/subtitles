00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,400
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:09,900
In this lab we're going to get a bit deeper into the application load balancer listeners and SSL tier

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,750
less.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:18,390
So what I want to do is show you how we can create multiple listeners and have multiple target groups

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,800
sitting behind them.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,190
So there's a few things on the slide which are worth noting.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,240
The first is we have two listeners here and there on different ports.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,250
One is a secure port.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,000
One is and now you can only have one listener per port number you can't have multiple listeners with

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
port four for free.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,820
So on the front end you have to have unique ports.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,510
However you can connect to target groups on the back end that have the same port number.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,840
So that means your instances can be listening on port 80 and be in type in multiple target groups that

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,050
are attached to the same load balancer and even the same listener.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,010
Now you also notice that one instance here is kind of between two target groups.

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,070
That's because it's part of both.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,620
So an instance can be in multiple target groups.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,780
We then have the rules here and the rules that we're going to set up in this lab are going to be that

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,990
we on our secure listener have a default rule that takes us to instance one.

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,080
But then if we put in shop dot DCT labs dot coms this will be DCT labs dot com and this will be shopped

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,990
or DCT labs dot com.

22
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:34,770
If you put that into the URL the host based routing condition will forward the traffic to target group

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,090
to you and it should be out a cycle between instance to an instance free.

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,480
Alternatively if you use the unsecure port port 80 it's going to pick it up on a different listener

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,770
and that listener is going to forward on to target group free.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,780
So we're going to set up this exact configuration including the SSL TALF certificates and I'm going

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,210
to show you how to generate those as well.

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,770
So that's enough for the fairy.

29
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,490
Let's get into the console and start building this out.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,530
The first thing we need to do is actually create a certificate for use with our load balancer.

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:14,520
Now I mean the AWB certificate manager you can find this by typing in certificate and you'll find certificate

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,650
manager here.

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,570
It's under security identity and compliance.

34
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,610
What I'm gonna do is click get started.

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,070
Request a public certificate.

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm gonna put in DCT lamps dot com and click next and then going to choose the email validation option

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,360
and choose review and confirm and request I'll continue.

38
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,040
And then what I want to do is request another certificate and this one is going to be shop DCT labs

39
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,440
dot com and again I'll use email validation.

40
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,370
So what I need to do now is actually go to my email and there'll be an email that's waiting for me where

41
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,310
I need to click a link to validate my certificate.

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,170
And that really just proves that I have ownership of the domain DCT labs dot com.

43
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,010
So this is the email I received and all I need to do is click on the link here to approve the request

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,110
and then ask me to approve.

45
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,330
So I get a click I approve and that's it it's done.

46
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,060
I've also got another e-mail for the shop that DCC labs dot com certificate.

47
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,020
So I'm just gonna go and do that now.

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,100
So I only took a few seconds and one side approved both of those requests.

49
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,380
I've now got my certificates issued so I can go back to easy too.

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,290
And we're going to set up our load balancer.

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,440
Now before we do that let's actually get our instances running.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,690
So I'm going to create a auto scaling group and I'm going to use four instances t to micros gonna call

53
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:45,560
my launch configuration LC 1 gonna use my I role for S3 full access and then I'm going to put in this

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,750
code same code that you've seen before.

55
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,520
Again it's always in the course downloads for each section.

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,780
So just grab that code and paste it in and it's gonna give a name to our instance on a web page so I

57
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:04,400
can click Next figure security group I'm going to choose web access and create my launch configuration

58
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,580
now for the auto scanning group again I'm going to just call it ASG one I'm going to use four instances

59
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,400
and I'm going to put those across two availability zones.

60
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,750
It doesn't matter and we're not testing cross so no balancing or anything like that.

61
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:24,650
So we can just collect configure screening policies keep it over its initial size and just go through

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,460
and click review and crazy also scaling group.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,230
So that will be our instance is being created.

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,170
Now let's go and create our load balancer.

65
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm going to create an application load balancer again it's just going to be called My Alby now for

66
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,080
the listener.

67
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,360
Paul I want to have two listeners so I'm going to also add my hasty CPS listener.

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,280
We put instances in AP SD to a to b so I'm going to choose those two subnets and now I need to choose

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,340
my cert so you can choose a certificate from AWB cert manager.

70
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,540
That's where we just created our certificate a few minutes ago or you can upload one chooses to forgive

71
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:04,680
him.

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,610
I am or uploads a certificate to I am.

73
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,650
In this case I'm going to choose one of my available certificates and it's going to be shopped at these

74
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,580
t labs dot com.

75
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,290
So actually what I want to do is I want shopped at these d labs dot com to be my secure site.

76
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,950
There isn't an option to configure the security policy.

77
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,380
I'm just gonna leave it on the most recent security policy that's selected by default.

78
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,650
I'm going to choose my web access security group and then I'm going to create a new target group called

79
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:39,690
G1 and I'm just going to change my healthy threshold to 2 and everyone else can stay as it is just to

80
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,060
keep reusing skills.

81
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm not going to add these to registered.

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,790
What I'm gonna do is just create my load balancer and while that's provisioning what I want to do is

83
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,490
go to my instances I should have for running instances and I'm just going to label these.

84
00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:01,680
So it's going to be instance one instance to instance for a and instance for so we can now go back to

85
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,420
are load balancer and what I want to do is configure the listener.

86
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:14,030
So we now have two listeners once listening on port 80 and one's listening on hasty CPS four for free.

87
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,890
Now what I want to do is create two additional target groups so if you remember from the diagram two

88
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,830
of them are going to lessen on port 80 and note that we have port four for free on the front end but

89
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,090
poor 80 on the back end.

90
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,620
So secure in the front but then it's unsecure.

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,720
Whereas in this side it's unsecure on the front but secure on the back and I really set it up like this

92
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,470
just so that you can see the different combinations.

93
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,590
We're not actually going to set up a certificate on instance for because that would mean going into

94
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,440
the instance and having to upload the cert files but outside of the scope of the course.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,170
But I just want to show you that you can have 80 on the front unsecure and then secure on the back end

96
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,300
or the reverse combination.

97
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,470
So let's get into the console now and we're going to set this up.

98
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,700
First thing I need to do is just create my other target groups.

99
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,680
So let's create C.G. to first thing we need to do is create our target groups.

100
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,930
So we're going to create T2 and this is going to listen on port 80 again healthy fresh I was going gonna

101
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,720
be 2 and then this target group free.

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,830
So it's cool that C G free and in this case what we want to do is listen on port four for free the hasty

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,460
TPA secure port.

104
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,670
Now of course what this means is you need a certificate on the actual instance itself.

105
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,260
So we're not gonna do that we're just I'm just showing you how we can figure this out click on Create

106
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,470
and that's our free target groups.

107
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,590
We now need to add our instances to our target groups.

108
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,240
So let's go into target group 1.

109
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:50,820
And we want to add instance one and instance to the target group to we're going to add instance to an

110
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,940
instance free and the target group free.

111
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,950
We're just going to add instance four.

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,130
So there we've got all our instances registered to our target groups.

113
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,650
Now what we need to do is go to the load balancer and set up the listeners.

114
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,100
If I try to add an additional listener on port 80 it tells me that I can't have duplicate load balance

115
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,320
supports the same for hasty CPS but we could then change it.

116
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,510
So for instance we could have another listener in port 81 and that would be fine but we've got our two

117
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:28,080
listeners what I need to do is edit them so that they reflect the diagram that we saw before in our

118
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,740
diagram we have a secure listener which is forwarding to target group 1 and target group 2.

119
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:41,600
So you got shocked DCT lamps dot com here and we've got DCT nabs dot com going through the default rule.

120
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,590
So let's see how we can set this up.

121
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:49,800
The first thing I want to do is add an additional cert so if you go view edit certificates you'll see

122
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,770
that you have the option to add additional certificates so I can click the plus here and it shows me

123
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,990
the available certificates.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,600
So I'm going to select the DCT lapsed dot com certificate and click add.

125
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,050
Now what this means is we've got two certificates and they have different DNS names.

126
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,040
So an application load balancer can use what's called server name indication.

127
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,010
And that means that it can select a certificate based on the name that is presented as part of the url.

128
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:23,520
So it will know to use DCT lapsed dot com or shopped or DCT labs dot com depending what the host name

129
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,020
is in the URL.

130
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,370
Now the other thing I want to do is I actually should have my DC labs dot com as the default rather

131
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,740
than shopped at DCT labs dot com.

132
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,670
So let's just go back and what we can do is edit the listener and I'm just going to change to DCT labs

133
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,700
dot com and click update.

134
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,570
So now that's my default.

135
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,970
Let's head back and just go into view edit certificates and we've now got these t labs dot com as the

136
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,280
default and I need to go back in and just add shocked that these steel labs dot com again.

137
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,010
So we've now got both fast difficult selected what we need to do next is edit the actual rules so we

138
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:05,340
can go to view edit rules and we can see here that requests will be forwarded to target group 1 but

139
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:12,530
what we want to do is add a rule with a host had a condition that says if the host header is shop dot

140
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,800
DCT lamps dot com and wanting to forward it to target group 2.

141
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,080
So that's that what we should have now is a single secure listener running on port four for free.

142
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,880
We've got two rules we've got the default rule and we've got the default certificate which are both

143
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,360
going to take anyone that tries to go to DCC labs dot com to target group 1 if they try to go to shop

144
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,200
of these t labs dot com the conditional host based rule will forward them to target group to where we

145
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,990
have instance to an instance free.

146
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,650
The only other thing we need to do is just edit our rule for target group free.

147
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,030
So let's have a look at our other listener and we just need to change the rule in here.

148
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,250
We need to collect the pen icon here to edit and then the pen here as well.

149
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:06,270
And then we can just go and remove that option and add another action to forward to target group free.

150
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,330
So we should now be set up exactly as in this diagram.

151
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,760
Now as I mentioned we're not going to be able to connect a target group free because we don't have a

152
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,940
certificate on the back end and we configured HDTV yes but we will be able to connect to target group

153
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,740
1 and target group 2.

154
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,800
And if we put in DCC labs dot com we'll go to target group 1 and if we put in shopped these t labs dot

155
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,440
com we'll go to target group 2.

156
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,330
Now of course there's one more important thing we need to do we need to go across to Route 53 and we

157
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,790
need to set up our DNS records.

158
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:46,180
So let's go and find Ralph 50 free and I'm going to go into my DC livestock on hosted zone and try to

159
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,610
couple of record sets.

160
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,990
So the first one is going to be the DCT labs dot com and this is going to be the zone apex.

161
00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:00,060
So there's nothing to write in the name you choose alias and then we choose our MLP and create and then

162
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,410
we create another record set.

163
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,000
And this one is gonna be for shop that DEA labs dot com.

164
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,360
It's also an alias.

165
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,190
And it also goes to the B.

166
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,860
So that's set we're set up now and let's try and go to DCT labs dot com and we need to do so with a

167
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,930
secure connection and there we go.

168
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:25,090
So we get a response and the name of the instance is called Resa and if we try and cycle we're going

169
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,890
to hit Bonita and Rita.

170
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,410
So we've got two instances and they should be instance one an instance two in our diagram.

171
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:40,680
Let's now try and go to shop dot DCT labs dot com and this time we get Marietta and if we now cycle

172
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:48,210
we get Marietta and Benita remember Benita was in Target group 1 and target group 2 whereas Marietta

173
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,370
is just in target group 2.

174
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,190
So this is behaving exactly as we expected to in this diagram.

175
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,550
We've got Risa and Benita and then we've got Marietta.

176
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,340
I hope you had a lot of fun in this lab guys and everything worked okay for you.

177
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,460
Let me know if it didn't or reach out on the forums we're finished with this configuration for now.

178
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,930
So we can go back in and remove everything.

179
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,760
So I'll just show you how to go and clean up.

180
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,550
Remember to remove your records from Route 53 and this is important if you're going to be running other

181
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:23,430
labs because it means that your records deleted and they get removed from your cash.

182
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,300
And then next time you try and create a record you shouldn't have any problems with actually getting

183
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,150
resolution working straight away.

184
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,940
Now we need to go and delete our load balancer.

185
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,130
We can get rid of all of these target groups.

186
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,350
We can delete our auto scaling group and our launch configuration and that should mean that our senses

187
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,160
are shutting down.

188
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,830
But if not just go in there and terminate your instances.

189
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,200
And I said for this lab guys in the next lab I'm going to show you a common use case where we have a

190
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,010
public facing application load balancer.

191
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,020
So in Internet facing application load balancer but we have instances in a private subnet I'll show

192
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,820
you how to set that up.
