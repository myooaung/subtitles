00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.520
The last rousing policy we're going to cover is the multi value answer announcing policy which allows

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:18.570
you to configure around 50 free to return multiple values such as IP addresses in response DNS queries.

3
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.500
So that means that when you create multiple records under the same name and set them as multi value

4
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.470
multiple IP addresses of return to the client.

5
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.240
And what that means for the client is that they're able to then connect to one of those addresses and

6
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.730
they can perform client side load balancing so they can determine which IP address to connect to and

7
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.040
if one of them fails they can connect to a different server.

8
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.750
Now Ralph 53 can respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records and it can also give different

9
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.850
answers to different DNS resolves.

10
00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.070
So if a Web server becomes unavailable after the resolve cashes their response the client software can

11
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.890
then try another IP address that was provided in that response so your client can then connect to wrap

12
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.780
50 free.

13
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.880
It gets given multiple values and it puts those into its cash and then tries one of them.

14
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.950
And as long as that's working that's great.

15
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.170
If it fails it can then try another policy so again what I mentioned before this is really a sort of

16
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.200
client side load balancing.

17
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.490
Now what Route 50 free also supports with multi value routing is health checks.

18
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.160
So the responses that come back will only include records that are healthy if you use health checks

19
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.730
so let's go back to the council now and we're going to set this up so I can create a record set.

20
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.420
I'm going to call it multi.

21
00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.670
I'm going to paste in one of our IP addresses and this one is from North Virginia.

22
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.640
I want to change the TTL choose multi value given a set I.D. I call it multi one and I'm gonna associate

23
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.860
a health check in Virginia and so while that's happening let's go back over and take the IP address

24
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.980
for our Singapore instance and we're now going to create another record set called multi and we're going

25
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:37.790
to change the TTL paste in the IP change to multi-brand you answer call this one multi to and that's

26
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.950
associate the Singapore health check.

27
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.580
Now you may remember we can actually do this for the light balance so we can put in multi we can change

28
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.780
to alias and select the light balancer but then we found the multi value answer is that she cried out

29
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.670
so we can actually do that.

30
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.100
So we have these two records pointing to our service.

31
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.290
We've associated our health checks we have multi value all its assets yes and we can go a four and just

32
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:16.270
have a look at our health checks just to make sure yeah all serve as a healthy according to this and

33
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.950
then we go back to Hastings owns

34
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.260
and that all looks good.

35
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.750
So let's go to a command prompt and I'm going to talk Digg to take multi thought DCT lamps dot com

36
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.390
and there we go.

37
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.600
We get two records so we know that these are both healthy records so Ralph Fifty 50 free returns.

38
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.100
Both answers.

39
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.900
So what if I had to do something like I did before.

40
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.420
We're going to go over to one of the regions.

41
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.610
Let's head to and win North Virginia again.

42
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.940
So let's change to Singapore this time and we're going to go to our Singapore region Asia-Pacific

43
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:26.690
and I'm gonna go to security groups and I'm going to go into web access and I'm going to remove HDTV.

44
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.030
So now if we go back it's around 50 for a in a couple of minutes we're going to find this health check

45
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.000
starts telling us that the Singapore instance is unhealthy.

46
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.980
So it's been a few minutes and the resource is now showing us unhealthy.

47
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.950
So it does take a little bit of time because we're relying on health checks here.

48
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.860
And that's one of the reasons why I W.S. recommend that you don't use multi value routing policies as

49
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.990
a substitute for a load balancer

50
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:09.340
so let's go back to the command prompt and do a dig again for melted or these steel lapsed dot com and

51
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.520
sure enough now we only get one IP address and that's because the other record is unhealthy

52
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.660
so that's it for multi value routing.

53
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.210
Couple of things that you need to know about the behavior of around 50 free with multi value routing

54
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.470
policies.

55
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.140
Is that rule 50 free responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP addresses.

56
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.840
Only when the health check is healthy.

57
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.120
Now if you don't associate a health check with an answer record rule 53 will always consider that record

58
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.260
to be healthy.

59
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.460
So that response will be returned regardless of whether the IP the instance is actually healthy or not.

60
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.480
And another thing if you have eight or fewer healthy records rule 50 free will respond to DNS queries

61
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.350
with all healthy records if all records are unhealthy round 50 free responds to DNS queries with up

62
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.480
to eight unhealthy records.

63
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.440
So those are just a few things to remember for the exam.

64
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.380
That's it for this lab and in the next lab which is going to go over shutting everything down and cleaning

65
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.950
up our lab.
