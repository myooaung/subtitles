1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,040
Continuing on same crime with U.S. convicts.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,020
Remember, this is a fully managed service that provides you with resource inventory, configuration,

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,500
history and configuration change notifications, which you can use for security and governance.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,200
You can discover existing resources in your account and export a complete inventory of resources with

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,520
all configuration details.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,710
Remember, this creates a configuration item for all the resources in your account, if you can figure

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,400
it to do so.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,000
So this can be used for compliance, auditing, security analysis, resource change, tracking and troubleshooting

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,790
and allows you to assess, audit and evaluate configurations of your resources.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,450
So remember, this is about keeping a record of all changes that are made to your resources and you

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,560
can do so historically.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,200
So it creates a history of change control and what's been changed at any point in time.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,880
And it's very useful, therefore, for configuration management as part of an Excel program.

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,340
Now, again, just to make sure you're clear on the difference between config and cloud trail cloud

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,520
trollers about user API activity on your account.

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,330
So it's about who did something config records, point in time configuration, details of your resources

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,740
as configuration items.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,090
So as about the configuration, stay at a point in time.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,550
So configures about saying what did my resource look like at a point in time?

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,970
What was its configuration?

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,750
Whereas Cloud Trail is about saying who made an API call to modify the resource, who deleted it, who

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,470
changed it?

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,650
And you're able to then track through API activity, who did what?

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,750
So those are the key differences that you need to know between config and cloud from.
