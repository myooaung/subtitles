00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.420
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.230
I apologize if this slide has a lot of information on it but this is quite a tedious subject here and

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.280
I'm trying to make it as visual as possible in this lab.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.780
This is very key to remember all of this information and the best way to do that I think is to do it

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.000
visually by having the combination of a diagram.

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.280
We have some of these bullet points as well as going into the console and actually performing each of

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.490
these operations so that we can contextualize it and really understand and remember all this information.

8
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.870
So before we get started we're going to go through all of these.

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.390
But before we get started let's head over to the console and I'm in the key management service and what

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.920
I've done is I've created myself a customer key so you remember we've got customer managed keys in KMS

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.850
and what that actually means and you'll see.

12
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.790
And by the way this is a regional service.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.600
I note that I'm in Sydney here.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.650
So if I try to use this key in another region well I won't even find it.

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.610
So we create a key here and you just create a name for this key.

16
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.930
So you just call it you know kms whatever you want to call it.

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.300
And then there's other advanced options here you can say a couple of things.

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.660
So you can have an external key that means you're importing your two 256 bit key

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.710
from your key management infrastructure.

20
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.400
So if your company has its own public key infrastructure you can take your keys and bring them into

21
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.710
AWS.

22
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.150
You can also use a custom key store such as cloudHSM and cloudhsm is an AWS service

23
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.720
which we'll cover in the security section in this course.

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.240
So back onto a message.

25
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.100
So this means that KMS actually comes up with key material and we're just going to leave that and

26
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.430
then you can just click on Next optionally add tags and then what you need to do is choose your key

27
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.230
administrators.

28
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.860
So for the one that I have I just chose myself and I'm not allowed to delete the key as well.

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.650
And then you need to define who's able to use the key in this case.

30
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.570
Just having my own account is fine I don't need to add a role for this obviously if you had multiple

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.370
people who you wanted to use this you'd probably create a row and then you can use groups or attach

32
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.270
roles directly in order to be able to use these permissions.

33
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.120
So you just go next and it will actually create and it's all for a policy here so it can figure out

34
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.440
the policy for you based on what you've just chosen and then you click finish.

35
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.470
So I've already got a key here and one of the other things I've done.

36
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.980
If you go into your key and you pop down to the bottom here you can see other AWS accounts and I've

37
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.790
actually added another accounts in so you just click add another account and you put in the account

38
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.640
number and click save changes and then that means that that account is now able to use this key and

39
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.690
you'll see why that's important in this lab later on so let's get back to the diagram.

40
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.980
So the first option here is just taken a snapshot.

41
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.030
So you've got your UBS volume and you want to take a snapshot of it decrypt the encryption State of

42
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.140
the volume is retained.

43
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.050
So if it's encrypted your snapshots encrypted if it's unencrypted your snapshots unencrypted and it's

44
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.060
going to be in the same region.

45
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.830
So let's head over and let's go to volumes and let's just go to create snapshot.

46
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.350
And you can see it says not encrypted and that's there's no option to change that.

47
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.280
And that's because this is an unencrypted volume and you can't change the encryption state of your snapshot.

48
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.810
You also can't change the region.

49
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.960
You can add tags but that's about it and you can give it a description.

50
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.410
So I'm just gonna cancel out of the

51
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.330
the next option is to take an unencrypted snapshot and copy the snapshot.

52
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.600
And in this case you can encrypt it and you can change regions.

53
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.220
So let's go back and we've got some snapshots here.

54
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.420
These are all unencrypted snapshots.

55
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.410
So let's just take this data volume here and under description we can see it's not encrypted.

56
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:11.350
So we can go copy we can choose a region obviously this is any region.

57
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.660
In this case I'm just going to leave it where it is and I'm going to give it a descriptive description.

58
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.500
So data volume you can see for encryption and now I can encrypted it so I can choose to encrypt the

59
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.670
volume and I can choose my key.

60
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.300
So we've got this IWC BSG here.

61
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.430
So this is the default and you can also see my customer KMS in this case I'm going to leave

62
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.810
the default and that's completed now.

63
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.940
So let's just go up and have a look and sure enough we can see it's encrypted and that's the KMS

64
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.740
key.

65
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.910
So we know that that's an encrypted volume

66
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.580
so the next thing is to take an unencrypted snapshot and try to volume out of it.

67
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.980
And in this case you can optionally enable encryption and you can change the availability zone not the

68
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.680
region but the availability zone.

69
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.970
So let's go back and take one of the unencrypted snapshots this case let's try take a root volume and

70
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.940
we can try to create a volume from that and in this case you can change the volume type.

71
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.700
You can change the size you can change the availability zone and then we can say well let's encrypt

72
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.570
this one.

73
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:33.080
And again we could choose the AWS KMS key and click rate volume and it's as simple as that.

74
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.630
So the next activity is to take an unencrypted snapshot and create an I.M. eyes.

75
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.740
Remember an image and the AMI can then be used to launch instances.

76
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.190
So in this case you take an unencrypted snapshot and create an AMI.

77
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.340
You can't change the encryption status and AMI is actually backed by a snapshot.

78
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.340
So it's not actually got the data within the AMI.

79
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.370
The AMI actually includes the block the voice mappings the launch permissions and the template for the

80
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.870
reef volume.

81
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.160
But it doesn't actually contain the data itself.

82
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.900
It always is backed off of the snapshot and therefore you can't change the encryption state because

83
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.690
the snapshot is even encrypted or unencrypted.

84
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.600
So in this case we have an unencrypted snapshot.

85
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.600
And that means the AMI we create can be shared with other accounts and it can be shared publicly.

86
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.020
So let's go back and do this.

87
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.600
So we'll go and take a snapshot and or choose or select a snapshot.

88
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.670
In this case when we take this unencrypted root volume and let's create an image from that snapshot

89
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.640
and we'll just call this my

90
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.860
unencrypted AMI.

91
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.410
And so you can see a few options here.

92
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.720
But the encryption status is not something you can change.

93
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.730
And as you'll notice you can't even change the region that you put this in.

94
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.250
So there's no option there or you can do is give it a name sheet change.

95
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.240
Some of these parameters and you can adjust the volume size and type but you can't change encryption

96
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:13.330
status so let's click Create we now go up to AMI we've got our unencrypted AMI and we can go to modify

97
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.420
permissions and we can choose this image is currently and we change it to public and that's now a public

98
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.470
image.

99
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.590
Another thing we can do is share the AMI with another account to do that we need to go back in and we

100
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.970
have to make it private first

101
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.900
and we have to hit refresh otherwise it often doesn't change and then we need to add in the account

102
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.830
number of the other account and we need to create the we need to select the add create volume for permissions

103
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.490
to enable that account to create volumes from the snapshots that this AMIs backed by.

104
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.410
So we click on Save and on another browser and a private window.

105
00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:01.090
I have a separate account which is also selected into Sydney here within the Sydney region.

106
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:08.730
And what we need to do now is in this offshore account where we've just shared this AMI we have to change

107
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:16.200
to private images and now we can see the AMI that we shared from this account.

108
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:26.010
The DCC labs account so we could then launch an instance from that image and if we go through to storage

109
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.040
you'd see that you know the the storage is is essentially the same.

110
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.200
You could then add encryption you could then change the volume size and the volume type.

111
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.780
So that's a share a snapshot between accounts.

112
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.440
So what we're going to do now is we're just going to remove that capability.

113
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.820
So what we're going to do now is copy an encrypted snapshot.

114
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.530
In this case the copy is still an encrypted snapshot.

115
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.420
So it's not like an unencrypted snapshot where you can optionally enable encryption with an encrypted

116
00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.470
snapshot.

117
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:05.300
It's still going to be encrypted but what you can do is change the encryption key and you can also change

118
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.320
regions.

119
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:13.930
So let's head over and go to snapshots and what we're going to do is create a copy.

120
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:20.220
And now we can see that we can change regions so we can choose Singapore if we like or any other region.

121
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.130
And this is going to be a copy.

122
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.090
And then as you can see you can't change the encryption status.

123
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.860
It's encrypted and that's greyed.

124
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.850
So I can't change that box but I can change the key.

125
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:39.130
So I could remove this and then I could come down and say well in this case I want this to be using

126
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:48.550
my customer key and click copy so we've changed the key that's used to encrypt it but we can't unencrypted

127
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.470
and we can change the region as well.

128
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:57.740
That option say the next task is to take an encrypted snapshot and create an encrypted volume.

129
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.700
So in this case again you can change the encryption key and you can change the availability zone not

130
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.410
the region because now we're talking about creating a volume.

131
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:14.050
So the snapshot is on S3 but the volume is going to be within an availability zone.

132
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:21.190
So the snapshot is going to be within a region and then the volume is going to be within an availability

133
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.550
zone.

134
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.130
So we can't change the region but we can change the availability zone that the destination volume is

135
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.000
created in.

136
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:38.150
So let's go back and take our encrypted snapshot and create a volume and in this case we just want to

137
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.280
change to 2C.

138
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:47.930
And again you can see that I can quite easily change my encryption key and create volume and now that

139
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:54.770
volumes in a different availability zone to where the original volume was that the snapshot came from.

140
00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:01.690
So the next task then is to take an encrypted snapshot and make an encrypted AMI from it.

141
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.790
And in this case the snapshots remain encrypted.

142
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.190
So the the volumes will be encrypted.

143
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.480
You can't share it with other accounts unless you're using the customer key in case if you're doing

144
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.650
that using the AWS managed CMK you can't share that.

145
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.720
So that's very important.

146
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.430
And you cannot share it publicly in any circumstance.

147
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:30.910
So let's go and take one of our encrypted snapshots and let's create an image from it.

148
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:38.410
And we're just going to call this encrypted ... so you can see because it's the snapshot that it's

149
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.930
using is encrypted.

150
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.160
There's no option to change that.

151
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.200
So we create the encrypted ...

152
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:57.490
and now if we go into permissions and try and hit public and we get an error saying encrypted snapshots

153
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.920
can't be shared publicly.

154
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.260
The same will happen if we go to modify image permissions and we try to add in an account

155
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.870
snapshots encrypted with the AWS managed CMK can't be shared.

156
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.630
So that's the key here.

157
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:20.070
So let's go back and we created another snapshot that was encrypted but with a different key.

158
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.600
So here you can see it's encrypted but it's encrypted with the customer key.

159
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.450
So the customer CMK that came from here from KMS that we created.

160
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:36.810
So we created a customer managed key so let's create an image from this one.

161
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:45.200
So in this case it's gonna be encrypted with CMK key.

162
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:58.130
And so the image is still encrypted and that's going AMIs and in this case let's try to modify

163
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.720
these permissions.

164
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.430
Now can we make it public.

165
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.110
No absolutely not.

166
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:11.150
But we can change the account or add permissions for another account to be able to create volumes from

167
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.640
this EMI.

168
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.920
So let's click on Save and that works.

169
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.780
So now if we head back to our other account and theirs are encrypted AMI.

170
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.530
So now we should be able to launch an instance from this.

171
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.830
We would also be able to copy it and change the encryption status.

172
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:38.400
So if we hit launch go free to storage there we go we can see that we have encryption enabled.

173
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:44.510
And again we could go in here and this is a different account so you're seeing different options but

174
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.580
we could then go and choose a different encryption key and launch that instance.

175
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.220
So the next one is to look at copying and encrypt AMI.

176
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.590
And in this case the encryption status remains the same.

177
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.340
But you can change regions.

178
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.530
So that's simply a case of saying well here's an encrypted AMI want to copy it.

179
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.620
What can I do.

180
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.660
Well I can't change the encryption status despite the fact that it looks like there's an option here.

181
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.320
You can't actually change their status without option here but you can change the region.

182
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:23.390
So I could then just say well let's copy this to Mumbai and the next one is taking in encrypted AMI

183
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.900
and launching an EC2 instance we actually quickly looked at this before.

184
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.440
So you take your encrypted AMI you launch you easy to instance and then when you go to storage you have

185
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.540
the option to change the key.

186
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.760
And clearly you can select your availability zone when you launch an instance as well so that's not

187
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:50.200
a problem even and then the very last one here is to take an unencrypted AMI and launch an EC2 instance.

188
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.170
And in this case you can change the encryption state as well as the easy.

189
00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:04.750
So if you go back to our unencrypted AMI we can launch we can go through to storage and we can.

190
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.250
This is not encrypted and then we can enable encryption

191
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.400
so that's it.

192
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.960
There's a lot of information there but hopefully you'll start to contextualize it and understand.

193
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.530
Best thing to do is to get into the console and actually just run through and practice all of these

194
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.790
different operations.

195
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.060
And that's the best way to really understand it and remember it.
