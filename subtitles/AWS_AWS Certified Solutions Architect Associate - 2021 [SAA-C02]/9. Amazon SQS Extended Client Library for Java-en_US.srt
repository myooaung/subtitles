1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,850
With excuse, the maximum message size is 256 kilobytes, so sometimes you might need to send a message

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,130
with some kind of attachment.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,610
That's a lot bigger than 256 kilobytes.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,980
And you can do that with messages that are up to two gigabytes by using the extended client library

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,610
for Java.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,730
So what happens is the producer uses the extend the client library for Java to send a message with a

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,730
reference to an S3 object.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,710
So the rest of the data, up to two gigabytes can be put as an object into this asheri bucket.

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,040
And the message that's placed in the queue will have a reference to the large objects that stored in

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,060
S3 and then a consumer can pick that up, picks up the message and knows where to get the object from

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,030
the S3 bucket.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,340
So the maximum message size is 256 kilobytes for excuse and you can use S3 and the excuse extended client

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,690
library for Java to manage obscures messages and that's useful for storing and consuming messages up

14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,600
to two gigabytes in size.

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,120
So you can use this to do the following, specify where the messages are always stored in S3, or only

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,020
when the size of a message exceeds 256 kilobytes.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,560
Or send a message that references a single message object stored in a necessary bucket and you can get

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,080
the corresponding message object from a necessary bucket and you can then delete the corresponding message

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,580
object from the ashry bucket.

20
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,900
So there's nothing left behind.

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,880
That's probably all you need to know for the exam.

22
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,520
So just remember, if you see a scenario where the message size is exceeding 256 kilobytes and it's

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,890
up to two gigabytes in size, then you can store that data as an S3 object and reference it using the

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,600
extended client library for Java.
