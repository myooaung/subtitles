1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,810
And this lesson on guns cover, not gateways and not instances now within the section, we've already

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:18,110
talked about network address translation and how it's used to translate the addresses, often between

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:25,910
public and private IP address ranges, not gateways, and that instances are both used for the one purpose.

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,840
And that purpose is to enable the instances that we deploy into private subnet to connect to the internet.

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,560
This is outbound only it doesn't mean there's going to be bidirectional traffic.

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,490
If we wanted that, we would just deploy instances into a public subnet and they would have a public

7
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,740
IP and use the internet gateway.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,800
But sometimes we want private instances, so no one in the outside world from the internet can connect

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,330
to are easy to instance, but we can connect outbound.

10
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,880
We might want to be able to connect to an outbound service, a service located on the internet, or

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,570
we might want to download software, software updates, that kind of thing.

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,430
So let's see how this works visually.

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,380
So again, we have an availability zone with a public subnet and a private subnet.

14
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,890
And we've deployed in EC2 instance in a private subnet.

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,140
And it has a private IP address and there's an internet gateway attached to the VPC.

16
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,090
What we might then do is deploy, and that's gateway into a public subnet.

17
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:33,140
Now it's important to understand that this Nat Gateway is in a public subnet because it needs a public

18
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,040
IP address.

19
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,530
It will have an elastic IP address assigned to it, and it uses that to be able to talk to the internet

20
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,710
gateway on behalf of our private instance.

21
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,860
So remember that for exam questions, it comes up a lot.

22
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,350
You always deploy your NAT gateways or your NAT instances in public subnet.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,210
So we then have our roundtable, as you know, the root table for the public subnet.

24
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,660
The main round table has a route to the internet gateway.

25
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,180
But we also have a private roundtable.

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:09,260
And in this case, we have added an entry and that entry is for the NAT Gateway out of this NAT gateway

27
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,920
we've deployed.

28
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:16,180
And just like with the Internet Gateway entry here, it's four zero zero zero zero zero.

29
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,230
So it means any address other than this address here that's already been specified.

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,790
So any address range outside of the VPC with this configuration are easy to instance can now use its

31
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,690
private IP address to connect to the private IP address of the NAT Gateway.

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,200
And then traffic can get forwarded to the internet gateway from the NAT Gateway using network address

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
translation.

34
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,070
And from there, it would go out to the internet so whatever service you want to connect to.

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,340
So that's a Nat Gateway, and Nat Gateway is an IWC service that you can deploy.

36
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,540
We then have NAT instances these are a lot less popular now.

37
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,090
We used to use these a lot before NAT gateways came along, and that instance isn't an IWC service.

38
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,920
It's just an easy two instance that you configure a certain way.

39
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,050
The deployments apology is very similar.

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,420
We've got our instance in a private, subnet or internet gateway.

41
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,290
And on that instance, when we deploy in that instance, we use a special am-I that's already been preconfigured

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,680
a certain way and that will have the string aims that end Dash, am-I Dash, VPC, Dash, Nat.

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,540
So you can search for that when you're looking for an EMI and you should see some entries come up.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,820
Really important thing to do is you have to disable source and destination checks.

45
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,670
This is the key one that pops up in exam questions.

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,290
Now, in true, if not, instances aren't covered as much as NAT gateways anymore.

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,520
And for most use cases, you're always going to choose a NAT gateway.

48
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,060
If it does come up, sometimes they're just checking your knowledge.

49
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,700
That's a NAT instance requires the source and destination checks to be disabled.

50
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,670
And that's essentially a setting that allows the NAT Gateway to function as a network address, translate

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,360
to receive traffic on one IP address and then translate it and send it out using a different one root

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,330
tables or set up almost the same as within Nat Gateway.

53
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,930
But we're just going to specify the Nats instance side instead.

54
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,470
And then, as with before we're connecting using a private IP to the NAT instance, using the BBC router,

55
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:24,620
and then we're connecting to the outside world by using the elastic IP of the NAT instance.

56
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,320
Now let's look finally at a few differences between NAT gateways and NAT instances, and I'm just going

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,960
to highlight a few of these that are really important for the exam.

58
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,550
The very first one is, in that instance, is managed by you.

59
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,910
It's an easy two instance.

60
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,420
You have to manage the operating system, install software updates and so on with a NAT Gateway.

61
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,610
It's a managed service, so AWB.

62
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,240
Manage it for you with a NAT instance if you want to scale it.

63
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,020
You have to scale up by changing the instance type, whereas with a NAT gateway, it's fully elastic.

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,500
Within that instance, you don't get a high availability.

65
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,810
You could potentially create a high availability solution, but there's no easy.

66
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,560
Way of doing it.

67
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,590
Whereas with a NAT gateway, it provides automatic high availability within an availability zone.

68
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,370
And you can place your NAT gateways in multiple availability zones or separate NAT gateways in different

69
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,450
availability zones.

70
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,810
So you have that hichi across all bases with a NAT instance, you can use security groups, you have

71
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,210
to use security groups because it's an easy to instance.

72
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,420
So you get a bit of control over how you configure the networking and who's allowed to connect with

73
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,010
a NAT gate where you don't.

74
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,490
There are no security groups, but it only allows outbound access anyway and can't be used in any other

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,150
fashion.

76
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,760
Whereas with in that instance, you could make it dual purpose so that it's actually your bastion host

77
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,990
as well, and users are connecting into your EC2 instance, your NAT instance, and then connecting

78
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,550
from there to private subnets.

79
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,300
You can't do that with a NAT Gateway, but really, that's a small limitation.

80
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,290
You should probably separate that functionality onto a separate host anyway.

81
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,580
Now those are the main ones for the exam, so you should be well set up now.

82
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,380
In the next lesson, we're actually going to configure and Nat Gateway and see how it works in action.
