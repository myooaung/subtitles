00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to use security groups and network schools, and we should

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.500
already have some instances running from earlier on in this section, so you should have free instances

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
running to in a public subnet and one in a private subnet.

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.220
And what we're going to do is test various configurations of security groups and network actors.

5
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.970
Now the first thing I need to do back in EC2 is go to security groups and I'm going to create a new

6
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.870
security group.

7
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.640
So we have the public web.

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.830
Now we're going to create the private app.

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.980
So this security group is going to be called Private Dash app.

10
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.690
I've given a description and let's choose my VPC for the VPC.

11
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.550
Now, what will the rule be here?

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.820
Well, I'm actually going to delete the outbound rules we've already configured.

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.780
We've given internet access to this particular instance before.

14
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.810
So we were able to download HD TPD when we installed the web service.

15
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.360
But for now, I'm going to take our outbound rules, which means from now on, it won't be able to connect

16
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.880
out to the internet for inbound rules.

17
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.390
What I want to do is use FTP.

18
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.940
So let's just scroll down, find HTP.

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.820
That's the protocol for the web server and for source.

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.010
What I'm going to do here is type S.G. and I can see my public web access.

21
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.520
So I'm doing the best practice and say what I want to do is make sure that the web server in our apps

22
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.410
is only ever going to allow connections that come from the web servers on the front and the public facing

23
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.420
web servers in this security group.

24
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.490
So let's create that security group.

25
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.920
Now we need to assign it to our instance.

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.270
So let's choose Private One Be go to actions, security, change security groups and we're going to

27
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.410
remove public web.

28
00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.330
I'm going to choose private app, click on Ad Security Group and then click on Save.

29
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.070
Great.

30
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.170
So that should be set up correctly now.

31
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.690
The first thing I want to do, though, is test the access to the security group on our front end.

32
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.960
So what I'm going to do is go to security groups, choose the public web security group and under inbound

33
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.900
rules, I'm going to edit the inbound rules.

34
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.220
And what I want to do here is change from all traffic.

35
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.960
And again, we're going to choose HDTV only.

36
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.570
We're going to remove the any source and we're going to specify my IP.

37
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.740
So what that will do is it picks up my IP address, and that means that I will be able to connect over

38
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.290
the internet to this particular web service.

39
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.170
Now I'm actually using a VPN, and we're going to change it in a moment.

40
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.830
So if you do have access to a VPN, you'll be able to do this as well.

41
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.570
Otherwise, it can be a little bit difficult unless you have multiple public IP, but I just want to

42
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.460
show you the concept anyway.

43
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.560
So let's just save this rule.

44
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.790
Come back to instances, take the public IP address and in a browser, let's just hit enter.

45
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.140
And that looks great.

46
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.420
So I get access to this instance.

47
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.990
Now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go in and change my VPN here.

48
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.710
So I'm connecting to a different service, and that means I've got a different IP now.

49
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.900
So let's just refresh the page.

50
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.440
Now, you can't see anything happening, but if you look up in the top browser ball here, we can see.

51
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.560
We're trying to connect and this is what happens with security groups.

52
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.180
When you can't connect, it kind of just hangs for quite a while and then eventually it will time out.

53
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.160
So that's definitely working.

54
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.890
We're not able to access the instance now if I come back to security groups.

55
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.160
And what I'd rather do is choose my public web security group at inbound rules.

56
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.510
And instead, I'm going to change this to any IPv4 because this is a web service, so we want anyone

57
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.070
on the internet to be able to connect.

58
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.250
So let's just save that role and take over here.

59
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.240
It failed to connect.

60
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.140
Let's refresh.

61
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.520
And now we're back in again.

62
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.870
So that's a good configuration.

63
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.880
Now a web service is allowing only FTP from the internet, and then it should be able to forward onto

64
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.840
the app service because of the security rules we set up before.

65
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.730
So let's test that layer now back in easy to.

66
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.370
That's got two instances.

67
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.900
And what I want to do here is connect to my public one.

68
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.550
I instance over instance connect, and I'm going to check the private IP address of my instance in my

69
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.270
private subnet.

70
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.270
And that's 10 zero four one four right now.

71
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.650
Just not as one of the things we have done here is we've got to secure, so we've locked ourself out.

72
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.590
Now, if you just click on this note here, it takes you over to an article and we can see that we actually

73
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.000
need Port 22 from our IP address to be able to access the instance.

74
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.870
So let's go back and set this up as a secure configuration.

75
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.890
So going back into security groups, what we need to do is go to public web, at inbound rules, at

76
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.280
a rule, and this one can be S-H.

77
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.680
And what we'll do here is we're just going to add any internet address because I might be changing my

78
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.330
internet address a couple of times.

79
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.090
So, otherwise, of course, you could use my IP or have a range of addresses that you trust.

80
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.920
That would be a more secure configuration.

81
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.030
But for now, we will be changing your lips, so I'm happy to have that as open.

82
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.680
So let's save those rules.

83
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.470
Now, let's try and retry this instance.

84
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.850
Connect and we're in.

85
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.380
So the way I want to try and test that we can connect to our app layer is using Curl DashPass and then

86
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.430
putting in the IP 10 zero four Dash one four eight.

87
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.540
Let's hit enter.

88
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.000
And we get a response, so that's great.

89
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.070
Now remember, we didn't have an outbound rule from that security group, so the response traffic is

90
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.250
coming back purely because this is a stateful firewall.

91
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.030
So that's it for security groups.

92
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.080
Let's move on and have a look at configuring a network ACL back in of APC management console.

93
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.770
Let's go to network cycles, and what we'll see is there are already network cycles, so we've got one

94
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.900
here for our custom VPC.

95
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.930
Now let us go in and have a look at the configuration.

96
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.030
So we have inbound rules.

97
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.600
We have a rule number one, allowing all traffic inbound.

98
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.350
And then at the end, we have eight to nine rule.

99
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.500
So remember these get processed in order.

100
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.510
So in this case, everything gets allowed because of the allow rule so that the deny rule doesn't get

101
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.670
processed outbound.

102
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.890
We've got exactly the same thing.

103
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.580
So let's try something.

104
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.350
What I'm going to do is edit the inbound rules and I'm going to add a rule and I'm going to make this

105
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.250
one on one.

106
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.360
And what I'm going to do is specify FTP source is going to be my IP address.

107
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.930
So I know my IP address is this one at the moment.

108
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.030
So I put slash 32 for an exact match, and I'm going to click on Deny.

109
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.310
So I'm going to deny access from this particular IP address to HTP.

110
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.680
Now, do you think this is going to work?

111
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.780
Hopefully, you realize there's an error here, but let's just save the changes and we'll go and check

112
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.070
it out back in easy.

113
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.850
I'm just going to copy the public IP of my instance.

114
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.610
Go to a new web page, hit enter and I get access.

115
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.010
So of course, that didn't work.

116
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.270
Now let's go and see why.

117
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.400
Back in the VPC management console, let's edit these rules for the network ICL.

118
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.260
Now, as you know, rules get processed in order.

119
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.720
So we've got a deny rule here that's after and allow the allow announce everything.

120
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.730
So actually, this is not going to work.

121
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.690
Let's change this to 99 sort by rule order.

122
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.400
And now we have a specific deny before and allow.

123
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.150
So essentially, it's going to look through the rules.

124
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.710
It's going to see that traffic is coming in on Port 80 from this particular IP, and it's going to deny

125
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.830
it.

126
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.490
So we never get to the allow rule for this particular traffic.

127
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.230
So let's save changes.

128
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.330
So we'll go and test this out now.

129
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.530
But there's just one thing that you need to understand was security group rules.

130
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.030
When you apply them, they do actually get put into effect pretty much immediately.

131
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.330
That can be a bit more of a delay with a network ACL.

132
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.010
So if you find you still have access to your instance, then it's probably just because you're a bit.

133
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.690
Too fast.

134
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.750
So just give it a couple of minutes and try again.

135
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:32.320
And we should find that we do get denied in a browser window here that's placed in our IP address.

136
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.050
And sure enough, it looks like it's hanging.

137
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.720
So that's clearly not working.

138
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.180
Now what if I changed my IP?

139
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.210
So this time I could change to somewhere different?

140
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.850
And very quickly this time the connection did actually change, and it did allow me in.

141
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:55.420
So sometimes the network ICAO rules apply super fast, and sometimes there's a bit of a delay, so it

142
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.290
really can vary.

143
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.470
So that shows you how to use a deny rule with a network ICL.

144
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.280
Now I'm just going to come back in and clean up that room, so I don't want to have any deny rules in

145
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.420
my network, ICL.

146
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.250
So let's just remove that one out from the inbound rules and save changes.

147
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.170
Now there are a couple of things we can clean up now to make sure that we don't get any bills.

148
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.810
Firstly, let's go to on Nat Gateway.

149
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.150
These can cost money, so let's just delete this Nat Gateway, and that's gone.

150
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.460
And don't forget, you will also need to make sure that the elastic IP has also been removed from your

151
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.600
account back in.

152
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.350
Easy to now.

153
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:39.640
I do want to keep one public and one private instance, but I can terminate the other public instance.

154
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.060
Now we will actually use the command line for this.

155
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.850
I just want to show you another Seelye command back in our fall here.

156
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.860
We can specify the values for all these two instances.

157
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.820
So I've just got one here, so I'm going to put it in inverted commas.

158
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.900
Copy this command and back in my command line.

159
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.300
Let's just try and terminate this instance.

160
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:06.370
And when you do that, you'll see that the current state is shutting down and the previous state was

161
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.790
running.

162
