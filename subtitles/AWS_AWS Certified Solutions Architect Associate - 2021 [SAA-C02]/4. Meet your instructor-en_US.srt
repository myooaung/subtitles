1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,530
I just wanted to take a few moments to talk about ways to keep in touch.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,360
I really appreciate having you as my student.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,320
It's one of my great passions to be able to teach and to do so for so many students around the world.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,980
It's a great privilege and I would really appreciate it would mean a lot to me if you connected.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,290
There are several ways we can keep in touch.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,290
But before I share those, I would just like to tell you a little bit about myself so you get to know

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,520
a bit about who I am.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,290
I originally come from the U.K., but I'm now very lucky to call Australia my home.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,560
I've worked in I.T. for well over 20 years working as a consultant in the systems integration space

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,970
for a large part of that career.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,990
I've also got lots of certifications from many different vendors, including IAC, Compter, Cisco,

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,120
VMware, Microsoft and of course, Awadi.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,390
I've always enjoyed learning, which is why it's such a great privilege to be able to do this full time

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,940
now and learn and teach others as well.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,180
I.T. certification has changed my life in many ways.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,640
It's helped me to develop a great career and it's also helped me to travel the world and end up where

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,470
I am today.

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,250
So it'd be great to connect.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,850
And there are several ways you can do that.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm on LinkedIn, so please connect with me on LinkedIn and share your course completion certificate

21
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,180
or share your Awista vacation.

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,110
I love to share in my student success, so please tag me and I would be sure to congratulate you on

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,810
your achievement.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,080
You can also find me on Facebook.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,590
We have a group called Awista Vacation Kuai.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,120
It's got many thousands of members and there's tons of engagement on there.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,150
So it's a great place to hang out and ask questions and share knowledge with other students.

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,020
I also have a YouTube channel for digital cloud training, so there's lots of free videos on there and

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,670
I'm adding new ones all the time.

30
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,770
So great place to get some free content.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,710
Last but not least, there's the slack workspace.

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,580
That's a really good place to find me.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,060
I like to hang out in slack, so please feel free to pop in and ask questions.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,250
So I really hope you'll get in touch.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,390
I look forward to hearing about your success and I hope you enjoy the course.
