00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.110
Hi guys we're back in the Elasticache dashboard.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.870
And this time we're going to create a couple of redis clusters.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.920
So what we're going to do is we're going to create one with cluster-mode enabled and one with cluster-mode

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.190
disabled so that you can understand the differences so let's click Create.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.290
And our first cluster we're going to not enable the cluster-mode.

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.590
So it's going to be cluster-mode disabled so we'll come down here.

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.580
We'll give it a name.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.120
We just call this one redis one and from the description I'm going to cluster mode disabled.

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.710
We then have the options for our engine our port and our parameter group.

10
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.870
I'm going to go in and choose a t2 micro.

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.490
And we now have the option for replicas.

12
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.410
So you can see that we can choose a number of replicas and you can have up to five.

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.360
So you can have between zero and five replicas.

14
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.410
Now the difference between the customer disabled and enabled is that when you click on cluster-mode enabled

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.040
you then get shards.

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.740
So you have shards and then you have replicas of shards.

17
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.570
So let's just head over to the diagram so we can remember what this is all about.

18
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.930
So you have shards with Elasticache redid and with cluster-mode disabled.

19
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.240
You have one shard.

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.850
You then have a primary node.

21
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.010
So this is the node that you're reading in your writing too and you then have your replicas and you

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.620
can have zero up to five replicas and they can be a cross Availability Zones and you can fail over to

23
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.900
a replica.

24
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.900
We have cluster mode enabled.

25
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.540
You then have multiple shards and each shard has a partition of data and each shard can have zero to

26
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.620
five replicas

27
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.010
so back in the console here let's just disable the cluster mode because we're doing a cluster mode disabled

28
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.670
first and let's just stick to two replicas.

29
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.640
And here we have multi AZ and auto failover.

30
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.810
So this means that we can enable high availability and failover to a read replica if our primary node

31
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.210
fails.

32
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.110
Now I'm going to leave the subnet group as it is.

33
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.890
You could then go and select your preferred availability zones so you could choose where your primary

34
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.570
goes.

35
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.650
And then you can choose where your replicas go.

36
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.340
So let's put those into separate Availability Zones you then have an option to enable encryption at

37
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.350
rest and in transit.

38
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.500
Now you can only do this at the point that you actually create the cluster so make sure you make the

39
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.570
right choices here.

40
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.830
That's what we need to configure.

41
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.680
So let's click Create and while that's happening let's go and create a cluster mode enabled cluster.

42
00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.140
So for this one I'm going to call this red is two and the description is going to be a cluster mode

43
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.450
enabled.

44
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.750
And again we get to choose are no type.

45
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.090
I want to use t2 micro again.

46
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.630
And then we get to choose how many shards we want.

47
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.690
So let's just go with two shards each with two replicas.

48
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.640
You now have a few more options in how you can distribute your slots in key spaces so you can choose

49
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.020
a custom distribution you can specify your Availability Zones.

50
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.260
So you have the slots and key spaces thing

51
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.020
and slots in key spaces are beyond the scope of the solutions architect's exam.

52
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.990
They probably come up in the devops exam.

53
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.710
You can then choose your primary replica for each shard and choose where you want that to be.

54
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.540
Let's just leave it is no preference.

55
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.790
An equal distribution.

56
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.360
Again you get the option to enable encryption.

57
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.860
Remember this didn't come up with Memcached because you can't encrypt with Memcached.

58
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.900
And we then have the options for backups

59
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.740
let's click Create.

60
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.350
It's been a few minutes now and both of our clusters are available and we can see that one is mode redis

61
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.660
and the other is mode clustered red is.

62
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.590
Let's go into our cluster mode disabled cluster first and have a look.

63
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.970
So again there's a few options for modification.

64
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.090
We can come in here and we can change that no type.

65
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.930
We can change from multi AZ to on or off and we can change some of the information around backup and

66
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.010
maintenance windows and you can then go in and click the cluster name.

67
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.420
And here you can add two or more nodes so you can add an additional node choose the name for and this is

68
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.790
a read replica node and you can choose the availability zone.

69
00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.680
You can also go into a primary node here and you can delete reboot and file over and you can also get

70
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.440
the endpoint.

71
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.690
You can see some cloud launch metrics below.

72
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.040
And if you select a replica in the list you can also go to actions and click promote.

73
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.710
So let's try promoting a replica and we'll apply this immediately

74
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.990
so it says you cannot manually promote a new master cache cluster while also failover is enabled so

75
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:39.780
when you have automatic fail over enabled you're not able to manually failover let's try another way.

76
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:49.510
Let's go to the primary node and choose failover primary and if we head down to events now we can

77
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.720
see test fail over API called the node group travels 0 1.

78
00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.660
Let's go back and have a look and see if it's changed the node and it took a few seconds but now we

79
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.880
can see that red is one dash 0 0.

80
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.170
Is the new primary.

81
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.100
So that works.

82
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:17.440
So you can't promote a replica when you have the failover enabled but you can failover a primary.

83
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.640
Let's go back now and have a look at our clustered radius.

84
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.760
So this is the one with cluster mode enabled

85
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.690
and with this we have two shards each with three nodes.

86
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.090
So we have six nodes in total.

87
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.280
So let's head in and have a look at the nodes

88
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.260
so here you see the shards and if you click on a shard then you get to see the nodes

89
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.930
and we can click back up here and then you can go into the other shard and options here are you can

90
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.040
failover the primary

91
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.300
and you can copy node endpoints and delete the nodes.

92
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.640
That's all you can do.

93
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:19.950
You can also come in and add a node and again you're adding certain number of replicas so let's go back

94
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:27.830
up to the cluster level and just have a look at the cluster configuration so just like with the other

95
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.260
read this option you have a couple of options in here for your security groups, your parameter groups,

96
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.720
your backups, and then your windows for maintenance and backup.

97
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.050
And that's really it.

98
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.900
So that's it.

99
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.670
For Redis the key thing really is to know the differences between memcacheD and then the two

100
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.540
redis modes.

101
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.490
So redis with cluster mode disabled and redis with cluster mode enabled.

102
00:07:52.490 --> 00:08:00.500
And then understand the use cases for elasticache which are really things like session state for non

103
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.710
persistent data and then in some cases for persistent data where you need very low latency and high

104
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.890
performance.

105
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:18.140
So what we're going to do now is delete these clusters and we can just select the option to

106
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.790
not to create a final backup

107
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.660
and that's both of our clusters being deleted.
