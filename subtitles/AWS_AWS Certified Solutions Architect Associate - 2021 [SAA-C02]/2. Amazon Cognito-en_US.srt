00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,270
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:09,500
In this lab we're going to cover Amazon called Cognito. Cognito is a service which is used with web and

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,040
mobile apps.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,660
So when you see exam questions that talk about authentication using web or mobile apps Cognito is

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,980
definitely something that should come to your mind and then you can start thinking about does it fit

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,720
this use case.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,870
So Cognito provides authentication authorization and use and management for web and mobile apps.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,690
And that means that your users can sign in directly with a username and password or even for a third

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,540
party provider such as Facebook Amazon or Google.

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,820
Now there are two main components to Cognito.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,250
And you can see these up on a screen here.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:53,840
You've got user pools and you've got identity pools the user pool is the is a user directory

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:04,180
and your users sign in to the web or mobile app through Cognito or federate with a third party identity

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,250
provider using a user pool.

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:21,050
Identity pools on the other hand are used to obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services

16
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,990
and that would include things such as S3 and DynamoDB.

17
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:32,360
So you have the user pool which is used for sign up and sign in services and then you have the identity

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,680
pool which is about connecting to AWS services.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,250
So a little bit more about user polls you can have social signin with Facebook Google you can also

20
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:51,500
log in with Amazon and you can also use SAML and IDP identity providers. You have user directory management

21
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,800
and user profiles and you have the option for multi factor authentication and other security features.

22
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,140
We have identity pools,

23
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,970
you also get social signin with Facebook Google or Amazon.

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,410
You also get open ID connect and SAML so you can actually use identity pools for that kind of

25
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,860
authentication and you can use user pools for it so you can use them independently or you can use them

26
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,930
together.

27
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,720
Now what I want to do is just show you a diagram which shows you a typical use case for called meta.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,990
So in this diagram what you can see is on the left hand side here you have an app and that apps running

29
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,370
and needs to get access to some AWS services.

30
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,130
So in this case you have a Cognito user pool and the first thing that happens is you need to get a

31
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,690
token from the company so you support so your fence casing here.

32
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:53,940
But you then need to access state AWS services so now what happens is you exchange your tokens for

33
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,240
AWS credentials and that's temporary AWS credentials and you can then access the service.

34
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,110
So you have the user ID stored in the user pool you have the Cognito identity pool where you are

35
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,790
then allowing access to the services and then this whole exchange takes place which allows the web user

36
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:25,240
or the app user to access the service.

37
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,280
So that's a bit about what it is and you probably don't need to know a huge amount more than that at

38
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,040
this stage for the exam.

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,530
But what we're gonna do is we're just going to go into the console and have a look around.

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,090
Now I may add a lap a bit later on that shows an actual use case where we can actually build this out

41
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,480
and really get it working.

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,400
But for now what I'm gonna do is just show you around the console so we can go in and manage user pools

43
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,000
and you can then click on Create a user pool and you need to give it a pool name so let's just call

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,190
this my user pool and you can see all these options on the left here so you can go free and modify these.

45
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:16,170
So you might say that you want a user name and also allow signin with an email address.

46
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,930
You can choose which attributes you want to require.

47
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,540
So in this case we're requiring an email.

48
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,020
You can set a password policy.

49
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,330
You can integrate with MFA.

50
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:39,130
You can customize addresses and tags and choose whether you want to remember the devices that the clients

51
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,650
connect it from.

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,010
You can then have your app clients which you would add in here and you can add triggers for workflows

53
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,600
and then you can just go down and create your pull.

54
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,720
So we haven't changed much.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,360
We do need to provide a name parameter.

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:02,660
So let's just go back up here and it's lost my name my user pool.

57
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:11,270
And if you click on review defaults and then create pool and so we now have a pool and you can see on

58
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,810
the left there are a couple of additional sections have come in.

59
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,940
You've got the app integration where you can specify domains UI customization for your app client and

60
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,080
so on.

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,000
And these are the actual places we can put that information in.

62
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,380
And then you've got a federation.

63
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,970
So under here you can enable certain identity providers and obviously here you can see Facebook Google

64
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,840
Amazon, SAML and OpenID connect.

65
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,270
So that's a user pool.

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:46,390
Let's go back up to the front screen and choose manage identity pools so hey let's just create one

67
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:52,770
called MyID pull and you can configure your authentication providers here.

68
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,560
So you'd need to go in and specify this information.

69
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:02,380
You could specify your user pull here or you could choose to enter your app ID for Amazon or for Facebook

70
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,310
or so on.

71
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,320
And you've also got Twitter as you can see in here and custom.

72
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,850
Alternatively you can just select this option here enable access to UNO fence gated identities and that

73
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,750
will allow us just to create the pool without having to specify any more information.

74
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:24,370
So once that's created you can view details and you can specify and IAM role can view the policy document

75
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,210
and so on.

76
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:32,400
We then go back up to the dashboard here and you can see our identity pool is being created.

77
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,970
We don't have any identities in there yet.

78
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,840
You've got this sample code here which you can download.

79
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,450
And we've got the identity browser so we don't actually have any identities at the moment.

80
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:49,540
Let's just go back up to user pools if you wanted to add identities to your user pool you can then go

81
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,920
in here and create a user and then you can specify a user name and an email address and you need to

82
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,850
select this option for phone number.

83
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,840
If you just want to leave that blank and you can create a user you can also import users.

84
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,110
So in this case you can choose to import a job.

85
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,760
Now we're not going to do any more with these at this stage.

86
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:19,270
I think the key thing to remember for the exam is that Cognito is used for web and app authentication.

87
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,300
Now we're not going to do any more with Cognito right now.

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,060
But what you need to remember for the exam is that company so is used for authentication, authorization

89
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,120
and user management for web and mobile apps.

90
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,390
Make sure you understand the providers that you can integrate with in other words the identity providers.

91
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:43,810
So that's Facebook, Google, Amazon, SAML and OID connect and know the difference between user pools

92
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,310
and identity pools.

93
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,410
And I'll share some links for some further reading with the course downloads.

94
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:56,050
So if you want to delete your user pool you can just go in and delete pool and you just type in delete

95
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,290
and then we can go to identity Paul.

96
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:07,780
And if you just go into the pool and edit identity pol and then scroll down and choose Delete identity

97
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,370
poll and that's all you need to do.
