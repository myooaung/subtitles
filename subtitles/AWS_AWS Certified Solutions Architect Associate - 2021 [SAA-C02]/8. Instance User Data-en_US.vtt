00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.490
We're now going to discuss instance use data so we discuss meta data before on the same article you

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.650
can see user data.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.280
If you just scroll down a bit further

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.340
and what instance data actually is is it's information that you can pass into the instance as it boots.

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.380
So for instance you can run some commands as the instance boots and configure your system.

6
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.760
So we're gonna head over to the management console and actually launch an instance and see this in action.

7
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.810
So we're gonna choose launch instance choose the Amazon then it's 2 a.m. I and the T2 micro instance

8
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.810
type and then we're going to leave all the defaults but we're going to go down to advance details here

9
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.290
and this is where we put in our user data so I have mine on my clipboard what I have is the path to

10
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.770
my interpreter then you My date that's why it's what date packages then I'm going to install the hasty

11
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.340
teepee daemon then I'm going to start it and enable it so I'll have a web server at this point I'll

12
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.850
then change in to the hasty email directory and create a page that has this text on it which we should

13
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.480
then be able to connect to on port 80 we can then choose next.

14
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.880
Next again and configure security group now under select an existing security group I have my web access

15
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.420
security group and I've actually already added port AC into it.

16
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.110
If you haven't got that you need to just go into your security group and add 80 inbound we can then

17
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.200
choose review and launch and launch.

18
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.210
It's been a couple of minutes.

19
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.540
My instance is running.

20
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.460
It's still initializing but let's see if we can connect to the web server.

21
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.010
So choose copy the clipboard to get the IP address and then I'm going to put in the IP address and my

22
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.060
browser.

23
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.710
And there we go we've got the text which we're expecting saying this is a test page running on Apache

24
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.530
or easy to India W.S. cloud.

25
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.220
So that's awesome.

26
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.670
So we've used a dates and we can pass this information in and configure our system run commands as it

27
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.450
boots up.

28
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.660
We can also run a command on the instance to actually see the information that's configured in the user

29
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.670
data I'm logged on to my instance and I can just run curl and then put in this IP address.

30
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.730
So it's very similar to the use to the metadata we covered in the previous lab except it's hasty teepee

31
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.730
1 6 9 2 5 4 1 6 9 2 5 4 slash later slash user data and you don't need the trading Slash.

32
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.230
And in this case you can see the information that's stored in the user data.

33
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.430
So that's really it we're going to use user data quite a lot throughout this course because we're going

34
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.030
to configure web servers and various other configurations quite a few times.

35
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.220
So you'll see this over and over again.

36
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.340
That's it for now guys.

37
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.310
See an excellent.
