00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:09.690
When you launch your EC2 instances you can choose to put them in a placement group and what happens

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.400
is when you launch multiple EC2 instances normally they will just get placed on the underlying

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.680
physical hardware in a way that you have no control over.

4
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.210
So you don't really know if let's say you launch two instances that are part of some kind of application

5
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.010
cluster.

6
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.840
You don't know whether they're sitting on the same underlying host the same physical server or whether

7
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.870
they're spread across different servers.

8
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.840
Now because of application clustering you might want to control that.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.220
You might also want to make sure that your instances are placed very close together.

10
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.220
So they have better node to node communication.

11
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.220
So that's what placement groups are.

12
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.430
Now there's three different types.

13
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.910
We have cluster, partition, and spread. So with the cluster placement group.

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.100
This is where your instances are placed very close together inside a single availability zone.

15
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.880
And this means that you get really low latency and no time and no communication is low latency and fast

16
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.450
because they're close together.

17
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.140
So think about tightly coupled applications and think about high performance computing or HPC.

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.370
applications.

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.060
I know in the SAA-C02 version of the exam high performance computing is starting to show up now

20
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.970
at this stage while I'm recording this the beta has completed and the actual final release of the exam

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.660
is scheduled for a couple of months time because it's January 2020 at the moment. By the time you watch

22
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.850
this

23
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.280
that might not be the case you might already be studying for the SAA-C02 and if so make sure you understand

24
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.920
high performance computing and we'll talk a bit more about the different types of adapter that you use

25
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160
for high performance computing as well shortly.

26
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.010
So we then have the partition placement group and this is where your instances are spread using logical

27
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.950
partitions so that you know that one group of instances does not share the same underlying hardware

28
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.210
as another group.

29
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.150
So you can have multiple instances or one host and multiple instances on a number.

30
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.550
Now I'll show you some diagrams shortly so that all this makes a bit more sense.

31
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.550
We then have a spread placement group and what this means is that you have your instances spread across

32
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.910
distinct underlying hardware.

33
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.540
Again the diagrams will make this easier.

34
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.430
So let's go through and have a look at some of these diagrams.

35
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.990
So this is what a cluster placement group looks like and you see that there's multiple EC2 instances

36
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.420
within a single availability zone and we know that these instances are going to be placed very close

37
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.740
together so on hardware that's very physically close.

38
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.150
And that means that you get better inter-node communications so good for high performance computing good

39
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.120
for tightly coupled applications and good to make sure you have that low latency and good bandwidth

40
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.890
between the instances.

41
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.820
Now you use enhanced networking and that means you're going to use an enhanced network adapter or an

42
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.180
ENA.

43
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.170
So we then have a partition placement group and here we can see that we can use multiple Availability

44
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.510
Zones and we have a partition here with a number of instances in it and another politician.

45
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.710
And we know that these partitions are going to be located on separate AWS racks.

46
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.190
So there's a layer of resiliency there because each rack has its own unique power sources and backup

47
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.450
power sources.

48
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.820
And obviously there's networking that's redundant as well.

49
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.400
So you now know that you've got a cluster here which is on in one rack and you got another cluster in

50
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.430
another rack and you got another cluster of instances that's in another rack and another availability

51
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.450
zone.

52
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.020
And we that have the spread placement groups.

53
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.870
And in this case what you can see is each instance is actually located in a separate rack.

54
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.390
So each of these red lines corresponds to a completely separate rack.

55
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.210
So Iraq you know is a sort of closet that you put your servers into when you have lots of different

56
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.990
servers in them and each rack is therefore going to only have one instance that's part of your application.

57
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.600
So there's lots of resiliency there you know that in this case you have five EC2 instances that

58
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.780
are part of your application and you know they're spread across five different racks and each of those

59
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.230
racks has its own redundant power and networking.

60
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.760
So lots of resiliency for your application within the AWS management console.

61
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.270
And I'm just gonna head over it's EC2 and you may notice that as this is a newer video the look

62
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.270
and feel of the EC2 console is changed a bit so we can say up here I'm actually using the new easy

63
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.960
to experience and you can easily switch that off if you want to.

64
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.280
It's not a huge difference but there's just a few enhancements now we're just going to scroll down to

65
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.950
placement groups and the networking and security and what we can do now is we can go in and create a

66
00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:01.590
placement group and say I'm going to create myclusterPG For place placement group and I'm just gonna

67
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.030
choose the strategy cluster and we can choose create and then we can go back in and we can create a

68
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.540
spread placement group, myspreadPG

69
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.940
and let's just go in and also create a partition placement group.

70
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.410
And this is the only time that you need to specify the number of partitions.

71
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.900
Let's just choose two and it says the maximum number is seven.

72
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.070
So we've created all of those and that's really all there is to it.

73
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.180
And what we can do now is go to instances and launch an instance.

74
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.370
Now what I'm gonna do first I'm just gonna carry on as per normal and choose the Linux 2 AMI and

75
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.230
the T2 micro and we can see here that we can choose to place the instance into a placement group.

76
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.560
So let's have a look that's add to an existing placement group.

77
00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.220
And what we can see is I can add these into my partition placement group and I can add into the spread

78
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.820
placement group that we created.

79
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.530
But as you can note there's no cluster placement group here and that's because the T2 micro cannot

80
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.060
go into a cluster placement group.

81
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.940
So there are specific requirements on what instance type you can add.

82
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.100
So let's just cancel out and try again.

83
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:27.920
I'm still going to choose the next two am I but let's go down and try a let's try a C5-large choose

84
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.650
next choose to add to a placement group.

85
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.110
And now we can choose to put into the cluster placement group as well.

86
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.460
And we're not actually going to go and launch any instances now.

87
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.890
I just want to show you where you go to create your placement groups and then how you can actually specify

88
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.300
the placement groups when you launch your instances.

89
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.530
So when you add to a placement group EC2 two will then automatically ensure that the policy for that

90
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.570
placement group and how your instances are placed on the hardware is followed.

91
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.410
Now let's just go back to the slides and I've got one more here for you.

92
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.580
And this just compares the different types of placement groups.

93
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.100
So we've got the cluster the spread in the Partition. So with clustered

94
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.910
this is about placing your instances into low latency groups within a single AZ and you use it to

95
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.010
get low network latency and high network throughput.

96
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.360
And remember you can use an enhanced networking adapter with your cluster placement group.

97
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.680
It's recommended that you do launch or you instances up front that you can add them later on with a

98
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.240
spread placement group.

99
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.810
Your instances are spread across underlying hardware and this reduces the risk of simultaneous instance

100
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.790
failure if the underlying hardware fails and that can also span across Availability Zones.

101
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.850
You can have a maximum of seven instances running in a spread placement group per availability zone.

102
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.190
We then have the partition placement group.

103
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.360
And in this case the instances are grouped into logical set segments called partitions and they each

104
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.870
use distinct hardware and you use that to control visibility ins to your instance placement.

105
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.840
We then have the partition placement group and in this case the instances are grouped into logical segments

106
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.350
called partitions and they use distinct hardware.

107
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.300
So you can control the visibility into your instance placement.

108
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.960
This reduces the likelihood of correlated failures.

109
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:26.180
So you know if multiple racks go down in the AZ then you can ensure that your application stays running

110
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.400
because you've spread your application across lots of different racks and lots of different underlying

111
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:31.960
hardware.

112
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.620
So that's it for placement groups.

113
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:39.140
Now in the exam cram at the end of the section I'm going to talk a bit more about the different adapters

114
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:45.440
that you can use with high performance computing and also for enhanced networking so the elastic network

115
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:51.380
interface the standard type of adapter the enhanced networking adapter the ENA and also the elastic

116
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.280
fabric adapter.
