00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:10.420
So carry on from the last lesson we launched an easy to instance into our VPC within a region and we

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.580
have an Internet gateway attached to this VPC.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.720
And what we need to do now is we're going to connect using our Internet clients.

5
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.560
So we're going to connect from our own computers to the two instance that we launched on Adewusi.

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.660
So let's head back to the console.

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.330
Back in the console here, we can see that we have our instance.

8
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.500
We can see that it's running.

9
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.900
It's past its status checks, which is good.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.650
That means everything is operational.

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.170
Now, one of the things we can do here is we click connect.

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.730
It actually gives us some information.

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.000
As you can see, there are a few ways you can connect.

14
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.830
We've got the easy to instance connect session manager, which uses another service enable us.

15
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.820
We're not going to use that.

16
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.980
And then each client.

17
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.370
So the SSA client is one of the most common ways to connect to our two instances.

18
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.310
Now, we can see here actually gives us some information.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.650
It tells us that we need to run this command.

20
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.580
Now, this is specific to Linux or Mac.

21
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.900
So if you're running a Linux or Mac, you need to run this command and then you can connect to your

22
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.860
instance using this address.

23
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.670
So this is the public DNS name.

24
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.550
Remember, your instance will have a public IP address.

25
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.040
It also has a public DNS name.

26
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.160
So this is a name that can be resolved to that IP address.

27
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.110
Now, it then gives us an example and the example is actually filled out for us.

28
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.780
So it shows us that we're running a command SSA.

29
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.570
So this is the secure shell and Dashi, the dashi is indicating that we need to supply the name of our

30
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.150
Kuyper.

31
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.040
So this is R.P.M. four that we created in the last lesson.

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.610
And we then connect to easy to use.

33
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.730
And that's the user on the instance.

34
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.350
So it's called easy to dash user and that's for the Amazon Linux operating system.

35
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.840
Then there's an app sign and then this is that public DNS name that you can see here.

36
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.610
So that's the way that we're going to connect.

37
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.300
For instance.

38
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.760
Now this again is for Linux and Mac.

39
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.620
We're then going to connect via Windows.

40
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.330
Now, depending on your Windows operating system, you might also have an associate's utility.

41
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.960
I'll show you.

42
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.610
It's very much the same command.

43
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.580
And also on Windows, if you don't have an associate's utility or you prefer to use putty, that's another

44
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.790
way.

45
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.860
And I'm going to show you how to use Putsy as well.

46
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.640
So what I'm going to do is unmilitary.

47
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.060
Just going to copy this entire command, cancel out of there and go over to a command prompt.

48
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.220
So I'm on a command prompt.

49
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.190
And I know that in this directory I do have my keypad, so I'm going to run this command, says SNH

50
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.470
Dash.

51
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.320
I then the key person, make sure that you've changed to a directory on your file system where you stored

52
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.490
the PM file, otherwise it won't work.

53
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.990
Now let's just hit enter.

54
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.600
Now, there will be an error message here because I wanted to show you I haven't run the command, which

55
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.850
I'm supposed to first.

56
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.140
So let's try and connect.

57
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.080
It's asking us to type yes or no.

58
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.280
I'm going to type yes.

59
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.200
And then we get an issue.

60
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.620
And it's basically saying that we have an unprotected private keeper.

61
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.390
So the key file and so what we need to do is run a certain command if we come back.

62
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.030
Remember, it was actually recommending that command to us.

63
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.110
That command is not just copy that Mod 400 Sydney Dash keep add up.

64
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.720
And that's the name of my keep our files might be different.

65
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.620
So we're changing the permissions assigned to that file.

66
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.090
So let's come back.

67
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.820
We're going to run this command that's run.

68
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.860
I'm just going to clear the screen and bring this down to the middle and then let's rerun the command

69
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.880
to connect via SNH and that's it.

70
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.280
We are now on our operating system in the cloud.

71
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.950
So we're now able to run commands on our Linux operating system on Adewusi.

72
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.470
And we can see at the command prompt here that it shows us who were connected and it says easy to dash.

73
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.120
I remember that's the user account.

74
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.210
We connect it as we specified that back up here.

75
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.640
And then it shows us the IP address.

76
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.570
But this is the private IP address of the instance, not the public IP address.

77
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.310
So now we can run commands.

78
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:20.050
For instance, we could run pseudo youm updates to run updates on our operating system, and that's

79
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.470
complete.

80
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.520
So now we have our all of our packages updated on our operating system.

81
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.290
So that's how it works.

82
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.270
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to see how we would do the same thing if our client's operating

83
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.070
system is Windows instead of Linux or Mac.

84
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.530
So what I've done to demonstrate this to you is I'm actually running a Windows server in another region

85
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.360
and in this case it's Singapore.

86
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.180
So I'm running a window server in Singapore.

87
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.240
And from this Windows Server, I want to connect to my Linux instance in Sydney.

88
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.070
So let's see how we can do that.

89
00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.000
Now, as I mentioned before, there are a couple of ways so we can actually run S.H. commands.

90
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.350
On this Windows server, depending on your client operating system, it may not have the utility installed.

91
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.320
But if I type S.H., you can see that we actually have a necesito utility now.

92
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:22.200
Also note, I have my key PDF file here so I can run SNH dash, I, I'm going to drag in this keypad

93
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.120
file so I get the path to the file.

94
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.050
And this is the key profile, obviously, for my ACSU instance in Sydney, and then what I need to do

95
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.430
is run to dash user at and I need to get the public IP address or DNS name of my easy to instant's.

96
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.250
So back in the consult with my instant selected, I'm just going to copy the public IP address, come

97
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.380
back and paste that in here, enter.

98
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.640
And unconnected, so I'm now connected into my Linux instance, so it's that simple.

99
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.870
Now, you might not have this utility installed, so I'm going to show you another way.

100
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.000
Let's go to Internet Explorer.

101
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.450
I'm going to head over to Google and then search for Putti download.

102
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.750
So putting is a tool that we can use.

103
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.500
Let's just click on this link here and let's click on Download Party.

104
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.540
I'm going to choose to install the 64 bit version of the mouse I click on Run and that's just go through

105
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.240
this wizard just leaving the defaults and click on install and finish.

106
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:35.330
So once that's done, what we can do now is firstly the putting tool does not use RPM files, it uses

107
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.260
PPK files.

108
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:42.350
Remember earlier I told you that if you launched your instance with a PPK file and you can create those

109
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.690
in the console by going down to the keypads in the left hand pane of the management console, then would

110
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.830
be able to use that file.

111
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.730
But we didn't.

112
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.640
We used to RPM.

113
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.430
So now we need to convert it to a PPK.

114
00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.550
So the first thing we do is let's find the putty folder and let's choose to use Putti again.

115
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.830
So this will generate a PPK file.

116
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.720
So what we do is we click on load, let's go to our desktop.

117
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.820
We need to change here to all files so that we can see the EPM file.

118
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.770
And let's click on Open, just like that message and then let's click on click on Save Private Key.

119
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.510
And now it's going to create this PPK file.

120
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.330
So I'm going to call this one Sedney.

121
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.170
That's Kepi.

122
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.260
But in this case, it's going to be a PPK file.

123
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.510
So let's save that file and close partition.

124
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.280
So we've now got this ready.

125
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.740
So the next thing to do is go back to party and we're going to use the pundits all itself.

126
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.670
That is a few things we need to do here.

127
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:50.780
So first, we come down to Conexion, S.H., come down to earth and then you see private key file for

128
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.890
authentication here.

129
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.090
We need to choose the file that we just created.

130
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.410
So we've got to choose this PPK file.

131
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.820
Click on Open.

132
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.400
Let's come back up to session here at the top.

133
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.050
We need to have SNH selected.

134
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.350
We so again have the hostname or IP address.

135
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.010
I've already got mine in my clipboard and then we need to make sure that we put in easy to dash user

136
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.610
at the beginning.

137
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:23.180
Remember, this is important for Amazon, Linux and then at so we should have easy to dash user at and

138
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.220
the IP address Port 22 and we've loaded our private key file.

139
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.080
So let's click on Open and there we are, we're on our Linux instant's.

140
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.430
So that's another way to connect to our Linux instant's on aways from a Windows client.

141
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.680
So you've got two options there to use the S.H. utility in your operating system, if it's there or

142
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.700
otherwise use putty.

143
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.650
So that's it for this lesson.

144
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.940
Let's go back now and we're going to terminate our instance because we've finished with it back in the

145
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.510
console.

146
00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:00.470
We can now go to Instant State Termini instance and click on Terminate and that's successfully terminated

147
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.160
our instance.

148
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.420
So I hope you enjoyed that.

149
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.010
And I'll see you in the next lesson.
