Hi, guys, cross account.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.630
Access is another I am topic that can come up in the exam now.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.350
I actually covered this particular diagram back in Section seven and we did a hands on lab and I showed

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.520
you how to set this up.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.940
But right now I just want to recover off of you to refresh your memory.

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.940
So remember, you use cross account access when you have a user in one account who needs to access a

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.440
resource in another account.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.760
So in this example, John wants to access an ESRI bucket, an account site, and he's an account B.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.630
Now you need to give him a policy that allows John to assume a role in the other account.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.050
And then you have a role in the other account of a policy applied to it.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.420
And that provides access to the bucket.

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.180
So basically, John is assuming the role in the other account, then accessing the bucket, using the

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.830
permissions applied to that role.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.500
So cross account access is useful for situations where an enterprise customer has separate accounts.

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.420
So you might have your development account and your production account and you need to be on access

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.740
resources with one.

17
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.030
I am user account across those different A.W. s accounts.

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.030
So that makes it easier to work productively within a multi account or multi role environment.

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.850
And you can switch roles within the AWB management console so you can sign into the console using your

20
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.430
IAM username and then switch the console to manage another account without having to log back in again

21
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.050
with a different username and password.

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.780
And this lets users from one account access resources another to make a request in a different account.

23
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.790
The resource in that account must have an attached resource base policy with the permissions you need

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.740
or you must assume a role.

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
So an identity based policy within that account with the permissions you need.

26
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.670
So that's probably about we need to know across account access.

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.050
And again, I would recommend going back to watch that lap if you haven't seen it already or you've

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.550
forgotten some of the contents, because you do need to understand how this works for the exam.
