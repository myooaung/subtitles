00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.280
Welcome to a hands on lesson for Amazon Route 53 now in this lesson, I'm going to use the registrar

2
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.210
capabilities of Route 50 free to register a domain name, and I'm going to use that to my name for a

3
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.740
few lessons in this course.

4
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.110
But to be fair, not a lot of lessons.

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.270
I'm going to use it a couple of times to show you how we can use our own custom domain names to connect

6
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.690
to resources using Route 53.

7
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.740
Now it's totally optional, and it's going to cost you up to around 10 or 12 dollars to actually register

8
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.320
a domain so you don't need to.

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.280
If you, you know, if you've got the money and you're happy to do that, then by all means register

10
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.820
a domain.

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.600
Otherwise, just watch what I do and you'll learn a bit through the process.

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.540
So in the management console, I'm going to go to services.

13
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.370
Let's come down to networking and content delivery and Route 53.

14
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.280
Now I land on this main dashboard here and we can see some of the features of Route 53.

15
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.530
We've got DNS management, traffic management, availability, monitoring, I suppose, health checks

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.960
we talked about and domain registration.

17
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.720
So I'm going to choose registered domain.

18
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.720
We now get to choose the domain name we want.

19
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.480
So I would love to have IWC Cloud Labs, but there's a good chance that I won't be able to get that

20
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.720
one.

21
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.550
It sounds like quite a good domain name.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.220
So certainly the dot com is not available.

23
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.830
You then get some other options here.

24
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.640
But what I'm going to do instead.

25
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.100
Let's put in DCT Cloud Labs and you'll just need to find something unique.

26
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.590
So we've DCT Cloud Labs, I can get the dot com, and there's some other options.

27
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.430
Sometimes you find some lower priced options, even down to five bucks.

28
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.370
So have a search, and the various suffixes are in this little dropdown list here.

29
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.050
And you can see the prices vary quite a bit, so you can find some cheaper ones.

30
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.320
Now I'm happy with this.

31
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.090
I'm going to add DCT Cloud Lipscombe to my cart register for one year.

32
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.210
Click on Continue and then you'll need to fill out the registrant contact information.

33
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.780
Now, make sure you get the correct email address in here.

34
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.420
If you want to do things like registering a SSL certificate through the Amazon Certificate manager,

35
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.240
it's going to send a request to this email address, so make sure that's one that you're actually monitoring.

36
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.460
Once you filled out that information, you just have to accept the terms and conditions and complete

37
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.920
the order so the order is being processed.

38
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.960
And what we'll find is if we go to hosted zones and we don't actually have anything here yet.

39
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.990
Keep an eye on this pop back in a few minutes and what you should find is that you have a hosting zone

40
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.000
for the domain name you've just registered.
