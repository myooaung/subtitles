Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.520
The last thing I want to do to secure my account is apply an IAM password policy.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.000
Now you can do this either by choosing this link here or if you go down to account settings on the left

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.370
hand side here.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.480
This is the password policy.

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.660
So this is simply a case of choosing what your minimum password length is, I think eight is quite a good

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.080
number.

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.320
So going to change it to eight I'm already requiring at least one uppercase letter.

9
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.170
You could choose to require a number as well for instance and you can also use set expiration choose

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.820
whether users are allowed to change their own password or not prevent Password Reuse and so on.

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.820
So it's literally just a case of going in there and applying the password policy if you want to learn

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.860
a bit more about password policies.

13
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.630
You can choose this managing passwords knowing which opens up this site AWS article.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.600
There are a couple of interesting things here.

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.870
For instance you want to know that the IAM password policy does not apply to the AWS account root user

16
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.630
a password.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.280
Also you can't create a lockout policy.

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.900
What AWS recommend instead is that you use multifactor authentication

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.670
Now we enabled MFA on the root account but you can enable it on other accounts as well.

20
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.700
And it's a best practice to do so for any administrative uses that have significant privileges

21
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.650
so that's it for this lab.

22
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.390
Guys just wanted to show you the password policy we should now have our account nice and secure.

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.060
If we just go back to the dashboard and let's refresh this page we've got a nice view of five tick marks

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.720
and a five out of five complete for our security status.

25
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.230
So that's all good.

26
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.630
I'll see you in the next snap where I'm going to talk to you a bit more about the AWS global infrastructure

27
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.700
and virtual private cloud.
