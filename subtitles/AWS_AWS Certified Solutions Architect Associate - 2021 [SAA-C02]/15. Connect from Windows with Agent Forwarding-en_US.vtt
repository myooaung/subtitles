00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:10.770
Some students have had difficulty connecting to the instances in the private subnets using Agent forwarding

2
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.320
when they're connecting from a Windows P.C..

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.730
So in the labs we've done this and we've used Agent forwarding using SSH.

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.400
And when you use Windows P.C. you have to use Putty and a tool called Pageant.

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.840
And I want to show you how to do that in this lab just to make absolutely clear. So the configuration

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510
is going to be much like this.

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.310
We have a private subnet.

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.300
We've got a NAT gateway for outbound Internet access and we're gonna be connecting from a Windows P.C.

9
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.930
on the Internet and we're going to connect to our jump host here and then from our jump post we're going

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.730
to connect it to the private instance.

11
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.360
But the point is we don't want to have any keys stored here so we're going to use Agent forwarding from

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.200
the windows P.C. so that once we've connected to this one we don't need to specify a key pair in order

13
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.100
to connect to the private instance.

14
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.360
So let's head over to the console and see how we can do this.

15
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.460
Now before we get started in the console I just want to show you.

16
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.250
If you search for Agent forwarding AWS EC2 one of the first articles that you're going to find here

17
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.950
is securely connect to Linux instances running in a private Amazon VPC.

18
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.050
And if you come down here it gives you all the information about how to do this using SSH and then

19
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.490
it also shows you how to do it on Windows.

20
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.730
And so we're basically going to follow the instructions here and I'll walk you through that now.

21
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.960
So the configuration is we have our instance in the public subnet and we have an instance which is

22
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.540
in a private subnet.

23
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.950
All it has is a private IP address.

24
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.360
Now I have a Windows virtual machine running on my computer and I have Putty installed and I've also

25
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.550
got my keypair file saved as a private key file so a PPK file which we can use with Putty and I showed

26
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.950
you how to do that earlier on in the section.

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.700
So what I need to do first is I'm going to go to this tool called Pageant and I click on pageant and

28
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.070
you'll see the system tray icon pops up and I double click on that.

29
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.030
We can now add a key and I'm gonna choose this key on my desktop.

30
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.350
This is the PPK file and click on open.

31
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.620
Now if you've configured a password you'll have to put the password in but I didn't do that.

32
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.580
So if I just closed out I now have the PPK file or the keypair actually loaded into pageant and it's

33
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.690
going to now forward that on for us.

34
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.760
So what I do is I open Putty.

35
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:53.250
I just want to change a setting here and then we need to go down to SSH auth and I don't specify a

36
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.540
private key file here.

37
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.280
All I do is click on allow agent forwarding so you don't need to specify the file and then then go to

38
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.170
session and let's connect to our public instance.

39
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.180
So I just need to get the IP address and I don't actually have the clipboard working on this.

40
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.570
So I'm just going to have to type this in.

41
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.690
So I still need to do.

42
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:26.910
Easy ec2-user@ and let's put in the IP so it's 52.62.87.112.

43
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.530
And now we just click open.

44
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.830
And so we're connected to our EC2 instance.

45
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.050
If I just expand this so that it's a bit more clear for you.

46
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.680
And what I want to do now is get the IP address of my private instance.

47
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.710
So that's 10.0.4.100.

48
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.690
So I shouldn't need to specify a key pair now.

49
00:03:48.850 --> 00:04:00.680
I just need to do SSh ec2-user@10.0.4.100 and hit enter and there we are we can

50
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:09.390
now see that we're connected to 10.0.4.100 and that's the instance in the private subnet.

51
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.430
So that's how you do it.

52
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.760
You know the instructions are there on the AWS Web site as well so you can easily follow through on

53
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.540
those.

54
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.810
But that's how you connect.

55
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.560
So the key thing to remember is you've got to set up the pageant tool.

56
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.850
And when you install Putty that will be installed by default.

57
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.770
So you get a couple of tools you get the PuttyGen and the pageant.

58
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:37.700
So just add your key pair to pageant and then when you connect allow agent forwarding but don't specify

59
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.620
you keep pair file.
