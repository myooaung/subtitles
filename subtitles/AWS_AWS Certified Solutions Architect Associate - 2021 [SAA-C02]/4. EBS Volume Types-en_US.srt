1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,050
So we can have a look at EBS volume types now.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:13,220
So EBS can be found within the EC2 dashboard and you can attach EBS volumes to an instance when

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,680
you launch it or you can create them independently here and you can also do this via the command

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:18,980
line.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,790
So we can go in and click Create volume and the first thing that we're asked to do is to choose the

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,460
volume type and we can see that there's a few different options here.

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,190
And if you hover over the little information icon it tells you a little bit about the different

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,360
volume types.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,840
So general purpose SSD is the default volume type that will be selected when you launch an instance

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,170
for your route volume.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:54,650
And as it says it can burst up to 3000 IOPS per volume and delivers a baseline of three IOPS per gigabyte.

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:01,450
So if you have a look here we've got a 100 gig volumes with 3 IOPS per gigabyte so 300 IOPS

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,220
.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,800
And if we change that 200 then it would just adjust it automatically and then it can burst to three thousand

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,630
if it needs to.

16
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,970
The next one down then is provisioned IOPS and provisioned IOPS can go up to 20000

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,560
IOPS per volume and actually delivers 50 IOPS per gigabyte.

18
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,010
So if we choose provisioned IOPS you get another little information icon here where it gives you a bit

19
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:44,780
more information where it says you can provision up to 50 IOPS per gigabyte so we have our volume size here

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,060
of 100 gigabytes.

21
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:57,750
We can therefore choose up to 5000 IOPS and if we try to go over and go to let's say 5001 then

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,030
it tells us that the ratio is 50 to 1.

23
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,870
So 50 IOPS a gigabyte.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,440
So we have to drop it back to 5000.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,950
So that's the maximum.

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,680
And then we can go up to 16384 about sixteen tibibytes and

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,310
then we would be able to increase this to up to 64,000 IOPS not 64001

28
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,660
.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,930
But up to 64,000 again with that same ratio.

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,620
Now don't try and create this because this would cost you a fortune but that's just to give you an example.

31
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,560
So let's be safe and just drop this way back.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,220
So the other type of volumes that you can choose here are the hard disk drive type.

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,050
So General Purpose and provisioned IOPS are solid state drives.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,430
And then you've got the hard disk drive type.

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,360
So you've got throughput optimized and magnetic it used to be the default for root volumes

36
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,910
but now it's been changed and I think it's just been deprecated away whereas these two might stick around

37
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,590
a bit longer.

38
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,080
Now one of the things you'll notice here.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,190
Well firstly it's just over availability zones so your EBS volume sits within one availability zone

40
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,370
and I'll show you how you can move UBS volumes between availability zones but you have to create it

41
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,150
within a specific availability zone.

42
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,220
The next thing I wanted to show you is the throughput megabytes a second you'll notice that there's no SLA

43
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,460
here.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,150
It doesn't specify anything.

45
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,280
And that's the same for any of these SSD types.

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,890
But when we come down to the hard disk drive type volumes then we get a SLA here and the throughput

47
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,320
optimised is is the best out of those two

48
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,690
so those are your volume types and then you can select a snapshot.

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:55,000
And this will just show you a list of publicly available snapshots or these are just snapshots that

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,660
other people have created.

51
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,960
And if you chose one of those then it would basically just create your volume from that snapshot which

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:09,840
would mean that whatever was installed on that snapshot will be available to you you can then choose

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,100
to encrypt the volume and we're going to cover all of this in detail throughout this section.

54
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,190
But this is just to show you how you can create a volume and a few of these variables.

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,390
The other thing I want to show you is this web page because this also gives you some more information

56
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,190
that you need to know.

57
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,440
So you do need to know this stuff for the exam.

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,740
So here's our hard disk types and our solid state drives.

59
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,760
The general purpose SSD and the provisioned IOPS so we can see that the use case for the general purpose

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:45,360
SSD is most workloads so they said this is a good balance of price to performance, recommended

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,020
for most workloads it's good for system boot volumes good for virtual desktops and low latency interactive

62
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,320
apps and dev test environments.

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,300
On the other hand your provisioned IOPS is about mission critical low latency so this is really high

64
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,110
performance.

65
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,660
So it's more about business critical applications large database workloads that kind of thing then you

66
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:19,810
have throughput optimized hard disk drives you are looking here at lower cost and the lowest cost is the

67
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,350
cold but that's very low performance so you really only use it for some very specific scenarios where

68
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,190
all you care about is cost something is not very important to you

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,470
with the HDD one rather than the SDD one.

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,300
So this is more about throughput so low cost but pretty good throughput.

71
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,480
So there might be some use cases that you want to use this for.

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,070
And again you you might want to just have a look at what's the cost differences you can come down and

73
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:58,810
see that it gives you 500 megabytes a second there vs. a thousand for general purpose and provisioned IOPS.

74
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,740
So there's quite a bit more performance in the provisioned IOPS SSD drive in terms of throughput

75
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,490
but then again the cost of this is going to be so much lower and you could even potentially bundle a

76
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,900
bunch of these disks together in a raid volume to aggregate the throughput.

77
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,250
And we'll talk about that later in this section.

78
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,600
So just familiarize yourself with this table and understand the different use cases and also the limitations

79
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,380
so you can't use even these as a boot volume.

80
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,870
Now you remember back here we did have an option magnetic standard which could be a big volume so you

81
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,710
can still use that but it's not even on this table anymore.

82
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,430
So really it's just being deprecated away.

83
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,190
Another thing to note maximum volume size is the same across all of these 16 tibibytes whereas the

84
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,520
max IOPS is significantly different so much higher on these SSD than it is on these HDD.

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Another thing that you might know is the minimum size is so a gigabyte or gigabyte for here 500 here

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,740
and 500 here.

87
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,100
So just understand those because those can come up in exam questions.

88
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,410
So that's it for this lab.

89
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,990
We're not going to create this volume and we're going to go into a bit more detail about some of these

90
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,550
other parameters in the next labs.
