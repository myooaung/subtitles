00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.950
Before we move on to EFS I just want to make sure that you guys are cleaning up your lab because we've

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.430
created quite a few snapshots, volumes and so on.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.990
So with your AMIs you can just deregister them so you click the deregister and you can just get

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.650
rid of those and you can select multiple at a time.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.660
Then let's go down to snapshots and we should be deleting all of our snapshots

6
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.600
and they're gone.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.760
And then in my case I've got a couple of volumes here that aren't in use so I could just go and delete

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.940
those volumes and then the very last one there is just the one that's attached to my instance.

9
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360
So I'm just gonna terminate that instance.

10
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.060
You might want to also go and check if you've been playing around with another account or in a different

11
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.670
region.

12
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.210
Then just go and check that you don't have any volumes or snapshots or AMIs that you want to get rid

13
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.390
of.

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.280
Another thing you might want to do is to delete your customer key so you'll see CMKs from the key management

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.180
service.

16
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.140
So you do pay for these.

17
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:19.960
I think that about a dollar each per month so you might just want to go in and disable the key and then

18
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.560
what you want to do is go in and schedule key deletion.

19
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.620
So there's actually a waiting period here and the minimum is seven days before you can actually delete

20
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.010
this.

21
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.000
So I'm just putting in the minimum amount of time there and then I can skip click schedule duration

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.770
by need to confirm.

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.980
So confirm here and then schedule deletion.

24
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.830
And so then in several days that will be ready to delete.
