00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,790
Hi, guys, in this lesson, we're going to cover three somewhat related features of free called versioning

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,220
replication and lifecycle rules.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,040
Starting off with versioning, this is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,460
bucket.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,150
So in other words, you upload an object like a file and then you edit that file somewhere else and

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,120
you upload a new version of that file to as free.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,090
Now what as free will do is will keep multiple versions so you can see the old version and the modified

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,450
new version, and you can restore the old version if you need to.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,370
So use versioning to preserve, retrieve and restore every version of each object in your pockets.

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,810
Burgeoning enable buckets will enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.

11
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,840
So remember those two because they can come up as exam topics and make sure you remember that these

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,480
are a couple of the key benefits of versioning.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,090
Next, we have free replication.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,480
Now we have two forms of this one is called cross-regional replication C Ah, and this has been around

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,500
for quite a long time.

16
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,740
We have a bucket in one region here and another bucket in a different region, and we simply set up

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,370
replication so that any data that's written to the bucket in the region on the left is also replicated

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,080
to the bucket in the region on the right.

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,680
Next, we have same region replication and this is just the same thing, but within a region that was

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
added a little more recently.

21
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,530
Now, in both cases, this can not only be across buckets, but also across accounts.

22
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,710
So whether you're using the same region replication or cross region replication, you can also have

23
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,440
different accounts for the source and destination buckets.

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,410
Buckets must also have versioning enabled.

25
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:02,260
You will not be able to set up any kind of replication without having versioning enabled first.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,780
We then have a lifecycle management.

27
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:13,150
This enables you to achieve two things ever transitioning an object through to a different storage class

28
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,110
or exploring the objects, in other words, deleting the objects.

29
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,550
So those are transition actions and exploration actions.

30
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,590
So what are the options?

31
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,730
Well, this kind of waterfall visual here on the right hand side shows you what the possible transitions

32
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,570
actually are.

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,900
So we've got standard at the top then standard i.e. intelligence sharing, one zone glacier in glacier

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,710
deep archive and you can see how you can transition objects.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,880
So what you can do is from the standard storage class to any other storage class, any storage class

36
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,670
to glacier and glacier deep archive.

37
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:01,300
Standard idea to intelligence sharing or one zone, i.e., intelligence sharing to one zone idea and

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,670
glacier to glacier deep archive.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,710
Now what can't you transition?

40
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:12,670
Well, you can't transition from any storage class to see free standard or from any storage class to

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,900
reduced redundancy.

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,970
Remember, as legacy, it's kind of still possible to use it, but it's not something that comes up

43
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,080
very much anymore.

44
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:29,320
The intelligence sharing storage class to S3 Standard I.a and one zone idea to S3 Standard IEEE or intelligent

45
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,740
sharing.

46
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,560
So useful just to remember these.

47
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:40,390
We do get scenarios in the exam where they give you some specific requirements for keeping data and

48
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,130
perhaps deleting it or archiving it, or retaining it for compliance reasons for a certain period of

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,550
time.

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,730
And then you've got to work out from the answers which storage classes and which sort of transition

51
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,960
actions you would use.

52
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,580
So that's it for the ferry.

53
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,120
In the next couple of lessons, we're going to see how you can put all of this into action.
