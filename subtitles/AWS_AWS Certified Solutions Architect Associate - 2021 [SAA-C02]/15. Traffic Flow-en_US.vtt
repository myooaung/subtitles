00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.250
This is just a quick lab to show you the traffic flow feature of our 50 free.

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.810
This is relatively new and has only been around for several months I believe and it's quite a powerful

3
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:23.600
feature and what it does is it enables you to create a policy which links together in this kind of logical

4
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.420
flow different rules so you can see in this diagram here you've got a different ness requests start

5
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.360
point you've got to fail overall with a primary and secondary and then the result of that fail overall

6
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.310
then puts you towards a weighted rule and then you've got a weighting and then say you can imagine that

7
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.870
you might have some fairly complex configurations and what you're able to do with this tool is to then

8
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:56.090
create a policy that incorporates that flow and then you can apply that policy to one or more domain

9
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.350
names and across different multiple hosted zones as well.

10
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.890
So it's quite a powerful tool.

11
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.920
Let's just have a quick look into the editor.

12
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.160
So we'll just call this test so we can click next and then you get this editor this visual editor so

13
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.390
you can then go in and choose your record type and then you can choose the first type of rule you want

14
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.900
to use and it'll come up with for instance primary and secondary and then you might have just as in

15
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.550
the diagram that we saw before you might then have a weighted rule and then that might lead on to a

16
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.840
geo location or a latency rule.

17
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.240
So it's very little bit beyond the scope of the exam to actually build this out at this stage but at

18
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.590
least you need to understand what it is and what the use cases are.

19
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.290
So just think about whenever you get a use case such as a customer is has multiple different types of

20
00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.930
roles such as fail over a weighted and latency and they needs a way to simplify a complex configuration

21
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.860
or create some kind of logical grouping that they can then use and apply across multiple hosted zones

22
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.350
or multiple DNS name spaces.

23
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.810
So that's just a quick overview you can go in and learn more by viewing the documentation.

24
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.550
So there's some great info that will give you a bit more of a detailed understanding of what this is

25
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.130
but that's it for now.
