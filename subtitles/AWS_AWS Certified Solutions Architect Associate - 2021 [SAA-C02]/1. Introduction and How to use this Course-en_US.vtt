Hello and welcome to the AWB Certified Solutions, Architects and Social Circles.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.960
My name's Neil Davis and I'm your instructor.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.690
Firstly, I want to thank you for enrolling in this course.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.830
I really appreciate it.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.290
And I understand you've put lots of trust in me to deliver to you the training that you need to pass

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.920
your exam.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.340
Now, I can assure you, are in the right place.

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.070
We've put a lot of effort into these courses to make sure that we give you all the information you need

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.790
for the exam.

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.490
So this course is a very hands on course, which makes it different from most other courses out there.

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.450
The way I teach is to show you few diagrams and explain to you the concepts.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.770
And then I actually take you in and we build out some architectures.

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.670
Now, the course uses a process of incremental learning.

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.240
That means you start at the very basics.

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.890
You learn some skills.

16
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.740
You build upon those skills and you keep reusing them and then building on more skills in subsequent

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.430
sections.

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.210
I therefore recommend that you do follow the course through in sequential order, and that will mean

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.860
you'll build your skill set up.

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.530
And by the end you'll have a really strong practical skill set.

21
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.550
Now you'll also develop lots of theoretical knowledge, both from the video lectures throughout the

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
main sections of the course and also the exam crams at the end of each section.

23
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.730
I also provide training notes so you get a free downloadable e-book.

24
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.330
And I also have lots of cheat sheets on my Web site.

25
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.850
Now, those are exams specific.

26
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.280
So what I've done is I've made sure that the right information is in there for this specific exam.

27
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.850
So we've all those resources available to you now have everything you need to build up your skills and

28
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.320
prepare for the exam.

29
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.930
Now, if you are a complete beginner, that's okay.

30
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.760
We start right at the basics.

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.160
So in the next section, there's going to be a basic overview of the identity and Access Management

32
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.420
Service and a few of the related concepts just so that you understand a few fundamental concepts before

33
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.250
we start going into a better Hands-On.

34
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.950
And then we actually create a free to air account so you can set up your own free to account.

35
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.830
And that means that you can actually follow along with the exercises that I provide.

36
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.710
Now, make sure you go to the course download at the end of Section one first, because especially from

37
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.330
section of free onwards, you're going to find that you need some of the downloadable materials.

38
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.010
So I definitely recommend you do set up the free to air account and follow along if you can.

39
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.440
If you don't have the ability to sign up for a free to air account or you're a bit more time pressed,

40
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.020
you can just follow through and watch me and I'll help you to learn the concepts and you'll still be

41
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.440
able to build up that knowledge and prepare for your exam.

42
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.730
Now, this is a lengthy course, but I do recommend you do it in its entirety.

43
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.690
The Solutions Architects Associate exam is quite broad in scope.

44
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.680
So you really need to have a solid knowledge of lots of different topics.

45
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.930
And I make sure you get that through this course.

46
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.940
So thanks again for being with me.

47
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.660
And I hope you enjoy the course.
