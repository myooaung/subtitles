00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.000
In this lesson, I'm going to point you towards some resources for installing tools that we're going

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.890
to use throughout this course.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.210
The first one is the U.S. command line interface, the Seelye.

4
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.920
You will need to install that on your computer and I'll show you how to do that in a moment.

5
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.460
Next is a visual studio code from Microsoft.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.720
These are all free tools.

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.870
By the way, Visual Studio code is useful for editing the code snippets that are supplied in this course.

8
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.360
Now, you don't need to write any code in this course.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.150
It's all supplied for you in the course download, and you can find a link to download the course materials.

10
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.340
In the last lesson of this section.

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.330
Lastly, Cloud Shell is an interactive command line environment running on a WC, so it's like running

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.090
the command line interface, but not on your computer.

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.380
It's actually hosted in a WC.

14
00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.100
It may be a useful tool for you, especially if you have any issues with firewalls stopping the command

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.350
line interface running on your machine.

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.620
So let's head over and see how we can set up these tools.

17
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.370
The first tool is the IWC command line interface.

18
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.640
Currently, this is at version two, and the link for this page is attached to this lesson.

19
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.550
So you need to choose your operating system.

20
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.980
So, for example, you might choose windows and then just download the installer package.

21
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.800
In this case, it's an MSE file and install that on your machine, and all the instructions are here

22
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.760
on how to do that.

23
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.120
If you're running on Mac OS, then there's also a package file here, which you can download to install

24
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.410
it on your operating system.

25
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.360
So follow the instructions for your operating system and install the SEELYE.

26
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.360
We're not going to use it yet.

27
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.810
We're actually going to configure the authentication and authorization for it a bit later on.

28
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.090
Next is Visual Studio Code.

29
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.460
Again, this is a free tool, and you can download it for Windows, Linux and Mac.

30
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.470
So again, just follow the instructions, download the installer and get it working on your machine.

31
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.040
Lastly, I want to show you a top U.S. cloud shell.

32
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.550
It's a really useful tool that enables you to run a command line environment on a WC, so using the

33
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.880
search box at the top of the screen here, I'm going to type cloud shell.

34
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.730
That's another useful way of finding services.

35
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.920
Now, the first option here is the one I want, so I'm going to click on Cloud Shell and it tells you

36
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.230
a little bit here about what's installed.

37
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.000
So it has the Seelye installed.

38
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.980
It has Python A.j.'s.

39
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.490
You get one gigabyte of storage free per region and you can actually save files in your home directory,

40
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.650
which were available for subsequent sessions.

41
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.620
So a very useful tool, especially if you have any issues stopping the command line environment from

42
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.700
working on your machine.

43
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.280
So I'm going to close that message box and it's going to create the environment for me, and that can

44
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.300
take a couple of minutes.

45
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.050
In this case, it was really fast and we're now ready to go.

46
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.030
So that's all there is to it.

47
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.680
You can now use a U.S. cloud shell to run Seelye commands in the cloud.

48
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.600
If you don't want to run them on your machine or if you can't, for some reason now you'll notice the

49
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.060
actions menu in the top right hand corner.

50
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.810
Here you can download files, upload files, restart cloud shell and delete the Cloud Shell Home Directory

51
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.800
if you want to start again.

52
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.330
So that's it.

53
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.110
For this lesson, you'll now set up for the hands-on lessons in this course.
