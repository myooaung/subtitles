Hi, guys.

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.700
In this lesson, I'm gonna cover off.

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.400
I am policy evaluation logic.

4
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.920
Now, it can be a little bit of a confusing subject.

5
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.200
So let's cover a bit of background first.

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.230
So before we get started on the evaluation logic, I want you to remember that we have identity based

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.510
policies and resource based policies.

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.980
So an identity policy, for instance, is a policy that you apply to an I am role or an I am user or

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.000
an I am group.

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.700
So these are identities, groups, roles and users.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.090
We then have resource based policies.

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.120
So a resource is something like an Ashry bucket and you're applying a policy to the Ezri bucket to define

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.460
who's allowed to access that bucket.

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.620
We then also have inline policies.

15
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.830
Remember, they're standalone policies and inline policies.

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.570
Inline policies are attached directly to the identity.

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.130
So in other words, you can't attach the inline policy to an item roll because it's actually just exists

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.200
within the context of this user account.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.750
Conversely, with a stand alone policy that you apply to an IBM group, you could also apply to a user

20
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.320
and a role.

21
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.710
Next stop, you need to understand the basic premise of evaluation logic.

22
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.940
So there's a few key concepts that we need to understand.

23
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.800
So identity based policies, we've just covered those and resource based policies.

24
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.290
There's then I am permissions boundaries.

25
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.450
And these are an advance feature that sets the maximum permissions that an identity based policy can

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.340
grant to an AI entity.

27
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.390
Now, I don't really see these covered much in the exam, but you need to know what these are for the

28
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.440
evaluation logic.

29
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.090
There's then a W.S. organizations service control policies and these can specify the maximum permissions

30
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.130
for an organizational unit.

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.460
Now, an organizational unit is a organizational construct within a W.S. organizations.

32
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.350
Again, not covered much in the exam, but you need to understand that for the logic that's coming up.

33
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.180
That's then session policies.

34
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.670
These were advance policies that you pass as parameters when you programmatically create a temporary

35
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.640
session for a role or federated user.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.380
So what does the logic look like?

37
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.160
First off, bottleful all requests are implicitly denied.

38
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.060
So implicit means there isn't a statement that says it's denied.

39
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
It just means that all requests are denied by default.

40
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.750
The root account is different and has full access.

41
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.990
Now, an explicit allow in an identity based or resource based policy overrides the implicit deny.

42
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.660
If you then have the permissions boundary organizations SICP or session policy present that might override

43
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.880
and allow with an implicit denial.

44
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.480
We then have an explicit deny and that overrides any allows.

45
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.010
So let's look at the evaluation logic then.

46
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.690
So this is what it looks like and is quite a lot going on there.

47
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.920
So let's break this down.

48
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.190
So first off, you have your implicit deny.

49
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.500
So decisions start with a deny.

50
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.630
Then you evaluate your applicable policies and you see is there an explicit deny?

51
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.570
And that will always be final decision denied.

52
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.570
If not, then it goes and checks.

53
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.030
Is the principal's account a member of an organization?

54
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.730
So that's a W.S. organizations with an applicable service control policy.

55
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.340
If so, check whether there's an allow.

56
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.900
If not, then deny.

57
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.610
If there isn't, allow, carry on.

58
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.960
And of course, if that isn't an applicable SICP, then it also carries on and then checks for resource

59
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.040
based policies.

60
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.860
Again, goes through the same process checks whether there's an allow otherwise carries on for looking

61
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.210
for the permissions boundary.

62
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.120
It then checks is the principal.

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.640
A session assumed using a policy and then go through that same logic.

64
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.970
And then finally checks for identity based policies.

65
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.620
So that's quite a lot to remember.

66
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.350
But I would say for the exam, the key thing to understand.

67
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.780
Remember, it's the evaluation.

68
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.640
Logic starts with an implicit deny.

69
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.800
And then the key ones that you need to know for the exam are resource based policies and identity based

70
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.430
policies.

71
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.550
So we're looking to see whether the resource base policy or identity based policy applies.

72
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.220
And if it does, checking for and allow.

73
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.440
If there's an allow, then it allows.

74
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.900
If there's not, then in this case for a resource based policy, it carries on for an identity based

75
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.470
policy.

76
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.880
If there isn't an allow.

77
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.740
It's basically the final decision.

78
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.780
That's the end of the processing.

79
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.430
So I hope that makes sense, guys.

80
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.630
I'll also link an article from eight of us in the course downloads.

81
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.400
So that might be worth read as well to make sure that you understand this properly.
