00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,850
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,650
In this lesson we're going to discuss virtual private cloud VPC.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,640
And I'm going to take you for a bit of theory.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,220
And then we're going to go into the console and see what it all looks like a virtual private cloud or

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:22,370
VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch your own resources within

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,400
a VPC.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,780
You can create your own networks using your own IP ranges.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,110
Now a VPC sits within a region so you can see here we have a region so this could be one of the 20 free

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,740
locations around the world.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,530
There are 20 free today and you can create a VPC within that region and then you create subnets within

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,170
that region which set within Availability Zones and those can be public or private.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,520
You then launch your resources into your subnets that are within your VPC with other resources that

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,800
don't sit in subnets You can also choose to put them in a VPC we'll see more about that throughout the

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,280
course.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,580
But what you need to understand at this stage is that you have a region within a region you have a VPC

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,890
and you can have up to five VPCs within each region by default like with many AWS services.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,540
There is a default quota limit but you can increase that if you need to by contacting AWS.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,940
You normally need to fill out a form and submit for a request for approval.

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,550
So we have our VPC within our region.

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,310
You can have multiple beeps within that region.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,450
So for each region around the world you'll need to have separate pieces.

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,140
There is a default VPC that's created by default and that's in every of those every one of those regions

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,510
around the world.

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:51,000
So you then have the availability zones which as we know from the previous lesson are one or more data

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,840
centers within a region and within there you create your subnets and deploy you instances.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,660
Now the way that you can communicate between Availability Zones and within between subnets whether they're

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:13,230
in the same availability zone or not is free the VPC router the VPC router has a route table which you

28
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,100
can configure and it actually has a IP address range.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,750
So every VPC has what's called a cyber block which stands for classless inter domain routing and you

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,190
can look that up on Google if you're not familiar of what it is you do need to understand it for your

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,130
exam.

32
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:37,200
And so you define the IP range for your VPC and then the round table will automatically be configured

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,980
to route between all your Availability Zones and subnets within your VPC.

34
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,680
You can also have an Internet gateway attached to your VPC and that allows you to access the outside

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,360
world.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,790
So for instance you can send requests out to an Internet Web site through the Internet gateway and for

37
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,300
that you need to specify the Internet gateway I.D. and an IP address as a destination in this case.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,330
This is essentially a wild card which means any destination send it to the Internet gateway.

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,870
You then have Internet gateways and these allow you to be able to communicate outside of AWS to the

40
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,840
Internet and to enable you to do that you have to create an Internet gateway and then you have to add

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,170
an entry to your round table which says for this destination ip address range in this case it means

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,230
any address send the connection to the Internet gateway and then it reference it out to the outside

43
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,790
world.

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,980
On this diagram I just wanted to show you an example of a region with multiple VPCs. As you can see

45
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:49,050
each has an IP address block and all the subnets within this VPC will be part of this block and each

46
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,810
VPC will have a different block.

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,830
So that's it for the theory.

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,620
Let's go into the console and start looking at what VPC is look like in the AWS management console.

49
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm here in the AWS management console and we can find VPC by going up to services and then choosing

50
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,350
networking and content delivery and his VPC.

51
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,830
This is the VPC dashboard and it gives us a bit of information about the pieces around the world.

52
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,890
So in this case you can have a look at the VPCs that we have.

53
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:26,070
And so my account actually has a VPC in all of these regions and that's not because I created one that's

54
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,790
just because as part of this free tier account or as part of any account you will have one VPC a default

55
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,360
VPC in each region around the world.

56
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,060
You can then see subnets.

57
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,380
And in this case in Sydney we have three.  There's three availability zones in Sydney and there's one subnet

58
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,330
mapped to each of those availability zones.

59
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,020
By default. You can see it varies but there's no less than two.

60
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,540
We then have route tables and every VPC we'll have a route table so there's gonna be one for each of

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,410
these VPCs and we'll have a look at what they look like in shortly for internet gateways.

62
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,100
Again each VPC has an internet gateway.

63
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,850
You can only attach one to a VPC and there's one for each region.

64
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,450
One of the things you need to understand in the AWS management console is when you go up to the right

65
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,180
hand corner here so you can see I'm up here in Sydney.

66
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,120
So that's the region that I'm connected to if you see the name of a region here.

67
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,870
It means that the service that you're working with is a regional service.

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,780
Sometimes you won't see that you'll see global here and there's no dropdown list so you can't select

69
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,520
a different region at the moment.

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,310
I can change regions for instance to us west north California and my console just connects there and

71
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,050
I can start configuring my VPC in Northern California.

72
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,040
But if it says global that means it's a global service and you don't have a regional scope where you

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,350
can configure things separately for different regions.

74
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,390
So right now I'm connected to Sydney.

75
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,620
Let's go to my VPCs and we can see here we have a default VPC.

76
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,020
It doesn't have a name.

77
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,260
It's just got an I.D. you can see the site a block here and there's a bit more information you can see

78
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,370
the round table.

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,800
The network ACL we can see that this is a default VPC as it says yes here.

80
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,910
And it has a default tenancy.

81
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,820
Now we'll go through a lot of these settings and more detail when we get to the VPC deep dive section

82
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,640
of the course.

83
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,270
For now what I'm trying to do is just familiarize you with VPC enough that we can carry on and start

84
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,370
actually building some resources in the next section where we're going to deploy some easy two instances

85
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,900
into the VPC.

86
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,730
So I'm trying to build on your knowledge throughout this course rather than just deep diving on one

87
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,620
thing and then moving on to the next.

88
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,510
That way you'll be able to repeatedly learn the same facts over and over again and actually use them

89
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,340
in practical contexts which will hopefully help you to really learn.

90
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,210
If we go down to subnets you can see those three subnets here and each of these will be matched to a

91
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,890
different availability zone.

92
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:03,240
So for instance the first one I've highlighted here is maps of availability zone AP-southeast-2c if

93
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,020
I select the next one on the list.

94
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:12,340
It's connected to AP-southeast-2b  and the next one will be on 2a. One of the key things to note

95
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,050
here is it says auto assign public IP v full and it's set to Yes.

96
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,920
Now if we want are easy two instances which is are elastic compute cloud instances so you might deploy

97
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,340
a Linux or Windows operating system onto a W.S. those operating systems will then pick up an IP V for

98
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,270
address.

99
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,510
If you have auto assign set to a yes you can also see for each of these subnets what the IP V for side

100
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,530
a block is.

101
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,180
So for this one it's 1 7 2 2 31 or 32 dot 0 slash 20.

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,420
And then if we go to this next one here it's 1 7 2 231 dot 0 0 slash 20.

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,400
So each subnet will have a different block of addresses but they're all within the overall side a block

104
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:04,080
of the BPC we now go to round tables and we can see we have one round table by default there's a route

105
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:11,920
that allows full routing between all subnets within the overall side of block for the VPC and then there's

106
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,100
one here which has a destination which basically means any IP address so any address that isn't within

107
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,330
this range.

108
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,340
Send it to the Internet gateway whereas anything that's within this range it gets routed locally.

109
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,090
So we then have the Internet gateway and this is what we just looked at.

110
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,320
It's specified in the route table so that we know how to route to the Internet gateway to get to the

111
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,340
outside world.

112
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,810
So that's it for this lesson guys.

113
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,660
This is really just a sort of getting started really just wanted to show you through VPC so that you understand

114
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,570
it and we're gonna be moving on in the next section to actually learning about the elastic compute cloud

115
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,290
easy to and deploying some easy two instances into a VPC before we do that.

116
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,110
There's an optional lab coming up where I'm actually going to register a DNS domain name using the AWS

117
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,050
Route 53 service.

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,040
It does cost a bit of money so you don't have to do it but if you want to it's useful for some of the

119
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,420
exercises in the rest of the course.

120
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,230
So if you want to go to that lab see you there.

121
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,770
Otherwise you can move to the next section and we'll get started on easy to.
