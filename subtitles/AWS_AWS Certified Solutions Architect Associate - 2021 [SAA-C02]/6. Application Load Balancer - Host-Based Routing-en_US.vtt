00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.600
My guys were carrying on from the previous lab and what we're going to demonstrate now is an application

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.420
load balancer with host based routing.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.990
So what we had in the previous lab was a default rule sending traffic to target group 1 and then we

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.510
had a conditional rule that said that if the path was slash orders send a target group to.

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.210
So that's a path based rule.

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.660
Now we're looking at a host based rule so this means that the hostname is different.

7
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.430
So what we're going to do is the default rule is it's going to send traffic when we use DCT labs dot

8
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.830
com but the shop dot DCT labs dot com is going to send traffic to target group 2 so if you have this

9
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.580
in the URL then it's going to send its target group to.

10
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.710
So we're going to use Route 50 free to configure our DNS records.

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.210
So let's go back over to the console and set up round 50 free Route 50 free is a DNS system and you

12
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.900
can register domains you can configure health checks and you can set up DNS records with various policies

13
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.420
which will cover in a lot more detail in Section 6 of the course.

14
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.880
For now what we're going to do is go to hosted zones and I have my DCT labs dot com domain.

15
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.200
Now this is what I registered in Section 2 of the course in the optional lab so you may or may not have

16
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.290
your own hosted zone.

17
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.970
If you do have one it's going to be useful to follow along.

18
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.190
So what I want to do is create a record set and I'm going to leave the name here empty.

19
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.010
I'm just going to have DCT labs dot com and that's known as the zone apex when you don't have any other

20
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.440
name before it.

21
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.690
I'm then going to choose a and then alias and if I just left click in here I'll be able to see my load

22
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.270
balancer so I can see that I have an application load balancer here and I'm going to choose that and

23
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.730
choose create.

24
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:10.320
So that's going to give me the DNS record to connect to my load balancer using DCT labs dot com.

25
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.460
I now want to create another record set and this one is going to be shot dot DCT labs dot com.

26
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.060
Again it's going to be an alias.

27
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.310
And again it's going to points of the Al B.

28
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.280
So I now have my two records and what I now need to do is go back to easy to and I need to update my

29
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:41.100
load balance with a rule so let's choose low balances listeners you edit rules I'm going to click the

30
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.170
plus insert rule and condition and I'm going to choose host header and this time I'm going to put shop

31
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.050
dot DCT labs dot com

32
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.530
and for the action I'm gonna forward to target group two.

33
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.170
So again what we've got is our two roles going to save those if the hostname name is shopped out DCT

34
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.010
labs dot com forward to target group to otherwise go to target group 1.

35
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300
So let's try this out.

36
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.000
I'm just gonna put DCT lamps dot com and I get xylem and clammy.

37
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.970
So those are the two instances which are in target group 1.

38
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:35.690
So now let's try putting in shop dot DCT lamps dot com and now we get Diane and Eleanor.

39
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.410
So that's working just as expected.

40
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.210
We have our two rules the default rule and we're using DCT lapse dot communists forwarding everything

41
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.450
to the two instances in target group 1 but then if we change the hostname to shop not DCT lapsed dot

42
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.950
com we go to target group 2 and get light balance between these two instances.

43
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.680
So that's great.

44
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.470
That's exactly how it should work.

45
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.130
I hope that work for you guys hope happening a lot of fun.

46
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.370
Now let's just go back and we can remove our configuration now.

47
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.010
So first thing to do.

48
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.360
Go into a load balancer.

49
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.460
Let's just delete our load balancer and then going to get rid of my target groups.

50
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.680
These don't cost anything but I don't need to use them or just recreate them when I need them.

51
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.870
And then we can go to instances and we can get rid of all four instances

52
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.940
and then the last thing to do.

53
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.410
Again you don't pay for it but I like to just clean things up.

54
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.580
Let's go back to Ralph 53 free and let's delete both of these records these two records that we created

55
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.690
and that's it for this lab guys in the next lab.

56
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:50.200
I'm going to introduce easy to auto scaling and so we're then gonna be using auto scanning in combination

57
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.240
with elastic low balances.

58
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.790
So we're gonna set up some fault tolerant resilient and scalable architectures.

59
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.110
So that should be a lot of fun.

60
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.250
See in the next lap guys.
