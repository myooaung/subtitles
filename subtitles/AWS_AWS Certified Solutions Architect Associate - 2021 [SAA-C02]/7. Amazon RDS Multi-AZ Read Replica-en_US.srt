00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:09,060
In this lesson, I want to cover off multi aisi read replicas, so you've already learned a couple of

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,180
key concepts you understand about multiuse.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,570
So here is a classic example of multiuse.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,620
We have our OD's master.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,220
So this is our writable instance that's active.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:29,070
We then have a standby and another availability zone and we have synchronous replication happening to

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,940
that STAMBAUGH.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,160
Now, our application will be pointed to this end point address.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:44,640
And if for some reason the availability zone or the database instance fails, this instance then becomes

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,160
active.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,260
So that's just classic multi-asset ideas.

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,660
And when this happens, the endpoint address will contribute to the stand by.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,760
So remembers one end point address, which gets cut over from your master to the standby, which then

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,310
becomes the master and the original master will become the standby once it's available again.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,970
Now, you also know that you can create a red replica from a master, maybe not this one, because it's

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,360
failed.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,030
But you know what I'm talking about.

18
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,460
So you create a red replica from your ideas, master.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,370
Now, in this case, you can see I've called this a red replica master.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,580
And the reason is what you can also do is enable multi-asset for your red replica.

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,240
So in this case, we've created a rich replica stand by and another availability zone.

22
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,070
And we have an end point address in this case, it's digital cloud, there are all sorts of different

23
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,210
endpoint address to writable end point.

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,580
This is only read only endpoint.

25
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,420
And we can then direct our application to do raids here and rights to this End Point address.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,680
But we might have a problem if this instance fails, because then our applications are unable to perform

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,250
reads.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,390
Now, you might have logic that fails it either, but you can also do it through A.D.s.

29
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:26,140
So in this case, what happens is your master files over to the stand by and your end point address

30
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,540
now cuts over to the Reed replica.

31
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,110
Stand by.

32
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,200
So hopefully that makes sense.

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,370
Let's just go over to the console and I'll show you how you do this.

34
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,340
So I'm in the console, I've already created a MySQL database called Digital Cloud.

35
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,610
I'm going to select my database.

36
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm going to click actions, read replica.

37
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,930
And straight away, you can see I have an option for multiuse deployment, so I'm just going to select

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,230
that.

39
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,900
I'm going to come down, I'm going to call this.

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,780
Don't that's the source, so I'm going to call this one digital cloud dash.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,630
Ah, and that's all I need to do.

42
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,140
So now I've created that configuration and it's going to take a few minutes.

43
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,000
So it will take a little while.

44
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:24,320
But eventually what I'll find is I have this replica, which will be it could be in the same availability

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,310
zone as the master here, and it will have another replica, which you can't see in the console here

46
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,230
because it's a standby instance.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,490
But that will be in a different availability zone to this instance here.

48
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,870
So I'm not going to hang around and show you that one, I just wanted to make sure you understand the

49
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,630
concepts.

50
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:51,480
So just remember, you can have a multi-asset master and stand by for your rideable database instance,

51
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,530
but you can also have multisite if you read replicas as well.

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,250
And in that case, the end point address for the read replica gets filed between different reach replicas.

53
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:11,970
Now, you can also pair this as a D.R strategy, so you could also promote a read replica to be a writable

54
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,680
instance.

55
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,570
And if it has a standby, that will also become a standby for that writable instance.

56
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,430
You might have a couple of exam questions coming up around these topics.

57
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,860
So hopefully now you have everything you need.
