00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.980
And this lesson, I'm going to cover how you can monitor your of instances, as well as find out the

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.940
status of the underlying hardware or which your instances of running.

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.370
So it will be a hands on.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.830
I'm going to head over to the console in the AC to management console.

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.340
I've already launched an easy instance if you want to follow along.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040
You can launch your own instance.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.100
You know how to do that.

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.600
Any instance Typekit do.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.910
But I recommend sticking within the free tier.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.020
So using a T2 micro instance will be fine and default settings are OK.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.490
Or we're going to do is look at these status checks and the monitoring information.

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
So with my instance highlighted, I've selected the checkbox on the left there.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
If I go across to status checks, you'll see there's two different types of status check here.

14
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
On the left hand side, we have the system status check now.

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.470
The System Status Check is checking that the underlying hardware, which you'll see two instances running,

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.330
is working operationally.

17
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.520
If there's a problem with a system status check, it means that eight of us are going to need to be

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.640
involved to actually fix that problem.

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.500
In this case, we can see a green tick mark, and it says the system reachability check has passed on

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.370
the right hand side.

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.380
We then have the instant status checks.

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.220
Now here IWC is checking the software networking configuration of your ISA to instance itself.

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.310
So making sure that your operating system is configured correctly so that your instance is operational

24
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.350
and it's communicating on the network.

25
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.530
If there's a problem here, it would need your involvement as an IWC customer to fix the issue.

26
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.620
And again, here we have a green checkmark, so everything's good.

27
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.130
Now, if I then head over to monitoring once the pages refreshed, you should see some information here

28
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.160
about the performance of your easy to instance.

29
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.830
Now, if you've just launched your instance, they may not be any data here as yet, but it will come

30
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.090
after a few minutes.

31
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.460
So as you can see, we've got information on the CPU utilization, the status checks.

32
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.790
We've also got networking performance information and we've got disk performance information.

33
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.850
Now this information is data that's getting sent to the Cloud Watch monitoring service.

34
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.880
We saw Cloud Watch earlier in the course when we actually went and created a billing alarm cloud, which

35
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.620
is a performance monitoring tool.

36
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.570
The services within IWC send metrics to Cloud Watch Cloud Watch will collect this metric data from your

37
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.130
EC2 instances, and then you can then go and look at that performance information.

38
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.600
And as you can see, it is presented here in the IWC management console.

39
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.450
Another place you can go is the cloud watch itself.

40
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.670
So this is the cloud watch console.

41
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.010
You can find it under services management and governance and cloud watch within cloud watch.

42
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.710
What we'll do is go down to all metrics and you can see we have some metrics here now.

43
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.350
The metrics that you see here correspond to whichever services you've been running and that are actually

44
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.150
sending data to Cloud Watch.

45
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.150
So you won't see all services here because we haven't used that many services yet, but we can see easy

46
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.510
actually.

47
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.180
And also EBS, the Elastic Block Store, which are the volumes which are attached to your instance.

48
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.220
So let's go into EC2 per instance metrics and you can see here we have an instance right now that should

49
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.400
correspond to the instance IP of our instance.

50
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.930
And as you can see, it does this one finishes in eighty five.

51
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.690
Now, once you have many instances running, you'll then have all of that information populates it here

52
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.360
and you can search by instance like.

53
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.020
These are the same metrics that we saw over in the easy to management console.

54
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.710
Now, if we come back up again to the top accounts EBS and per volumetrics, we can then see the metrics

55
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.460
corresponding to the volume that's attached to our easy to instance.

56
00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.040
So now we're looking at performance data related to our EBS volume, and if we come back over to EC2,

57
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.190
got a storage and you'll see that volume here, my volume, my D finishes in D7 and that corresponds

58
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.740
to the metrics that I'm seeing in the console here.

59
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.070
So again, if you want to find something in the console, let's say you want to search for the metrics

60
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.350
for this particular volume IDE.

61
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.720
And maybe you have lots of EBS volumes running, then you would just go and filter and you would see

62
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.570
only the metrics associated with that particular volume.

63
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.000
So I'm going to clear my filter that come back over to E2.

64
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.450
I want to go back to the monitoring tab and you see you have this option here to manage detailed monitoring

65
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.960
now with monitoring your AC, to instance, will send metric data to Cloud Watch every five minutes.

66
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.430
And you don't pay for that.

67
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.130
If you want to enable detailed monitoring, you're going to need to pay, but then your instance will

68
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.750
send data every one minute.

69
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.860
So if you need that extra granularity, you can enable detailed monitoring.

70
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.690
I'm just going to cancel out of there.

71
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.540
And that's really all I wanted to show you in this lesson.

72
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.850
So I'm simply going to terminate my instance.
