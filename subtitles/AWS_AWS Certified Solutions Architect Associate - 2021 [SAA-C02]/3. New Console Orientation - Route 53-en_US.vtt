00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.130
Welcome back, I have another orientation video now just to show you a couple of the differences with

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.420
the Route 53 dashboard, because eight of us are rolling out a new version of the console at this stage,

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.930
you can actually switch between the old console and the new one.

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.980
But let's have a look through at some of the key differences.

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.530
Now, the key difference is that I want to show you when we go into hosted zones, so let's go into

6
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.390
hosted zones.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
I have one particular hosted zone in this particular account, and it has two records in it.

8
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.510
Now, let's just have a quick look at the hosted zones in the old console.

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.300
So this is what it looked like.

10
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.460
Now, if you want to create a record set, it pulls up this menu on the right hand side here.

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.030
And this is what we're going to be using throughout this section.

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.610
So I just wanted to show you the difference.

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.250
So this is the way we create the record set in the old console.

14
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.930
And as I mentioned, you can switch to the old console, if you like, or just use the new console.

15
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.040
I'll be using the old console for the videos and the rest of the section.

16
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.780
But the differences on that, great.

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.930
So once you've seen this video, you should be able to work out the differences.

18
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.280
So, hey, you would then choose the type of record.

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.360
So for example, and a record, then you choose whether it's an alias or not.

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.560
If it's an alias, you then find the cloud front distribution, the elastic beanstalk name or whatever

21
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.930
it is that you're providing an alias to.

22
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.610
Let's click on no.

23
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.420
Then obviously you put in the value here in the title.

24
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.730
So the value might be an IP address in this case.

25
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.840
And at the bottom here you've got the routing policy.

26
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.300
So for a simple routing policy, there's nothing really else to configure.

27
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.220
But then if we go into weighted, it's going to ask for some more information.

28
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.520
So that's the old console.

29
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.830
Let's look at how this is done in the new console.

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.670
So in the new console, we create a record and it now has this graphical interface.

31
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.710
You can choose the routing policy you want to use.

32
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.480
So let's use simple routing policy.

33
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.760
Then you need to define the simple record.

34
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.190
Let's try creating one for test and then we need to choose what we're routing to.

35
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.420
In this case, I'm going to route this one to an IP address.

36
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.060
It could be an alias to another record, an alias to an API gateway, cloud fund distribution, beanstalk

37
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.020
environment and so on.

38
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.590
And obviously we got the low balances in here, global accelerator as free and VPC endpoint.

39
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.710
So lots of different options.

40
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.450
Let's choose IP address for this example and just put in any old IP address.

41
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.890
Then you can choose the TTL if you like.

42
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.010
And you could change the record type if you want to as well for this case.

43
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.390
I'm just going to keep it as an a record and a fine, simple record, and then you just choose correct

44
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.890
records.

45
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.180
So that's it.

46
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.900
Very simple.

47
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.620
Let's create another record and this time let's have a look at weighted click on next.

48
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.860
And maybe this one is called weighted.

49
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.120
Scroll down.

50
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.620
It's going to be in a record again.

51
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.410
And then we would define weighted record and again we would choose what we're routing to.

52
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.780
So let's just put this as a particular IP address.

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.730
We need to choose the weights.

54
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.630
We need to choose whether there's a health check there isn't in this case.

55
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.270
And then we might put something in here.

56
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.320
So let's put the record.

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.680
I'd just as test and click on define weighted record and then you'd go in and add additional weighted

58
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.220
records.

59
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.890
So like, there's really nothing more to it than that.

60
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.200
It's just a slightly different interface.

61
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.340
Once you get used to it, you'll find that the settings themselves are the same.

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.070
It's just about the presentation of those settings.

63
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.360
So I hope that helps.

64
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.950
And as I mentioned at the time of recording, you can still switch to the old console if you like.

65
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.200
I do like the interface of the new console, though, and at some point HWC will remove that ability

66
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.820
to use the old console.
