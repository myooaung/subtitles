00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.970
This is just a quick lab to discuss performance.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.670
So we've already seen that with volumes.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.160
we can choose different volume types and you can choose provisioned IOPS for instance and we know

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
that you can go up to 64000 IOPS at the very top.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
Now some of this is dependent on the instance you use.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820
So there's a thing called EBS optimized instances.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.390
So this is an article that covers EBS optimized instances and what these are is just an instance that's

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.260
being configured in a way that it has dedicated capacity for the EBS.

9
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.290
In other words as you know the traffic that goes to EBS volumes goes from an instance and then it goes

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.580
over the network to where the actual EBS volumes are.

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.580
So what it does is it dedicates some capacity in the network adapter so you should do that or at the

12
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.430
very least you should ensure that you use an instance that has 10 gigabits per second network interfaces

13
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.440
so you can pop down in this article and it shows you the types of instances that support EBS optimized.

14
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.800
So if we go back to the console we can launch

15
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.940
and then on this screen if you come down to see some of these say for instance we saw I think a few

16
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.220
of those with the C4 extra large for instance.

17
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.070
So here we go you got the C4 extra large and you can see it's got a high network performance.

18
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.670
And that means you can then use provisioned IOPS volumes with this type of instance and have a large amount

19
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.770
of IOPS dedicated. Another option if you don't use those is to use

20
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.250
RAID

21
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.510
So RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks and you can look it up.

22
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.000
Now this is also an array of inexpensive discs.

23
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.580
There's two different ways that you can call it.

24
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.310
So RAID is a way that you can use multiple discs to aggregate performance and there's different ways

25
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.360
that you can do that.

26
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.530
This happens in AWS at the operating system level so in other words you configure this through

27
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.140
your operating system you would attach multiple volumes and then you'd configure one of these types

28
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.310
of RAID like RAID zero or RAID one for your operating system

29
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.400
so it is actually important to know this for the exam.

30
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.830
I would at least know the difference between RAID zero which is striping and RAID one which is mirroring

31
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.540
your discs, and you need to understand what the performance and redundancy benefits are of each of these

32
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.490
different types of RAID.

33
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.220
And that's all here.

34
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.130
So you can look that up here.

35
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.240
Another one is we have nested RAID.

36
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.300
So this is where you put two types of RAID together such as RAID 10.

37
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.790
So that's another one that's potentially going to come up on the exam.

38
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.320
Understand RAID 10, understand RAID zero, and RAID one.

39
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.350
And just remember that you need EBS optimized instances or at least instances with a decent amount of

40
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.500
network bandwidth at least 10 gigabits per second.

41
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.220
If you're going to be using provisioned IOPS with a large amount of dedicated IOPS.

42
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.560
Another thing worth mentioning is that if you're using encryption the encryption operations occur on

43
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.100
the servers that host the EC2 instances.

44
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.520
So that means that your data is secure both in transit and rest.

45
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.050
So when you're moving your data between the EBS which is network attached storage and the actual EC2

46
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.970
instance over a network that data is encrypted and it's also encrypted when it, when it's at rest

47
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.260
actually sitting on it.

48
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.860
Yes but the thing I want to point out here is that AWS state that you can expect the same IOPS performance

49
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.870
on encrypted volumes as you do on unencrypted volumes with a minimal effect on latency.

50
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.730
So you don't have to concern yourself with the performance of your encrypted volumes.

51
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.000
I expect that what they're using is some kind of dedicated cards to offload that from the actual network

52
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.540
adapters.
