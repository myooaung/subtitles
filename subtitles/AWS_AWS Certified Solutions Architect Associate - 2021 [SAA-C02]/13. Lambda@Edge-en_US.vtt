00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:12.610
This is a quick lesson on lambda at edge, lambda at Edge allows you to run Node.js and Python Lambda

2
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.970
functions to customize the content the cloud front delivers, such as executing these functions closer

3
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.140
to the viewer.

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.130
It can be run at several different points and you've got to remember these for the exam so you can run

5
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.360
your lambda functions.

6
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.850
After Cloudflare receives a request from a viewer, that's the viewer request before it forwards them

7
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.350
on to the origin.

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.770
The origin request of the cloud front receives the response from the origin known as the origin response

9
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.350
or before cloud forwards, the response to the viewer, and that's known as the viewer response.

10
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.940
So let's look graphically.

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.680
We've got our cloud front cash.

12
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.500
We've got an S3 origin and we've got our user.

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.880
The user submits a request that's known as the viewer request.

14
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.690
And this is where you can process using a lambda function.

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.240
You've then got the origin request.

16
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.970
And before that happens, you can also use lambda.

17
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.970
The response then comes back.

18
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.510
That's the origin response.

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.150
And again, before it gets forwarded on, you can process it with a lambda function and then you've

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.610
got the viewer response, which is before cloud front forwards, the response to the actual viewer.

21
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.620
So those are the different places.

22
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.880
The key exam tips here are the lambda right edge gives you that capability to run lambda functions closer

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.170
to your viewers.

24
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.570
They can be Node.js or Python.

25
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.600
And then just remember the different points at which you can process data using Lambda.
