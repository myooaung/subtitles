00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.130
Hi guys we're now going to cover the difference between public IP addresses and elastic IP addresses.

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.400
I've got a bit of theory to cover and then we're gonna go into the console and see how this works.

3
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.610
So the terminology can be a little bit confusing because both of public IP address and elastic IP address

4
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.710
are public ip addresses so they're always an IP addresses that are publicly routable on the Internet.

5
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.830
The key difference is that the elastic IP address is static whereas the public IP address is dynamic.

6
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.240
So if you put your EC2 instance into a public subnet that's configured to provide that instance

7
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.180
with a public IP address at boot time it's gonna be a dynamic public IP address and that means that

8
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.260
when you stop the instance you will lose the address if you restart the instance you don't lose it you

9
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.430
retain the public IP address but every time you stop the instance you're gonna lose it and you're going

10
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.720
to pick up a new one.

11
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.080
So you don't always want that.

12
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.310
That might not be ideal in many situations where an elastic IP address it's static.

13
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.850
So you can stop your instance and started again you can reboot it.

14
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.720
You can do whatever you want and you'll always have the same public IP address.

15
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.550
The other key difference is you can move an elastic IP address between instances and an elastic network

16
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.750
adapters elastic network adapters or just additional interfaces that you can attach to your instance.

17
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.210
And we'll see those in the console shortly with a public IP address.

18
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.350
There is no charge and these are used in public subnets.

19
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.150
We have an elastic IP address.

20
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.100
You are charged if the IP address is not used.

21
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.350
So for instance you might have allocated an elastic IP address to your account but you haven't associated

22
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.320
it with an instance or an elastic network adapter.

23
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.060
Alternatively it might be attached to an instance but the instance isn't running.

24
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.820
So in those cases you actually have to pay a small charge which is really IWM trying to incentivize

25
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.310
you to use these addresses because IPv4 addresses are in shortage on the Internet.

26
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.280
So the other thing about public IP is an elastic IPs is that always associated with a private IP

27
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.060
address on the instance.

28
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.080
So let's go back to this diagram I showed you earlier.

29
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.070
You remember that from the Linux operating system or Windows whichever way you will only ever see the

30
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.820
private IP address because the public IP address is associated to it but it's external to the operating

31
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.520
system.

32
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.300
So every time you allocate a public IP address it must be associated to a private IP address.

33
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.440
Now when you boot an EC2 instance into a public subnet it will have a private IP on eth0 it and

34
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.400
it will automatically Associate a public IP which is associated then with eth0.

35
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.140
Alternatively you can add an additional elastic network adapter and that could be if one and you can

36
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.850
then choose to associate an elastic IP address to each one.

37
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.980
And we'll see how all this works shortly.

38
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.940
Now you remember that your Internet gateway is your path out to the Internet and it performs one to

39
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.510
one net.

40
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.780
So it actually takes your source address and changes it to the public IP address.

41
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.160
So your source address from your operating system when it sends a packet out onto the network is always

42
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.560
going to be the private IP because that's the only IP it knows about the Internet gateways job is to

43
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.770
then change that to a public address and send it out to the Internet.

44
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.070
And that way it can be addressed and readable on the Internet.

45
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.300
And then in the reverse when it receives packets that need to be sent to your operating system it needs

46
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.000
to change the destination address to this address because it can't be received on the public address

47
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.370
because your operating system is not aware of it.

48
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.420
So that's how that works.

49
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.100
And if you say on this slide here again you can have if one can have a public IP address or an elastic

50
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.020
IP address associated with it.

51
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.680
And in that case there is still a private IP to public IP association.

52
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.140
So it's the same thing.

53
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.610
So let's head over to the console now and see all this stuff in action.

54
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.010
So I'm in the EC2 dashboard and what I'm going to do is just run up an instance.

55
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.760
So I'm going to launch a Amazon the next two am I I'm going to use the T2 micro and I'm just gonna leave

56
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.370
all the default so I don't need to change anything.

57
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.720
It's going to go into my default VPC.

58
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.260
All I want to do is just change my security group I just use my web access security group.

59
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.140
I'm not even going to SSH into this but I just need to choose a security group anyway.

60
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.670
And then we just hit launch so straight away we can see that a public IP address has been associated

61
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.030
with this instance and that happens straight away.

62
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.340
And then here's the private IP address.

63
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.000
So the private IP address and the public IP address will be associated.

64
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.670
And as you know from the previous lab if I did SSH into this instance you wouldn't see this public IP

65
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.720
address.

66
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.970
Now let's go down to network interfaces.

67
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.760
You can see we only have one.

68
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.130
And if we click on that interface it gives us some information so we can see stuff like the interface

69
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.270
or the the VPC that it's in and you can see the private IP address and the private DNS name and then

70
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.140
the public IP address is all here.

71
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.930
So I'm just going to let this initialize and pause them recording for a second and then let's see what

72
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.750
happens when we restart or stop our instance.

73
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.640
So this instance is almost ready.

74
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.680
Now one of the things you can do to see the status in the instance is go to instance settings under the

75
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.600
actions menu and get instance screenshot.

76
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.440
And here I can see that the operating system is booted and it's ready to be logged into but I'm not

77
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.550
actually going to log into it.

78
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.910
I just wanted to have a look.

79
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.450
Now the status checks haven't completed yet but the operating system is running.

80
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.970
So we've got our public IP and it begins in 13 and ends in 91.

81
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.430
So let's keep an eye on that.

82
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.440
And then what I'm gonna do is just restart the instance I'm going to choose reboot and now that it's

83
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.490
booting I can go back to instance settings get instance screenshot and as you can see we get an error

84
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.990
getting this console screenshot message.

85
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.980
So that means that it's actually in the process of rebooting and we'll just wait a couple of minutes

86
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.540
until it's back up again.

87
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.910
Let's have a look again and see what the status of this operating system is.

88
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.810
So it's burning up.

89
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.090
It's on the way.

90
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.430
And let's just quote close there by the film that we can see is that even if we hit refresh we can see

91
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.560
that we still have the same IP address that ends in 91 so that's what happens when you reboot.

92
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.270
But what happens if you want to shut down.

93
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.950
So in that case I can go instance state stop and choose.

94
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.040
Yes.

95
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.820
And so the instance is stopping now and then a minute.

96
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.390
Once it's in the Stop state we should see that the public IP address disappears.

97
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.150
So there we go the instance state is stopped and we can see that the public IP is gone the private IP

98
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.400
address is still there.

99
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.010
So that's something to remember your private IP address is retained when you stop your instance.

100
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.030
Let's start it up again and see if it gets a new address.

101
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.430
So the instance is starting up and it's actually in the running state now and you can see it's got a

102
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.120
new public IP address.

103
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.180
Now the private IP address is the same.

104
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.780
And we now have an association with this new public IP address.

105
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.590
So that's what happens when you stop and start an instance.

106
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.160
So that's set for this lab guys.

107
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.200
What I'm going to do is stop it here and then I'm going to start a new lab and in that lab we're going

108
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.450
to go through Elastic IP addresses.
