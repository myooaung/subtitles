00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.810
In this lesson, I'm going to cover off SSL A.L.S. and something called server name indication.

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.740
So with cloud front, we can have an SSL TLS certificate.

3
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.540
We can issue that for us certificate manager if we want to.

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.770
If you want to use ACM, the cloud fund certificate must be issued in the US East one.

5
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.840
This is true because cloud phone is a global service for global services.

6
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.780
If you want to issue a certificate using ACM, you always have to use US East one.

7
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.870
The certificate can be Ikm, or it can come from a third party certificate authority as well.

8
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.520
The default cloud for domain name can also be changed using C names.

9
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.040
We saw this in the hands on where you have the option to add in your own custom domain name.

10
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.810
So what about origins?

11
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.490
In this case, we an S3 origin and then a custom origin with a load balancer?

12
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.040
Well, you can SSL secure these as well.

13
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:12.850
In the case of S3, it already has its own SSL TLS certificate, so you can already connect to S3 using

14
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.730
HTTPS, and that's not something you can change yourself.

15
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.010
We have a custom origin.

16
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.030
You can put your own certificates on or use ICMJE.

17
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.110
So in the case of Albi, you're using ICMJE.

18
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.720
In the case of easy to, you can use a third party certificate authority to generate your certificate.

19
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.510
The origin certificates must be public certificates, that's important to note.

20
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.480
So what happens now is use comes along and issues a request to cloud front.

21
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.230
And this is going to be secured with SSL TLS.

22
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.860
This is known as the view a protocol because this is the protocol between the viewer and cloud front

23
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.250
and the view of protocol policy can control the behavior.

24
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.100
Again, we saw this in the hands on.

25
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.930
You can choose to allow TCP and HD TPS redirects to actually HTTPS or just force HTTPS and drop HTP

26
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.620
connections.

27
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.870
On the back end, you have the origin protocol, so that's where Cloud Front is then talking to the

28
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.290
origin.

29
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.050
Now what about the server name indication?

30
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.510
Well, what this is is it's a method where you're able to have multiple SSL TLS certificates, which

31
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.240
correspond with different domain names running on the same IP address on cloud fronts.

32
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.760
So, for example, we've got my other Domenico and my public domain, not dot com.

33
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.870
These are the domain names that are being used on these certificates.

34
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.410
So the requests that come in will match these domain names.

35
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.940
Normally, you wouldn't be able to run these or one IP address or one listener.

36
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.670
You'd need a separate certificate and a separate listener, which means another IP address and in cloud

37
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.740
front, you have to pay for those IP addresses.

38
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.630
In this case with SNI, you can share a single IP address.

39
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.070
So it's pretty clever.

40
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.670
So this means that a user can now connect to my public domain.

41
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.380
Dot com.

42
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.240
And the request URL includes the domain name, so it's in the header.

43
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.990
And that means that the certificate is going to match the specific domain name cloud front nose, which

44
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.070
certificate to match.

45
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.130
And the same will happen for my other domain boycott, and that one goes to the other certificate.

46
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.840
Note the S9 works with browsers and clients released after 2010.

47
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.300
Otherwise, you need a dedicated IP if you really need to support some super old browsers.
