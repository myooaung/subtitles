00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,650
Hi guys we just got a little bit more theory to cover before we get stuck into the practical on read replicas.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,940
MySQL replicas, global databases, multi-masters, can all get a bit confusing with Aurora.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,120
So what I want to do is just try and in the next couple of labs really try and make this stuff very

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,900
clear.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,520
As I mentioned multi-Master's something that's in preview so we're going to push that to the side.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,700
We're not going to cover that in the next couple of labs.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,800
But what I am going to do is make sure that you guys fully understand what an aurora replica is.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,480
What a mysql replica is the difference between those and the global database.

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,260
So first off between the role of replicas and mysql replicas you've got up to 15 Aurora replicas.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,950
Now remember these are in region and we'll see in a diagram what this all looks like in a second.

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,620
You've then got the mysql replicas these are only up to five.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,920
And these are all in different regions and yet across region.

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,700
So this is not within a region.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,510
So these are very different use cases.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,130
This is just for scaling your reeds up within your region.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,120
Very low latency fast synchronization whereas with mysql replica you got a bit of a longer lag in

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:23,420
terms of your replication time but you're gonna be using these for scaling reads across region and also

18
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,140
for using as a failover target in different regions.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,760
There's a performance impact with mysql replica because it's using that sequel then log replication

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:43,130
whereas with a raw replica the impact on the primary is very low with both you can failover.

21
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,280
So you can use these as failover targets with obviously with the Aurora replica that's within the same

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,180
region and with the mysql replica that's cross region and you can see a little bit difference between

23
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,480
the amount of data that you might lose you can automatically fai over two in aurora replica but you

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,820
can't have mysql replica.

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,230
So there's some manual interface intervention required there.

26
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,830
There's a couple of other features because of the sequel binlog replication a couple of things that

27
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,570
you can do.

28
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,060
mysql so let's get onto a diagram.

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,900
This diagram shows you what Aurora looks like within a region.

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,380
So as I mentioned before you always get two copies of your data and at least three availability zones

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,130
so that's six way replication are six copies of your data storage is actually provisioned in 10 gigabyte

32
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,240
chunks and then that's replicated across to all these different copies.

33
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,510
You have one primary so this is the one where the rights come from the primary rights to all copies

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,320
of the data in each of these availability zones

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,530
a single logical volume is actually presented to the DB instances so they're not aware they don't see

36
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,890
different copies of the data and that's how you're read replicas can then read the data so they read

37
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,870
that data and that's why it's such a low lag time because the primary is basic just writing to all three

38
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,180
of these pretty much at the same time.

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,470
Your read replicas or your Aurora replicas can then read that data and serve applications we've read traffic

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,880
just as with the other databases.

41
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,310
The primary has its own endpoint and then the replicas have different endpoints.

42
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,730
And then you can then promote a replica to be a primary.

43
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:43,980
Now in terms of the automatic promotion there's a thing called tiers and tiers represent the order in

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,060
which you would like replicas to be automatically promoted to primaries in the event of a failure.

45
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,200
So you can specify tiers for each of the replicas.

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:59,350
And that that controls the order of promotion as I mentioned before you can also use auto scaling to

47
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,650
add replicas and we'll look at that in the console.

48
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,610
So let's get on and actually start building some stuff in the console.

49
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,340
I'm locked into the IWC management console and I'm just going to head over to RDS

50
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:23,060
and what we're going to do is we're going to create a database and the first thing we're gonna do is

51
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:30,650
we're just going to try a standard Aurora database and before we go any further I've gotta warn you

52
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,330
guys this is not free tier.

53
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,040
So none of the labs that we're going to do on Aurora are gonna be free tier and I'm gonna be adding

54
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,660
quite a few copies of databases to show you the various features.

55
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,780
So this is definitely going to cost them money wouldn't be a lot if you shut it down fast enough.

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,130
But you know this could be could be some dollars.

57
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,410
So just bear in mind if you don't want to incur any costs you should just watch along and not actually

58
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,430
perform these labs.

59
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:05,560
So I'm going to choose the Aurora database engine and we're going to choose my school five point six

60
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,440
we're not going to go for the latest version because there are some limitations with mysql.

61
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,440
Five point seven.

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,660
Some of the features aren't available yet.

63
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,860
And note the Aurora global database feature.

64
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,910
So you actually have to click on this option here and go into a different wizard and we're going to

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,950
do that in a couple of laps time.

66
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:33,910
So I click next and this is where you can see that you have the option to even provision and manage

67
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,230
the servants and sizes or use service.

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,020
So if I provision then I've got my DB engine and then I've got my instance class so I might change this

69
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,520
to one of the other DV instance classes and that'll be that.

70
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:55,300
And then I could use multi easy and I can create read replicas if I then go to service.

71
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:04,070
Some of those options disappear and what I'll do instead is I'll be able to specify the minimum and

72
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,580
maximum resources for the DB cluster.

73
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,760
So let's just have a look at that.

74
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:16,790
I'm just going to call this database digital cloud paste that into a few places there and this is where

75
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:24,200
you then have the option to specify the amount of RAM so you can say the minimum there is one 1 unit.

76
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,590
So these are units and then this is the amount of RAM.

77
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:34,790
So one unit is 2 gig 2 units is 4 gig 4 units is 8 gig so I can say I want to start at 1 unit so 2 gigabytes

78
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:41,480
of RAM and go up to a maximum of 16 units or 32 gigabytes of RAM and it will automatically scale the

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
database for us.

80
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,600
Now I don't want to use that option now because it does have some limitations so I'm just gonna go back

81
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,800
to provisioned and I'm going to choose the smallest option available and I'm not going to create a replica

82
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,270
right now because we're going to create one for the console and I'm just going to paste in my deviance

83
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,140
and so identifier keep my master username and password the same click on Next

84
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,210
I'm going to put something in for the cluster identifier and database name and we're just going to leave

85
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,030
this in the default VPC and subnet group

86
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,360
and I don't need public accessibility.

87
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm gonna choose an existing security group because I know I've already got some ideas.

88
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,000
Launch was at one set so just grab one of those

89
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,790
and you can leave encryption on or turn it off.

90
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,460
And then here this is where you can specify the failover priorities that I mentioned before.

91
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,600
Which control the order of promotion then got back up and backtracks backtrack allows you to determine

92
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,360
how far back in time you want to go so you can specify the amount of time and then you're able to

93
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,400
move your database back to that point in time without needing to do a restore.

94
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,630
So that's a pretty cool feature.

95
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,980
We're going to disable enhanced model of showing hacks we don't need it and I'm going to disable this

96
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:20,320
option leave the maintenance window has no preference and I'm going to disable the deletion protection

97
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
and create database

98
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,530
so we're now in the console and we can see that we're in a state of creating and you can see that you

99
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,580
have a hierarchy here.

100
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,760
So first off this is showing as reader.

101
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,180
But once it's created it will change to writer.

102
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,900
So it's been several minutes and we now have the database available and we can see that the role is

103
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,610
changed to writer.

104
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,100
So let's go in and have a look at the database we can see that we have an endpoint ports 3306

105
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:04,030
because the engine is still mysql and we can see the availability zone that the primary instance

106
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,200
is running from.

107
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,770
And then we have monitoring where you can see some metrics from cloud watch on what's going on from

108
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,470
a performance perspective.

109
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,870
Now the key thing that I want to show you is let's go back up to this level.

110
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,820
So you go up to the database configuration level and you go to actions and here you got a few options.

111
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,930
So one is you can create a clone.

112
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,530
So this creates a full clone of your database.

113
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:37,120
And if you click on it you get a few options including you can specify the database engine or the database

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,630
instance class so you actually can't change the engine but you can change the instance class and you

115
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,940
can specify some different parameters and so on.

116
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,580
So that's a great way to clone your database and you can also then create a cross region read replica.

117
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,060
So this is going to be the subject of the next lab.

118
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,890
You can restore to a point in time so that's the BackTrack feature and you can add a replica free auto

119
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,590
scaling so we're going to go and add a reader.

120
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,540
But this is the same thing as just using auto scaling.

121
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:18,600
So if you come in here you can use two different metrics even CPU utilization or average connections

122
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,680
both on your existing replicas.

123
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,810
So it's even a percentage of the CPU or number of connections and then you could also specify some

124
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,980
scale parameters and cool down stuff.

125
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,640
And obviously you can go from one to 50 and you can't have more than 15 because that's the maximum number

126
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,840
of rural replicas

127
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,040
who come back and just go here.

128
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,300
Then what we want to do now is click Add reader and we can actually choose the availability zone if

129
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,690
we want.

130
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,150
Remember that the Aurora replicas are within region.

131
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,510
So you you can choose an availability zone but you can't choose a different region and you can choose

132
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,030
to change this ones publicly available if you want to.

133
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:06,980
You can't change the encryption attributes because the primary is already encrypted but you could also

134
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,770
change the DB instance class if you wanted to.

135
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,870
So let's just go in and let's put in

136
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,530
read only D.B. as the instance identifier.

137
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:25,610
Let's give it a priority of Tier 1 and we'll leave the other attributes as they are and just click Add

138
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,550
reader so we can see now that we can we have the hierarchy here where we can see the writer and the

139
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,040
reader it's in a state of creating at the moment it's gonna take a few minutes to provision this instance

140
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,470
we can see it's in the creating state and we can say it's a reader whereas the digital cloud database

141
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,910
is a writer and what we're gonna do is we're going to end the lab here but we're going to leave things

142
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,080
running because in the next lab we're going to create a cross region read replica.
