Hi, guys, the other type of VPN that we can establish in IWC is a site to site VPN, so a site to

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,520
site VPN is where you might connect, for instance, a customer data center or office location in the

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,910
IWC and have a private network established over the internet.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,820
So an encrypted connection, which you can then tunnel through your traffic and again use internal IP

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,590
address, private IP addresses.

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,320
So the set up looks something like this.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,470
We've got an IWC VPC on the left and then on the right hand side, we've got a corporate data center

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,690
that could be a data center or an office, and you want to connect that into IWC.

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,700
So a VPN is a managed IP SEC VPN.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,570
And what we do is we create something called a virtual private gateway, which is also known as a V.W

11
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,550
on the IWC side.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,990
The VW is deployed on the IWC and then a customer gateway is deployed on the customer side.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,800
When you have those two components, you can then establish a encrypted VPN connection over the internet.

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,980
The VPN connection supports either static routes or BGP pairing and routing.

15
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:27,150
So in our roundtables, we can actually specify a destination for the side, a block of the corporate

16
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,790
data center and then points it to a virtual gateway I.D. So that's this device here.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,210
So that means any traffic go into this IP range will be sent over the VPN connection.

18
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,040
So it's fairly straightforward.

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,430
And the most common use case for this is what we see here.

20
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,760
It's connecting in data centers or office locations to IWC so that you can then tunnel your traffic

21
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,370
over an encrypted connection using the incident.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,370
It can also be used sometimes as a back up connection for Direct Connect, and we'll look at that later

23
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,360
on in this section.
