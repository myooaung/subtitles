00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,460
There are a few different ways that we can enable cross account access, and we really need to understand

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,820
what is our use case, are we going to be using the console?

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,550
Are we going to be using programmatic access?

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:23,300
So let's have a look at the different methods we can use resource based policies and I am policies for

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,510
programmatic only access to S3 bucket objects.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:33,590
We can use a resource based ACL and I am policies for programmatic access to pocket objects as well.

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,490
Or we can use across account.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,070
I am role for programmatic and console access.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,690
The key takeaway, I suppose, is if you want console access, you need to use a cross account.

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,580
I am role, so you assume the role and then you can access the data.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,760
Alternatively, if you only need programmatic access, you have a choice of resource based policies

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,410
and I am based policies and also resource based ACLs as well.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,050
So let's have a look at a simple scenario.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,450
We have accounts a on the left, an account, B on the right, on the left, we have an S3 bucket.

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,650
We want our user in Account B to be able to access that bucket.

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,610
So we've created a role and attached to the user.

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:23,150
There's going to be an identity based policy and that policy allows the user to assume the role and

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,900
accounts a.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,090
The user will then issue the SDS assume role, perhaps through the console.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,360
And then the role must have a trust policy that allows the user from Account B to assume the role.

21
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,750
And if that's the case, then the permissions policy will then allow whatever permissions are assigned

22
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,910
to that particular policy in that role.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,120
So that's the theory behind cross accounts access.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,580
And in the next lesson, we're going to do a hands on where we're going to implement this very scenario.
