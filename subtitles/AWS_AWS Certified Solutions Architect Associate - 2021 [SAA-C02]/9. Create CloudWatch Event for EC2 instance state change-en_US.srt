00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,370
Hi, guys, and this lesson is going to be a hands on lap, and what we're going to do is we're going

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,220
to create something like on the screen here.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,330
So we're going to have an easy to instant's.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,660
We're going to configure cloud watch events.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:19,780
So we have an instant state change notification sent cloud watch when we terminate the instance and

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:25,370
we're going to get cloud watch to then send a notification to our target, which will be an excuse.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,160
Q Now we won't have an easy to instant polling, which is going to do that manually, so we'll go in

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,520
through the console and find the message.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,010
So let's head over to the console.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,520
I'm going to I'm going to launch an instance and I'm just going to go through the normal defaults with

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,780
a T to micro and let's just use next next security group.

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,080
I don't really need to log into it, but I'll put it web access anyway, and then let's just launch

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,820
that instance.

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,990
So the instance is launching.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,080
Let's now open up cloud watch and we're also going to need us.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,400
So in fact, let's go to ask us first and what we'll do is we'll create a queue.

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,560
I'm just going to call this my simple queue and then choose quick create queue.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,660
So we've got our queue.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's go to cloud watch and let's go to events and eventually create rules so you can go down the rules

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,610
and then choose create rule.

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,200
Now we're going to choose the event pattern.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,800
They can choose a schedule as well, but we're going to choose an event pattern.

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,530
I'm going to search for two now.

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,450
I don't want it to be all event, so I'm going to choose easy to instant state change notification.

25
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,010
And in fact, I'm going to choose a specific state and I'm going to choose terminated.

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,960
So I'm only going to get notified when an easy two instance is terminated.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,360
And you could even choose a specific instance.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,450
But I'm just going to leave it as any on the right hand side here.

29
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm then going to choose excuse Q and choose my Q and that's all I need to do.

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,990
So let's just choose configure details.

31
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:09,130
I'm going to give it a name and I'm going to call it Termini instance and then just choose, create

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,460
rule.

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,870
So that's it.

34
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,510
That's the rule created and that rule is now active.

35
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,100
You can say it's a green status.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,440
So the way to test it is I literally just have to go over and terminate my instance.

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,590
So choose, terminate and choose.

38
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,010
Yes.

39
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,540
And now let's go to the excuse management console and let's choose view, delete messages and start

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,650
polling the messages.

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,620
And that took a few seconds to come through.

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,800
But now we can see our message, choose more details and we can see a bit of information here.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,570
So we've got the detail type isn't easy to instant state change notification.

44
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,780
The sources, too.

45
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,550
We got the account ID, we've got the time, we've got the region as us west to and then we've got the

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,470
resource ayran and we can see the instant side in here as well.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,280
So that's it.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,210
Very, very simple.

49
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,510
But just to show you what you can do with event notifications.

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,620
So I'm going to actually delete my message and I'm going to go and delete my Q And we've already deleted

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,850
our two instance.

52
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,730
If you want to, you can then go in and clean up your role as well.

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,710
You just let you go and delete your role.
