00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.220
In this lesson, we're going to create a custom VPC with public and private subnets.

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.890
Now let's have a look at what we're going to create.

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.120
So we're going to use the same example side a block we've seen in the section.

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.880
It's going to be a 10 zero zero zero network with a 16 bit subnet mask.

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.710
That's the overall block of addresses.

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.590
Then we're going to create these four subnets.

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.200
We've got Private One, a private one bay and public one and public one bay.

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.530
And the one in the one bay mean that they're associated with a specific availability zone.

9
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.650
Now for the private subnets, we'll have a private roundtable for the public subnets.

10
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.700
We'll have this main round table that's created by default will attach an internet gateway to our VPC,

11
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.650
and the main round table will have a route via the internet gateway out to the internet.

12
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.180
For those public subnets, we also must specify that we want our instances to pick up a public IP address

13
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.050
automatically.

14
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.740
So that's the configuration.

15
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.700
Let's head over to the console and build this out in the VPC dashboard.

16
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.310
I'm going to go to your VP PCs and we just have a single default VPC.

17
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.770
So let's create a new one in your course.

18
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.320
Download in the code directory Amazon VPC you'll have this file, a custom bash VPC.

19
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.750
We can simply copy values.

20
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.900
So I've got the name that's going to go under name tag.

21
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.190
Let's copy the side a block and put that under IPv4 side a block.

22
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.760
We're not going to do IPv6 at this stage, and this course will leave the tendency as default.

23
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.520
If you change the dedicated, it's going to put your instances on hardware that's dedicated to you and

24
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.630
that's going to cost you more money.

25
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.870
So definitely leave that as default, and that's all we need to do to create the VPC.

26
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.000
So the BPC is being created.

27
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.270
One thing I'd like to do is go to actions, edit DNS hostnames and enable.

28
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.230
That means we'll get DNS hostnames for our EC2 instances.

29
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.900
The next task is to create a subnets.

30
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.490
We've got public subnets and private subnets.

31
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.240
So I'm just going to copy these values to my clipboard.

32
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.350
We'll come back, go down to subnets, create subnet.

33
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.840
We need to specify our VPC so my VPC, and then we can put in the name and a subnet name.

34
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.570
Choose the availability zone as one ust one and then the IP for side block will come back.

35
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.320
We'll copy this side a block and we'll paste that in.

36
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.050
Now we could create the subnet there, or we can add a new one, and we're just going to do the same

37
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.150
for the next free subnets.

38
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.480
So just go through this fall and copy these settings for your additional free subnet.

39
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.080
When he finished, your page should look like this.

40
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.780
You've got public one in US East, one eye with a 10 zero one sided block, and then you've got subnet

41
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.230
two public 1b and that should be in Usf1 Bay.

42
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:14.630
So let's modify that and 10 zero 02 Private one, I should also be in used one eight 10 zero three and

43
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.830
then Private one be in East one 10 04.

44
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.120
So that all looks good.

45
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.900
Let's create all four subnets, and that's the four subnets created now for our public subnets.

46
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.430
We want to go to actions here, modify also assign IP settings and enable the auto assignment of public

47
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.140
IPv4 addresses.

48
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.250
So I've done that for public 1B.

49
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.960
Let's do it for public 1a, and those are updated now.

50
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.070
So the next thing I want to do is I need to create a round table for my private subnets so they're not

51
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.060
attached to the main round table, which is where the public submits will be.

52
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.110
So let's go to round tables, create round table.

53
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.300
We're going to specify a name.

54
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.240
I have that my clipboard from the file private party for VPC.

55
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm going to select my VPC and then we'll create the round table.

56
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.650
Once that's created, go to subnet associations, edit subnet associations and you want to select Private

57
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.800
One, 1B and Private One I and safe.

58
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.680
So now we've done that.

59
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.600
If we go into subnet associations, we should see an explicit association for Private One and B.

60
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.060
If we come back up to roundtables, we'll see the other round table here.

61
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.390
So this is the main round table or the public round table, if you like.

62
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.430
And under subnet associations, there are no explicit subnet associations, but 1A and 1B public are

63
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.960
associated implicitly.

64
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.550
The next thing I need to do is go and create an internet gateway.

65
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.270
So under internet gateways here, let's create an internet gateway.

66
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.360
We'll give it a name, and let's just paste this value in from the file and create Internet Gateway.

67
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.500
Once it's being created, it needs to be attached and the actions you can attach to the.

68
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.980
See, select the VPC.

69
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.410
And then attached the Internet gateway.

70
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.950
Now, the last thing we need to do now, we have an internet gateway, we do need a route from our main

71
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.610
roundtable.

72
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.070
So let's go to the main round table here.

73
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.760
Go to routs, edit routs at around and we'll put in the zero zero zero zero zero.

74
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.990
Choose our internet gateway and there it is in the list.

75
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.740
So now everything within the cinder block will be routed locally by the VPC router and everything that's

76
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.440
not within that BBC side.

77
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.140
A block will go out to the internet via the internet gateway.

78
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.120
So let's just save those changes.

79
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.190
So that's it.

80
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.100
We've created our custom BPC with public subnets, private subnets to round tables and an internet gateway.

81
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.640
Now that's all I need to do for this particular lesson.

82
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.490
In the next lesson I'd like to do is launch some instances and just test our configuration and make

83
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.220
sure we have the communication we expect.
