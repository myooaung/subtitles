1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.370
Likewise in this lab again to install Wordpress on an EC2 instance.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.350
Am I going to use RDS MySQL as the device backend.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.990
So let's create our database.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.490
I'm in the RDS management console and create database and I'm going to choose MySQL and

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.950
then we can choose the option here that says only enable options eligible for RDS free usage tier

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.990
and we'll click next and you'll see this time it doesn't ask us for the use case because it's already

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.910
configured it for the free tier and we can leave the database engine as it is.

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.830
It's going to install on a T2 micro instance you'll see that multi AZ is greyed out. You can enable

9
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.750
multi AZ just not part of the wizard.

10
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.080
So once we've complete we can add a multi AZ replica in obviously that's going to push us outside

11
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.350
of the free tier and that's why it's not enabled here

12
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.960
will leave these defaults and then we're going to come down and we're going to give our database a name.

13
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750
I'm going to call it digital cloud.

14
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.340
I'm going to copy and paste that into my master user name my master password and my confirmed password.

15
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.050
So obviously this isn't very secure but this is just a temporary database.

16
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.140
We can then choose our VPC I'm going to choose my custom VPC.

17
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.700
There's already a subnet group and I'm gonna make this publicly accessible.

18
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.650
And we could make this publicly accessible but we don't need to for this scenario.

19
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.540
I could then choose data availability zone as well but in this case I don't really care.

20
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.030
We could now choose an existing VPC security group but I don't have any set up at this stage for RDS.

21
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.700
In fact there is one here from a previous installation so let's just use that one.

22
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.010
What will happen is if you don't select one it will create one called RDS launch with it and it will

23
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.030
have port 3306 enabled for inbound and usually it will then lock that down to a source IP and

24
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.490
it will be the IP that you're connected from.

25
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.840
I'm gonna paste digital cloud into the database name as well.

26
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.500
She will leave the port as the default.

27
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.910
We can't enable encryption again.

28
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.940
This is because of the selected engine or DB instance class does not support it.

29
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:39.240
We can leave the remaining defaults except I'm going to just disable this deletion protection and we

30
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.530
can click Create database

31
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.480
so if we head back to the main console we'll see now that this is in a state where it's creating and

32
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.040
that's going to take a few minutes.

33
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.690
So let's go and get our EC2 instance running we're going to create a new instance now and it must

34
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.950
be an Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Going to choose next we're going to put it into my I'm going to put

35
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.640
it my custom VPC and I'm gonna choose a public subnet.

36
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.650
We're then gonna run some codes do some installation and so I walk through this quickly and it's all gonna

37
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.320
be in the course downloads we're gonna do Yammer updates install our packages we're going to run the

38
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.550
Amazon Linux extras installation and what we're gonna do is install that PHP seven point two package.

39
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.020
Then going go into install start and enable the Apache service.

40
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.350
We're going to change to the /var/www/HTML directory.

41
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.930
We're then going to download the WordPress binaries.

42
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.390
We're gonna unzip them.

43
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.100
We're going to copy all the contents of the WordPress directory to the working directory and then we're

44
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.680
going to modify a couple of permissions.

45
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.970
And don't forget the missing piece here which is the path to your interpreter at the top.

46
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.920
And let's just click next.

47
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.460
Next configure our security groups and just choose our web access and I'm going to launch this instance

48
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.210
and it might take a few minutes to install the PHP 7.2 package especially takes quite a few

49
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.820
minutes sometimes to install so that could delay your instance coming online.

50
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.850
So it's been a few minutes are instances now running.

51
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.080
Let's take its public IP and just see if our installation worked.

52
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.430
And it does so this is the WordPress setup screen now that's great.

53
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.470
But what we need to do first is before we run that is just get locked into the instance.

54
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.500
So I'm going to SSA Chen and we can come back to the wordpress installation screen now and just click.

55
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.130
Let's go

56
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.190
and what we need to do is go over to order Yes and we're going to grab this end point copy that to our

57
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.830
clipboard and paste us into where it says database host.

58
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.640
We then need to specify the name of our database.

59
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.390
So digital cloud I use the same for my username and password.

60
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.830
You leave the table prefix as it is and then hit submit.

61
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.130
So what we're gonna do now is copy this code go back to our instance and we're going to change directory

62
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.620
to var/www/html

63
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.070
that is and what we should see in here is that we've got a lot of files for WordPress

64
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:50.420
and we want to run sudo nano WP dash config dot pHP and then paste in all that code and then save

65
00:05:50.420 --> 00:06:00.010
that file and now let's head back to the installation and we'll click Run installation and that's great.

66
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.880
So we've got our site installed.

67
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:12.550
Now let's give it a site title so let's call this my wordpress RDS test and I'm going to give it

68
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.120
a user name.

69
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.040
That's just cool.

70
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.760
This will nail and I'm gonna give it a password.

71
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.030
I'm just going to call it digital cloud again.

72
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:30.390
I've got to confirm the use of that weak password and it's gonna call it nail apps digital cloud testing

73
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.380
dot com or something fake like that and then install Wordpress

74
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.890
we can now log in

75
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.580
and we're logged into our site using our RDS database.

76
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.960
So now let's go to posts.

77
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.100
Now we've got the hello world post here.

78
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.900
Let's just add something new and I'm gonna put in as the title

79
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:11.610
digital cloud RDS test and then we could put something in here like for instance let's just put

80
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:21.460
an image in so I'm going to choose upload and let's choose our lambda image and then we've just published

81
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.050
that post

82
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.270
right.

83
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.070
So we've got the Post published.

84
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:33.670
And if you click View Post that's the that's what we will say that saw a new post and what I want to

85
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.890
do now is show you how we can look inside the database in order.

86
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.410
Yes.

87
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.060
So we're going to head back over to the command line.

88
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.510
What we're gonna do now is install the utility HP my admin and to do this.

89
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.850
We need to install a dependency first.

90
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:57.040
So I'm going to do yum install GHB M.B. string dash y and we're gonna need to do this as sudo

91
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.430
and then as should just to make things easier let's just switch to root for the remaining commands and

92
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.770
I'm gonna run system CCL

93
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.140
restart page TPD

94
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:30.470
and we also want to restart P.H. BHP dash FP and and then the next thing to do then is to get the binaries

95
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:37.910
for page my admin so I've I'm going to use this command wget and then this is the path or we'll be

96
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:43.760
in the course downloads and then we have this rather lengthy command which unpacks and sets this up

97
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.560
for us.

98
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:51.800
So let's just run this command and if we just one else we should see the PHP my admin folder let's go

99
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:59.000
in there and we should be able to find a file called config.sample.php and what we

100
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.590
need to do is we'll copy that file.

101
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:11.810
So let's just put in the name of the file so it's config the sample and excuse me we need to copy it

102
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.560
to config by and see BHP.

103
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:22.000
So just get rid of the sample and then we're going to do nano config.

104
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:29.850
I can say that BHP and we want to come down to where we've got this line this says serve as host.

105
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:37.670
And it says local host and we're just going to backspace local host and then I'm going to go back over

106
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:43.610
two ideas and I just need to grab that end point address again and then we'll come back paste that in

107
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.570
and we're going to save that file

108
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.130
and with any luck.

109
00:09:51.140 --> 00:10:03.010
What would be I to do now is just use this IP address and then we're going to go to PHP myadmin and

110
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:03.520
here we are.

111
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.220
So let's put in the username a password for this site or for this database which is digital.

112
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.900
Digital cloud digital cloud and hit go.

113
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:18.460
So there we are we're actually in the database now so we're connected into our RDS database and

114
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.720
we can see our digital cloud database tables here.

115
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:29.710
And if we went down to for instance posts we can see our digital cloud RDS test post that we just

116
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.670
installed.

117
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.680
So just a way of visualizing you know what you've actually done here.

118
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:43.060
You've created a wordpress database within RDS and that's now running successfully from your EC2

119
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.740
instance in the next lab.

120
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:51.430
What we're going to do is enable multi AZ for our database and then we gonna fail our database over

121
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.270
and see what happens.
