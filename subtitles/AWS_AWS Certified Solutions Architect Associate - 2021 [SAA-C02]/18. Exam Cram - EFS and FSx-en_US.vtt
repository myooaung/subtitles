1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.410
So moving on to the elastic file system.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.060
This is a fully managed service that makes it easy to setup and scale file storage so remember that

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.910
this is file storage not block storage.

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.770
It's an implementation of an NFS file share

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.170
Accessed using the NFS version 4.1 protocol.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.460
It's elastic in nature so it scales drastically and you only pay for what you use.

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.610
And this is different to EBS because with EBS you actually pay for the amount of data you provision.

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.150
So if you create an EBS volume that's 100 gig in size you pay for 100 gig not the maybe 10 gigabytes

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.540
data that you've got stored on it.

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.190
It's multi AZ for metadata and data storage and you can configure your mount points in one or many

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.210
AZs.

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.990
It can be mounted from on premises systems.

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.520
If you use direct connect or VPN. Alternatively you can use the EFS file sync agent to replicate data.

14
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.690
EFS is elastic and grows and shrinks as you add and remove data and can scale to petabytes you can

15
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.620
connect concurrently up to thousands of EC2 instances from multiple ways.

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.120
So this is a real big difference to EBS.

17
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.880
We can only connect the EBS volume to one EC2 instance. With EFS you can connect lots of EC2

18
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.650
instances concurrently you can choose two different performance modes you've got General Purpose and

19
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:31.000
Max IO. EFS is a file system interface again and it uses file system access semantics such as strong

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.830
consistency and forward looking so data stored across multiple AZs in a region. It has read after

21
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.670
write consistency and you need to create the Mount targets and choose the AZs to include. Access control

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.850
is performed in a couple of ways.

23
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.330
So you've got the access control for the administration of the file system and that's using IAM and

24
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.640
then for the actual files.

25
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.910
So controlling access to files and directories you use POSIX compliant user and group level permissions.

26
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.860
This allows you to restrict access by user and group. A security group is the

27
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.680
firewall where you add the rules to define the traffic flow that's allowed to your EFS file system.

28
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.940
We then have encryption. So EFS offers the ability to encrypt data at rest and in transit. Keys are managed

29
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.080
by KMS and the data encryption in transit uses the industry standard TLS 1.2 to encrypt

30
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.050
data. Data encrypted at rest is transparently encrypted while being written and decrypted while it's

31
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.730
being read you can enable encryption at rest in the EFS console or by using the CLI or SDKs. So

32
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.360
EFS Sync provides a fast and simple way to securely sync existing file systems into EFS.

33
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.520
You might use that for migrating data to AWS and you can copy data up to five times faster than

34
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.620
Using standard tools. It's secure and efficient and it copies data and file system metadata such

35
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.900
as the ownership the timestamps and access permissions as well.

36
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.110
Now Amazon FSx is something which has been introduced fairly recently on AWS and it is definitely part

37
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.410
of the SAA-C02 version of the exam.

38
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.360
Whatever FSx is it provides fully managed third party file systems. With FSx

39
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.160
you are looking at workloads such as high performance computing, machine learning, and electronic design

40
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.070
automation and we'll talk a bit more about some of those use cases shortly.

41
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.780
With FSx it's a managed service so you can allow it to manage to file servers and the storage and it

42
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.910
will also make time consuming tasks such as the hardware provisioning software configuration patching

43
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.420
and backup.

44
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.360
So that's just a standard comment from AWS about the fact that this is a managed implementation of these

45
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.740
file systems.

46
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.580
It integrates the file systems with cloud based AWS services as well.

47
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.020
Now there are two different file systems you can choose from.

48
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.030
There's the FSX for windows file server for Windows based applications and the FSx for Lustre for compute

49
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.220
intensive workloads.

50
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.350
So let's look at those and a bit more detail.

51
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.680
Amazon FSx for windows file server is a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system it's built

52
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.270
on Windows Server and provides compatibility with the features which you would expect with a Windows

53
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.660
file system that's SMB protocol, NTFS, and Microsoft AD integration.

54
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.510
It uses SSD storage so it's fast and low latency and you can use this for all sorts of critical workloads

55
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.960
such as home directories media workflows and business applications.

56
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.380
So definitely supports lots of the windows native filesystem features so access control lists shadow

57
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.440
copies use acquired is also distributed file system.

58
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.750
It's an NTFS file system that uses the SMB protocol for access and you can connect thousands of compute

59
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:11.250
instances to it. FSx can also connect file systems to EC2, VMware cloud on AWS, and Amazon workspaces

60
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:20.070
and Amazon App stream 2.0 instances. You can connect from on premise using direct connect or VPN and

61
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.720
from multiple VPC accounts from regions using VPC peering or transit gateway.

62
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.030
Your data is automatically encrypted at rest.

63
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:36.300
With X and it complies with ISO PCI DSS, and SOC certifications and is also HIPAA eligible. Data

64
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:43.350
on FSx is automatically replicated within an availability zone and protected form component failure.

65
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.880
Now there is also a multi AZ deployment option and that is a sort of active and standby configuration

66
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.240
where data is actually synchronously replicated to the standby and then also you can failover to that

67
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.450
standby if you need to.

68
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.470
The other type of file system of FSx is FSx for Lustre.

69
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.690
Now this is one where if you hear about Amazon S3 being used and it is a use case with FSx,

70
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.710
this is probably going to be the file system you need to use because it allows you to transparently

71
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.650
access data from S3, so you can see your S3 objects.

72
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.670
You can run analysis on them and then you can save your data back into S3.

73
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.870
You can also access this file system over direct connect with VPN. Another use case for Lustre

74
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.780
is that you can actually burst from on premises into the cloud.

75
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.540
If you're doing that SAA-C02 version of the exam you definitely need to know Amazon FSx, there could

76
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.270
be a few questions on the exam and I recommend therefore going and just doing a bit more reading up

77
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.610
on our training notes.

78
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.420
And also on the AWS website.
