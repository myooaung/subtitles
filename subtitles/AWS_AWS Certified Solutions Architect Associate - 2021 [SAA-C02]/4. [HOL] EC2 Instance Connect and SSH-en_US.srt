00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:12,530
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to connect to your Linux instance using the secure shell

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,340
protocol and also a utility called Instance Connect.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,630
So let's head over to the console back in the management console.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,620
I have my Linux instance selected now.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,680
As you can see, each instance has an instance I.D. You can see the state which is running tells you

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,040
the instance type, and it shows that it's still initializing.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,580
In fact, if I refresh that, it should be ready.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,110
So yes, it is ready, and it's telling me that the status checks have passed, which means it's in

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,040
a good state of health.

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,780
You can see the availability zone and you can see some information about the public and private addresses

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,760
that the C2 instance has.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,570
Now there are a couple of ways that we can connect to an instance if we click on the Connect button

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,590
up here with the Linux instance selected.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,270
We'll see a few options.

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:14,610
There's easy to instance, connect session manager SSA clients and then easy to serial console.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,960
Now the two that I want to show you in this course are easy to instance connect and switch clients.

17
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,470
So let's start with easy to instance connect.

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,400
Now, the great thing about this is you don't need to do much at all.

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,210
Everything is filled out for you, including the username.

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,690
And easy to dash user is the correct username for the Amazon Linux Amoy.

21
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,870
So all you have to do is click on Connect what you'll then find as you get this command prompt.

22
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:55,430
Now what we're seeing here is that we're logged into the Amazon Linux two Amoy, and it's actually prompting

23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,490
us to run the Sudo Yum update command.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,080
And what that does is it updates the software on the Linux instance.

25
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,760
So I'm just going to run that just to show you that we're doing things on this EC2 instance where locked

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,300
into its console and we're actually able to run commands.

27
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,990
So that just took a few seconds, and you can see how easy this is to be able to get access to your

28
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,560
instance.

29
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,080
Now, backing the management console the other way that we can connect is the sage client.

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,290
So if I select this option, you'll see that it actually tells me the command that I need to run.

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,060
So we can see that we need to run an S-H command Daschle.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,670
And then this is the name of our keypad file that we created when we launched our instance.

33
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,870
And then it pre populates the DNS name of our instance.

34
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,830
Now let's just go back and be clear what that means.

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,520
So our instance has a public IP.

36
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,970
It has a public IP v4 DNS address.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,760
So this is a domain name, and you can see it actually includes the IP in the domain name.

38
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,010
Now, either of these can be used to connect, for instance, from the internet.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,710
It also has a private domain name and a private IPv4 address.

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,520
These are for internal use only you can't connect from the internet to the private IPv4 address or DNS

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,940
address.

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,260
Now, if we go back to the Connect and Associates client, we can see that we already have all of this

43
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,860
filled out.

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,840
So I'm going to copy this to my clipboard and then go over to a command prompt.

45
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:43,070
Now, back on a Windows desktop here, if I go to start, just type CMD and open a command prompt.

46
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:50,320
Now, if you're on a Mac operating system, you can open a terminal on a Mac OS desktop.

47
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,900
If you click on Launchpad and then go to other you'll find terminal.

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,120
Now Terminal will give you the site's utility that we need back on windows.

49
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,990
We should also have that same utility here.

50
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,550
Now, if you don't, then for Windows 10 you can install it.

51
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:17,780
Just do a quick Google search for install open source h windows and you'll find how to do it.

52
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,420
It's very simple now that we know we have the utility to run such commands.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,070
I just need to check that I have the file in my directory.

54
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:35,410
So on windows, I need to run, dial and make sure that I have the file in the directory I'm in.

55
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,760
If not, you need to change directories.

56
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:46,730
So let me clear my screen just to make this clearer for you, and I'm going to paste in the command

57
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,100
that I copied from IWC.

58
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:57,530
So now I can just run this commands, and what we should find is we get straight access into our Linux

59
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,100
instance.

60
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,800
So that's how we connect from Windows.

61
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,050
Now there is one extra step.

62
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:10,220
If you're on a Linux or Mac OS machine, so let's go back over and I'll show you that back in the terminal

63
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,110
on my Mac OS machine.

64
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,640
What I need to do is run less just to check that I'm in the correct directory.

65
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:24,410
And sure enough, I have my file here and now I need to run the command mode 600 and put it in the name

66
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,890
of the file, and that's going to change the permissions.

67
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,790
We have to do that.

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,840
Then we can paste in the command from IWC.

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,910
The exact same commands hit.

70
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,660
Enter, we need to type yes and hit enter again.

71
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,720
And now we should be connected.

72
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,720
And sure enough, we're connected to our Linux instance.

73
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,500
So that's how you do it using the S.H. clients.

74
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:54,380
As I said, the Instance Connect is a great feature, so it's certainly one we'll use when we can in

75
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,920
the course.

76
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,000
But if you want to connect for remote administration, this is how you do it.
