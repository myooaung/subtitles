00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.180
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.280
Now that we have our free to air account up and running, we need to configure the accounts and we're

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.530
going to do a few things in this lesson.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.340
Firstly, we're going to configure an account alias.

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.490
And this is a way that we can sign in easily using the alias, which is going to be a name that we decide

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.110
on instead of using an account number which is a bit more difficult to remember.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.180
We're also going to enable access to billing for IAM users.

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.870
What this means is, by default, only the user can ever update or view information about billing.

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.140
So what we want to do is make sure that we can actually supply permissions to users in our accounts

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.990
who should be responsible for seeing that information.

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.810
We're going to update the billing preferences.

12
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.560
There's a few things to do there and creates a billing alarm.

13
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.110
Now, the billing alarm is going to send you an email if you reach a certain threshold so you can set

14
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.790
it to $5, for example.

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.760
And if you do forget to turn something off, then you're going to get that warning and that's going

16
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.260
to be sent to you via what's called a simple notification service subscription.

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.850
An SMS subscription.

18
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.700
So let's head over to the console and configure our account, so I'm locked into my account as the root

19
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.150
user.

20
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.210
And up in the top right hand corner here there's a dropdown and you can see we have various regions

21
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.900
around the world.

22
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.580
So these are all of the IWC regions that you can launch resources into.

23
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.460
Now for this course, for the most part, we're going to be using U.S. East one North Virginia, so

24
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.800
make sure you have your console set to Norfolk, Virginia within currency.

25
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.560
Go up to services and you'll see a whole list of services under the various categories.

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.510
Now we're going to scroll down to where we have security, identity and compliance and choose IAM.

27
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.790
This is the main page for the Identity and Access Management Service.

28
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.880
And as you can see, on the right hand side, here we have an account alias and the account alias is

29
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.120
the same as the account's I.D. and it's just this long number.

30
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.830
So it's very difficult to remember.

31
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.030
So what we're going to do is create an alias that's much easier to remember.

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.780
I'm going to choose DCT eight U.S. Cloud Labs.

33
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.350
Now you will have to change that because it does need to be unique.

34
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.240
I'm going to click on save changes.

35
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.360
And now it's created the alias for me.

36
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.480
And that means that next time we log in with an IAM user accounts and it's going to ask for either the

37
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.130
accounts ID or the account alias, it's going to be much easier to remember the account alias.

38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.970
The next thing we're going to do is to updates our billing information and who can actually access billing

39
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.660
information.

40
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.840
So in the top right hand corner here underneath my account name, I'm going to select my accounts on

41
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.650
the main page here.

42
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.250
I'm going to scroll right the way down to where we can see I am user and roll access to billing information.

43
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.330
I'm going to click on Edit, Activate Iam Access and then updates back at the top of the screen were

44
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.040
then going to choose billing preferences.

45
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.990
I'm going to select all of these options here, so receive a PDF.

46
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.130
Invoice by email makes it easier to look at your bill, receive free to usage alerts and receive billing

47
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.940
alerts as well.

48
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.870
And I need to enter my email address and then save those preferences.

49
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.290
I'm now going to set up my billing alarm.

50
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.900
I'm going to do that by clicking on services.

51
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.640
I'm going to scroll down to management and governance, and we're going to find Cloud Watch.

52
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.730
Cloud Watch is a performance monitoring tool, and it receives information from our services, including

53
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.480
billing information, so we can use cloud watch to monitor the billing information and then send us

54
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.620
a notification using S.A. when we reach the threshold we've defined.

55
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.140
So again, make sure you're in Norfolk, Virginia.

56
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.510
On the left hand side, choose Billing.

57
00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.880
Choose Create an alarm.

58
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.130
Select the metric.

59
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.750
Choose Billing.

60
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.430
Total estimated charge and then select USD.

61
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.740
We can then choose select metric at the bottom.

62
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.610
We can leave the defaults on this page, scroll down and here where it says whenever estimated charges

63
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.240
is, we want to have greater than a certain threshold.

64
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.820
So for instance, you might want to set it to $5 or $10 or whatever you're comfortable with.

65
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.080
So I'm going to set minds of five.

66
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.560
Click on Next.

67
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.530
We now need to create the simple notification service topic.

68
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.660
This service is going to notify us by email when we exceed our threshold.

69
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.940
So let's choose create new topic.

70
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.880
We can give it a more descriptive name if we like mine will be called billing alarm and then you can

71
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.260
add the email endpoint.

72
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.210
So I'm going to add in my email address and I'm going to choose create topic and that's done for me.

73
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.410
So now if I scroll down to the bottom of the screen, click on Next.

74
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.760
Give the alarm a name.

75
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.830
I'll also call that billing alarm.

76
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.090
Click on Next.

77
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.710
Scroll down.

78
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.270
And then just create the alarm.

79
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.360
So that's it.

80
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.320
We've now created the configuration on IWC.

81
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.300
Now the subscription is pending confirmation, as the warning message tells you up here.

82
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.190
So go to your email inbox.

83
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.610
Open up the email that you've received and click on the link to confirm your subscription and then your

84
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.870
alarm will be ready to work.
