00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,680
Hi, guys, in this lesson, I'm going to give you an overview of the I Am service, the Identity and

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,120
Access Management Service.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:20,390
Now you have seen this in the last section when we logged in to U.S. and we configured our account.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,470
We actually went into the IAM management console.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:31,510
IAM is the identity and access management service, and it's a way that we can authenticate and be authorized

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,300
to access services on IWC.

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:41,650
So let's say we're connecting to an end up U.S. service via either the management console, the command

8
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:53,440
line interface or the API will connect to IWC IAM and we can then authenticate and all principles must

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,900
be authenticated to send requests.

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,250
Now what is a principle?

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,920
Well, a principle is a person or an application that can make a request for an action or an operation

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,820
on a resource.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,560
Now, actions and operations are both where we're using the API to interact with an IWC service.

14
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,290
So we have users roles, federated users and applications.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:28,000
We then have a couple of types of policy so we can assign permissions to users and then we can use policies

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,880
to control access to resources.

17
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:39,070
We have identity based policies and resource based policies, and these determine whether to authorize

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,020
the request, whether to allow or to deny the request to the resource.

19
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:51,880
And once you've got an allow or deny, assuming as a deny in this case, you're then able to run an

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,830
action against a resource.

21
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,990
Now remember I said that everything in IWC is an API call.

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,370
So when you're trying to launch an issue to instance, you're basically executing the run instances

23
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:06,900
command.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,410
If you're trying to get information about an S3 buckets, you're running the gets bucket API action.

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,380
And if you're trying to create a user in IAM, you're running the create user action.

26
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:29,440
So whatever resource you're interacting with in IWC, an API action is actually being executed and you

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,480
need to have the permissions assigned to your accounts and you need to be allowed for a policy to be

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,240
able to actually perform that specific action.

29
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,650
So the actions are then authorized on the IWC resources.

30
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,850
So that's a really quick overview of what this service does.

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,660
And in the next lesson, we're going to delve in more depth into users groups, roles and policies.
