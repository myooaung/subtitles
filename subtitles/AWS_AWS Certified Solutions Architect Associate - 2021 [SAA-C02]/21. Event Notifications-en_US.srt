1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,930
Let's now cover events, notifications, and the best way to do this is to go straight into the console

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:14,080
and if we had to properties, we've got events so we can receive notifications when specific events

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,200
occur in a bucket.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:23,320
So let's have a look inside at what the options are so you can add a notification and you've got all

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,480
these different event types.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,530
So you can have an event when somebody uploads an object, a put request or post or a copy or multiple

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,250
upload is completed and so on.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,470
So there's quite a few different event types that you can configure there.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,170
And then there's a few different types of destination that you can send to.

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,290
So we've got S.A.S. topic, which is the simple notification service.

11
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,480
We've got the simple Q service.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,770
Ask us where you can send to a queue and then we've got LAMDA functions.

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:00,250
So Lambdas is a very interesting one because it's a serverless service which provides functions as a

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:00,820
service.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:08,650
That means that you can take code and have that code run in response to events or triggers, as they're

16
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,510
called in lambda.

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,020
And we're definitely going to cover this in the lambda section of this course.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,930
So we're actually going to configure an event notification and see how it works.

19
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,540
But an example is that you have some images that you're uploading to a bucket and then you want Lambda

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,060
to process those images.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,050
It could be adding a watermark.

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,570
It could be changing the file type.

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,100
It could be doing one of a number of things and then saving that data to a different location, for

24
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,610
instance.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,970
So lots of power with how you do that.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,680
And we'll see the information that's sent with an event soon.

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,880
So let's get around to actually configuring an event.

28
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,500
But what I'm going to do for this map is we're going to send to an S.A.S. topic and generate an email.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,780
Now, I don't have any at this stage.

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,130
So what we need to do first is head over to S.A.S..

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,090
So this is the simple notification service and what we're going to do is we need to create a topic.

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,710
So I'm just going to call this one email Neil, and we can leave the defaults except for the access

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,280
policy.

34
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:26,040
Now, in here, you can use the basic option where you can specify which accounts have published, messages,

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,480
rights you can also configure, who can subscribe to the topic.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,430
So you could put in an account.

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,280
Top Icona allow everyone, etc., but what I have is I have some code in my clipboard, so I'm going

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,670
to go to Advanced and I'm going to delete all this Jason code and then I'm going to paste this code

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,000
in.

40
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,150
And so I already have the right information in here.

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,770
So I have the ayran of my bucket.

42
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,980
So really, you just need to change the bucket name and that's all we need to do.

43
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,540
Everything else can be defaults.

44
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,780
So now we have a topic and what we need to do is create a subscription, so I'm going to choose the

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,560
protocol and now you can see the different options for S.A.S..

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:24,550
You can send you can use the GPS protocol, you can use email, email, Jassam, excuse, lambda functions,

47
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,050
et cetera.

48
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,820
So there's quite a few different options.

49
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,750
What we want is just simple email.

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,620
And then I'm going to type in the email that I want this to go to.

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,380
And we can click create subscription.

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,600
Now, we can see here we have a status which is pending confirmation, so I'm just going to go to my

53
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,850
male client on another screen and I should have a notification and I do.

54
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:06,270
And so I'm going to click confirm subscription, and this is the response that I got from another browser,

55
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,490
just saying that I subscribe to the topic.

56
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,800
So that should all be set up properly now and we can go back to history and I'm just going to.

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:32,310
At a notification event, we'll call this one email put's, so I want an email to go out when I have

58
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:39,540
a put event and you could choose a prefix and a suffix to the prefix would be something like your folder

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,380
name.

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,020
So you only want to apply this to objects that are uploaded to a certain folder in your pocket.

61
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,080
And then a suffix can mean that you can have an optional suffix to limit the notifications to objects

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
with keys that end with matching characters.

63
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,370
So if all your data ends with certain characters, or maybe it's the filename, for instance, you could

64
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,780
configure that as a suffix.

65
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,780
So let's choose S.A.S. topic and email Neil and click save.

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
So that's been saved.

67
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,740
What I want to do now is come back and I just need to upload a file to my bucket, so I'm just going

68
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,050
to upload any fall I can.

69
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:30,260
And this is the S3 notification that I received, so I got a couple of emails, this was the first one

70
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,070
that came from.

71
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,460
There's more information in this one, so if you look at the type of data that we can see the region,

72
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:43,970
we can see a timestamp, we can see that the type of request was an object created a put request.

73
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,700
We can see the principal I.D. of the user.

74
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,820
We can see the source IP address that it came from.

75
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,630
So that would be my public IP address.

76
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,860
And then we can see request header information and schema versions, bucket names and so on.

77
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,750
So there's quite a lot of data and this is the type of data that can be sent to a service such as an

78
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:13,670
excuse Q or a Lamba function, which could then use this data to perform whatever processes it needs,

79
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,020
then needs to perform.

80
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:23,140
So that's event notifications and we will cover some more examples of how to use event notifications

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,420
later in the course, such as using security cues and lambda functions as well.
