1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.860
So moving on to cloudfront.

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.860
This is a Web service that distributes content with low latency and high data transfer speeds.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.790
So it's about dynamic static streaming and interactive content.

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.560
It's a global service.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.380
It allows ingress so uploading of objects and egress to distribute content.

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.660
When you set up cloudfront you can use a zone Apex DNS name. Platform also supports wildcards CNAMEs

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:38.200
wildcard SSL certificates dedicated IP custom SSL and SNO which is server name indication. So the edge

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.130
locations and regional edge caches make up part of the AWS global infrastructure.

9
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.830
The Edge location is the location where the content is actually cached requests are routed automatically

10
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.200
to the nearest edge location.

11
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.560
They're not tied to availability zones or regions that separate a regional edge cache is located between

12
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.060
the origin so where the data is coming from originally and the global edge locations and actually has

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.770
a large cache bandwidth.

14
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.690
So there's more space available to cache objects.

15
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.810
This allows you to have your objects available for a longer period of time in the cache in a regional

16
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.700
edge cache vs. an edge location.

17
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.460
They aim to get more content closer to users.

18
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.040
So this is what it looks like just to help you remember this you've got your origins that's where your

19
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.100
data is stored can S3.

20
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.580
Could be EC2.

21
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.820
And then you have your regional edge caches.

22
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.120
So these are the ones with the slightly bigger cache bandwidth.

23
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.920
And then you have the edge locations.

24
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.560
Now there's more edge locations than regional edge caches and they're kind of closer to users but they're

25
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.590
a bit smaller in terms of the amount of data you can store on them.

26
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.720
So in this case users then can connect to a cached objects in an actual location.

27
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.500
If it's not there they'll go to a regional edge cache and if it's not there it gets pulled down from

28
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.030
the origin.

29
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.060
So the origin is the source of the files that the content delivery network distributes can be an S3 bucket

30
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:17.260
EC2 instance a load balancer or Route 53 or also something external so non AWS custom

31
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.100
origin server as a HTTP server which can be an EC2 instance or an on premise non AWS based

32
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.880
web server. So EC2 instances are considered to be a custom origin as well as static websites when

33
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.870
it's S3.

34
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.800
There are two types of distribution.

35
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.650
You've got the Web distribution that has static and dynamic content including multiple file types and

36
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.920
the files are distributed over HTTP and HTTPS and you can add update orderly objects and submit

37
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.630
data from a web form.

38
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.050
You can also use those for live streaming to stream an event in real time.

39
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.570
You then have the RTMP distribution.

40
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.050
This is for streaming media files using a baby flash media servers RTMP protocol.

41
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.200
This is one that allows users to begin playing a media file before the file is finished downloading

42
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.910
files.

43
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.990
In this case must be stored in S3 so with cloudfront you can restrict access to the content using sign

44
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.620
cookies or signed your URLs or by restricting access to the objects in the S3 bucket.

45
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.490
There's also a special type of user called The Origin access identity (OAI) and that can be used to restrict

46
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.640
access to content in an S3 bucket.

47
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.180
If you use an OAI you can restrict users so they cannot access the content directly using the

48
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.330
S3 url.

49
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.660
They have to connect to cloudfront. Definitely an exam question watch out for this one.

50
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.810
So if you have an S3 bucket you can use OAI to make sure that no one can circumvent cloudfront

51
00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.960
and go directly to the S3 bucket but you can't do it with an EC2 Origin.

52
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.640
It has to be an S3 bucket.

53
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.570
With cloudfront you pay for data transfer out to the Internet and the origin and the number of requests

54
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.210
and also invalidation requests.

55
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.760
And if you have dedicated IP custom SSL or field level encryption requests what you don't pay for is

56
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:29.570
data transfer between the region and cloudfront or the regional edge cache and the AWS ACM SSL/

57
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.940
TLS certificates.

58
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.280
You also don't pay for shared cloudfront certificates.
