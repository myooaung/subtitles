Hi, guys.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,340
We've got a couple of laps now on public, private and elastic IP addresses.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,880
Now, it can be a bit of a dry subject.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,040
And so I'm going to break it up into two or three labs.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,410
And this one is really going to be a lesson.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,590
So I'm just going to talk to you about some of the fairy now and then we're going to get into some examples

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,320
and I'm going to show you the behavior of the addresses.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,570
So let's get started with a bit of fairy.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,910
So as you know, we have public IP addresses, private IP addresses and also an elastic IP addresses.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,460
So a couple of facts about them.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,760
A public IP address is lost when the instance is stopped.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,110
So if you run your instance and you reboot it, it will retain its public IP address.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,330
But if you stop the instance and then started again, it actually picks up a new one because these are

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,640
dynamic public IP addresses.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,360
Obviously, you use them in public subnets and you don't actually pay for their usage, so it's a free

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
address that you get from Amazon.

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,820
Public and elastic IP addresses are both associated to a private IP address on the instance, and I'm

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,570
going to show you a diagram and explain this concept to you a bit further in a second.

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,480
With private IP addresses, the address is retained when the instance is stopped and your instance will

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,420
have a private IP address, whether it's in a public or a private subnet.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,520
And like I say, that's because the private IP address is actually what the operating system sees.

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,560
So the public or elastic IP address is associated to that address will say this a bit further and a

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
second.

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,850
We then have the elastic IP addresses.

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,800
So this is a static public IP address.

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,610
Now, what you have to do is request the address and then you can associate it with an instance if it's

27
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,330
not used.

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,660
So it's disassociated or the instance instances stopped, you do get a charge for it.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,830
So you're not actually charged if you're using it, but you're incentivized to actually make sure you're

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,590
using it and you're charged if you don't.

31
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,000
So let's have a look at a couple of diagrams to understand these concepts a bit further in this diagram.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,110
We have an 82 instance.

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,360
So this box here is an easy to instance.

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,200
Let's say it's running Linux, but it really doesn't matter.

35
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:36,730
The instance has to Infonet interfaces, both of them have a private IP address, but one of them the

36
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,400
primary interface if zero.

37
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,250
Has a public IP address associated with it.

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,740
Now, this could be a public or an elastic, so even though dynamic or a static address, it doesn't

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,170
matter.

40
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,750
The point is, this is outside of the operating system.

41
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,880
The Linux operating system doesn't know anything about this address.

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,520
All it knows is this address.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,530
However, eight US map this address to this one, and that's actually performed over the Internet gateway.

44
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,250
So the Internet gateway performs one to one network address translation.

45
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:23,150
And what that means is when data comes into this public IP address, the Internet will then swap that

46
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,830
address from the public IP address to the private IP address so that the operating system can then pick

47
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,480
it up and process that data.

48
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,300
When data goes outbound, the source address from the operating systems perspective would be the private

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,110
IP address.

50
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:48,160
But to make it accountable on the Internet, the Internet gateway then needs to translate the source

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,090
address to the public IP address of the instance.

52
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,140
And now that data can go out with a source address that's actually relevant on the Internet.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,260
So that's just a bit of faery.

54
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,840
And what we're going to do in the next lab is we're actually going to run through a couple of scenarios

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,360
with private, public and elastic IP addresses to see how they work and how they behave.
