00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:10.120
So the next routing policy we're going to discuss is geo location routing so geo location routing is

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.920
used to serve traffic based on the geographic location of users.

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.700
So the location of the DNS queries come from.

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.210
So similar to when you're looking at latency based routing but slightly different in that you can lock

5
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.300
to a specific geographic region rather than using latency.

6
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.680
So you might want to use geo location routing if you need to localize content or present a Web site

7
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.710
in a specific language or you might want to use it to restrict distribution rights of content where

8
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.050
you only have distribution rights in a specific geographic region.

9
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:59.250
So you can lock down that distribution of that content to that specific region you can specify geographic

10
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.040
locations by continent country or even by state in the US.

11
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.040
So if you look at this diagram here what you can see is very similar to the other record sites we create

12
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.140
multiple entries for the same domain name.

13
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.620
And then we provide the values and then we lock down by geo location.

14
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:31.500
So we say for instance that if a user is coming from Singapore we're going to lock them to the geo location

15
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.450
region Singapore which is AP SD one.

16
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.320
If the user is coming from Oceana such as New Zealand.

17
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.330
Then that user gets sent to the region the Oceania region.

18
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.910
So and the local data center for that or the local region for that would be AP SD 2 in Sydney.

19
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.720
So you can then say well for everything else I'll have a default rule.

20
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.290
So someone starts querying from Mexico.

21
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.440
They might get sent a U.S. e one North Virginia.

22
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.010
So you typically have a default rule which means everyone goes to that specific location if they don't

23
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.550
fall within one of the other geographic areas and then you can lock down where users in other specific

24
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.810
locations around set free specifying their geo location in the record.

25
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.970
So let's go back and set up some of these records.

26
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.500
So first off let's start with the Singapore IP address and we're going to come in create a record set

27
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:49.190
and this one is gonna be called geo location and I'm going to put the IP address in and didn't copy

28
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.610
so let's just go back and try that again.

29
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.370
So we put the IP address and we're just going to go down to geo location and so now you can see continents

30
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.150
and then you can see countries.

31
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.980
So what I just want to do is I'm just going to search and we've got Singapore here and you can associate

32
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.600
it with a health check.

33
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:21.760
So I kids associate this with the Singapore health check and can I need to put in the I.D. Singapore

34
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.920
Geo and it's click on Create.

35
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.600
So we've got that record.

36
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.410
Now let's go back and get our North Virginia record and this is the one that I wanted to lock down as

37
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.830
the to open really as the default record.

38
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:47.880
So I've got geo location and I'm going to put the IP address in specified geo location and this time

39
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.130
that's the default option.

40
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.280
So let's set default.

41
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.950
And I'm just going to default and the again I can select a health check if I like

42
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.300
and then for the last one we're going to use our load balancer.

43
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:15.670
So let's just go and put geo location and change to an alias and choose our low balancer and we can

44
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.720
choose geo location.

45
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.680
Now notice in our next line we're gonna be talking about multi value art.

46
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.750
So that's great out because you can't do that with a load balancer.

47
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.880
So let's go down now and for this one I want to put in I could put Australia but in this case I want

48
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.800
to have a broader reach.

49
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.490
So I want to cover people in New Zealand for instance and other parts of Oceania so I can put it Oceania

50
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.320
and let's just give it a satellite day.

51
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.870
And again I can associate this with a health check.

52
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.240
Well that's target health so that's for the low balance so I don't need that here.

53
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.650
So let's just change to Sydney Alby and click on Create.

54
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.060
So we've got our free record sites.

55
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.170
Now I'm in Sydney so I'm going to just go to a command prompt so I'm at a command prompt now and I'm

56
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:21.080
going to type dig geo location DCT maps dot com and hit enter and let's say now I get those two records

57
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.820
that I know is associated with my local load balancer.

58
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.640
So I'm just gonna go back here and on another screen.

59
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:36.970
I'm gonna go back and I'm going to connect to let's say I can connect to Canada or again I'm back at

60
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.450
the command prompt with an IP address in Canada and let's it take geo location or DCT labs dot com and

61
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.400
I've got a response and I realized that I actually got the.

62
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.710
I think I copied the wrong address there so let's what we should have is the North Virginia record.

63
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:05.960
So let's go back and sure enough for the North Virginia one I just need to replace that IP address and

64
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.530
I can save the record set and I'm just gonna have to wait for the TTL to expire and then I'll renew

65
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.080
again.

66
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.210
So I'm back at the command prompt the TTL should have expired now.

67
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:26.180
So let's just run that they command again and sure enough now we get the North Virginia IP address so

68
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.820
the other thing to test now is I'm going to disconnect from Norfolk Virginia excuse me from Canada which

69
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:42.320
was obviously the got picked up as the default rule which connected me to North Virginia.

70
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:50.730
So now let's just connect to Singapore so I'm now connected to Singapore and if I run the day command

71
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.460
again course I'm going to get the updated address.

72
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:03.000
So I've changed locations and it's given me a new TTL and it's given me the 72 address which corresponds

73
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.590
with Singapore so that's if a geo location routing you should look out for questions that talk about

74
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:20.480
locking down distribution of content localizing web pages or serving Web pages in different languages

75
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.240
that kind of thing.

76
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.540
That's the type of language you might see that would push you towards using a geo location routing policy

77
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.300
whereas with the latency one it be more around performance and ensuring that users get the best use

78
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.080
of experience.
