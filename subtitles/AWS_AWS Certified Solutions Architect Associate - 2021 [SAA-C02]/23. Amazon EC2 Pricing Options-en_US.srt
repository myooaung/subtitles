00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:11,180
Hello and welcome to this lesson and this lesson, I'm going to cover the Amazon EC2 pricing options

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,660
and various use cases for those different pricing options.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,900
So there's quite a bit of a deep dive on these subjects as they do come up quite a lot in exam topics.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,340
So you really need to know this.

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,970
So firstly, let's look at the different types of pricing model there.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,650
All we've got on demand on demand is just the standard rate.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,750
There's no discount, there's no commitments.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,020
You can use it for things like dev test workloads, anything that's short term or unpredictable.

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,030
So in that case, you're not committing, but you're also not getting any discounts.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,120
So it's just a standard rate is very flexible.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,180
So it's very useful when we launch instances in this course, we're just using on demand because we're

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,530
not running them for very long.

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,690
If you're running a workload for a longer period, then you've got to start thinking about some other

14
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,020
kind of option other than on demand because you're just not going to get any cost savings.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,930
That's it's going to be the most expensive option.

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,790
So next up, we have reserved in this case, you are committing.

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,300
So though IWC is mostly about not having any commitments in this case, you are going to commit, but

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,530
you get a discount for it.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,680
That discount can be up to 75 percent and you commit for even one year or three years.

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,290
And this is for things like your steady state workloads, your line of business applications.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,340
They're not going anywhere.

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,260
They're going to keep running year after year.

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,350
It's predictable, and therefore you need to make sure that you get the best pricing model for it.

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,570
And in this case, it makes a lot of sense to have that commitment with IWC.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,100
You could also reserve capacity with reserved instances as well.

26
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,500
Next up, we have spot instances.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,850
This is where you're actually bidding for unused capacity.

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,620
So IWC obviously have huge data centers.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,840
It's not always fully utilized.

30
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:06,200
And so there's lots of unused capacity and you can bid on the usage of that unused capacity.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,960
In this case, you can get discounts up to 90 percent.

32
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,440
So really big discounts.

33
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,420
But there is a catch, of course, and that is that your instances can be terminated at any time and

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,870
you do get a short notification before that happens.

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,780
But in this case, you need workloads to have flexible start times and flexible enzymes.

36
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,980
This is used in situations such as where somebody needs a really cost effective solution to run a large

37
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,610
processing workload, and that workload can actually withstand instances being terminated so the data

38
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,950
needs to be saved or it needs to be replicated somewhere, and the application logic needs to be able

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,680
to recover from any terminated instances.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,930
We then have dedicated instances this is where you have physical isolation at the host hardware level

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,620
from instances belonging to other IWC customers.

42
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,910
So we typically are using shared infrastructure.

43
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,170
The infrastructure, which, for instance, is run, is shared across many customers.

44
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:17,540
If you need to dedicate your instances to hosts that are not shared with other customers, then this

45
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,530
is the option for you.

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,090
In this case, you pay.

47
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,990
Per instance, your dedicated instances can be sharing hardware with other instances from your account,

48
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,520
but not from other IWC customers.

49
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,320
We then got dedicated hosts.

50
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:38,210
This is a physical server that's dedicated for your use, so you're not sharing it with anybody and

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,340
you've got a whole server dedicated just for you.

52
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,080
It's going to cost you a lot more.

53
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,240
Both of these options are going to be expensive, so you've got to think about, you know, why do you

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,720
need this?

55
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,830
But you might need this for things like soccer and core visibility.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,890
So some licensing is bound to the CPU's in the physical hosts that your instance is run on and therefore

57
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,060
dedicated hosts means that you can have that visibility and it helps you with licensing.

58
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,190
You have host affinity so you can control where your instances are actually running.

59
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,600
Which hosts are they running on?

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,940
You might want to make sure that two particular instances are running on different hosts, and you can

61
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,890
do that with a dedicated host.

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,050
This model is pay per host, so you pay for the whole host rather than the instances running on it,

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,100
and it's going to be a lot more expensive than any of the other options here.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,070
Lastly, we have something called savings plans.

65
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,300
This is where you commit to a consistent amount of usage, and this goes across easy to forget, which

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,500
is a container technology we'll talk about later in the course as well as lambda.

67
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,110
So in this case, what you're doing is you're saying I'm going to pay a certain rate and I'm going to

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,350
commit for a certain period of time, one or three years to using a certain amount of compute capacity.

69
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,090
Now, let's look at how you actually build.

70
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:15,190
So you actually build per second with a minimum of one minute and that's for Linux instances and the

71
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,250
per second billing is for Amazon Linux and a buntu in on demand reserved and spot forms.

72
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,380
We then have billed per hour.

73
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,720
This is a minimum of one hour.

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,430
And this applies to windows and applies to other distributions such as commercial Linux distributions

75
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,510
such as Red Hat Enterprise, Linux and Susie Enterprise Server.

76
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,130
Now what about the EBS volumes that are attached to your two instances?

77
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,120
Well, those are actually billed per second with a minimum of one minute.

78
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,470
So what about the EBS volumes that are attached to your instances?

79
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,130
Well, that build per second with a minimum of one minute.

80
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,430
So let's look at reserved instances in some more detail.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,900
Remember that the term is one year or three years and you have something called a standard ROI and you

82
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,740
have a convertible.

83
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,250
All right.

84
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,210
The standard ROI means that you can change availability zones the instant size if it's Linux and the

85
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,910
networking type you use to modify reserved instances API action to perform those changes.

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,450
With a convertible, Roy, you can change the AC instant size for Linux and the networking type as well,

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,540
but you can also change the family operating system tenancy and the payment option.

88
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:39,260
And in this case, you use the exchange reserved instances API action to perform those changes.

89
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,050
The payment options can then be all upfront, partial upfront or no upfront, so you even pay for the

90
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,270
entire one or three years upfront.

91
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,500
And that means you'll get the best discount, but not so good for your cash flow.

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:58,850
Or you can pay a partial fee upfront and then a monthly payment or no upfront, which just means a monthly

93
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,300
payment.

94
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,590
And of course, you don't get quite as much of a discount if you don't put anything down upfront.

95
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,760
But that obviously gives you a better cash flow situation as well.

96
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:15,290
When the attributes of a instance that you've launched into your account match the attributes of a reserved

97
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,830
instance.

98
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,750
That's when the discount gets applied.

99
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,260
So that can include the type of instance you're running, the instance type, and it can include the

100
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,300
operating system that you're using.

101
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,970
With that instance, the tenancy is another attribute so that can be default or dedicated.

102
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,900
Remember that dedicated means you're running on dedicated hardware.

103
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,230
Lastly, it can be the availability zone and the region.

104
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,700
So these are all the attributes that need to match the ROI for it to be applied.

105
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,830
When you specify and availability zone, you can also reserve capacity in that easy but by region.

106
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,150
It does not reserve the capacity, but the discount does apply to all availability zones.

107
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,930
So let's look at these scheduled ROI schedules.

108
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,220
All ROI is where you matched a capacity reservation to a recurring schedule.

109
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,060
There's a minimum of 12 200 hours per year, and you might use this for something like a reporting application.

110
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,850
So if that runs for six hours a day, four days a week, that would be one thousand two hundred forty

111
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,870
eight hours a year.

112
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,850
So what you do is you just pay for one thousand two hundred and forty eight hours a year and you get

113
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,800
your reserved instance discount.

114
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,510
And you can just use that within those time frames.

115
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:36,280
Now, very recently, I've noticed this IWC seem to be deprecating this functionality, so they now

116
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,440
say that they do not have any capacity for purchasing scheduled reserved instances.

117
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,120
Now I still talk about it because it's definitely on the exam at the moment.

118
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,490
It will take a few months before they get rid of those questions and update the exams.

119
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,550
So just bear in mind, the exam may not reflect this.

120
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,280
Yes, if you see something mentioning scheduled reserved instances, that means the exams not updated.

121
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,130
Next up, we have the savings plans.

122
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,990
So here we have the Compute Savings Plan or the Easy two savings plan.

123
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,220
With the Compute Savings Plan, you choose a one or three year.

124
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,760
It's an hourly commitment to usage or Filegate Lambda and to any region, family size, tenancy and

125
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,330
operating system with the easy to savings plan.

126
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Again, it's a one or three year commitment.

127
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:35,440
It's hourly usage again, too easy to only and within a selected region and instance family.

128
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,720
And you can also use any size, any tenancy and operating system combination.

129
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,890
Let's look at spot instances in some more detail here.

130
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,360
You're bidding for unused capacity and getting a discount of up to 90 percent.

131
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,820
You can launch a spot instance that's just one or more spot instances, or you can launch a spot fleet.

132
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,520
This is where IWC launches and maintains a specified number of spot.

133
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,530
And also, you can mix in on demand instances to meet a certain capacity.

134
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,180
You then have two fleets.

135
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:19,700
This is where IWC launches and maintains a specified number of spot on demand and reserved instances,

136
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:27,260
all in a single API call with Sea Fleet, you can define separate on demand and spot capacity targets,

137
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,060
bids, instance types and availability zones.

138
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,520
So lots of flexibility there.

139
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,230
Now you do get a two minute warning if eight of us need to reclaim capacity.

140
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,960
And this is made available via instant metadata and also cloud watch events.

141
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,690
Spot Blog actually comes up in a few exam questions with Spot Block.

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,170
This is where you can run two instances uninterrupted for one to six hours, so you're getting a discount,

143
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
but you also don't get an interruption.

144
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,700
So in this case, you just specify the block duration, which is anything from one to six hours.

145
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:11,310
The number of instances and then your bid price pricing is 30 to 40 per cent less than on demand.

146
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,320
So much better than on demand.

147
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,390
Not anywhere near as good a spot.

148
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,900
But if you need to make sure that your instances aren't terminated within that time frame, then spot

149
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,040
block is a good idea.

150
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,050
Lastly, let's look over dedicated instances and hosts and a bit more detail.

151
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,640
So this table just helps you understand the differences because it can be a bit confusing.

152
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,690
So we've dedicated instances and hosts.

153
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,810
It's enabling the use of dedicated physical servers.

154
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,040
Remember that we've dedicated instances your instances of running on hardware the other IWC customers

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,640
are not using, but other instances that aren't dedicated.

156
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,850
Instances in your account can share that hardware.

157
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,920
We then have, per instance, billing.

158
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,920
That's four dedicated instances per host.

159
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,700
Billing is for dedicated hosts and then lots of features here, which you don't get with dedicated instances.

160
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,030
You've got visibility of sockets, calls and the host I.D affinity between a host and an instant, so

161
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,210
you can choose where which instance your host is going to run on.

162
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,580
You can target instance placement and automatic instance placement is for both.

163
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,010
And you can add capacity using an allocation request for dedicated hosts.

164
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,790
So that's it.

165
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,740
For this lesson, we've covered a lot of ground and it's not the most exciting topic, but it really

166
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,910
is game for the exam.

167
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,780
There's lots of questions in the exam on EC2 pricing.

168
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,590
In the next lesson, we're going to look at some particular use cases.

169
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,920
We're just going to cover off when you would use each pricing model.

170
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,770
So I hope that is useful to you and I'll see you in the next lesson.
