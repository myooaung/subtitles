00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.290
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.490
Welcome to this lab on the network load balancer.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.360
So as you remember the network load balancer is the one that operates at the connection level.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.440
So just go back to this slide we have the network load balance here operating at layer four which means

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.460
TGP and UDP.

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.360
You can also assign elastic eyepiece.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.730
So that means you can have a static IP address associated with your low pants with the other types of

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.390
low balances you only get the DNS name and NWS control of the IP address and you don't see it but in

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.990
this case you can have a static IP assigned.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.130
So what we're going to do is build up a lab just like this one.

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.700
I'm going to connect from my Mac on the Internet and we're going to have a network load balancer.

12
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.410
There's obviously an Internet gateway attached to the VPC to allow the connection in and we could have

13
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.080
two instances running and they're both going to be in a public subnet.

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.280
And remember the network load balance or whichever low bias the Internet face and low balances still

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.080
round the connections to the private IP addresses of the instances.

16
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.970
So what we're going to do is we're gonna build these instances with Apache and just to make it a little

17
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.800
bit more fun.

18
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.170
I've got some files and some use data and we're going to generate some index files that have the name

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.340
of the easy to instance and it's going to pull the name from a name file.

20
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.180
So let's just go over to Amazon S3 where we're going to upload those files.

21
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.250
So I mean it's free and I'm going to use my DCT labs bucket.

22
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.290
You can just create yourself a bucket.

23
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.690
It really doesn't matter what the name is and I'm going to choose upload and add files and I'm going

24
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.620
to choose these two files index not 60 and names dot CSP and these files will be available in the course

25
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.380
download for you.

26
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.280
So let's just choose choose and choose upload.

27
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.180
And we've now got of two files so the top one here is gonna be our index or hasty email file.

28
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.240
It will be edited and then saved as Dot hate email as part of our user data and names dot CSP is a file

29
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.970
just with lots of names like first names.

30
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.410
So we're going to assign a first name to our instance and that's gonna be copied into the index file.

31
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.180
So now that we've got these two let's go to the easy to management console and we're going to launch

32
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.990
a couple of instances.

33
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.120
So I'm going to go through to configure instance details I'm going to specify two as the number of instances

34
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.210
I need to use my S3 role.

35
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.150
I've now got this one called S3 free full access which gives me full admin access and you'll need to

36
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.930
have at least read permissions to be able to copy those files to the easy to instance we can then go

37
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.190
down to advance details and I'm going to paste in this user data.

38
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.130
So what we're doing here again we're calling the path to our interpreter bash we're doing some updates

39
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.780
we're installing a patching and enabling it.

40
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.660
We then change to the dub dub dub hasty email directory and we copy these files from S3.

41
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.160
So we copy the names dot CSP file and the index dot text file and what we're then going to do is just

42
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.630
run this bit of code that takes a name from the file at random and copies it into the index file and

43
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.610
saves it as indexed or hasty email.

44
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.510
So we actually get a file our index hasty email file says this is instance Paul or Annabel or whatever

45
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.550
it might be.

46
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.020
So that's just a bit of fun just to make things a bit more interesting but also so that we can see how

47
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.190
the low balances working moving us between different instances.

48
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.940
So let's just click next.

49
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.430
Next security group selects an existing one choose web access and review and launch and launch and that's

50
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.610
it.

51
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.430
So we can now go and set up our network load balancer.

52
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.460
So we go to low balances create load balancer and we're gonna choose network load balancer.

53
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.290
So as it says here you use a network load balance or when you need ultra high performance tier less

54
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.720
off loading at scale centralised cert deployment support for UDP and static IP addresses for your application.

55
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.880
So you can not only have elastic IP addresses associated with your network load balancer You can also

56
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.340
have static eyepiece on your application the network load balance is also capable of handling millions

57
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.250
of requests per second while maintaining low latency.

58
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.850
So whenever you see exam questions that mention you need very high performance very low latency and

59
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.250
lots of connections you might want to think about the network load balancer again you need to take context

60
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.150
into account so also see if there's any requirement for stuff like path based routing or host based

61
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.160
routing because that might push you to application load balancer but otherwise it might be a network

62
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.680
load balance.

63
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.770
So when you're looking at that low latency and high performance so let's choose create.

64
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.570
And I'm just going to call this my MLB and we're going to leave it as Internet facing so obviously you

65
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.160
can change this to internal when you only want an internal load balancer but we want an Internet one

66
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.110
now for a network load balancer you'll see we only have these layer four protocols we don't have the

67
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.410
option for HDTV or hasty CBS.

68
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.870
So I'm going to choose TPP but of course you can still run HDTV hasty CPS applications.

69
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.870
It's just that the information in the hasty teepee headers at last 7 is not going to be recognized by

70
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.220
a network load balancer.

71
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.170
So we can now choose our availability zones and we need to specify at least two availability zones and

72
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.440
IP V for address we can even have a signed by W.S. or we can choose an elastic IP.

73
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.950
Now if you do have an elastic IP assigned to your account you'll be at a selector here.

74
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.440
And if you do that you have to do it for both availability zones you can't have one as a dynamic address

75
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.740
and one is an elastic IP so let's click next and next again and what we need to do now is create a target

76
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.090
group.

77
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.340
So this is a concept that doesn't exist in classic low balances but you need to create target groups

78
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.720
for network low balances and application low balances.

79
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.470
I'm just gonna call 91 and what you can do then is specify some parameters associated with the targets

80
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.620
and collect them under a single configuration.

81
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:32.290
You can choose instance or IP I'm going to choose instance and then for protocol again it's layer 4

82
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.020
protocol.

83
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.550
So I'm just going to leave it at CCP 80 and health checks you now have more options.

84
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.150
But that's just for the health check.

85
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150
I'm fine with hasty again.

86
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.740
I'm going to put my healthy threshold down to two and my interval down to 10 seconds and let's clip

87
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.170
next.

88
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.020
Now we can see that we have options to register our targets so that a select way for these guys and

89
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.290
choose ads registered and we'll click next and create.

90
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.870
And so that say it's been created.

91
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.710
Let's go back to the console and you can now see that it's in a state of provisioning so Web alert network

92
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.850
an application load balancer you have low balances and target groups.

93
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.150
So some configuration is done here.

94
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.400
You can edit some information about the load balancer enabled deletion protection cross line load balancing

95
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.440
and access logs will cover these later on in the section.

96
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:32.540
You can look at some high level information you can then have a look at your listeners and we've listeners

97
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.110
you can actually add additional listeners so I can go in and it has to be a different port.

98
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:43.040
But I could add in an additional listener and I could say forward to now I only have one target group

99
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.290
but I can even send it to that target group.

100
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:51.660
So I've now got two listeners if we come back one in Port 80 and one in Port 81.

101
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.180
Now they're both going to the same target group but I could have them going to different target groups

102
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.700
under monitoring.

103
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.690
You can see some cloud Watch metrics for your load balancer.

104
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:10.130
Now let's go to target groups and what I want to do is go to targets and have a look at the status of

105
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.730
my targets.

106
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.530
So that by and the initial status if you have a look at health checks you can see what the configuration

107
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.890
is and you can change it.

108
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.070
And again you can see monitoring here and this is about healthy and unhealthy hosts.

109
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.630
So let's go back to targets and we're hoping that these are going to change to healthy.

110
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.700
So that's a few minutes but we have two healthy instances now.

111
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:37.760
So let's go over to low balances and I want to copy the DNS name of the load balancer and then just

112
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.630
open up a tab and paste that in.

113
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:47.330
So here we go I get my index or hasty mail file which says Hi this is Madeline.

114
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:54.090
And if I click refresh with a network load balance so it doesn't operate quite like the other load balances

115
00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:01.450
which send connections in more a round robin fashion between instances.

116
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.770
Eventually it will find the second instance and in fact this takes place even if you go to the load

117
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:15.390
balancer and enable cross own load balancing which it says even the distributes the connections between

118
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.700
targets in the availability zones.

119
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.920
So let's go back and refresh again.

120
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.300
And we still get Madeleine and while we could try doing is opening a new window so then I open a private

121
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.300
window here.

122
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.200
And this time we get Rebecca.

123
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.020
So before we had Madeleine then we get Rebecca.

124
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:41.400
So what it seems to do is stick you to one of the instances rather than just sending each connection

125
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.080
request to a different instance.

126
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.380
And we're actually going to have a session later in this section on stickiness which is the feature

127
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:56.850
of low balances which ensures that connections stay on a particular backend instance when they're coming

128
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.350
from one particular client.

129
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.730
So we'll have a look at the behavior across the different low balances in that lab later on.

130
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.140
So that's set for network load balances guys.

131
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.610
Hopefully that's giving you a good understanding and I hope you've enjoyed this lab.

132
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.520
What we're going to do in the next few labs is actually use application load balances I'm going to have

133
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.880
a look at Path based routing and host based routing and lots of the features of the Albee for now what

134
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.750
we can do is just go in and we can delete our load balancer and once that's delete you can then go in

135
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:35.800
and delete your target group and we can then go and shut down or terminate our instances.

136
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:36.660
So that's it guys.

137
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.130
I'll see you in the next lab.
