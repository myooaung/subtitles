1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:07,650
We're now going to cover object lifecycle management so with object lifecycle management.

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:14,540
you can automatically move data between different storage tiers or archive and delete that data.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:22,000
So you might use this to move data that's not so frequently access from as standard as free to another

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,140
storage class and then you can expire data when you no longer need it.

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,940
So let's go into a bucket and have a look how this is configured.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,450
So we head over to management and we've got the lifecycle rule option here and there's a couple of

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,410
different links here which take you to some more information.

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,630
So we've object lifecycle management.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,660
There are a couple of actions that you can configure.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,610
One is a transition action.

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,850
And this means that you actually move your objects from one class such as S3 standard to another class

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,630
such as Standard I.A. which is the infrequently accessed class.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,960
And that's a lower cost storage than standard.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,630
So you might move it there when you don't need to access it as often and then you could move it to glacier

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,750
when you think that you really won't need it or need to retrieve it very often at all.

16
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,020
And that will save you even more money.

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:20,470
And with the caveat being that you have longer retrieval times if you do need to access that data.

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,030
So those are things that you can automate for a transition action.

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,860
Then you've got expiration actions.

20
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:34,350
And this literally means that you can inspire your objects which means that Amazon deletes them another

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,000
link here gives you a bit of a diagram which shows you about how you can configure these actions.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,060
So with the transition actions you can move for instance from standard to standard IA you could then

23
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,200
go to one-zone IA which has less redundancy you could then move from there to Glacier or to deep Archive

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,190
which is the version of glacier which has even longer retrieval times.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,450
So there's lots of options they call it a waterfall model where you can just move between different

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,410
tiers and all of this can be set up to happen automatically as well.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,300
The third link talks about objects expiration which really is deleting the data so let's go back to

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,330
the console and let's actually configure a rule.

29
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:31,000
So I'm just gonna call this my lifecycle rule and you can put in a prefix here if you just want to

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,560
apply this to certain prefixes and the objects underneath those prefixes within the bucket.

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,880
I'm just going to leave that blank and you can then choose.

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,210
So if you have versioning enabled you can choose to apply your transition action to the current version

33
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:52,840
or also to the previous versions so you can have a transition action for the current version which says

34
00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:00,250
let's go to standard I.A. after 30 days and then you could say well for the previous versions I don't

35
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,810
need those very often at all but I'll have a backup of them so let's just transition those to Glacier

36
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,870
and you can then expire so you can say the current version should expire 395 days previous versions

37
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,490
can perhaps you bring that down to 180 days

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,830
so that's all you need to do.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,650
And then you can click on Save to hit refresh and ....

40
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,120
There you go.

41
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,860
Those your rule so very simple and lots of flexibility in how you can use lifecycle rules and very

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,480
good for ensuring that you're using the best tier at a certain time.

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,530
So if you have a lifecycle for your data that you're very well aware of you can configure the rules

44
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:56,780
here to move that data between different storage tiers and then deletes it according to your known lifecycle

45
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,790
for your data.

46
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,940
If you don't know the lifecycle for your data that's where you might want to use something like the

47
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,760
intelligent tiering of S3 which then moves data around automatically.

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,130
But that's a different thing to this.

49
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:16,940
So this is more about configuring when you know what the lifecycle of your data is a couple of other

50
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,120
things I want to bring to your attention are on this web page which talks about transitioning objects

51
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,700
using the S3 lifecycle.

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,250
It tells you what these supported transitions are and what the unsupported transitions are.

53
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,850
So you should be aware of these just understand you know which what you can move from where to where.

54
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,440
And then there are some more constraints as well to understand there.

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,760
And also have a look at the pricing.

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,890
You don't need to know every detail in here for the exam but what you do need to really understand is

57
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,030
the price differences just have a good understanding of what the price factors are.

58
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,450
What you get charged for such as you can see here is free transfer acceleration something you need to

59
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,990
pay for.

60
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,910
So that might be something that changes the design data transfer pricing as well.

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,790
So you need to know what you try and what you pay for.

62
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,980
And it's really data that goes out.

63
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,010
It's not data that comes in as you can see here.

64
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,060
It's all data that goes out and that includes two different regions.

65
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:29,170
There's also some costs around storage management requests as well so the get in the puts and so on

66
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,240
requests that you issue to S3.

67
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,740
So just get an understanding of those and then also this chart here which is on this web page called

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,760
Amazon S3 storage classes what you need to know here.

69
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,770
Now you won't again be asked it's unlikely at least that these days that the exam will ask for a specific

70
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,190
thing like how many zones are there in you know S3 standard IA or one zone IA.

71
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,200
But you do need to know this because it might ask you a question about what the redundancy is or you

72
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,880
might have a constraint in a question that says that you need to ensure that your data is replicated

73
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,610
between at least three Availability Zones which storage tier should you use.

74
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,040
And so it might sway you one way or another.

75
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:20,520
Also understand the minimum storage duration which applies to certain tiers and then also you can see

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,410
here you pay per gigabyte retrieved with some tiers but not with others.

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,640
So just get an understanding of what the charges are I'd get an understanding of which constraints apply

78
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,070
to each tier and how they're designed and architected.
