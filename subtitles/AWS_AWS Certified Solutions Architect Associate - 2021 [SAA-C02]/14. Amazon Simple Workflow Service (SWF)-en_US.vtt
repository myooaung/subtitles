Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:11.540
I'm in the console for the Amazon simple workflow service, SWF. SWF is a web service for making it

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.750
easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.910
It uses asynchronous systems as workflows and supports sequential and parallel processing.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.380
You can track the state of your workflow and interact with it through an API.

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.160
The key use case for SWF is when you have the human enabled workflows.

7
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.320
For instance the fulfillment systems like I mentioned in the lesson at the beginning of this section.

8
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:48.820
So if you see an exam question that asks for a workflow execution system which requires human interaction

9
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.030
then that might be SWF, for most use cases you're going to look to step functions and especially

10
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.070
if you see those questions that come up and ask you about the visual workflow which is a feature of

11
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.160
step functions.

12
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.530
A few key facts that might be useful for SWF when it comes to the exam.

13
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.620
One is that SWF has a completion time of up to one year for workflow executions.

14
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.140
It also uses a task oriented API and ensures that a task is assigned once and never duplicated.

15
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.830
It also keeps track of all tasks and events in an application it uses domains or the concept of domains

16
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.760
which are logical containers for application resources such as workflows activities and executions the

17
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.000
workers are programmed to interact with SWF, have to get tasks processed, receive tasks and return the

18
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
results and then you have a decider which is a program that controls the coordination of the tasks.

19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.730
In other words they're ordering that concurrency and their scheduling

20
00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.920
so the key components therefore are domains, workflows, activities, task lists, workers, and workflow execution.

21
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.110
Now that's probably about the amount that you need to know for the exam and unfortunately it's not a

22
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.090
very easy service to work with in terms of just showing you an easy demo but you can just have a look

23
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.550
around the console and see what's in there so you got the workflow executions and you can list your

24
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.830
executions.

25
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.350
You've got the workflow types and then hey you can have a look at what's available or register a new

26
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.050
workflow and you then have your activities where again you can register your activities.

27
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.840
So I really don't feel we need to go into much more detail.

28
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.120
The key thing with SWF and Step Functions is just to understand what they are and what the

29
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.230
use cases are.

30
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.020
When would you use one over the other.
