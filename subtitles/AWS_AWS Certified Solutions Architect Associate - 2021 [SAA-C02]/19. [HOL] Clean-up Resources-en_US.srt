00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,560
Hi, guys, just a short lesson to go back in and make sure we clean up all the resources that we launched

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,670
in the section, that might cost us some money back in the easy to management console.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,390
Let's first go down to auto scaling groups or we need to do here is select auto scaling group and delete.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,800
And that's going to be deleted.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,450
Now remember, we do have a launch template, but you don't pay for launch templates, so there's no

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,980
need to actually get rid of that.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,320
We might use it again later on in the course.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,240
And by terminating or deleting the auto scaling group, we should find that these instances had do terminate

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,660
shortly.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,680
We'll come back and check that in a moment.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,850
In the meantime, let's go to load balances.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,350
I've got my load balancer here running my Albi.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,590
We're going to delete the load balancer under target groups.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,320
We have these free target groups.

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,770
Again, these don't cost you any money, so there's no need to delete them and we might well use them

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,130
again.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,250
Make sure you release any elastic IP addresses.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,110
So if you do have some left over from the NHLBI labs, do the release.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,790
Elastic IP addresses action for each of them to make sure that they go from this view.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,030
So let's just come back up now to instances and give this a refresh that's still running.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040
So let's go back down to auto scaling groups and have a look at what's going on now.

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,080
We can see that an action is taking place.

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,210
It says it's deleting.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,050
So if you go to activity and what we have here is a waiting for LP connection draining status, and

25
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:37,110
that means that the auto scanning group is giving a period of time for the elastic load balancer to

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,580
finish off any connections and closed them out before the instance is terminated.

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,840
So that might take a few minutes and then we should see things change.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,610
So let's just keep an eye on this.

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,070
Now you will note in the message here that it's changed the design capacity from two to zero.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,340
So we should see that if we come back up to the details page, we can see that all the capacity configurations

31
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,690
are zeros here.

32
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,260
So the auto scanning group does want to get rid of those instances.

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,300
Let's come back to activity and just wait a few minutes for this to occur.

34
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,850
Now, of course, you could go and manually terminate the instances, but I think it's good when you're

35
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,430
learning to actually watch what happens when you leave it to its own devices with default settings that

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,430
would have taken about five minutes or 300 seconds.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,980
And now that's happened, and I can see this in progress and we're terminating the active instance.

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,280
So if we come back up to instances here, we should see that the instances are being shut down.

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,880
So that should be all of the resources that might cost you money.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,660
Cleaned up.

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,470
And that's it.

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,300
For now, I will see you in the next lesson.
