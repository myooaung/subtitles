00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:09.560
Hi, guys, in this lecture, we're going to talk about a single sign on Ezo AYSO is a relatively new

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.780
service and I believe it's going to start appearing on the exam more this year.

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.160
So I'm in late January now.

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.180
I think in the next couple of months it's going to start appearing a bit more regularly.

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.480
So you might win a few more points by understanding AWB, as I say.

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.160
So before we get started talking about the actual service itself, let's just explore what Esso is all

7
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.570
about.

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:39.230
So the point of single sign on is that you might want to have a single user identity, so an account

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.800
somewhere.

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.930
And through that single user account, you want that user to be able to log on to multiple services.

11
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.850
So that might be multiple accounts.

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.730
It might be, you know, that they need to log on to get Hub and G Suite and Salesforce and so on.

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.180
And you want that to happen seamlessly.

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.140
You don't want them to have multiple accounts in different places and you don't want them to have to

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.880
enter passwords repeatably.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.600
So that's what the point of exercise is and that's what single sign on service for us actually does.

17
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.840
Now, the identity sources can be in AYSO itself, so the user accounts can be created here, or you

18
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.830
can create your user accounts in a source like Active Directory or Girod.

19
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.700
So these are both Microsoft active directories, ones obviously managed on easier ones, actually managed

20
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.850
within your data center on premises most likely, and in both cases yourself, managing in terms of

21
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.530
creating your own users, your own groups and your own policies.

22
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.840
Now, I think most of the time people are going to be using active directory.

23
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.380
A lot of organisations use active directory and those organisations might want to just have their users

24
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.520
created in one place.

25
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
They don't want to have those users having accounts all over the place.

26
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.000
It becomes more complex, governance becomes more difficult, which means security can be a bit more

27
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.020
of an issue as well.

28
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.770
So they prefer the user accounts to be all in one place and they want to enable that so that those users

29
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.510
can then sign into the single sign on service once and access different accounts and access other business

30
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.680
applications as well.

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.280
Now there is quite a big list of built in SASO integrations.

32
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.260
This is just a few of them on the page here.

33
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.300
There's many more I'll show you in the console, but basically this is what it's all about.

34
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.120
So this is what single sign on service does and integrates sort of active directory and integrates with

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.430
services using Samal 2.0.

36
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.500
That's what you would use for Azerrad.

37
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.870
So let's just look at a bit more background.

38
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.010
ASIC makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AYSO accounts and business applications so

39
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.740
that users have a single sign on access to all the assigned accounts and applications from one place

40
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.690
you can easily manage.

41
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.190
So access and user permissions to all of your accounts in organisations centrally and so configures

42
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.850
and maintains all the necessary permissions for your accounts automatically.

43
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.980
So it doesn't require any additional set up within the individual accounts.

44
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.170
You can assign user permissions based on job functions and customize these to meet your specific security

45
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.720
requirements.

46
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.070
So so it's very flexible is up to you to define how your users are able to log on to different services.

47
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.630
Now, there's also those built-In integrations, and that includes things like Salesforce Box and Office

48
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.480
365.

49
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.160
So you can also create and manage those identities within SASO or connect to Active Directory or 088,

50
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.300
as we call it before.

51
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.210
It's also integrated tightly with AYSO organizations, which means you can select one or more accounts

52
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.520
within an organization and grant users access to those accounts.

53
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.210
So it doesn't have to be all accounts.

54
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.300
You can select which ones within the organization and is giving you that central place to manage.

55
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.060
So access for US accounts now, as we said before, it creates its own directory.

56
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.510
So it has its own directory within SSA where you can create users and you can also apply groups within

57
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.470
SSA as well.

58
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.210
Or alternatively, and most likely, you're going to use something like Microsoft Active Directory Domain

59
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.870
Services.

60
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.990
And for Azerrad it's using security assertion and markup language.

61
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.360
So Samal 2.0, that's what you use to connect to as you add.

62
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.230
What I'd like to do now is take you to the management console.

63
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.120
Now, we're not going to build out a configuration.

64
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.780
Clearly, you need third party business applications.

65
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.420
You also need multiple accounts or organizations.

66
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.950
And that's quite a complex.

67
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.800
Difficult for you, difficult for me as well.

68
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.260
But what I do want to do is to show you around the console so you understand it a bit better.

69
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.590
I'm in the management console.

70
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.250
If we go to services, come down to security, identity and compliance and we can find a single sign

71
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.430
on.

72
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.650
Now, if you haven't used it before, you'll see the splash screen and you can enable us AYSO once it's

73
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.640
enabled, you will see this screen and you can go in and choose your identity source and by default,

74
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.350
it's going to be Awassa.

75
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.880
So so their user accounts are going to be created within Awassa.

76
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:23.430
So you can choose change and then you can change the active directory or an external identity provider

77
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.070
using Semmel 2.0.

78
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.500
You'll see that there's also a user portal URL which you can customize.

79
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.820
Let's go back to Dashboard and choose manage.

80
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.160
So access to your accounts.

81
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.840
And we've within here, you can choose an account and then choose assign users and actually assign those

82
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.220
users to the account.

83
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.390
Heading back to the dashboard, you can also manage so access to your cloud applications, so again,

84
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.270
this is using SAML 2.0.

85
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.270
Let's choose add new application and it's going to populate a list of third party integrations which

86
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.340
already exist within Adobe SSA and you'll find is quite a lot.

87
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.260
We can just keep clicking more applications and there's a lot here.

88
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.340
And there's a lot that you recognize, I'm sure.

89
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.100
And you could choose any one of these let's choose confluence, for example, and click at application,

90
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.080
and then you'll see that you get some metadata information here for Samel and you can actually download

91
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.660
this metadata file and then you need to configure some information about your application.

92
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.640
So you need an application.

93
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.020
Samual metadata file.

94
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.190
Now, clearly, we don't have a application that we can integrate right now.

95
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.060
So I'm just going to choose.

96
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.630
Cancel.

97
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.940
And if you go back to applications now, you'll see you've got this confluence, you can easily just

98
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.630
remove that.

99
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.070
And so there's lots and lots more applications there built in integrations.

100
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.650
So you just need to be able to fill out those files, have the right information available, and then

101
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.290
you can connect those applications to Awassa so quite easily.

102
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.440
So that's it for just a quick overview in the console.

103
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.000
And again, I think what we've covered is enough for the exam.

104
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.890
There should be a few questions popping up.

105
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.620
It will just be about understanding what AYSO is and what the likely scenarios are.

106
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.390
So the key scenario for the exam is going to be that a company has their own identity source.

107
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.970
So it's probably going to be active directory and they want to be able to configure some kind of single

108
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.920
sign on to multiple accounts.

109
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.040
How do you do that?

110
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.650
And the answer is going to be Awassa.

111
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:49.650
So now to remove our configuration, you can go to settings, come down here and just choose to delete

112
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.600
Awassa.

113
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.740
So select all of these and then choose, delete.

114
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.940
And that would just put it back to where it was.

115
00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.490
So that's it for this lab.

116
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.800
Guys, I hope you enjoyed it.
