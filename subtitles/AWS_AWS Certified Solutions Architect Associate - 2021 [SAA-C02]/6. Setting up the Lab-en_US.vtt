00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.870
Hi guys.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.580
Over the next several laps we're going to be using some resources split geographically to test the different

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.010
types of routing policies that we have in round 53.

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.030
So what I want to do in this lab is just set up that infrastructure.

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.580
So first off I want to launch two instances into my local region which is Sydney

6
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.790
and what I want to do is I'm going to put both of these in my custom BPC one of them is going to go

7
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:45.080
public to a I'm going to use an I am role and we're going to play some code in the user data.

8
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.670
Now this is slightly different to the user data we were using in the previous section but what it does

9
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.620
still rely on having this index stop 60 file on S3.

10
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.830
So hopefully you've uploaded that and the difference with this one is we create a variable which is

11
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.220
populated using the instance metadata and it's basically going to pull the availability zone that the

12
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.410
server is in and then it's going to write it into that index not hasty email file.

13
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.590
So I'm just going to copy this code and put this into advance details.

14
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:31.140
And so just make sure that you have your IAM role specified and let's move on and we can go to security

15
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.690
groups Web Access Review and launch and launch and then I'm just going to do the same thing except this

16
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.650
time I'm going to put the second instance into a different availability zone.

17
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.420
So I'm going to choose my VPC and I'm going to put this one it's a public to be and again I need my

18
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.670
I am role paste in the instance metadata user data excuse me.

19
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.950
And then we move on and choose web access security great.

20
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.350
And just launch and now I'm going to create a life balancer so we're just going to create a simple application

21
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.260
load balancer.

22
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.470
Can I just call it my Alby.

23
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.470
It's going to listen on port 80.

24
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.350
I need to put it in the BBC here.

25
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.280
So I've chosen my VPC and I'm going to put it in the public to a and public to be

26
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.730
and we just choose web access and then that's for the target group.

27
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.380
It's just TFG one we're going to leave all the defaults sir except we're going to change the healthy

28
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.670
threshold too.

29
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.810
And then we can go in and register our targets and we've got those two instances

30
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.200
so that's it.

31
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.210
Create that load balancer and now I'm going to change regions.

32
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.280
So what I want to do is change over to

33
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.460
U.S. East North Virginia 1st.

34
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.100
And here we're just going to create an instance and we're going to put it into a public subnet.

35
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.190
So let's just go through the wizard a little bit slower for me now.

36
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.940
And we only have one BPC here and it's gonna go into another availability zone with also assigned public

37
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.980
IP sets a yes.

38
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.430
So that's great.

39
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.480
I can see my I am role of course because I am is a global service.

40
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:51.040
And I'll also be able to put my user data into the user data section.

41
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.550
So let's go forwards now we won't have a security group here so I'm just going to create a new one.

42
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.150
And I just like to use my default web access as the name.

43
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.000
And we need port 80.

44
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.830
So just find hasty T.P.

45
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.340
from any source and launch

46
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.780
and if you haven't got to keep em.

47
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.500
Just try to keep her there.

48
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.050
So I'm back in the Sydney region now looking at my low balances.

49
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.600
Now I actually had some problems launching instances in Europe for some reason.

50
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.050
So what I ended up having to do was launch my third instance into Singapore.

51
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.860
So this is what I've actually got now I've got an instance in Singapore which is A.P. se one and this

52
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.680
is it's public IP address and then I've got one in north Virginia and record its address and then for

53
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.140
the instances behind a low balance.

54
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.410
So we have our DNS name.

55
00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.390
So just to show you what this looks like now is the user data that we put in just returns the you know

56
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.910
this simple text and this simple screen but it just tells us which availability zone this instance is

57
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.100
in.

58
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.730
So this one's in AP SD to be.

59
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.140
Now these are behind a load balancer.

60
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.590
So if I refresh I now get AP SD to a.

61
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.210
So that shows that the low balance was working and we've got our instances and two different availability

62
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.140
zones.

63
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.880
So that's it for this.

64
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.580
Now just make sure you record your addresses somewhere so it's easy to just access those when you need

65
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.280
them.

66
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.050
And in the next few labs we're going to start going over some of the routing policies.
