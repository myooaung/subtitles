Hi guys.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,850
This is a relatively short lap to cover transit gateways so we've got a slide up here which is from

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,290
the previous lab where we're talking about VPC pairing.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,700
And you'll remember that pairing connections are one to one relationships between pieces.

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:28,430
So in this case where we have free VPC is we actually have to have a pairing connection between each

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,540
VPC.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,320
So here we've got a VPC or between each VPC pair.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,550
So the top left and the bottom have to have a VPC pairing connection the top two have to have one and

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,760
the top right in the bottom VPC you need to have a connection so to connect these VPC you need free

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,440
VPC parent connections.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,340
So obviously this can get quite complicated and cumbersome when you have a lot of these pieces.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,510
And that's where transit Gateway comes in.

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:04,010
So I've just got the IWM transit Gateway web page open here and it just tells us that transit Gateway

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,560
is a service that enables customers to connect VPC pieces and on premises networks to a single gateway.

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,630
So that's the key thing.

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,470
It's not just about BPC but it's also about on premise networks

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,350
and it goes on to say we're very WS transit Gateway you only have to create and manage a single connection

18
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:31,090
from the central gateway into each VPC on premises datacenter or remote office across your network.

19
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,970
So it acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among the networks which acolytes spike.

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,430
So it's a hub and spoke topology now if we just go down the page here we've got this kind of before

21
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,370
and after image where without transit gateway on the left here and we can see just what we had in that

22
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:56,230
slide we've got a VPC here one here and here and here and to connect all those four together you have

23
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,820
to have all these different peering connections and then you've got a VPN connection from a customer

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,520
Gateway which is a VPN connection from a customer site.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,770
And on premise network and so on and so that that's already looking quite complicated and that's only

26
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,170
a few pieces in a couple of office connections.

27
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,880
So on the right hand side here we've got the transit Gateway and it acts as the hub and then you have

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,900
the spokes which are direct connect gateways and VPC and VPN connections so you can interconnect all

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:36,140
of these things with transit gateway in the middle so really it's quite a new service.

30
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:44,470
It was released around November 18 and it takes about six months for new releases to actually make it

31
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,540
on to the exam.

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:53,200
So we should I mean June late June now so I'm expecting to see some questions popping up now if not

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,090
in the near future on transit gateway.

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,230
Now let's just head over to the console and you can find it in the VPC dashboard.

35
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,960
Head to the bottom.

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,810
You've got transit gateways and you can select create transit gateway.

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:19,290
Now another right one now because it does require some things like a BGP ISDN which I don't have and

38
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,540
so I'm just going to sort of show you through the console here What what where to find this information

39
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,590
so you can come in here and this is where you create a transit Gateway.

40
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,690
You then have transit Gateway attachments.

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,960
So this is how you connect to your hub your transit Gateway hub.

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,870
And then there are round tables which are curated so you can always go up and hit the question mark

43
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,050
to get more information.

44
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,130
And this there's lots of stuff on the obvious Web site.

45
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,180
So have a look over the FAA queues.

46
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:59,420
Have a look over the about pages here and just try and understand what the use cases are for transit

47
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,800
gateway.
