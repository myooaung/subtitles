1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,620
So in this lab we're going to cover identity based policies and we're going to focus on user policies

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,420
and policies that are applied to groups.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,600
We're also going to have an example of a bucket policy in this lab.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,530
So let's head over to the console.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,650
Now I quickly want to show you this article and I'll provide a link in the course downloads.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,140
This gives you some instructions on how to do a very similar scenario to what we're actually gonna go

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,830
through now and use some of the code snippets from this web page

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:42,060
so heading into the IAM management console I created a couple of users Paul and Sam and if we head over

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,690
to groups we've got the developers group.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,070
And as you can see back on the user's page Paul is a member of the developers group.

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,430
I've created a bucket called DCT company and within DCT company we have a couple of folders to organize

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,620
some objects.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,440
You can see a file which is up on the root of the bucket.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:12,890
And then within each of these folders you'll also find a file.

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:21,070
So this is the set up we're going to use to show how we can use policies to restrict and provide access

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,430
to users.

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,620
So the first we're going to do.

18
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:32,860
I have some code here in text Wrangler and I'm going to copy this first piece of code and we're going

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:42,200
to come back to IAM and I'm going to go to policies create policy and we're going to choose JSON and

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,050
we're going to override this JSON here and we don't need to make any changes to this code.

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:56,140
What this will do is will allow the list or my bucket's privilege on any resource in S3 on this

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,590
account.

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:04,290
So this is a wildcard within S3 so we can click review policy and we need to give it a name

24
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,850
and we're going to call it allow LIST BUCKET.

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,520
Now we can click Create policy

26
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:22,130
we then kind of go to our group access the developers group and go to permissions and we can attach

27
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,710
a policy and I'm just going to start typing and there's our policy.

28
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,350
And so what we're going to do now is head over to a private window and I have Paul logged in.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,660
Now Paul doesn't have any other privileges so he shouldn't be able to see anything in S3 but let's go

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:45,470
there now and what we should find is that he's able to list the buckets in the account and sure enough

31
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,660
we can see the buckets.

32
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,220
We can't see the file because the privilege which we provided only gives access to list the buckets

33
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,830
not any objects within the bucket.

34
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,560
So what I want to do now is provide this use of the additional capability to be able to view objects

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,930
within the roots of the bucket.

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,570
So coming back to I am I'm gonna head over and get my next piece of code

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,210
and we're going to go back into this policy allow this bucket and click on edit and JSON and I'm going

38
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,930
to remove this code and replace it with this piece of code.

39
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:35,190
Now what we need to do is replace the resource here with the correct ARN for our bucket.

40
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:42,130
So if we just go into S3 check the box next to our bucket and we can now copy the bucket either

41
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,660
and so I've copied that.

42
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,100
So the clipboard and if I come back here I can paste it in.

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,030
Now I've done this for all the other codes so we won't need to do it again.

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,930
But I wanted to show you where that's done we can now click on review policy

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,230
and save changes

46
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,040
now just to understand this code.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,190
What this does is we have the resource still set to the bucket name but we now have a condition which

48
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,790
also allows us to access the prefixes and delimiters and a prefix would be a folder within the bucket

49
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:32,060
and the delimiter is the slash which allows access to objects beneath the root of the bucket.

50
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,300
So let's head back over to the private window and let's hit refresh

51
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,120
and we're not able to see any changes.

52
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,230
So let's just log out

53
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,690
and log Paul back in again.

54
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,440
So we'll log back in as Paul.

55
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,030
Let's head back to history.

56
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,480
So now I can say that not only can we see the photos but we can see this file object in the root of

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,960
the bucket

58
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,770
if we try to open one of these folders.

59
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,810
We'll find we get an Access Denied message because so far we've only allowed the list buckets and we've

60
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,630
now allowed objects within the bucket as well.

61
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,640
The same with the Department photo.

62
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,210
So what we want to do next is we're going to head over and get this next piece of code which is going

63
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:34,080
to allow our user to view the department folder contents and we're going to flip back to where I'm logged

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,650
in with my administrative account head to users.

65
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,900
And we're going to attach this one directly to Paul.

66
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:48,840
So in this case we're going to add an inline policy we click review we choose JSON we delete these

67
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,460
contents and then we paste this in.

68
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,420
Now what we need to do again is to change the IRS and here to the IRS about bucket

69
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:14,350
and then we need to change the folder name to department and we can click review policy.

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,530
We have to give it a name.

71
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,910
I'm just gonna call it allow department folder

72
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:30,380
and then we click Create policy so let's head back to our private window with Paul logged in and try

73
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,460
to access the department folder and let's just give it a refresh.

74
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,670
And sometimes this will work.

75
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,750
Sometimes we'll have to log back out back in again.

76
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,520
So I've looked pulled back in again.

77
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,020
Let's head into history.

78
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,540
We're going to go into our bucket and we're going to choose the department folder.

79
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,930
And so now we can see the contents of this bucket.

80
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:58,510
So let's try and download one of these files and I click on download I get an access is denied and let's

81
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,050
go back and try and upload a file.

82
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:11,100
So I'm just going to choose any file from my drive and click upload and we can see the file uploading

83
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,710
and then we'll get an error and we can view the details of the error as options request denied.

84
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,010
So we now want to give some additional permissions to this user so that the user can upload and download

85
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,580
objects.

86
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:33,950
So get and put objects so we're going to come back to our code and choose the next snippet and I'm going

87
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:41,910
to copy this back change to my minister to change to my administrative window and I'm going to go back

88
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,410
into this inline policy

89
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,980
click on edit policy Jason again and again and we're going to completely override this.

90
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,790
Let's just delete that code and place this back in.

91
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,100
Now in this case I've already updated the code.

92
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,170
So we already have the I ran for the bucket.

93
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,280
However it looks like I do need to copy it down here as well

94
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,130
so we have our eye around for a bucket.

95
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,600
We've got the Department folders set here.

96
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,990
And here we have the IRS for the bucket slash department slash staff.

97
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:24,520
So this should allow us to get objects and put objects in other words download and upload objects into

98
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,990
the department folder

99
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,420
so we click save changes and let's flip back to Paul's console.

100
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,720
And again we're going to log Paul out and back in again.

101
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,150
So we'll look back in as Paul and we're going to head back into S3

102
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,670
we're going to choose DCT company and department and so we can see the files but let's try and download

103
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,520
those one of these files.

104
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,760
So then a click download and sure enough it pops up on another screen.

105
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,090
That's the file which I wanted to download.

106
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,410
And now let's try and upload a file

107
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:14,140
and I'm just going to choose one of these text documents and click upload and strangely it's saying

108
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,040
I've got an actually I can see that the file is uploaded and here it is

109
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,200
so we're now able to get and put objects into this bucket.

110
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,330
But if we go up a level we still can't get into the confidential bucket.

111
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:39,060
And what I'm going to do now is a match going to let it create a bucket policy which allows us to act

112
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,950
to access this confidential folder.

113
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,550
So let's go a bucket policy

114
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,560
and let's grab this snippet of code and place this in.

115
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,270
Now what this does is it specifically calls out the ARN of Paul.

116
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:06,920
So this this applies to Paul only it allows Paul any action on the resource DCT company with the prefix

117
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,930
confidential slash star.

118
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:16,220
So in other words Paul gets it explicitly allowed to do any action he wants on the confidential folder

119
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,890
and its contents.

120
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:27,360
So let's click save and we're going to head back and click on refresh and sure enough straight away

121
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:35,350
we can see the confidential information in this bucket what I want to do now is show you how we can

122
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,170
explicitly deny access to the confidential folder.

123
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,930
In other words we're going to override the bucket policy.

124
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,250
So to do that I'm going to come back and I have a bit of a longer piece of code here.

125
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,300
But what this does is it's going to allow us access to the Department folder whilst explicitly denying

126
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,100
access to the confidential folder.

127
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:08,890
So let's come back to I am and we're going to apply this to our user Paul by overriding this JSON code

128
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,190
here

129
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:21,560
and it's click review policy and save changes and we can just quickly look at this code.

130
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:31,190
We have the allow permission on the bucket route and the string for that apartment folder slash star

131
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,860
and then we allow gets and puts object to the Department folder and then we have a explicitly deny any

132
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:49,890
requests statement which says let's bucket deny and we apply it to anything that isn't department.

133
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,240
So we don't explicitly state the confidential folder but we say that this user cannot access anything

134
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,570
other than the department folder so we've applied that.

135
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,260
Let's come back and click on confidential.

136
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,610
Now we've already seen this before so it actually shows the listed object but we also get the access

137
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:16,850
the night message so we can tell that this policy has taken effect so that's it for this exercise.

138
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:25,160
And if you want to remove the configuration you can simply go in and delete the policy that's attached

139
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,610
to Paul

140
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:41,590
can go into policies search for the policy that we created and delete and then the only other thing

141
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:50,060
you need to do is come back to the bucket access the bucket go to permissions bucket policy and you

142
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,140
can just click on delete

143
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,240
and that's it for this lab.

144
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,150
Hope you had some fun.

145
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,480
It's quite a complicated subject but worth going through a few practices and just getting yourself completely

146
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,270
comfortable with these techniques of applying policies that the bucket level as well as at the resource

147
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,600
level.
