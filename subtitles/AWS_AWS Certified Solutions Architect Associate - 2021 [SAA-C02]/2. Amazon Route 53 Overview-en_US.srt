00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,950
In this lab we're going to cover a quick overview of Route 53.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,820
So you've already had some exposure to Route 53 throughout this course and you may even have registered

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,370
your own domain at the beginning.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,090
But if not that's okay.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,440
We're gonna go over each of the key areas of Route 53 in this lab.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,850
So Route 53 has a few key capabilities.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,860
One is domain registration so you can go and register a domain name using many different domain suffixes

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:38,030
such as dot net dot com dot org dot dot uk there's a huge list so you can come on search for your domain

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,930
name and if it's not taken you can register. What will then happen is a hosted zone gets created for

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,890
your domain.

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,620
Now you know that could be a public domain or you can create a private hosting zone and we're gonna

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,050
go over there shortly.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,780
So private hosted zone would be for instances to resolve within a VPC so it can be pretty much any

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,590
domain name you want because it's not going to be publicly registered.

15
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:11,000
So hosted zones are collections of records for one of these domain names and you can then add your own

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,460
records and we're going to go over all the different record types and show how they work in labs for

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,110
this section.

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,550
So another thing Route 53 can do is health checks.

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:31,310
So it has the capability to check your instances but also your load balancers and you can even create

20
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,890
health checks for resources outside of AWS.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,420
So you can for instance have your web servers that are listening on port 80 and you can send health

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,140
checks to them on port 80.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,620
You can do the same for your on premise servers if they're publicly accessible and you can do the same

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,200
for load balancers.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,670
And the result of those health checks can then determine the DNS responses that you get from Route

26
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,390
53

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,240
So Route 53 principally is a DNS service.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,020
So what you're doing is you're looking for the IP address that's associated with a domain name.

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:16,900
It's then going out and checking the health of your servers your web servers and responding and saying

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,930
all right if that's healthy then I'm going to give you a certain IP address.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,880
But if this instance has become unhealthy I'm going to give you a different one. We then have traffic

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,180
flow which is a relatively new service.

33
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,930
It's been around for a little while now but it's relatively new and what it does we'll talk a lot more

34
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:40,070
about the different types of records that you can create in Route 53 shortly and we'll cover this

35
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,800
traffic flow towards the end of the section because basically you can then take the different types

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,710
of record sets that you use you can create some logic that creates a flow.

37
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:59,950
So it's a logical flow to to work out  which responses to provide to your clients.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,590
So that's a simple high level overview.

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,430
Let's just go to the console and have a look at this.

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,090
So this is the route 53 dashboard.

41
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,890
We've got the DNS management here and I've got one hosted zone which is dctlabs.com which we registered

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,320
in an earlier section.

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,900
You can then create your traffic management policies here.

44
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,170
You can create your health checks through availability monitoring and you can register domains here

45
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,420
through domain registration.

46
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,160
So that's it for this and I just wanted to give you a really quick overview.

47
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,020
We're now going to talk about hosted zones in the next lab.
