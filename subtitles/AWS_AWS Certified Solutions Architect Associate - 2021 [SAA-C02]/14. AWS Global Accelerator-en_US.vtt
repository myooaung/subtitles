Hi, guys, and welcome to another lesson and this lesson I'm going to discuss IWC global accelerator

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:20.300
global accelerator OGI is a networking service that allows you to utilise the IWC global network to

3
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.340
send data to your applications.

4
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.460
Now, using IWC as network means you're avoiding the internet for a large part of the data transfer,

5
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.060
and that means that you get better bandwidth and latency and a lot of consistency, much more consistency

6
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.920
than you would get on the public incident.

7
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.620
So let's have a look at the architecture.

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.100
Let's say we have an application running in UX one and another one in AP Southeast, too.

9
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.650
Now it's the same application and it's running behind an application load balancer in both regions.

10
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.640
And what we want to do is direct our users to the region that's closest to them, and that is healthy

11
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.000
as well.

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.140
That's actually operating.

13
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.920
So let's say we have some users in United States.

14
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.220
In this case, we're using Amazon Route 50 free with an alias record that points to global accelerators

15
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.270
endpoints, so the users will resolve in this case, DCT labs dot com, and they get an answer.

16
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.580
Now that answer includes two static any cost IP addresses.

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.130
Now, by the way, just as a little aside, you need to understand that when you use an alias record

18
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.320
with Route 53, what you're doing is you're mapping your domain name like DCC Labs dot com to the domain

19
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.170
name of the global accelerator endpoint.

20
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.650
In the case of a load balancer, it would be the low Palance DNS name.

21
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.640
What then happens is you need to resolve the DNS name of global accelerator to its IP addresses.

22
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.450
And in this case, you get these two static IP addresses.

23
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.480
So that means you can whitelist these in your firewalls.

24
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.960
Now, these two IP addresses will both lead to your application wherever the application is, so you

25
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.810
can have your application in several regions around the world, and you'll still only ever use these

26
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.690
two IP addresses to connect to those endpoints.

27
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.230
So it's not one of these per each region, it's actually either of these IP addresses will actually

28
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.980
take you to any region that's active, but you'll be directed to the region it's closest to you, or

29
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.150
you can assign weightings.

30
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.210
So what happens after you've got the resolution?

31
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.210
You've got the IP address and you're now directed to the closest edge location to you.

32
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.270
So these users are in the United States, so there'll be a cloud front edge location near to them,

33
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.660
and actual location is not an IWC data center.

34
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.770
There's lots of edge locations around, and they host some resources for IWC, including Cloud Front,

35
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.630
which is a content delivery network.

36
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.330
So what happens is you connect to the edge location that's closest to where you are and then you use

37
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.160
the IWC global network to actually connect to the application endpoints, and those can be in multiple

38
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.730
regions.

39
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.830
So again, you're using these static any cost IP addresses to connect to multiple regions and you get

40
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.110
directed based on where you are.

41
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.840
So in this case, the traffic will traverse the global network, but the users will actually be directed

42
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.010
to US East one.

43
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.490
So just to help you understand as further, the users are somewhere in the U.S., let's say that somewhere

44
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.570
near New York.

45
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.600
And they're going to get directed to an edge location is very close so that they do have to use the

46
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.800
internet, but they don't have to go very far on the internet to get to the edge location.

47
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.830
So that minimizes the chances of licensing from the point that the traffic hits the edge location.

48
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.850
It's on the IWC global network all the way through to the application.

49
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.630
And that means consistent licensee and good bandwidth, so you can definitely optimize your connection.

50
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.620
If the U.S. East one side fails, the requests are then routed to another endpoint.

51
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.310
So in this case, they get routed to AP selfies, too.

52
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.680
Now, AP selfies, too, is a long way away.

53
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.750
But because we're using the global network, we're not going to get anywhere near the latency issues

54
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.300
we might experience if we tried to get from over here in the U.S. all the way to Australia.

55
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.990
So Global Accelerator is all about optimizing network performance to your applications, directing you

56
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.560
to the closest regions, or you can manipulate that by specifying weightings to direct traffic to the

57
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.760
regions of your choice.

58
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.650
So that's it for the ferry.

59
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.810
And what I'm going to do in the next lesson is we're going to create a global accelerator and we're

60
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.310
going to see how it works in action.
