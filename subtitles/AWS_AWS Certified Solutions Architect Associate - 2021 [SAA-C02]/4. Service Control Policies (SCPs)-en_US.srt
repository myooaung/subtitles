1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,800
Service control policies or steps are a way that we can control using chase on policies, the permissions

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,990
that are available in an account.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,330
So let's have a look at how this works.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,070
We have our IWC organization, we have a management account and that's under the roots of the organization.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,770
You can apply a policy here.

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,910
And by default, there's a policy here, which is an ACP, and it has this statement which essentially

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,010
says effectors allow action star resource stock and those are wildcards.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:48,200
So what this does is it allows any action on any resource, so steps will control the maximum available

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,680
permissions.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,180
They don't grant you permissions.

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,960
You need to have permissions assigned to you through IAM.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,770
But what this will do is limit what's available now in this case.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,580
This ACP allows all action, so it's not limiting anything.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,000
Users in the management account are not restricted.

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,630
So these policies are not applying to the management account, but we can apply them to organizational

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,110
units and then accounts underneath the management account.

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,420
Now here we've got a TAC policy.

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,650
This enforces TAC standardization and then on the right hand side, here we've got another O.U and we

19
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,000
have a development accounts in it.

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,740
And here we have another you underneath the Devah use of a forming a hierarchy with children underneath

21
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,550
children.

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,850
And we have a production account attached to that O.U and we can apply service control policies.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:50,680
Now this service control policy essentially denies the easy to run instances API action, for any instance.

24
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:57,380
So the resources just EC2 instance, start with a condition, and the condition says that the string

25
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,990
does not equal to Mike, right?

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:08,720
So what this is saying is it's denying the ability to launch an easy to instance unless the two instance

27
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,040
is a T2 micro.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,250
So you can only launch T2 micro instances.

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,990
So deaf users can only launch a T2 micro now because of the effects of policies in that they actually

30
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,650
flow down to child organizational units.

31
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:33,620
The production users also cannot launch any instance other than T2 Micro because it's been denied an

32
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,600
MCP at a higher level.

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,880
So these permissions will flow down through that hierarchy and apply to any accounts underneath.

34
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,950
A really important thing to remember is that steps do not grant permissions.

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,250
They limit the maximum available permissions.

36
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,430
So, for example, if you're your user in this development account, you do have or you're not constrained

37
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:02,060
through the step from launching to micros, you can launch a T2 micro, but you do need to have the

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,330
I Am permissions for easy to to be able to do that.

39
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,270
So what you need to understand is first, you need to grant people permissions and then you can control

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,490
the permissions that are available in an account.

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,350
Now these constraints will apply to everybody, including administrators.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,030
So if you're an admin in the developer account, you have full U.S. access.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,860
You still won't be able to launch anything but T2 Micro SD two instances.

44
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,210
So that's the ferry.

45
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:34,820
In the next lesson, we'll do a hands on and test applying an Sep policy to our production account.
