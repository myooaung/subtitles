00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.180
Hello and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.070
The first thing I'd like to say is congratulations on being here and investing in yourself.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.490
Now this course and all of the associated resources we've put together are designed to ensure you have

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.150
the best chance to pass your exam, no matter what your background.

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.520
Everyone can pass this exam with the right resources and the right approach to study.

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.170
So how do you go about using all of these resources to your best advantage?

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.810
Firstly, I'd like to point you towards the course download lesson, which is the last lesson in this

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.350
section.

9
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.530
In that lesson, you'll find a link to our website.

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.900
From that page, you'll be able to download the code that you need for the hands on lessons in this

11
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.380
course.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.680
You'll also find a study guide which can give you a very good idea of how to approach study.

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.800
Now it is a guideline, really.

14
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.670
You can follow it to the letter if you like, or you might sort of tailor it to your own needs, depending

15
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.060
on how much time you have each day to allocate to study.

16
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.120
You'll also find the slides from the course, which you can download and peruse at your leisure offline.

17
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.700
There are two types of lesson in this course.

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.740
The first is the ferry lessons.

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.800
Now in those, I try to keep things as visual as possible with lots of animated diagrams to help you

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.270
to understand the concepts.

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.150
Then we go into hands on lessons.

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.280
You'll identify those because the name of the lesson has A. Well, at the beginning.

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.480
Hands on lessons are where you have an opportunity to go into the IWC console in your own free tier

24
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.240
account and follow along with what I do so that you can learn some really valuable hands on skills.

25
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.720
At the end of each section, you'll find a couple of additional lessons.

26
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.090
One is the architecture patterns.

27
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.510
What I do in those lessons is I try to introduce you to a way of taking the knowledge you've just learned

28
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.060
and putting it into the types of scenarios that you find in the workplace and also on the exam.

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.670
So it's about understanding particular problems that companies are trying to solve with the technologies

30
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.960
you've just learned about.

31
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.740
I go through some example requirements and the best solutions for them.

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.350
Then I have the exam crams.

33
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.950
Exam crimes are a really fast paced way of going through essentially a list of bullet points key facts

34
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.930
that you just need to understand for the exam.

35
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.180
Now that's good for last minute revision.

36
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.790
After you've been through the section, you've understood the fairy you've practiced hands on, and

37
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.420
now you just want to go through very quickly and get to the core facts.

38
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.390
At the end of each section, you'll also find a quiz.

39
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.260
The quiz will test your understanding of the knowledge you've just learned.

40
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.930
Quizzes are not meant to reflect the style of the exam questions those can be found in our practice

41
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.320
tests.

42
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.840
Now, I do highly recommend that you use our full practice test course to make sure that you've got

43
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.870
a broad understanding of the types of questions that come up and really hone your skills on problem

44
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.300
solving and coming up with the best solutions.

45
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.180
Quick tip If at any point in the course you find that I'm going too fast or too slow for you, you can

46
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.770
always change the playback speed.

47
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.630
And there are also subtitles which you can enable or disable at any time.

48
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.160
If you want to read along as well, the last thing I want to mention is our cheat sheets.

49
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.740
You'll find links at the end of each section.

50
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.710
Now they are a list of the core knowledge that often comes up in the exams that are a good way of quickly

51
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.180
getting to the knowledge you need without getting bogged down in all the hundreds of pages you'll find

52
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.080
on RWC.

53
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.110
So hopefully they're a really useful resource for you too.

54
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.320
So those are all the resources available to you now.

55
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.230
I do highly recommend that you follow through the course in order I do build on concepts and we work

56
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.890
through labs and use things that we've created in previous sections.

57
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.720
So it's really much better if you follow through the course in order and don't skip any lessons.

58
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.640
So that's it.

59
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.510
As I mentioned, there's a lot of resources here and absolutely everything you need to pass the exam.

60
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.450
So I hope you enjoyed the course and I'll see you in the next lesson.
