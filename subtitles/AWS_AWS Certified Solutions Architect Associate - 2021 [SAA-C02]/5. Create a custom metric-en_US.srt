00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,090
Hi, guys, this lesson is going to be a hands on lab, where I'm going to show you how to create and

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,810
publish custom metrics from an easy to Linux instance.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,970
Now, I'm going to be following Loosley with this article here, so I'll provide this in the course

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,530
download.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,270
And by all means, you can follow this article if you want a bit more detail, because this has a few

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,150
different metrics that it's actually going to publish.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,200
Whereas what I'm going to do just to simplify things is just use memory.

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,330
Now, why have I chosen memory?

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,260
Because memory comes up on the exam quite a lot.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,840
And the reason is because when associated with Cloud watch, what you'll find is that memory is something

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,950
which is not recorded by default using cloud watch.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,440
Now, let me just go back over to somewhere.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,220
I've actually got a bunch of metrics, so let's go to the Sydney region.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,850
And if I go to metrics and if I choose to, per instance, and then I'm just going to copy one of these

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,140
instant sightings just to bring down the lists, I'm going to filter the list.

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,980
So we just see one instance and you can see there are 17 metrics.

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,920
That's the default and none of those are related to memory.

18
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,410
So if you look on the right here, there's none that are related to memory.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,180
A CPA, we got desk, we've got network and so on.

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,710
But there's no memory metrics.

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,750
And that is something that's been coming up on exam questions and different certifications for quite

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,100
a while.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,610
So they still get thrown in every now and then.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,360
Now, I'm going to go back to you southwest Oregon, because this is a bit of a blank slate.

25
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,280
So I don't have metrics here.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,490
If you have a look on the metrics and go to it's clear those filters, I've only got one metric.

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,910
So there's nothing going on here.

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,300
So the first thing I need to do is go to two and we're going to launch an instance.

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,490
It's going to be Lennix two.

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,060
Am I?

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,250
It's going to be a T2 micro.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
All of this can be defaults.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,350
We just need to put it into a security group for S.H. So I've got my Web access reports.

34
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,750
We need to open to any source, address this change, review and launch and launch.

35
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,970
And that's on its way.

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,950
Now, you'll find in the course download that you've got this mentor, S.H. Shell script and it's under

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,910
code cloud.

38
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,320
Watch Memmel S.H..

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,060
And what we're going to do is we're going to use the first two lines here.

40
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,440
But the first thing we need to do before we can use the script is change the instance side here.

41
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,180
So make sure you delete the instant.

42
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:35,090
Let's come back, find our instance and I'm going to copy the instance ID here and then just paste that

43
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,280
in.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,930
So the next thing we need to do is copy our public IP.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,840
Just going to check what my keeper is called.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,450
So that's dash copy.

47
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,200
So I'm on the command line now.

48
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,810
I'm going to tie S.H. Dash.

49
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:56,480
I put in Oregon Das Kapital primness my keeper and then easy to dash user adds and then the IP address

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,160
and that should be running now.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,740
So let's hit enter and type.

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,310
Yes.

53
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,520
And now we're on our new Easy two instance.

54
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,370
So what I need to do first is I'm going to create a file called Memmel S.H. and we're going to go back

55
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,600
and we're going to copy these first two lines here and we'll paste that in.

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,170
And then I'm going to save this file.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,170
Now we need to have permissions for the Shell script to actually publish data to cloud watch.

58
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,350
And for that, I'm going to go back over to the console and we're going to head over to Iame and I'm

59
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,640
going to head down to roles and search for cloud watch.

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,630
Now, I actually have a role, so I've got one called Cloud Watch Agent several.

61
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:45,650
So if you just create a role, choose EC2 as a trust type and then for permissions, what you'll find

62
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,140
is this cloud watch agent server policy and that policy gives us the actions we need.

63
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,270
So we've got the metadata action and there's got some other ones around logging and describing volumes

64
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,810
and tags.

65
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,440
So I already have that policy.

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:07,760
So I'm going to head back to to choose instant settings here, attach, replace Iam role and then choose

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,300
my cloud.

68
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,660
Watch Agent Severo and Head apply.

69
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,690
So we've now got our roles, so we should have permissions, what I need to do now is I want to test

70
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:27,010
my script and to do so I first need to run it plus X to give execute permissions to the file.

71
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:34,190
So Ashmont plus X, Mendoza, which we now should be able to run Mandorah S.H..

72
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,980
So let's see what happens now.

73
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,740
We get a message saying that we need to specify a region.

74
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,390
Now I know that the command line we're using doesn't accept a region variable.

75
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,330
So instead what we can do is just type Athabascan figure.

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:58,150
We won't put it in an Axis Kiddi or secret axis K and we'll just type us W two for the region name and

77
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,860
just put in whatever your region is.

78
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,230
And then I'm going to hit enter a couple of times.

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,050
Now let's try and run this command.

80
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,830
So appearance and appears to have run.

81
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,200
Now if we head back to cloud watch, let's have a look at what metrics are already there.

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,200
So back in cloud watch.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,530
We have one metric, but let's refresh this page.

84
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,390
And if that doesn't work, refreshed the entire page.

85
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,400
So just refresh your browser window and then sometimes that makes the difference.

86
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,740
So now let's go back to all metrics and we can see that we've got the standard metrics.

87
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,300
So we've got the EBC two metrics and some usage metrics and then we've got a custom metrics.

88
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,790
If we go in here, we can see that we actually have our custom metric.

89
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,170
So that's how we create a custom metric.

90
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,980
Now, if you want to take it a bit further, the next thing we can do is in this file we can run this

91
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,490
command.

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,520
So we're going to try to crosstab so that it runs on a schedule.

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,020
So just copy from the start until the end of the script.

94
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:07,570
Now, then a copy that come back to the command line and we'll type crosstab Dashi hit ensa paste in

95
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,890
and then type Kolon WQ.

96
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,590
So in the bottom corner there you can see Kolon WQ and that will save the file and then it should stay

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,140
say installing new crosstab.

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,410
And that means that the crosstab is going to cause the Shell script to run on the schedule that we just

99
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:26,920
defined.

100
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,850
Now another thing I want to do is actually install the stress utility.

101
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,810
So I'm going to copy this command, post this command in and hit Enza and that should install these

102
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,410
libraries.

103
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,820
And then let's come back and install the stress dash and G utility.

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,570
So I'm going to pass that command in and that should install and then I'm going to run this command.

105
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,330
So I'm going to take all of this code here.

106
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Copy that in.

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,500
And then once this is finished installing, we can just put that into the command line and run the stress

108
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,070
utility.

109
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,030
So I'm going to answer I missed the V on the end there and then head enter.

110
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:12,530
And so that's going to start a series of these VMS with a certain amount of CPU and memory utilization.

111
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,300
So what you can do now is just watch what happens in cloud watch.

112
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:23,530
So over a period of time, we should see some more statistics coming in from memory usage in the graph

113
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,240
at the top here.

114
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,940
So that could take a few minutes before you start seeing some good data.

115
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,920
So just go and have a cup of tea or something like that and then come back and have a look at your graph

116
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,850
in a few minutes time.

117
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,060
I've waited a few minutes and now I've got a bit of data.

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,640
And you can change the resolution, by the way, under period here.

119
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,110
So if I change that to one minute, then we'll see a bit of a line here.

120
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,380
So it goes up, it peaks, and then it drops down and kind of stabilizes.

121
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,900
And you can see the increments here.

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,290
So you can see where the data points were actually received.

123
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,520
So that's all I wanted to do in this lesson.

124
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,010
And what I'm going to do, I'm going to leave this running.

125
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,410
And in the next lesson, we're actually going to create an alarm and try and trigger that alarm.
