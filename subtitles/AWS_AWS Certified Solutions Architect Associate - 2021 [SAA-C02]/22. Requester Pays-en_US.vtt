00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.450
Another feature of Amazon S3 is the requester pays.

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.800
And we're going to go into the properties of a bucket and have a look at this.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.810
So requester pays means that the requester.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.390
In other words whoever is trying to access the data will pay for the requests and the data transfer

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.590
charges.

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.040
So it doesn't mean that they pay for storage.

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:34.320
The bucket owner always pays for storage but it means that they will pay for any of those data transfer

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.810
charges and request charges.

9
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.260
So we can just click on Learn more here when you configure request to pays the bucket owner still pays

10
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.060
the storage cost.

11
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.470
As I mentioned before and then the requester pays for the transfer charges and the request charges.

12
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.310
So because you therefore need to be an authenticated user.

13
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.130
In other words a user from another AWS account.

14
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.710
It doesn't support anonymous requests.

15
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.020
It doesn't also support bitcoin or SOAP requests.

16
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:18.910
Now also the request must include certain parameters in the header of the request so that specifies

17
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:26.610
information that is used then to ensure that that user is charged for those requests and that data transfer

18
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.610
back in the bucket.

19
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.820
Here it's a simple enable or disable.

20
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.950
So I'm not going to configure it here.

21
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.380
Just read about it and understand that this is a potential solution for certain use cases.
