00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.070
Hi guys.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.730
In this lab I want to talk to you some more about security groups.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.630
As I've mentioned before security groups are firewalls that are applied at the instance level.

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.080
So they actually look for traffic that's going into and out of the plastic interface is connected to

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.860
your instance.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.020
You can have multiple instances in the same security group and you can have multiple security groups

7
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.210
applied to an instance.

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.340
So what we see here is we have two instances instance a an instance B and they're both in the web access

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.190
security group and the SEC Group a security group.

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.730
Let's imagine that the SEC Group a security group enables ICMP pain.

11
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.330
So that means that these instances can send ping packets to each other.

12
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.550
A key fact about security groups is their state file.

13
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.720
And that means if you allow an inbound connection the response traffic is always allowed.

14
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.380
And we'll see more about that soon what we're going to do now is we're actually going to launch two

15
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.320
instances and we're going to set up this configuration.

16
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.990
So let's head over to the AWB management console so I mean the easy to management console and I'm going

17
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.390
to select launch instance and then choose Amazon Linux to EMI.

18
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.500
I'm going to choose the T2 micro.

19
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.290
I'm going to change to two instances and they're going to go into my default VPC.

20
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.360
I don't care which subnets they go in.

21
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.790
It should spread them into two different subnets and they're going to get public IP addresses.

22
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.800
So that's all I need at the moment and I'm going to choose the security group as web access.

23
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.960
So that will give us the port 22 that we need to be able to secure shell into these instances

24
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.200
just then go and choose launch with knowledge and launch instances

25
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.240
so those will take a couple of minutes to launch.

26
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.980
So that's took a few minutes and they're both initializing but they're both running so I think I'll

27
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590
be at a connect to these now.

28
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.910
So what I'm going to do is copy the IP address to my clipboard of one of them and I'm going to head

29
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.190
over and secure shell into that instance

30
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.920
and I'm in.

31
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.810
So I'm going to clear my screen just to make things a bit clearer.

32
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.000
And now I'm going to go and get the IP address of the second instance

33
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.830
so we now have a secure shell sessions of both instances.

34
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.340
Now what I can do is I want to actually try and ping from one instance to the other instance to do that.

35
00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.430
I'll need the private IP address and you can even get that from the console here or you can actually

36
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.770
see it in the text here before our command line.

37
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.690
So what I'm going to try and do is ping from this instance to the one on the right hand side

38
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.700
so I've put in its IP address and that's why I'm paying

39
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.330
and it doesn't look like that's working.

40
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.610
That's stop the connection and we can see 100 percent packet loss and let's try and do it the other

41
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.760
way around.

42
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:43.150
Paying 1 7 to 31 1 1 5 1 and hit enter and exactly the same thing is going to happen.

43
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.740
It's not going to happen because we don't have anything in our security groups that are allowing that

44
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.850
connection so let's go back and what we're going to do is create a new security group.

45
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.230
I'm going to click Create security group and I'm going to call this SEC group A and then I'm going to

46
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.320
copy that and put it into the description what I'm going to do is just save the security group and I'm

47
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.050
going to create a new security group as well which we're going to be using shortly in Islam and I will

48
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.120
call this one sec Group B.

49
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.610
And again I'm just going to copy that and paste it in and I'm not going to create any rules and now

50
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.180
what I want to do is I'm going to go back to set group a to edit and I'm going to add a rule and I'm

51
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.730
going to choose all ICMP V4 and I'm going to type S G and I can see my security groups.

52
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.150
So I'm going to choose the security group itself.

53
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:55.370
So what that means is this rule will allow inbound traffic on ICMP protocol from the security group

54
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.840
itself.

55
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.160
So that means members of the security group.

56
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.270
So any instance that's a member of this security group will be able to send ICMP data to other instances

57
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.830
that are members of the security group but no one else will.

58
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.680
So I can choose safe and we can now go back up to our instances

59
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.980
and I'm going to choose each instance go to networking change security groups and add in set Group A

60
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.800
We now go back to the command line and rerun those commands.

61
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:42.680
So let's try and paying instance be and that's working fine and now let's try and paying instance a

62
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.310
for instance B and that's working fine as well.

63
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.580
So that rule has allowed these instances to be able to send ping data to each other.

64
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.290
Let's go back and swap instance B into SEC group B

65
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.230
and now let's rerun those commands.

66
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.080
So we'll try and paying again and that doesn't work and we'll try and pay again.

67
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.650
And that doesn't work.

68
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.400
So what we've done now is we've enabled this configuration.

69
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.930
So we have instance a insect repay an instance B in SEC group B.

70
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:35.290
The problem is SEC group a is the only one that has a rule and it only allows access from members of

71
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.970
its own security group.

72
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.040
So we need to change the rules sets now.

73
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.750
So let's go back and see how we do that

74
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.940
what we need to do is go to security groups go to SEC group a and instead we're going to pull that out

75
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.220
and choose set group B.

76
00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:02.370
So now we'll have inbound access on ICMP from SEC Group B we save that rule.

77
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.720
We should find that we can now ping instance a from instance B and that works fine.

78
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.250
Notice how quick this is the instant you change it it takes effect.

79
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.690
So security groups have immediate changes applied.

80
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.590
Now the other way around isn't working still.

81
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:27.600
So we still can't ping instance B from instance say so let's go back and change the obvious security

82
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.500
group.

83
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:39.140
So in this case we need to change security group B and add a rule that allows ICMP V4 from security

84
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:48.580
group a and now let's go back and try that so that's great that's working we can now ping in both directions.

85
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.940
Now you'll notice that there's no return rules.

86
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:58.200
If we go back to our security groups in outbound we already have a rule that says all traffic can go

87
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.640
outbound but we don't actually need that because as long as the inbound rule allows the traffic inbound

88
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.790
the return traffic will go out regardless.

89
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.530
We could actually go in here and remove that from both security groups

90
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:25.230
and let's go back and see if our ping works and it still works in both directions so security groups

91
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.530
to stifle the changes are applied immediately.

92
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:37.490
You can specify inbound and outbound rules and you can use your source or your destination can be a

93
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.840
IP address a site a block or a security group.

94
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.520
So there's a few things to understand and we're actually going to be able to use these and put some

95
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.920
of this into practice for out this course.

96
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.580
And this is really just a sort of start scratching the surface.

97
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.350
We're going to get into a lot more detail later in the course.

98
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.560
We don't actually need these security groups anymore but they're attached to our instances.

99
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.110
What we need to do is go and terminate our instances which we don't need anymore.

100
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:12.000
So again to terminate both of these and they're going to get shut down and once that's done we'll be

101
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.580
able to go back and delete our security groups.

102
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.830
However you will run into a problem if you try and delete them now as long as you have another security

103
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.490
group referenced you won't actually be had to delete it.

104
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:30.970
So we can go to inbound rule just delete that rule do the same on the other security group and save

105
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:38.460
that and now we should be able to delete the security groups and now we should be able to delete the

106
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.390
security groups

107
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.650
and they're both gone and that's it for this lab guys.

108
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.180
I hope you're learning lots and enjoying the process in the next lab.

109
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.460
We're going to discuss instant metadata.
