00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.690
Section when I last slept showed you the slide, you might find that there are circumstances where you

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.670
need to migrate a lot of data.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.240
Now, a huge amount of data in it might take too long.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.470
Now, I'm not talking here about specifically servers or databases.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.910
I'm talking about actual data that's sitting maybe on your file server or some kind of storage device

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.100
in your on premises data center.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.960
So if we're online, if we're actually using a network, there's all these different mechanisms that

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.160
you can use, these tools you can use to migrate data into the cloud.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.270
But what happens if you have a massive quantity of data, say you got tens of terabytes or you've even

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.040
got sort of petabytes and so on?

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.880
So in that case, the network link that you have might not be fast enough to move that data.

12
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.280
So you've always got to do a calculation.

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.530
Now, if you're using a VPN, then that means that you're using the public Internet.

14
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.150
So not only is it the bandwidth between your whatever your Internet service provider has provisioned

15
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.060
for you, but you've also got to take into account the fact that at certain times of day there's congestion

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.730
and there's latency and so on.

17
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.340
So it might take quite a period of time.

18
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.990
And you can do a calculation.

19
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.300
You can go and find a toll online and you can look up, you know, if you've got 20 terabytes of data

20
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.840
and you've got a, I don't know, 500 MIT and 12 meg connection, then you can just have a look and

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.980
see how long is that going to take and work out whether it's acceptable to you.

22
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.970
Now, the other thing that you have to consider there is that you've got your on premises servers and

23
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.770
they're using that Internet connection.

24
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.590
Maybe not to connect to where W.S., but they're using it.

25
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.420
And maybe your customers are coming in via that connection as well to, you know, some application

26
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.590
service that you're sharing.

27
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.260
So you don't necessarily want to saturate your link with your file transfer as well.

28
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.790
So that's another consideration.

29
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.840
Now, if you do have direct connect, then that's great.

30
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.110
You've now got less issues with Licencee and.

31
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.650
If you've got one or 10 gigabits per second, so you got a decent amount of speed, but it's still going

32
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.780
to take time if you've got tens of terabytes and you still got to worry about saturating that length

33
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.600
that you might be using for, you know, some data transfer traffic, some application traffic that's

34
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.460
already going across those links.

35
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.610
So this is where you might need to find another way, like to physically transport your data.

36
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.280
And that's where these guys come in.

37
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.860
So we've got a snowball and the AWOL snowmobile.

38
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.310
Now, obviously, the snowmobile is pretty much this truck here.

39
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.250
So you've got this in this entire container on the back here, which is full of storage devices.

40
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.600
So that's for huge amounts of data.

41
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.450
And then on the left, we've got this tamper proof snowball device.

42
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.640
So this will get delivered to you.

43
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.810
You will load your data onto it.

44
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.290
And then that data then gets moved to a W.S. It gets put onto as free into a packet that you can specify

45
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.830
and then you can then work with that data.

46
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.340
So if your data transfer time is going to take too long, then you might want to end up going with a

47
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.740
snowball or a snowmobile device.

48
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.010
Now, another thing that's come up in exam questions is if you wanted to put in a direct connect connection.

49
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.840
Remember, it takes time.

50
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.500
So it can be anywhere from, you know, a month to multiple months to get that direct connect connection

51
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.850
actually installed.

52
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.350
So if you need to get your data up into a W.S. faster, then and you can't wait for that direct connect

53
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.950
connection, then you might have to go of a snowball device.

54
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.590
So let's have a look at a bit more detail.

55
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.850
So with a snowball, you can transfer hundreds of terabytes or petabytes of data between on premises,

56
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.000
data centres and history.

57
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.190
It uses a secure storage device for physical transportation.

58
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.490
And there's some clients software that you install on a computer.

59
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.950
And that's then used to identify the data that you want to migrate, compress and encrypt it and then

60
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.860
transfer that data onto the snowball device.

61
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:27.540
It uses 256 bit encryption managed, which became Askey, and the actual enclosure is highly tamper

62
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.410
resistant as well.

63
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.150
So it's a secure device.

64
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.330
Now, with Snowbowl, you've got two options.

65
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.600
You've got the 80 terabytes and the 50 terabytes.

66
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.080
And A.W. Resh refer to this as petabytes scale.

67
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.550
Now, obviously, you would need to have quite a few devices for petabytes of data.

68
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.510
But you can do that.

69
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.360
Obviously, you could order quite a few devices.

70
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.240
However many you need, then you've got the snowball edge, which is a 100 terabyte device.

71
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.570
This is also known as petabytes scale.

72
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.280
And it comes with some onboard storage and compute capabilities as well.

73
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.130
And then you've got the snowmobile.

74
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.790
So this is what they call exabyte scale with up to 100 passive bytes per snowmobile.

75
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.810
So that's gonna be a pretty rare use case.

76
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.630
But, you know, it can happen.

77
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.560
So that's a huge quantity at a so that you can actually move in to A.W. US.
