00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,710
Hi guys we're going to create a wordpress stack now using CloudFormation and what I'm showing you

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,110
on the screen is the PNG that was exported from the designer.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,320
So I used that template and just clicked on the export button and this is what you see.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,690
So you can see on here we've got a DB instance we've got a load balancer.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,510
So there is running an ideal spot away.

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,620
We have a load balancer with a target group.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,070
We have a couple of security groups an Auto Scaling group which will have instances running in it

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,120
an ALB listener here

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,040
and the launch configuration.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,230
So that's the infrastructure that's gonna get built now through the designer.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,710
You can see all these different mappings and how they relate to each other.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,770
So let's head into the console and have a look at this.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,770
So I'm in the CloudFormation management console and then choose create, use a sample template and

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,840
choose the multi AZ simple wordpress blog.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,240
And what I want to do is view in designer and we do need to make the same changes that we made in the

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,840
last lab.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,510
So I'm going to go in here and I'm going to search for PHP and it's not that one is this one here.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:25,710
And I just need to change this to PHP 70 and then PHP 70 dash mysql and HTTPD24.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,190
So I've made those changes and what I can do rather than sort of export in the fall and uploading it

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,000
which I wanted to show you last time is we can just go and create this stack

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,030
so the stack is ready to create we click on Next.

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,490
And I'm going to change again to use smaller instances try and keep us in free tier so I'm going to

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:53,810
use this t2.micro I'm going to just copy and paste the passwords again change the instance type here

24
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,430
which is for our web server and she's my keeper.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,740
Now we can create multi AZ if we want I'm not going to bother for this lab because we're not going

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,170
to test failover or anything like that but you could just change false to true if you wanted to choose

27
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,360
multi AZ as well.

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,310
And now we can choose our subnets now and then I choose my default subnet.

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,600
I did notice in testing that if I chose the other VPC CloudFormation put my instance into the correct

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,170
VPC but it put the database into the default VPC so that's clearly not the code written into the

31
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,010
template to update the ID since to be deployed into the same VPC.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,150
So I would just leave it as default if I were you or you could use it as an exercise to sharpen your

33
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,390
skills on creating CloudFormation templates.

34
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,490
Now I've just added my subnets and I click on Next.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,230
And of course I need to give it a name.

36
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,400
So in this case I'm going to call it multi AZ WP.

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
So again we don't need to make any other changes here,

38
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,690
I'm just gonna go through.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,380
You can see everything set up correctly.

40
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,530
And I'm just gonna head through and click Create stack.

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,140
So that took about 15 minutes or so for me.

42
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,870
And it looks like things that have been created and it's all complete you can see in here application

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,740
load balancer.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,460
The target group the listener you can see the web service security groups being created, the database

45
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,360
security groups, the database instance itself.

46
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,200
And then the launch config and the web server green.

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,350
So that looks really good.

48
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,420
Let's have a look into resources here and you can sort of see some information about your resources.

49
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,390
Now one of the things to note logical ID refers to these attributes that are within the template

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,020
file.

51
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:53,200
Whereas the physical ID actually represents the resources outside of the template file.

52
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:00,700
So anything like the Rand you can get IP addresses here sometimes URLs that kind of thing if you

53
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,440
look on the outputs we've got the Web site url.

54
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:10,260
So let's quickly just click on this link and see what happens and sure enough it works.

55
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,830
So we've got our wordpress installation ready to log in and create our sites.

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,980
So that's really it.

57
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,820
But I want to show you the other things that are being created so let's have a look into instances here.

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,200
And so we've got our instance.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,190
This is the one that was just created.

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,650
We've then got the security groups.

61
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,360
So we've got a couple of security groups one for the web server one for the database server and we've

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:46,140
got a load balancer so that's being created and a target group and then we've got our launch configuration

63
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,450
and Auto Scaling group.

64
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,410
And then we've also, if we go over to order, yes we should also have an RDS database so the database

65
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,570
backend for this wordpress installation is actually going to be this database instance

66
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,440
so we've automated the entire installation.

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:13,110
We've set it up and through the file it's not just installed WordPress but it's configured the

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,560
the wordpress installation to speak to the database backend.

69
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,120
And so the whole thing has been automated so that's really really cool.

70
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,630
Now what we want to do now we've finished with this one but we're not going to delete it yet.

71
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,690
What I want to do is just show you a couple of other things about CloudFormation.

72
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,510
If we head back to stack info here one of the things you can see here is drift status and it says not

73
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,690
checked.

74
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,880
And what we can do is you can click here and say detect drift.

75
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,910
And what this does is it checks that your infrastructure is built according to your template.

76
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,780
So you've built your input for structure based on this template file here.

77
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,530
So if anything's changed then it will pick that up and report it back to you.

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,270
Now to go in that now it says drift status is in sync.

79
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,960
So that's great.

80
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,100
Let's head over to it.

81
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's head over to EC2 and find security grapes.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,370
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go in and... let's in fact, let's go into this one.

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,350
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to remove one of these rules so let's remove this as the

84
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,470
site rule.

85
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:32,120
So what we've done now is we've changed the security group and this security group was built using the

86
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,920
template file.

87
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,180
So the definition of the security group and how that security group should be configured is different

88
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,410
in the template file than it is now actually is here.

89
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:49,160
So let's go back and click on detect drift and straight away we have address status it says "drifted".

90
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:01,170
And we can go up to here and we can view drift results and it's just refresh this page and sure enough

91
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:08,050
down here we can see that the web server security group has been modified so this is a really good way

92
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,990
to make sure that your infrastructure is configured according to the way that you need it to be.

93
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,990
And for instance you know somebody has changed one of those security groups.

94
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,180
They might have added a port in that they shouldn't do or protocol or they might have changed the configuration

95
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,870
in a way that could lead to instability, could lead to performance problems, could lead to security problems.

96
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:36,160
So that's why CloudFormation is a good tool for securely and consistently deploying infrastructure and

97
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,950
you'll sometimes see exam questions that refer to that.

98
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:46,210
So they might say that a team of developers need to find a way to repeatedly build infrastructure. Maybe

99
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,350
they're building the same sort of infrastructure for different clients or something like that, and they

100
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:56,370
need to be able do it efficiently but also securely, and repeatably without having any error.

101
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,720
So that's where things like CloudFormation can be really really useful.

102
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,050
The other thing we want to exploit are change sets.

103
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,700
So what a change that is is it's a way of looking at the changes that you want to make to your stack

104
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,410
before you actually make them.

105
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,140
So I'll show you what that means.

106
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,440
We'll click on Create Change there and we're going to use the current template and click on Next.

107
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:28,440
But what we're going to do is we're going to change the DB class to t2 small and that's all in a day

108
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,810
and it looks just like you're gone through the wizard at the beginning with first deploying a stack

109
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:42,440
so go through and create the change sets and it tells us here that a change is a preview of how this stack

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,140
will be configured before creating the stack which allows you to examine various configurations before

111
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,690
executing the change set.

112
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,950
So what we're going to do is just create this change set and you can give it a name and you can set

113
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,270
a description and we can see what is going to be modified so it shows us that the DB instance is going

114
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,390
to be modified. Not sure why the launch config is going to be modified..

115
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,970
But anyway the DB instance is what we're looking at here.

116
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,310
And if you go over to JSON changes you'll then see the code that is being modified and you can see

117
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:25,540
in here that the DB instance is going to be changed so what we can then do is you can then choose to

118
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,090
delete or execute your change set.

119
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,010
So let's just click on execute and now we can see that the same stack is being updated

120
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,840
and let's head over to RDS

121
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,030
and have a look at our database and we can see that our database is now in the state of modifying.

122
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,580
So it's now going to be shut down so that it can change from a t2 micro to a t2 small.

123
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,000
So that took a few minutes and we can now see that the database is modified to a t2 small so let's

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,850
head back to CloudFormation and this has had a refresh and it's still showing it's in progress.

125
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,260
I think there was still some stuff outstanding and we'll actually have to wait a few minutes until the

126
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:21,220
stack is completed before we can then go and delete asked at the stack updates have completed now and

127
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,330
we're done for this lab.

128
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,270
So all I'm going to do is go in and click delete and delete stack.

129
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,180
Now you want to keep an eye on this because you will find sometimes that CloudFormation doesn't successfully

130
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:40,690
delete your resources and it's usually quite easy to have a look in the events and work out what's going

131
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,960
on sometimes it might be that a security group can be deleted.

132
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,510
And I found for instance earlier that my security group couldn't be deleted because there was a network

133
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,640
interface that had been looked like it had been detached but not deleted.

134
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,560
So I had to delete the network interface manually in EC2 and then go and delete the security group

135
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,840
and then everything else just was it was deleted automatically by CloudFormation.

136
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:11,290
So just go and make sure that all your resources are properly terminated and delete it and make sure

137
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,900
that you don't end up with any charges.
