00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.010
Hi, guys, a storage gateway definitely comes up on the exam, it's been around a while, but I didn't

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.690
cover it before because it's definitely very difficult to show in a lab environment.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.740
But what I wanted to do instead is to just give you some diagrams and some slides and talk through what

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.990
Gateway is, because you just need a high level understanding of storage gateway and the three different

5
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.660
types of storage gateway so that, you know, when you get exam questions, which type of storage gateway

6
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.000
you should be using or whether you should be using a storage gateway at all.

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.690
So the first one is a file gateway.

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.080
So with a file gateway, the storage gateway here is actually an appliance.

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.480
This is a virtual appliance running on VMware or hypervisor within the corporate data center.

10
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.800
So an on premises environment and your servers on premise, while your application servers or your clients

11
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.940
or whatever are connecting to the storage gateway using either the network file system protocol NFC

12
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.350
or the server message block SMB.

13
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.610
So one of those two file level protocols.

14
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.380
Now the data can then be stored in multiple storage classes in the cloud.

15
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.860
So even as free standard standard infrequently accessed or one zone infrequently accessed, files are

16
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.720
stored as objects in S3, but they're presented as file systems within the storage gateway.

17
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.010
Now a local cache can provide low latency access to recently used data.

18
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.140
So you hit the cache first, see if the data's in the cache.

19
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.080
If not, then the data is going to be stored in S3.

20
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
So the bulk of your data is stored in S3.

21
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.950
Just a cache of the data is stored locally for low latency access.

22
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.610
So key things to remember.

23
00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:03.690
This is file level, it's SMB or Neff's and the data is stored in S3, but it's cached locally for a

24
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.880
subset of the data, the recently used data.

25
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.260
Now remember, this is a virtual gateway, so it runs on Hyper V or VMware.

26
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.790
It can also run in, etc..

27
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.910
So far, Gateway provides a virtual on premises file server, enabling you to store and retrieve files

28
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.380
as objects and as free.

29
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.290
It can be used for on premises applications and for easy to resident applications that need files,

30
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.350
storage and free for object based workloads.

31
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.000
C Use for flat files only they're stored directly on S3 file.

32
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.370
Gateway offers SMB or NFC based access to data in S3 with local caching, and it supports those three

33
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.240
different tiers of all classes of S3 storage.

34
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.770
So it's very standard standard IÃ‰ or one Xania.

35
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.950
It also supports Linux clients connecting to the gateway using manifest versions free and full, and

36
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.350
Windows clients connecting to the gateway using SMB versus versions two and three.

37
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.430
Maximum file size of an individual file is five terabytes.

38
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.540
That's the free limit.

39
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
We then have the volume gateway, so this is the second type.

40
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.270
So you have a file gateway.

41
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.440
This is the volume gateway.

42
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.240
And next we're going to cover the type gateway.

43
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.000
So this is the second type of storage gateway and there are two different configurations and I'm showing

44
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.140
both of them on the screen here.

45
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.510
So the top one is what we call cached volume mode and then we have stored volume mode.

46
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.040
Now, firstly, the key difference is this is block level.

47
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.420
So we're talking about Eskenazi.

48
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.870
We're not talking about SMB protocol or NFC protocol here.

49
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.960
This is attaching essentially a disk to your server using ICE Skuzzy.

50
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.210
So it's block level protocol.

51
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.150
Now in the cached volume mode, the entire data set is stored in S3 and a cache is stored locally.

52
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.860
So I've highlighted the key word here.

53
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.880
This is hopefully a way of remembering this more easily.

54
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.670
Just remember that we're talking about on premises here that the cache is on premises.

55
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.210
So in cached mode, the cache is on premises, everything else is in S3, whereas in stored volume mode

56
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.120
the data is stored on premises.

57
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.030
So the data is all stored here and then it's actually backed up as snapshots to S3.

58
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.490
So you're using S3 in this configuration as a backup, but your data is local.

59
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.790
Whereas in this case, you're using as free as a place to store your data and you just want to be out

60
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.550
of cash, some data for, you know, recently use data for low latency access.

61
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.860
So that's the volume gateway.

62
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.240
So Volume Gateway represents the family gateway that supports block based volumes.

63
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.400
It was previously referred to as Gateway.

64
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.960
Kashiram Gateway stored volumes.

65
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.560
I think that terminology was probably a bit more confusing.

66
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.160
I prefer the new terminology, says Block Storage by skuzzy based cache volume mode.

67
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:07.770
The entire data is stored on as free and a cache is accessed locally on sites in stored volume mode.

68
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.320
The entire data set is stored on site and asynchronously, backed up to as free as IPPs points in time

69
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.140
snapshots which are incremental and compressed as always.

70
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.470
Each volume gateway can support up to 32 volumes in cash mode, each volume can be up to 32 terabytes

71
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.000
for a maximum of a petabyte.

72
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.890
I don't think you need to know those specific numbers, but in case you do an installed mode, each

73
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.590
volume can be up to 16 terabytes for maximum 512 terabytes per data gateway.

74
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.160
Lastly, we then have the type gateway.

75
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.570
So in this case, it's about having your backup service on premise.

76
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.150
They might be running something like CommVault or netback up or whatever.

77
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.550
VM, you know, one of your one of the typical well-known backup software.

78
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.230
And you're backing up to a virtual type library sort of virtual type.

79
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.740
So Awassa Storage Gateway presents that to you.

80
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.580
The backup server can use one of many common backup applications.

81
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.640
Now, when you're actually writing data to the tapes of the tape is mounted, the data actually goes

82
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.810
to S3 standard.

83
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.840
And then when you ejects your tape, the data is then stored in S3 Glacier in glacier depth archive.

84
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.870
So very cost effectively.

85
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.120
Again, it's ice skuzzy.

86
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.990
So it's an ice cuzzi connection to the VTL library.

87
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.880
So this is used with popular backup software, each gateways pre configured with a media changer and

88
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.830
tape drives supported by net.

89
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.380
Back up, back up exactly same and so on.

90
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.710
You can select one of these different type sizes.

91
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.850
It can have up to fifteen hundred virtual types and a maximum aggregate capacity of one petabytes.

92
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:55.230
All data transfer between the gateway and storage gateways encrypted using SSL and all data stored by

93
00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:02.860
type Gateway Innisfree is encrypted server side with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys SC S3.

94
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.740
Now those last two points about the encryption, they apply to all different types of gateway.

95
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:15.150
So it's always encrypted using SSL in transfer into Adewusi and it's always encrypted at rest with Amazon

96
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.800
S3 managed encryption keys.

97
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.210
So that's it for Storage Gateway.

98
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.770
Those are probably all the facts you need to know for the exam.

99
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.600
So just make sure you understand the different types of gateway and when they're going to be used.
