1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:12,730
In this lesson, we're going to use query string routing to conditionally route all connections to different

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,840
target groups based on the query string parameters that we define.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,940
There is some code that you're going to need.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,890
This is in the co-director of the course.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,030
Download auto scanning and Ailbhe, and it's called User Dash data.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,170
Dash app Dash Group to search what this does is simply creates a web service and adds the text.

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,700
This EC2 instance is in App Group B to the web page.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,430
So we're going to copy all of this to our clipboards and in the active management console, we're going

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,510
to launch an instance.

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,590
It's going to be the Linux to my C2 micro.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,310
And what we're going to do is make sure that we put it in one of the subnets that is attached to our

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,060
target group.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,110
So I'm going to use USC SW1A.

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,110
If I scroll down to the bottom, I can paste in my code.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,760
Go to next.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,560
Next.

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,310
And then across the security.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,220
And I need to choose my Web Access Security Group.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,350
Let's go to launch, choose our keeper, and we've launched that instance.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,220
We can now view instances and we should have these free instances.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm going to label this one.

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,100
This is the one we just created.

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,700
So this is the one for the query test and click on Safe.

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,530
So that would take a few minutes to come up.

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,290
We also need a separate target group.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,550
So we're going to come down to target groups choose Create Target Group.

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,950
The target site will be instance.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:46,010
The target group name will be tJI, Dash, Ielpi, Dash two and the Protocol HD CPAC again, BP sees

29
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,910
already selected.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,270
All of the other information is fine as the defaults.

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,980
Let's click on next, and we're going to manually add a query test instance, so I'm going to include

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,310
as pending below and then create that target group.

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,860
So we have a target group with an instance.

34
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,680
Of course, you can probably imagine because we saw this recently that it's going to be unused, and

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,650
that's because it's not attached to a load balancer.

36
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,000
So what we need to do now is go back to our load balancer.

37
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,090
We're going to choose listeners and once you're going to create a role for this listener.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,360
So what we do is click on view edit rules.

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,030
Now, a listener is a protocol combination, so if you wanted another listener, it would have to be

40
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,520
a different port could be HD 281, for example, or HTTPS for for free.

41
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,320
So we don't want another listener.

42
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,780
We want a role within this listener.

43
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,050
Now I find this one of the most unintuitive consoles in IWC, but I'll show you how to work it.

44
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,640
So we click on Plus.

45
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,510
Then you go to insert rule and condition.

46
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,550
We're going to use query string.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,230
Now this is where you have path, Hofstetter, HTP, header and others.

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,220
So there's quite a lot of different ways you can route your data.

49
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,110
We're going to use query string.

50
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:13,580
The query string is going to be App Group and the value is going to be a.

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:23,590
Add action forward, too, and we're going to choose Teague Albi and we're going to save these.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
Click on Save.

53
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,850
We're now going to add another rule.

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,650
We're going to do the same thing, but this time it's going to be App Group and we're going to enter

55
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,170
B.

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:43,420
And this time we're going to forward to Target Group Albi to click on the tick marks and save.

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,730
So what we have now, we have free rules.

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,630
The first rule is going to check for the query string parameter app Group B, and if it finds that it's

59
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,020
going to forward to the Albi to Target Group, if that's not the case, it's going to have a look for

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:06,190
the query string app Group A and if it finds that it will forward to Target Group Albi and if neither

61
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,220
of those happen, it's just going to forward it to Target Group LP.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,620
That's the default rule at the end.

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,900
So those rules are set up correctly.

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,020
Let's go back and check our target group.

65
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,110
We want to make sure that all instance is healthy.

66
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:28,120
So now that we click Refresh, we should find it is used because it's used in that rule and the instance

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,470
has quickly become healthy.

68
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,840
So all looks good.

69
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's go to low balances description and I'm going to copy the DNS name.

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,440
Now let's go to a new browser window before what we did was just pasted in this DNS name.

71
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:49,300
Now, for now, because we're going to add a query string, you must add HTP colon slash slash at the

72
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,330
beginning, and then we're going to put in our query string.

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,240
So I'm going to put a question mark.

74
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:04,660
App Group equals high unless hit enter and we get forwarded to our issue instance in USC SW1A.

75
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,280
Now, remember, there's a different message with all other instance, it might be in the same A-Z,

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,380
but it should provide a different message.

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,040
So what I'm going to do now is just change this to App Group equals B and hit enter.

78
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,020
And now I get the different instance, the one that's in the new target group we just created.

79
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,940
So that's an example of using query string parameter based routing with an application load balancer.

80
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,070
And that's it for this lesson.

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,100
What we're going to do is we will remove the instance that we just launched because we don't need this

82
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,650
one anymore, but we'll leave everything else running.

83
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,160
We're still going to continue using this in more hands on lessons.

84
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,400
So once that's terminated, you're all done for this lesson.
