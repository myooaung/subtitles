00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.350
So now we're going to talk about what happens after you

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.860
deploy your application to the cloud.

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.790
And to do that, we're going to take a look at Josh, and let's see where he's at.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.070
As of right now, he has deployed his first CDK application.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.910
But just like ours, there's really not much in it.

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.440
He simply wanted to test out the deployment process.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.600
So now he's going to begin building out key components

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.980
that he's going to use with the CDK.

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.640
And with this, he's going to need to be able to do a few things.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.540
First of all,

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.550
he'll obviously need to be able to deploy updates to his app because all he

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.040
has right now is an S3 bucket and a CloudFormation output.

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.640
He also is going to need to manage environments for cost reporting.

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.110
So the organization wants to know how much we're spending

15
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.650
on the development environment versus the staging

16
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.540
environment for this proof of concept.

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.490
And once he's done with an environment,

18
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.040
he'll also need to know how to delete an app environment when this is completed.

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.260
Now,

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.610
an important note here. We're really not going to dive fully

21
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.770
into a multi‑environment CDK application. That will be coming

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.980
within the next course in this path.

23
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.990
But I'll be walking through how we categorize an

24
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.040
application for a specific environment.

25
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.280
Now, if you remember, we talked through the CDK deployment workflow,

26
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.800
and we walked through the process of doing a net bootstrap,

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.360
which, again, only needs to be done once per environment,

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.070
synth, and deploy.

29
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.660
But now there's another part of this process,

30
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.080
and that is we need to update our project with the new infrastructure,

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.310
and then it's going to go through a process of creating a diff,

32
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.930
so the difference between the cloud‑based infrastructure that

33
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.250
we've deployed and what we have locally within our application.

34
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820
So to make this workflow work,

35
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.240
here's what we're going to be doing within this module.

36
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.160
So first, we're going to be updating our existing CDK app with

37
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.600
additional resources. We're going to be adding a VPC into the

38
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.740
resources that we currently have.

39
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.450
We're also going to be adding tags to a CDK app programmatically.

40
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.630
We'll be creating our first custom CDK construct,

41
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.160
and once we're done,

42
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.020
we'll be deleting our deployed CDK application. And then

43
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.000
later, within later modules, we'll be redeploying it with a lot of additional resources.
