1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,110
So now, to help us understand better what the CDK is actually doing,

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,540
we're going to be generating the CloudFormation templates for our CDK app.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,930
So first, we'll use the CLI to generate those CloudFormation templates for our

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,920
CDK app, and then we'll be reviewing the generated templates.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,070
So, let's dive in.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,750
So first, just as a reminder, here is our current CDK application.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,040
We have two resources that have been configured within our primary

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,490
stack, and that is an S3 bucket that has encryption set to be

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,400
S3_MANAGED, and we have a CloudFormation output,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,540
which is going to output the bucket name of our bucket.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,830
So now I'm going to navigate over to the terminal, and we'll

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,040
generate the CloudFormation templates for this stack.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,280
So I'm here within the base directory of our project,

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,980
and I'm going to create a new directory called templates.

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,640
And then within here, I'm now going to run cdk synth,

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,780
and I'm going to pass it the directory that we just created.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,570
And now I'm just going to run the command.

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,940
So now that the command has completed, I'm going to move over back into VS Code.

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,090
So now I'm here in VS Code, and I can see that I now have a templates directory.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,450
I'm going to go ahead and open up this directory, and I'll see that I have

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,210
the name of a template that corresponds to my stack,

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,290
which is TypescriptCdkStack. So I'm going to click on this, and I can

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,040
see now that generated JSON template for my stack.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,880
So if we look here,

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,620
there's a few things to point out. Here within the Resources

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,140
section we do have our bucket, our DocumentsBucket.

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,340
So there's a few things I want to point out here.

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,900
First of all,

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,690
you'll notice that we gave it a name of DocumentsBucket, and you can

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,800
see that that becomes the base for the name within CloudFormation, but

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,940
it does have an identifier placed after it.

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,270
In addition, you can see that our BucketEncryption option is configured here.

33
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,370
We can see that we are using AES‑256 server‑side encryption. And again,

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,970
this is going to be managed by S3. We also have some

35
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,590
specific details included here, such as the DeletionPolicy,

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,240
which in this case is set to Retain.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,000
It also includes some CDK‑specific metadata, which in this case lets

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,940
it know what the CDK path is for the resource.

39
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,270
So if I scroll down here,

40
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,410
we also can see that we have our output configured, and this output

41
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,640
is going to be the output that will appear within CloudFormation

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
that will have the name of our bucket.

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,190
And we can see here that the name of this export is

44
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,840
going to be DocumentsBucketName.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,410
So this is what we have in terms of our generated stack.

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,510
So now that we have this in place, and now that we've had a chance to

47
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:52,000
review the generated JSON template for our app we're now ready in the next clip to go through the process of deploying it.
