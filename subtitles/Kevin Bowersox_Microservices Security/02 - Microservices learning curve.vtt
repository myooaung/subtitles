00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Before we take a closer look

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.000
at microservice security, let's talk a bit

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.008
about who the course is for and what information

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.003
you should know ahead of time.

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.009
When I first encountered microservice security,

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.008
it was a bit overwhelming.

7
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.009
Building microservices is already complicated.

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.004
However, I was now confronted with a bunch of new

9
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.002
security technologies, standards, and techniques.

10
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:28.001
It seemed like the old playbooks were thrown out the window.

11
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.006
At the same time, I was excited for a new challenge

12
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:35.001
and I began to furiously read security specifications,

13
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.008
talk to experts, and build prototypes.

14
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.004
After a few years of building and securing

15
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:45.004
microservice-based systems, I began to clarify the concepts

16
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.006
for others to help them understand

17
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.003
how to build secure microservices.

18
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:54.006
So this course captures those conversations

19
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.005
and it's intended to help anyone with a role

20
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:01.002
or an interest in building a microservice-based system

21
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:05.000
get past the initial information overload.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.005
Given the new way of working introduced by microservices

23
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.002
and DevOps, this creates a pretty wide audience.

24
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.008
I've had conversations with people in all sorts

25
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.006
of positions, including application developers,

26
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.004
security engineers, pipeline developers,

27
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.008
and even scrum masters.

28
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.003
If you're in one of these roles, you can benefit

29
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.005
from the information in this course.

30
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.000
Microservices and security are a pretty deep space

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.008
that tends to layer concept on top of concept.

32
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.005
I can unpack most of that information but you're going

33
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.001
to get the most from this course

34
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.005
if you have a little background in how systems

35
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.008
are built and architected.

36
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:47.000
If you haven't worked in a team to build

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.008
a traditional information system before

38
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.009
or haven't heard of concepts like APIs and containers,

39
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.003
there may be other courses in the LinkedIn Learning platform

40
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:01.008
that would benefit you more, like Microservice Foundations.

41
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.002
That's all there is to know.

42
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.000
I can guide you through the rest of the lessons from here.
