- [Kevin] Thanks for watching this course

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.009

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.005
In the course I've provided you

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.003
with strategies for securing microservices

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.008
that overcome the security challenges

6
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.003
of a distributed system

7
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.001
by using leading standards and platforms.

8
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.008
Before we wrap up the course

9
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:20.009
I want to provide you with some recommendations

10
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.004
for what to explore next

11
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.006
and give you some information about my other courses.

12
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.006
If you want to get to the expert level

13
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.003
I highly recommend reading the specifications

14
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.007
discussed in this course,

15
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.005
such as those for OAuth 2 and JWT.

16
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.002
These materials will deepen your understanding

17
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.004
of the standards used to secure microservices

18
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.000
and allow you to teach them to others.

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.001
Throughout my career

20
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.001
I've learned the most through hands-on prototyping.

21
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.006
I encourage you to download or sign up

22
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.006
for some of the platforms mentioned in this course

23
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.004
and to build small proof of concepts against them

24
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.007
with the techniques we discussed.

25
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.003
Prototypes pay huge dividends.

26
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.002
