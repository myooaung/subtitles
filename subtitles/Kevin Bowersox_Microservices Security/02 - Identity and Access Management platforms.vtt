00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] In a microservice architecture,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the identity service provides two critical capabilities:

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.004
authentication and token management.

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:14.002
Now, as a general rule of thumb, in the security domain,

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.002
you do not want to build your own solutions.

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.003
You want to source them from expert providers.

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.006
Luckily, there are many open-source and commercial identity

8
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:29.007
and access management platforms that provide authentication

9
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.009
and token management right out of the box.

10
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.007
We can use these solutions in order to fulfill

11
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:41.008
the capabilities required for our identity service.

12
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.006
Now if you're in an enterprise setting,

13
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.005
it's highly likely that your IAM platform

14
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.003
has been selected for you.

15
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.002
As a developer or a security engineer,

16
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.007
you're going to find yourself integrating microservices

17
00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:01.008
with the IAM platform in order to secure them.

18
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:03.009
From an integration perspective,

19
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:08.001
we're primarily interested in four capabilities provided

20
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.003
by these platforms: authentication, identity management,

21
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:17.001
security standard implementations, and token management.

22
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.007
Authentication is extremely complex

23
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.004
and it's really easy to get it wrong.

24
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.000
That's why you want to source that capability

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.005
from an IAM platform.

26
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.003
Leading platforms seamlessly integrate

27
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:32.007
with many different types of identity stores

28
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.006
in order to authenticate the user.

29
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.004
Identity store store users credentials,

30
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.003
and information like permissions about them that we can use

31
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:46.002
to make access control decisions within a system.

32
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.004
Identity stores range from local databases,

33
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:50.009
to corporate held apps,

34
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.004
to even social networking sites

35
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:58.000
that allow users to use their credentials on that platform

36
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.002
to authenticate in another system.

37
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.008
For extra sensitive scenarios,

38
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:08.004
IAM platforms also support multi-factor authentication.

39
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:09.007
Using this technique,

40
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:11.006
we combine their credentials

41
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.007
with another form of authentication,

42
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:18.001
like a one-time pin or biometrics.

43
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.007
Identity management is another important security capability

44
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.001
provided by these platforms.

45
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:25.005
It's essential to understand

46
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.009
who or what is accessing a resource, and specifically,

47
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.003
what permissions they have to access them.

48
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.000
There are many advanced scenarios

49
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.008
for accessing a microservice

50
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.008
that go beyond role-based permissions,

51
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:43.000
such as when a user delegates permission to their data

52
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.004
to another application.

53
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.005
Using the identity management capabilities found

54
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:53.009
in an IAM platform, we can satisfy these scenarios.

55
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:57.007
These solutions are also great sources for implementations

56
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:01.009
of security standards and protocols used by microservices,

57
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:06.007
such as OAuth two, OpenID Connect, and JSON Web Token.

58
00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:10.006
These are the details I mentioned in our pattern discussion.

59
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.007
And a one item that clearly fall into the category

60
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.002
of concepts you need to understand,

61
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.006
but do not want to build yourself.

62
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:21.008
If you find yourself building an authorization server,

63
00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:26.008
it's time to take a step back and readdress the situation.

64
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:29.001
Tokens are also extremely important

65
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.001
for securing microservices,

66
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.007
and you'll find capabilities for managing them

67
00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:37.005
within many identity and access management platforms.

68
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.001
The capability to create and verify tokens

69
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.006
is handled by an authorization server,

70
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:45.008
which is defined in the OAuth two specification,

71
00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:49.004
and implemented in many IAM platforms.

72
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:52.001
Beyond these basic capabilities,

73
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.004
you'll find advanced support for different token formats,

74
00:03:55.004 --> 00:04:01.001
refresh tokens, token revocation, and token storage.

75
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.001
Across the IAM solutions you'll find support

76
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.006
for many different hosting configurations,

77
00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:09.008
including on-prem, cloud, and hybrid.

78
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.002
These should satisfy all the different needs

79
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.007
that you'll see across microservice-based systems.

80
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:17.003
When choosing a platform,

81
00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.009
do a very careful assessment of these solutions

82
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.000
to find the one that best suits your needs.

83
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.006
Identity and access management platforms

84
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:29.004
are the keystone of how many systems are secured.

85
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:32.001
Microservices are no different.

86
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.007
However, you'll discover they interweave many

87
00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:40.000
of the latest IAM capabilities in order to secure them.
