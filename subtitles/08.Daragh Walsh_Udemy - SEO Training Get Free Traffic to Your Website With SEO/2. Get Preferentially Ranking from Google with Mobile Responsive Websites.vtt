00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.940
In this lecture I'm going to show you how you can run another free test from Google to really ensure

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.840
that you have a mobile friendly Web site.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.480
The reason that it's important to do this is because in April of 2015 Google stated that they will be

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.370
expanding the use of mobile friendliness has a ranking signal on what that really means is that preferential

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.670
treatment will be given to mobile friendly sites and that they will appear higher in the search results

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.880
.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.810
And because of this so mobile friendliness is not something that's a luxury now.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.640
It's really a must have for any business.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.060
And really what Google is trying to avoid is mobile sites like this.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.960
When people come on they're very small hard to read obviously there's going to be people leaving outside

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.780
straight away.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.500
So really the ideal scenario is something like this in order to run the test it's very easy.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.610
Let's just take our.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.700
You were out as we did before.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.390
You just copied and pasted in our way to a couple of seconds to analyze.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.410
So the test is being complete and it's awesome.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.140
This page is mobile friendly.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.030
So just to recap what you've learned in this lecture is how to run this test and ensure that your site

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.160
is mobile friendly.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.820
The importance of doing this is this is now a ranking factor by how Google decides who gets to the top

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.080
of the search results.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.980
This is one of the criteria they consider.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.800
So it's very important to ensure that a Web site is mobile friendly and to access this test for yourself

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.360
you can find in the resources section again you can just click that and get straight into it.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.190
So maybe just that I am enjoying slashing
