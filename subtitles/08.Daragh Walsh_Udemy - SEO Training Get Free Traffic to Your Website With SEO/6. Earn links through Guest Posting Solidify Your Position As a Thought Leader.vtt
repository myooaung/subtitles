00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.480
So and that you put out a couple of great pieces of content over the last few months such as the ego

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.680
bait the SlideShare the info graphic as we discussed what you want to do now is solidify your position

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.260
as a top leader in this space and a great way to do this is to publish a guest post on one of your key

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.530
influencers blogs.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.490
So this is a fantastic way to foster powerful relationships with those key influencers and also get

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.070
your brand in front of their audience.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.660
And then finally also just build direct links from high authority sites and that are rather mature in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.140
each.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.700
Back to your site.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.280
So the way I'm going to show you how to do this is really just by looking at a very successful example

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.690
.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.560
So here we are on smart passive income dot.com.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.170
This is a blog by poplin and it covers generally how to make passive income online.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.160
And so what this page is here is a guest post from Brian Deane from battling co dot com one of the top

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.610
guys in a CEO on the site is really focused on ASIO's he can see ahead his guest post is complementary

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.930
.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.080
Her pants audience because pothooks more generally hates make money online.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.420
And then Brian Deans come in with actually very detailed specific information on his CEO.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.390
So you can see how that complements there and why he probably agreed to have this guest post.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.790
Secondly Walt was very smartly done here is that this is actually an updated post of a post that was

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.070
written before so this is a great example of modeling success.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.700
TUFFIN wrote an article How to you know back kinking strategy.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.290
I was back in 2010 but obviously a lot of the strategies are out of date so grindy comes in building

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.680
on something that's already been successful.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.330
Modeling it and updating it so he's really doing kind of favor thereby updating that already.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.290
Great information for his own audience.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.260
So we haven't looked through the article here we can see that very early on.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.380
There is a need to follow buckling straight back to back Glynco using the run names so that's really

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.770
in terms of building links a very powerful one there and throughout the article then and there's more

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.290
things as well.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.280
But I think Waban Brian Deane does well in this as well is he takes examples from heartfully inside

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.030
himself smart passive income.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
And he presents that as he can see something at the angry text here.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.310
He presents some as good examples to Pott's audience so he's really reinforcing how good a job that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.780
part is doing.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.910
And then he also believes in references to himself etc..

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.810
So that's really it.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.520
I mean I just think this is a really good example of you know a complementary guest posts on one that

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.590
also is modeling success and something that worked previously and also got some good links so let's

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.760
just finally look at the actual stats on it.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:27.210
So 174 links what a huge amount of Facebook activity Twitter activity Google Plus so successful in terms

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.140
of social building in terms of brand building.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.650
And in terms of building powerful relationships that's really the right way to do guest blogging.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.250
You may have heard about some negative things that I was posting and but that's really where you say

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.740
paying and a lot of different blogs to just post your articles on that's a lot more spammy as you can

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.650
see here this is very strategic and extremely powerful.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.960
As soon as so that's kind of the capstone on maybe the last six months of activity and a way to reinforce

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.840
and build new relationships.
