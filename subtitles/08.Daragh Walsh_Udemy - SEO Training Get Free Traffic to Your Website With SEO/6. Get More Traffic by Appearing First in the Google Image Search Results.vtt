00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.910
Cried so let's talk briefly about image optimization.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.450
This is really important for two reasons.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.310
One it's just another clue that she can give the Search Engines of a watcher and pages about and as

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.220
a result she can rank higher in the search results.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.000
But secondly and probably more importantly it allows you to peer into google image search results.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.070
This is important especially if you've got a physical product.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.490
And if you've got people searching for images there if it's faster than for to visually find what they're

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.650
looking for rather than read what it's about.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.340
Well and this is important strategy for you so let me show you a couple of quick things that you can

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.500
optimize your images.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.610
So if we return to the example article that I'm publishing in wordpress here that you are I'll optimization

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.250
you can see that about it in two images.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.040
One is just you know an example of godi where our law is optimization where the key word is there.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.150
And then secondly an example of poor optimization really there's just two things that you want to focus

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.360
on.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.840
Number one is the alternative text to make sure your keywords are in there.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.520
And it's easy to read.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:25.650
And then secondly what you want to do is just make sure the actual is on the actual file name itself

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530
includes the keywords.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.620
So as you can see separated by hyphen so cost you are l dash optimization.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.850
Example.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.810
You don't want it to be something generic like D.H. 1 x y z or whatever screen shot x y and on the days

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.950
you want to put in actually descriptive keywords that'll help you allow new users find your content

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.410
.
