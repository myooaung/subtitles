WEBVTT

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.810
Sonera we have a list of key word ideas.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.950
We want to do next.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.800
And the second part of our key research process is really to narrow down that list by looking at the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.000
data in the Google Keyword planner tool.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.410
We really want to make a data driven decision about what keywords we're going after and where we're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.770
going to invest or as CEO first.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.990
So I'm going to show you how to find the monthly search volumes for each keyword in agoo a planner too

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.250
.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.390
And also how to look for terms that are really going to give high conversion and result in a sale or

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.510
sign up wanted to try and avoid general keywords because usually they have a much lower conversion.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.180
So let's get straight into this.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.260
So the first step for you if you haven't already done will be create a Google Adwords it can't at Google

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.540
AdWords is the advertising platform of Google and the keyword planner to is a part of that.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.370
It's free to use all you need to do is follow the prompts and set up an account.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.420
Sometimes people say that they see them being pushed towards creating an ad you don't need to do this

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.330
.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.900
But if Google does kind of push you down that path you can always just go up to Tools keyword planner

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.920
will be brought back to this page here.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.530
And then this is really where we can start a process of.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.040
So once we're in the Google Keyword planner to what we want to do is command to get search volume data

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.370
and trends because we already have a large list of keywords.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.730
We can just paste those straight into this section.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.000
We're going to be able to see what the monthly search volume is.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.560
So then here you can use the targeting and you can limit the search volume that you want to see for

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230
a particular country.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.360
And because I think a lot of the markets say if I was 7 growns would be from the U.S. I'm just going

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.510
to keep that as a you as targeting let's search and see what comes up.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.720
So this is fantastic.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.040
Now Google is actually showing me how many searches on average in google there are for these exact keywords

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.710
so I can see for drone on average per month in the United States there's over 200000 searches for this

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.250
term which is really fantastic for us to see.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.610
So how do we start to narrow down this list.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.450
Well the first thing is to look at the keyword itself.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.800
If you were to tie yourself drone into the Google search box do you think you'd be ready to buy a drone

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.080
.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.700
Do you think you would be and know much about drones.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.480
Probably not.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.840
You probably if you're typing that into Google you'd be maybe interested in drones.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.110
Want to find out what they are the different types you would be much higher up the firing funnel.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.980
Evy maybe getting interested is something like quadcopter if a person types that into Google clearly

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.350
they know maybe two different types of drones and they're looking to find more information on the specific

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.710
type of drone you type in drones for sale.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.380
Obviously you're looking to maybe buying drones lots of great keywords to try and rank for it because

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.570
it's going to lead to sail sale as similar to the UAV as we saw.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.750
This is maybe a different category of drones so obviously the person knows a little bit more about drones

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.240
parody or drone.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.940
Someone obviously knows if they're talking in this into maybe this is the best type of drone.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.110
And they were very interested in maybe buying this drone or getting more information about it.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.370
So that's the first thing we want to look at the keyword itself and really the intention behind somebody

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.900
if they type that into google and we want to pick the keywords that will maybe result in much higher

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.750
conversions or more specific terms the better second thing we want to look at is the average monthly

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.450
search volumes.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.080
Obviously these last specific terms draw higher amounts of average searches per month.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.410
But also that average number of searches then draws more competitors other people trying to as CEO rank

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:22.030
their sites from those terms so it's really better to try and get lower monthly searches.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.070
You know maybe above 2000 as a minimum.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.650
And if we can couple that with a more specific term that's going to lead to less competition and higher

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.990
converting keywords.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.660
So let's start actually building a new list and what we can do is just organize this list in terms of

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.420
starting with the top Monkley searches.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.940
I'm going to skip all of these first to because I think they're not specific enough and that high volume

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.890
is going to draw a lot of competition from as CEO.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.070
So what we can do is click this button.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.190
It's going to build up a new list here and this is kind of the stuff that we want to be going for some

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.690
more specific still are a good search volume might still be a little bit too competitive for us.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:17.010
But let's keep going down the way s I think this is a particular and I and yet trone camera.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.140
I think that's Nixy.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.330
I love this up.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.470
This is a specific type of drone.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:31.960
So if you could build a web site around that to get right for that are drones look best drones see it

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:38.330
can see still very good search falling for these drones of folly.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.760
This is very specific and I mean that can be a great video.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:52.690
Great blog post and a link to even Amazon to sell the best drones that follow you drone reviews.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.810
That could be something else he could ring for as well and our copter.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.260
So let's look at this.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.650
This is I've seen the brand name.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:10.190
Not as much search volume this maybe not as competitive as the A or perish one that we saw Accenture

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.420
.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.450
So don't go pro Goodwin.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.950
So essentially that's what you're going to want to do.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.440
And another consideration that you can have is at how many many people are advertising for these and

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.700
these Keywood So this competition here this is this.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.180
This isn't the competition of have heart.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.990
It is too rank for these key words in search engines.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.940
This is how many people are actually bidding on this keyword in terms of advertising.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.740
It'll give you a sense maybe of how valuable the term is.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.560
And so what you can do next is after you've looked at the keywords themselves and the average monthly

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:04.590
searches you can start to look at the suggested bid so you can see here that although there's a very

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:11.640
low number of searches only 90 searches per month on average in the U.S. The amount of people bidding

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.040
for this keyword is quite high and they're built.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.320
They're building up to $12 per click for that one keyword which probably makes sense over the long run

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.600
because drone insurance cost someone types that into google.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.880
They're looking to insure their drone which means they probably if they have a drone they've already

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.760
spent a couple of thousand on that which makes sense for them to buy insurance.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:44.610
So this is something if you're in that industry and you wanted to you know rank for that term you could

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:51.270
probably you know that that's a very high that's a very valuable term if someone is to spend $12 for

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.260
12 years one click.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.630
You know if you were to rank for that term you'd have a lot of highly valuable traffic.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.250
Same some other stuff here.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.390
So let's not get into her list as well drone insurance coverage.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.690
So there's another key word is fellated drone.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:17.050
UAV insurance similar term as well actually has higher searches per mode and much lower costs.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.160
If I were if I were these guys I'd be I'd be paying for this term because I get more searches for less

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:29.470
money and UAV insurances will go even higher.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.800
Let's keep moving then you have the insurance cost.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.490
That's this insurance UAV training.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.530
This is pretty interesting ones if you had a training course.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.120
And you know that if you were to build traffic for that it would be quite Followill.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:52.860
So that's just another way to look at this information from a conversion point of view and also see

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.060
how valuable that traffic might be.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:04.440
And then what you can do is take that list and paste it back into maybe your second your second sheet

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:10.890
on this key research workbook and they've got to narrow down the list of terms that you think are good

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:16.530
search volume and but also that could result in high conversions.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.670
And that's really what you want.
