00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.490
Grade soon in this lecture I want to give you a content strategy that's going to guarantee you links

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.660
and really the idea here is that you'd like our Watz already be successful and the model itself instead

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.240
of creating a new piece of content out of the blue and hoping that people are going to like it it's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.720
going to be successful what you want to do is actually find content that's already being shared on social

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.610
media that's already generated a torrent of links.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.750
And really what you're going to do is take that and improve it so you can either make it more up to

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.850
date of was published two years ago and you think that nobody's really been you know given an update

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.560
on this a fresh perspective.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.510
How does this new information impact that old information and you can go into more detail so you can

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.830
read the post and say you know that's good but it's not really enough I need more specifics.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
You have to go off and reference a lot of other posts to get clarity on what you can use then create

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.530
a new post with that extra information or you can just simply make it more visually appealing so in

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.330
images and for graphics and just really bring it to life more for people and in a make the design and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.290
the whole experience a lot better.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.250
So what we're going to do is look at a tool now and that's going to help us find content that's already

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.160
been successful.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.950
That'll give us a starting point then for how we can build on us and produce a piece of content that's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.930
really going to get links.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.430
So the two that we want to use to help us find successful pieces of content is called seamless he has

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.650
typed that into Google.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.120
And again this is a it's a there's a pro version of this too.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.640
But there's really a lot of great information here even on the free version.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.920
So let's just continue with my example of drones and see what's been the most successful pieces of content

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.280
in the past six months under all categories so and here you can see that Dulfer drones over dolphin

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.060
stampede and whales often a point in Maui.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.490
SEE can see that's been a huge amount of likes for this on Facebook shares Google shares.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.200
So a very successful piece of content.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.370
Unbelievable.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.620
He's successful so maybe just have a quick look at that.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.710
And that's over 10 million views on YouTube.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.770
I mean I think this is really where this is a great example of where drones really come to life and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.710
get back to some games

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.200
.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.780
So that's

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.450
OK.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.730
And so while you're not going to be able to replicate that tomorrow it's in an amazing location and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.950
probably a very unique opportunity what you could do maybe is do the best drone best you could create

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.430
a post saying you know the best drone videos and or in nature when you already know maybe these videos

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.340
have got 10 million whatever views so that's a piece of content that she can create if you were selling

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.690
drones and you wanted to attract people to your site and get them for it.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.640
So that's just an idea and again you're maybe you're getting the attention of these influencers here

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.590
is this guy Helfen Safari dot com so I mean he's really he's really done well.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.310
That's essentially the idea is to find content that she couldn't replicate and make better make better

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.910
in terms of making it more uptodate or more detailed.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.720
We're generally just more visually pleasing with design etc so have a look through that what also is

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.790
cool is that you can filter by days and then you know articling for graphic X-posts whatever.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.010
You can check it out there.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.850
There is an option to view the bottlings but you have to sign up for a pro account so you can maybe

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.710
do is take the links put them back into the Maaz open site explore.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.980
So what else is cool about this tool is if you weren't able to identify the influencers you can use

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.980
this as a step dad for the last lecture.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.490
Let's just type in drones and here it brings up a lot of the influencers that around that keyword.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.080
And these are Pietsch people then you can reach two or Again look at the content that's been successful

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.570
for them.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.960
So that's really it.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.380
I hope that's been helpful and is going to make you confident that when you invest your time in producing

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.160
content and you're you're backing a winner and that you're going to be producing something that's appeals

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.520
to a lot of people.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.570
And this is just fantastic too.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.380
And I really hope you find it useful.
