00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.880
See are very welcome to the section of the course now that we know what keywords you want to rank for

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.430
based on the work within the law in the last section while we want to do a step two of our ASIO's strategy

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.410
and what we're really going to cover in this section is optimizing our content around those keywords

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.540
.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.310
This process is also known as on page optimization and really the purpose of it is to is to tell Google

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.750
water content is about if Google can easily understand what our content is about.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.320
Then we have a much better chance of peering at the top of the search results when somebody types in

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.460
that keyword to the search engines.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.740
So to demonstrate how to do this and really bring it to life for you what I'm going to do is walk it

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.330
step by step through optimizing a WordPress page and show you how to optimize the Warrell.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.420
The title.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.310
That is scription the header headings inside the content and the images etc. so that by the end of this

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.200
section you will really know how to perfectly optimize your content around those keywords.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.010
Just remember that this section is called On page optimization not just on Web site optimization.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.000
So this is a process and a blueprint that you're going to use over and over again as you create new

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.650
pages for your site.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.560
It doesn't have to be for every page for your site but if you want to rank in the search engines you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710
should really engage this process.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.330
And for those pages that you want to write for
