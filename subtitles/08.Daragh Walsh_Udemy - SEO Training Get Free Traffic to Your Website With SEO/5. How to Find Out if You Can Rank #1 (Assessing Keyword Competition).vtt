00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.500
So welcome to the final step in our research process by now I have a shortlist of key words which you

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.180
know have good month research following them and you also know their specific and so are likely to convert

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.410
.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.770
Well the final thing that we need to really assess the competition for that those key words can we realistically

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.770
get to the top of the search results or is the key we're too competitive and we really do want to get

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.970
to the top of the search results because that's where everybody on Google clicks.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.980
They don't look to the second page.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.720
They don't look to the third page.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680
So this is a very important part of key research.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.490
And I going to show you a prostitute is using another free tool.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.950
So let's now return to our keyword research list.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.030
And we want to we want to see is take these one by one and start putting them into Google because we

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.750
really want to see what these top 10 search results are like.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.580
And as I said we want to assess really can we beat these guys the way that we're going to do that is

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.960
we're going to use a tool called the Mars Bar Chrome extension.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.190
You can just type it into Google and pop right up there and you can add us to Chrome.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
I've already got it installed here.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.310
And so I just click this little button click this little button and now it should pop up with this little

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.030
toolbar underneath that gives us some information that can help us decide is this keyword too competitive

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.060
.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.980
We're coming around for us so to assess if we can really get to the top of the search results.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.750
The main metric we're going to focus on is this P-A.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.510
This stands for page authority and if you remember earlier in the course I told you that Google in the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.840
search results ranked the most relevant web pages not the most relevant web sites.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.290
So that's why we're really focusing on this page authority that's really the authority for the page

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.610
.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.960
So one other information that's shown here is the number of links from around the Internet linking back

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.600
to this page and really showing its authority as well the domain authority DA is the an on aggregate

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.220
the authority that all of the web pages on this Web site on the domain really have.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.900
So just to keep it simple.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.870
The main thing that we want to look at is this page authority figure.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.710
And essentially what we're looking for is for this key word are there are a lot of the page authorities

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.820
are or are they 40 or below.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.470
I think you know as a guideline what I would say if all of the pages are 30 and below.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.770
It's going to be easy for you to rank there if the pages are from maybe 30 to 40 what you're going to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.290
need to do is have some good onsite optimization which I'm going to show you do later in the course

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.180
and also builds some links.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.060
So that's the guideline Let's have a look at entry so we can see that the page authorities seem to be

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.870
quite high.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.130
Sixty two seventy seven.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:12.660
Here's a little bit lower at thirty seven fifty 46 51 48 42 and last but not least 18:10 at the bottom

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.830
.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.520
So I think what I would say is that's quite a competitive keyword.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.910
From what I can see there also is a bit of a broader keyword so maybe something more specific could

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.080
be good to look at.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.870
So as you can see here Google has suggested some other related searches and actually you scroll down

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.260
the bottom they they have all of them here so you could maybe copy this back into the Google Keyword

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.740
planner to see if these you know longer tail keywords have any good search find them.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.790
OK so Ardu copter Kesh is probably the best one there with 90 searches per month so a low amount of

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.600
searches but I think for Drum's if you get a sale on them you know it's usually quite a high price point

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.230
so that could even be worth getting a ranking for so let's have a look at this name.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.500
So as you can see Daphne it's seems like a lower page volumes all rancid 28 42 31.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.300
And this is definitely going to be a lot easier for you to get to the top of the search results on.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.520
And if you a high price price point it could be worthwhile taking time to rank for even 90 searches

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.090
a month.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.070
But I guess it really will depend you know on what is the price point.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.060
If they complete the purchase.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.510
So what I can do then maybe is on my final list I've got it in Arti cup to cash a note of the number

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.340
sergers But let's keep looking because we really want to pick the best.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.810
He would say let's move on to the second one on our short list.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.660
Let's go.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.900
John Carter Cash so kind of a similar one but a different starting keyword so you can see here maybe

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:13.290
42 47 27 1 45 63 20 so 42 22 so this is definitely a keyword that actually now has more searches than

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.610
the Ardu copter keyword and is less competitive.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.920
So this is definitely you know a better keyword for us to focus on.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.060
And you know as well as the page authority what you might start to notice now is some of the On page

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.230
optimization so you can see that you know these these these page authorities are like 40s aren't there

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.960
so what you need to do is have good on page optimization and also build some links as well.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.920
So for this particular keyword quadcopter kit you can see in the title TYG.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.820
This is what we're really going to look at this morning the key or the on page optimization section

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.210
of the course but you'll notice that the key word isn't featured in the title tag here it is here.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.490
It is here it is here and not the exact Heuer it is featured in the title here.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.380
So it looks like some of these pages are not that well optimized around this keyword specifically.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.910
So if you could do a better job than Then you have a good chance of ranking for this keyword.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.940
Also the number of links is not that huge.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.460
I mean 6 links 0 links 11 links eight links and you know that is not a huge amount of links so this

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.680
is definitely good keyword and I'm going to put some of her on a list.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.870
So just to recap on what you've learned to this lecture you've learned that assessing the key word competition

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.160
is really an essential part of the SEO.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.670
You really need to know can you get to the top search results.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:56.510
The best way to assess that is by typing putting the key word from your short list into Google and looking

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.900
specifically for the page authorities as a guideline I would say below 30 page authority of a lot of

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:11.310
them on the first page or below 30 is going to be easy for me to rank if it's between 30 and 40 with

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.770
some good on page optimization which just show you in the next section of the course and some link building

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.620
link with some links which are shown in the files section of the course you should be able to rank with

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.200
those.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.870
So I hope you enjoyed this lecture and give it a go yourself and learn the most part Chrome extension

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.730
and start testing those keywords
