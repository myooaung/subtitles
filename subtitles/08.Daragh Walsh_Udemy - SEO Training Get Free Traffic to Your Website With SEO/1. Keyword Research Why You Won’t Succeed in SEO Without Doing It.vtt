00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.390
So you're very welcome to this section of the course in this lecture what I want to do is firstly talk

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.130
about why you won't be successful in a CEO unless you do keyword research.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:19.710
And then secondly I want to give you an overview of a three step process to perform keyword research

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.820
to enable you to really find the low competition and high converting keywords.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.000
And that will really set us up for the remaining lectures in this section.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.660
So why is cuboid research really essential for you to if you want to be successful at RCO.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.430
Well you've got to be a little bit strategic.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.050
Firstly you want to make sure that you're not creating content and trying to build links around a keyword

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.670
that nobody is actually searching for.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.860
So you'll be wasting your time unless you need some keyword research to confirm that.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.920
Secondly you may be creating content or trying to build links around the key word there is just too

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.930
competitive.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.880
There could be companies with teams of people trying to get to the top of the search results for that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.150
.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.210
So again you've got to be kind of strategic about it.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.900
You've got to put some time into identifying where there's opportunities and then go after those opportunities

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.080
.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.690
So now I want to give you an overview of the three steps to find the low competition high converting

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.980
keywords and this is really what we're going to be covering in the remainder of this section.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.860
So firstly we want to brainstorm and build a list of 50 to 70 key word ideas and I can show you how

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.120
to do that in the next lecture using three different tools.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.060
Secondly while we want to do is narrow down that list by assessing really is there search volume for

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.250
these keywords and we're going to use the Google Keyword planner tool.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.260
And then finally we want to finalize our key word selection by assessing that competition.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.200
Are we going to be able to compete for these key words and get to the top of the search results.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.390
So that's an overview of the process what we're going to cover and the rest is section.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.010
So let's get straight into it.
