Grade this lecture we want to look at his six ways to maximize the links from your SEO campaign.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.530
So these are really six strategies that are going to help you get the most amount of links possible

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.420
from your content campaigns.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.280
This is something you can do in the lead up to just after you release your piece of content whether

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.390
that be the SlideShare guy's posts and or whatever and for graphic cetra So that's the first one and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.630
that's to contact those that are revealing continues so you can use the openside Explorer to Hamas or

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.440
AAA crafts or Majestie guess you know tools and pull a list of from your own side of the people already

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.690
linking to you then you get informed and this you have this great new piece of content and there are

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.700
already Linked-In.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.380
There's a really high probability that they're going to link to you again.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.700
Secondly you want to contact your influencers so you've already engaged them with the ego based.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.790
Now is an opportunity for you to put a piece of content in there and help them support you and shared

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.960
and otherwise endorse you.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.700
So the next way then is to really reach out to your target so as is your potential customers you can

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.470
get to know that you've made this great resource.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.840
It should be useful to them if you're trying to make it useful to your audience so you can Latinized

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.190
tarnished you know maybe at the start in social media and then escalate to email if you need to.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.210
OK so the fourth way to get more links from your SEO campaigns is leverage your mailing.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.910
So this is just really how using your mailing list that you've been collecting as subscribers and inform

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.030
them that you've got some new content and include an embedded code for them if they want to.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.100
So it's easy for them to link to their users.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.250
OK.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.450
Fifthly the conversations have had back into the forums and blogs the message boards quite Q&A sites

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.040
and you know contextually and in that conversation I link back to your content when it makes sense when

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.140
it looks natural.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.400
And that's the food thoise to the six way then to find unlinked mentions so you can go back to the two

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.710
sumo you can go to another website will mention doneness identify where across the web people have mentioned

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.550
