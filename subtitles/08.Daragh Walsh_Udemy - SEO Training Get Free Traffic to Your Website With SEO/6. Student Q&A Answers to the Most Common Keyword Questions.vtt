00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.870
Congratulations on completing the research section of this course.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.240
By now I hope you know how to find a low competition high converting keywords.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.140
To summarize this section what I'd hope would maybe be a cool thing to do is I'm going to show you a

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.280
number of questions that I've received from students about 10 questions on keyword research and I think

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.860
but by going through each of these and answering each of these this will serve as a great summary to

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.270
this section and hopefully answer any questions that you might have if are if you've another question

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.970
I'd be delighted to take it.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:46.160
You can click on this chat icon here and leave another discussion for me.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.770
And if you like this type of form us just let me know as well because I'm happy to make these kind of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.570
Kootenays summaries for other sections of the Course as well.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.200
So let's get started with some more basic questions and then we'll get more advanced as we go through

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.250
.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.830
The first question here is from site Chandni Guess what are key words p words are very simply what people

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.280
are typing into the Google search bar when they're trying to find information.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.810
Know the word might be new to keyword but I guarantee the process is not.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.820
You probably do this 10 15 20 times a day.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.500
You go to Google and type in a word when you're trying to find information.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.040
This word is called a key word.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.740
So if you get more specific it can be a two three four five or eight key word that's known as a keyword

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.650
phrase key word and a key word phrase are essentially the same.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.640
We find the key words the same way in the google key we're planner or tool we assess them how competitive

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.240
they are the same way.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.750
And also in the next session I'll see how we optimize our content around them to say ways.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.670
There's no difference between a keyword and a keyword phrase in terms of RCO process.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.080
So next question here from Raj Kumar here is do you suggest choosing less competitive keywords.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.990
Absolutely yes.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.430
That's the whole purpose of this section.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.740
It's to find these lower competition keywords.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.290
The competition really there is the competition between the other web site owners who are all trying

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.390
to get to the top of the search results for that keyword.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.100
The reason everybody wants to get that up is because they want to get those visitors who are typing

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.250
that into Google to come to their sites.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.260
And so definitely we want to choose less competitive terms.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.250
And you know at a high level the way you can think about competition is that single word keywords will

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.810
be more competitive.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.310
So for example drones like we saw as a single word key word.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.880
It's going to have a lot more searches because it's less specific but it's also going to attract a lot

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.240
of competition because of that high number of searches.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.460
So what we want to focus on are these less competitive.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:16.770
Two word phrases or three and four key word phrases so drones that follow you drones with cameras follow

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.160
you et cetera.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.690
So I said in the in relation to the last question there is no difference in our A.U. process between

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.820
keywords and key phrases.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.420
But there is a difference in terms of their competitiveness.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.120
Generally as the keyword becomes more descriptive with more words it becomes less competitive.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.450
And so we really want to target those because it's easy for us to get to the top of search results and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.680
bring those visitors to our site.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.330
So next question here from chariot facility how many keywords can we optimize per page.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.780
I would really recommend that you just focus on one key word or key word phrase per page because you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.960
really want to make sure that Google understands what your web pages have buyers so that they can then

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.420
match it up to somebody who's searching in Google for that keyword phrase.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.540
So next question is from Jeff tears.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.600
He says that he has found a low competition keywords.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.080
He's used the most boring tool to check the top 10 search results for the keyword he's seen.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.230
They have a low page tortie you know below 20.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.520
So it'll be easy for him to get to the top of the search results for these keywords.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.190
However he is also known as not they have a lower amount of Monkley search volumes by you know 500 and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.110
below.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.080
So that's what you generally expect for lower competition.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:57.300
There's probably lower volume but what you can do is take a portfolio approach so as you said you should

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.330
target one keyword per page but that doesn't mean that you only target one word.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.750
You can have a number of pages targeting a number of different keywords and in aggregate the traffic

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.330
that you would be getting will be substantial.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.850
So you get one page talking about Pardue Kopra kits.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.120
You can have another page that's talking about you know the top 10 drones that follow you.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.260
The next page could be whatever.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.700
So you can have multiple different keywords that you're targeting bring in traffic from all those and

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:38.380
use in a portfolio approach you can still get a lot of traffic from these lower search.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.480
Q It's another question about the you were planning or tool from Rohit Kalita here you said.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.600
Can you explain what suggested it means in words.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.550
So this isn't really so relevant as CEO but it comes up as a common question.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.890
So I thought it answers really what Rohit is referring to here is this calling here suggest you bid

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:07.210
what you've got to remember is that the Google words Google planner tool is part of Google our words

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:16.140
Google onwards is really part of Google that you know sells these advertisements against the search

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.410
results so all of these are ads here.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.430
It's here.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:28.420
And the way that Google sells these ads is through an auction process and in an auction you bid first

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.680
.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:37.050
And what they are suggesting is that to win the auction you should have a period of two 13:9 per click

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.870
.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.420
You know in order to win the auction for this keyword.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:48.780
And so what we can use this information for FIRMAT Nescio perspective is to say OK whether someone is

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:57.390
paying for 35 per click for the keyword personalized travel coffee mugs then we know that must be highly

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.170
valuable traffic.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.040
Those visitors are probably very likely to make a purchase.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.110
And so we can rank organically in the search results just using a SEO that is going to be valuable traffic

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.640
.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.000
And so you know if that keyword is not so competitive it's going to be valuable.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.570
Q Right now the question we often get about the killer or tool is is the composition here showing us

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.410
the competition for us.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.370
And no it's not.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:34.980
This is the competition for the auction so high competition usually means a high amounts of people are

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.750
bidding for this keyword and low competition is a lower amount.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.340
It's not really reflective of how hard it is to get to the top of the search results for that keyword

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.940
.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:54.020
We want to use the process that I showed you with the Mars bar and looking at the top 10 results with

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.940
the page 20.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.420
So final question here from Tony Wilson he says where do we put the key word.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.880
So I've chosen that's really what we're going to talk about in the next section of the course the on

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.970
page optimization section of the course and again show you exactly what Upholders keywords that you've

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:18.270
chosen for each individual page so that Google knows what your web page is about it and they'll give

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.950
you the greatest chance of appearing at the top of the search results.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.450
So I hope you found this lecture helpful.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.570
