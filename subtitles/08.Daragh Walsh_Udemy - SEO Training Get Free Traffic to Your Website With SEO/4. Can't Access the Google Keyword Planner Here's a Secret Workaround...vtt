00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.960
So if you're trying to access the Google key planner tool after the last lecture and you're seeing that

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.520
you are being brought through these steps here that's OK.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.010
That's actually part of the new sign up process.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.710
You used to be able to skip through these steps in the past and access the tools straightaway.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.760
But it seems for a lot of countries now Google is forcing people through these steps.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.810
In almost every country countries I've heard a number of students say this is what I want to really

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.280
show you in this lecture is how to go through these steps.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.080
But essentially he won't be spending any money on a campaign.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.500
And you're going to essentially counsel the campaign as soon as it's set up you will need to put in

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650
some credit or debit card details.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.400
But I want to show you know how you can really set it up so you're not going to spend any money.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.230
We have to create a bit of an odd first and you get through to the second screen and it'll say your

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.560
bhajis here will be 10 Euros per day or something equivalent in your country and really you want to

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:10.260
change this to be as low as possible so he can put it as your budget being that's actually changed to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.550
say one 10 cents a day.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.170
And we also then want to go down here and says automatically set my bids to get the most clicks when

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.280
in my budget.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.840
So no you want to say I want to set my bids and myself on you want to change this to as low as possible

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.650
seems like 10 percent is the lowest amount possible.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.920
So what you've done is you change your budget to 10 cent which is going to give you zero clicks.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.160
Obviously you're not going to win any bids with a 10 cent Bridge which is perfect.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.290
So I don't want any clicks and no impressions that mean I'm going to spend money on my.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.180
This is Tencent as well.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.550
So it's really saving continue from there.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.590
You will need in this building part to putting your credit card details.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:14.070
But as you said we set it up so low that it is going to it's not going to there's going to be no bids

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.570
.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.890
And so what we want to just do is agree there.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.300
So once you're in here then you can highlight the campaign here.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:35.460
This is always just set up when you can go remove So now you have no campaigns that you can come in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.990
and access the till.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.490
So you just set it up put the bids very low and then counselors and then you have full access to the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.870
till
