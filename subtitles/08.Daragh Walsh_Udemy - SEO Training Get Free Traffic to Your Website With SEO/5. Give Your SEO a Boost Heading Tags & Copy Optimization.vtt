00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.100
Great.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.500
So let's have a quick look at heading Teigen copy optimization really the common theme here is that

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.220
search engines are going to give more credits if you make the text larger if you bolded a few for minors

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.380
.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.940
And that's why it's important to have the keywords in those particular places.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.930
So you know the first thing is really to place the key words in your heading tags.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.980
So different types of heading tags which really correlate to the different sizes of text so place the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.250
keywords in your page one page to page three times.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.610
When I show you in an example I think that's going to become really clear.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.880
So the other thing is that it's best to have 2000 plus words on the page.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.030
A huge study was done and conclusive evidence showed that the longer is really the better.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.030
You know in that in all those were in our copy what you want to do is include the exact key word about

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.290
two to three times you want to drop the key word in the first hundred words.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.150
And so so good to bold and Tulsa's or underlying the exact word to draw attention to this.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.280
So that's really.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.360
Let's return to our example now.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.100
I think when I show you an example of all these best practices Ill bring it to life all the more.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.170
Let's first talk about the heading tags.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.590
So as I said it's important to have a key word in the heading types and the good news is for the hate

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.640
.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.270
One TYG generally in wordpress it's all in the title of the post is automatically wrapped into the page

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.070
one tag.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.660
So a few key words in there that's going to appear.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.310
Now Page two tags if you want to set that up you just really format us by selecting page 2.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.680
So again I've got the key word there are benefits of Eurail optimization.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.660
And finally in Page 3 Tigi examples of your oil optimization.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.080
Best Parks's.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670
So that covers often having tags.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.300
Let's talk again about the Copie optimization so he can see I've got my key word in the first 100 words

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.590
.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.370
I've bolded and italicized as well.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.890
I haven't got 2000 plus words on the page but obviously that wouldn't be good to do as well.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.300
So finally just scrolling down again and reviewing the overview from our WordPress SEO by Yeo's plug

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.680
in we can see that that content section has gone green because I've included the key word in the content

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.520
as well.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.900
So that really wraps up the piece as well and all is looking very positive and great on page optimization

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.000
.
