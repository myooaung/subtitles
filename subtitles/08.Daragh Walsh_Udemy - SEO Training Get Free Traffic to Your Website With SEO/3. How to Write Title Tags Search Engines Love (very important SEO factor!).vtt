00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.660
In this lecture I'm going to show you how you can optimize your title tank for the search engines.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.470
If you've got a WordPress site we're going to show you a really cool free plug in that will help you

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.070
get this right every single time.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.140
I'll show you how to do it for an on wordpress site as well.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.590
And we'll also show you how to do it for a local business because there's one key consideration you'll

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.870
have to remember to optimize a local business title time for search engines.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.690
So what really is the title type.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.480
Well it's essentially the title of the page and it's the most important indication that you can tell

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.390
Google what your web page is really about.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.680
It's no coincidence that I've typed in home insurance here is a search on all of the pages in the search

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.560
results have come up with home insurance as a key word in the title.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.510
So as you can probably guess it's really important in your title time to include the key word that you're

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.250
targeting that you think people will be typing into the search engines.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.610
And you want to have that as close to the front of the title Teich as possible as you can see all of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.410
these guys have them.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.430
Another place you can see the title Time is when you open a separate time you can see cheap home insurance

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.730
here and that has the same title tied there.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.710
This can be really good in terms of your users.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.610
If there were multiple tabs open and they want to get back to your site you can really make sure that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.820
they know what this size and buy so they can click back to it easily.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100
Now if you're a local business what's important to remember is that people in the search engines are

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.500
most likely after they type in the keyword is to put in a location so you can imagine say I live in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.220
Dublin and I could type in dentist Dublin and you can see that the web pages that are coming up at the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.710
top obviously our web pages have that keyword at the start of their title.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.690
You can also see that they've included the neighborhood that they're in.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.770
And also this is kind of the zip code here as well.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.110
So I would if you're a local business I'd really encourage you to include as much of the information

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.130
in the title tag as well as you can capture all of those types of searches as well.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.980
Dublin dentist dentist Portabello dentist the names you could have a chance to rank for all those terms

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.130
.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.010
So as well as including your key word in the title time what you want to do is make sure that it's the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.820
correct length and you want to keep it at 55 characters.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.190
Otherwise Google is going to cut it off and it won't appear in the search results so you can see here

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.280
that this tile tag is too long and I'm not getting the full information.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.320
You can see here this one is too long as well.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.350
Could of this one as well.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.430
So those guys could really maybe rework that title Teich and only show what is really important in the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.140
55 characters.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.470
You can see here this one is good.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.750
This one's probably better because this kind of something enticing wittedness and these guys will in

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.420
the long so insurance you can count on this is probably one of the best things because it has that the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.890
key word again and something you know kind of a value proposition so that you understand the theory

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.910
.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.960
I want to show you how to put it into practice.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.940
As I said for WordPress site is a really great plug in that could help you with this.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.770
You can just come in to plug in new type in SEO and download this plug in here you can see that I've

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.390
already got it installed and that will come up then as a tab.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.190
The sidebar here.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.620
So now that you've got that installed and you want to create a new page or update an existing page what

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.330
you can do is scroll down to the post as you plug in here you can type in the key word that you're trying

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.920
to focus on.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.540
So let's just imagine that I was trying to recreate page we were looking at and what it says here is

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.870
that the focus keyword does not appear in the page title and that's OK because we haven't written the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.980
page title.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.180
Yes.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.320
So let's just take this page right here.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:28.350
As an example I'm going to pop it in to the article here and it says now that the page title contains

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.230
the focus keyword.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.880
However we can see that it's a little bit long here it's getting cut off.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.140
So we're going to come up to this snippet at Ed. here.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.510
And I'm just going to take this again and pop it in here.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:52.370
So really what I'm taking at is this terrible last there so you could just pop that in there.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.180
Now you can see that the page title is the correct length.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.040
It also contains the focus keyword at the beginning which is considered to improve rankings.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.270
So if you're using some other type of web site builders should be very straightforward to set the title

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.020
tight.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:17.490
And if you're doing it in hate mail you can just come to title not in the title there and then it's

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.300
close brackets as per normal.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.000
So just recapping what you've learnt in this length share and remember when you're optimizing the title

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.670
tag to make sure you include the key word include the key word at the start of the title TYG.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.760
If you've got a local business make sure to put keyword plus location that can be city neighborhood

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.830
zip code etc..

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.040
Also make sure the title tag is not more than 55 five characters in length.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.800
Otherwise they will be cut off and me as a searcher I won't get the full message.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.180
If you've got a WordPress site I suggest that ios SEO plug in it will make sure you get it right every

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.670
single time.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.940
And if you've got a nerd type Web site builder or hate mail you're coding in now it should be pretty

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.440
straightforward as well.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.220
The final thing to remember is that a title tag is set for every single page on your website.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.550
So make sure that for the different pages on your Web site that you're trying to rank for that show

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.570
you have a unique title tag telling Google what the page is about.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.080
Maybe your contact page your testimonials page.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.830
There won't be a need to optimize that too much and put for Daphne for content blog posts home page

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.010
.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.620
The main page is in categories on your site.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.880
You really want to make sure all of these title ties are unique
