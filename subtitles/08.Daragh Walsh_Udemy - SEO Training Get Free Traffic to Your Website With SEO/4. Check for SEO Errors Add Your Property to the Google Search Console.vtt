In this lecture I'm going to show you how you can add a website to the Google webmaster's tool.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.500
Now also known as search console and the value in doing this is that you can use this tool to identify

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.820
any technical errors on your web site then correct those errors so that all of the client's web pages

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.910
will appear in the search results.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.600
Decline can also use this tool on an ongoing basis to find out water.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.170
The key words that are leading people to their web pages so that they can find out what are the most

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.360
popular pages in search terms.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.370
Create more content around that and really for other traffic.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.590
So by setting this up for the client and giving them access you're giving them a very valuable source

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.200
of data.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.470
Health care there is sort of kick off the process you can come to Google dot com forward slash web masters

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.260
and then sign in to search Konsole next thing that you're going to really do is the you or all of this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.390
size in here and the property.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.810
So the next thing that we need to do is verify that you are the owner of this size and really the easiest

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.350
way to do is if you've got a WordPress site is to use a particular plugin.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.070
So when your Wordpress dashboard you can come over to plug ins here and new and then really search for

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.710
the plug in called Host.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.210
See you can see that I've already got iron installed here and once you've got on installed you come

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.960
down to the top here and then come up to the general subtype here.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.640
And really what we want to do over to here is the web tool.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.490
And now we go back to the search console.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:57.540
Want to take this code and we want to get it in here and we just click safe so you can see automatically

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.340
that code has been shortened.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.250
And that's absolutely perfect.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.620
So and then that man that that saves on a WordPress site we just want to come back and click verify

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.950
and we can see that that has been successfully confirmed that where the owner of the site and we can

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.670
really click Continue.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.440
So if you're building a non WordPress site what you can do is take this minute tag here and pasted into

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.870
your site's home page in the header section and then again you'll come back here and really verify that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.900
it's worked OK.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
So now that we're in our dashboard I'm going to show you the remainder of this section a couple of other

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.340
items that you can do to really Vonni to the client.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.810
And then finally if you want to give them access to this now once you set it up you can come up here

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.750
to this little gear icon.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.020
Click on user and property owners and really add a new user pop in their email address.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.120
You can probably give them full access and then they can have access to all of this information as well

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.420
.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.100
So I think this is a really good way that you can add value to your Web site Bill.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.460
And another way to really help increase your Web site fee
