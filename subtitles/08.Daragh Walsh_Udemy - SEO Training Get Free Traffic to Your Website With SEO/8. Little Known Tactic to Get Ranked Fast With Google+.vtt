00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.490
So when in previous lecture we learn that social signals from Web sites like Facebook and Twitter were

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.310
only indirectly in parent and a CEO meaning that activity and captions on those sites will not really

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.060
influence what appears in the search engine results.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.790
However the one exception to that is Google plus the social network of Google itself connections and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:34.260
shares on that social network will actually directly impact what appears in the search engine results

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.760
.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.650
This is absolutely huge because it gives you a huge shortcut to getting to the top of the search engine

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.680
results and really you only have today maybe one tenth of the work that she would have to do with normal

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.130
link building to get to the top of the search.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.470
So so this is not that well-known.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.270
And I think were going to hear a lot more about this over the next two years so I wanted to let you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.330
in on it now.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.450
Let's discuss this a little bit more.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.110
So let's look at an example now of how Google Plus can influence what appears in the first page of Google

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.310
.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.330
So as you can see I'm logged into my Google account and I've typed in air purifier here and as you can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.050
see on our Mars bar here though we've got a pretty high page authority and domain authority and links

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.310
for these sites.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.120
So obviously that's the traditional reason why they're on the first page otherwise is because they're

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.570
localized companies dot These are companies and arland So this is probably the type of product you want

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.580
to buy locally.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.390
That's why they're appearing.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.280
And Google is putting those in front of my search as well.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.770
But here down the bottom you can see that there is a Google plus post from a company called carriÃ¨re

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.400
Plus they're based in the U.S..

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.770
So doesn't it make a lot of sense here for local reasons.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.810
There is no links on the page and so widely appearing here.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.890
Well the reason really is is because I'm actually following these kinds.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240
On Google Plus.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.150
So I started following them a couple of months ago.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.870
Just because it's news and content there.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.960
But I haven't had any engagement engagement with them since so still the connection is really powerful

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.960
in terms of what's appearing on the first page you will for that particular search term.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.690
You may be thinking OK that's great but not a lot of my audience are on Google Plus.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.480
Well you've got to remember that Google Plus is actually the second biggest social network anybody has

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.200
a G-mail account anybody has a YouTube account automatically has a Google Plus account and so there's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.060
great scope there for getting your audience onto Google Plus.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.530
So the beauty of this is that you don't even need to have a big following on Google Plus if you can

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.550
get your content in front of the key influencers in your knees.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.900
And they plus one is and they share to their audience will then when their audience goes in search using

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.720
Google for a particular search term and your content matches up with that.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.660
And even much better chance of appearing on the first page of Google because they're connected to your

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.700
influencers.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.000
So that is extremely powerful.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.010
And the strategy that she should take advantage of.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.960
So just a quick technical tip when you are setting up a code post page for your business.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.850
You first go into your normal profile and then you set up a particular page for your business so it's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.920
a bit like Facebook pages.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.070
If you've ever set one of those up so there you go work away on that strategy and really take advantage

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.900
of this remarkable opportunity
