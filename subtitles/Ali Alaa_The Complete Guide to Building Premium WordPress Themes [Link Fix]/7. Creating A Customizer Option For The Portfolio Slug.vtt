00:03.100 --> 00:09.090
So let's in this lecture create an option to change this URL  slug here.

1
00:09.090 --> 00:10.740
So you might think this is easy.

2
00:10.740 --> 00:15.000
We'll just add an option in the Customizer and we already know how to do that.

3
00:15.000 --> 00:22.910
And then when we create or post type we'll just instead of typing "portfolio" here we'll get it from the

4
00:23.210 --> 00:28.540
theme option. But actually there is a couple of tricky points in this option.

5
00:28.610 --> 00:31.510
So that's why I decided to do it.

6
00:31.540 --> 00:40.370
So first let's go to customize.php. And let's add this option in the general setting.

7
00:40.670 --> 00:42.910
So I think you already know how to add options.

8
00:42.920 --> 00:44.180
We've done it before.

9
00:44.300 --> 00:47.410
So I'm just gonna paste these.

10
00:48.130 --> 00:51.070
So I just added a new setting "portfolio_slug".

11
00:51.410 --> 00:58.250
And it has default value and sanitizing and you already know that. And the control for it which is a textfield

12
00:59.180 --> 01:01.310
inside the General section.

13
01:01.460 --> 01:07.760
So let's save and let's go to the Customizer.

14
01:07.920 --> 01:18.760
And now in the General Options we have the Slug. So now you might think I'm gonna go to this file and type

15
01:18.760 --> 01:22.230
here get_theme_mod() and then the name of the setting.

16
01:22.880 --> 01:23.860
But actually it's not.

17
01:23.890 --> 01:29.370
You can do that but it's not a good practice to use a theme option inside a plugin, right?

18
01:29.620 --> 01:37.330
So it's much cleaner to somehow use this option inside of the theme and WordPress actually makes this pretty

19
01:37.330 --> 01:38.440
easy.

20
01:38.440 --> 01:45.100
We have a filter that you can use to filter these $args. So we can run this filter in the theme and then

21
01:45.100 --> 01:49.270
we can modify the rewrite key in the arguments.

22
01:49.270 --> 01:54.420
So let's go to, let's put it in the theme, in functions.php.

23
01:58.590 --> 02:00.470
Let's add filter.

24
02:00.590 --> 02:07.120
It's called "register_post_type_args". And let's create a new function.

25
02:07.310 --> 02:10.170
Let's call it "_themename_filter_portfolio".

26
02:10.370 --> 02:16.390
And it takes two arguments. So let's define this function.

27
02:19.980 --> 02:26.100
And the two arguments are the $args of course and the $post_type.

28
02:26.100 --> 02:34.120
So this filter will run for all custom post types and we need only to modify the portfolio post type.

29
02:34.630 --> 02:37.740
So let's do a quick check here. "if ($post_type"

30
02:38.170 --> 02:39.110
is equals to

31
02:39.150 --> 02:45.430
and then you add the slug of the post type which is this one.

32
02:45.640 --> 02:51.740
If so we need to modify the $args and then return it, right?

33
02:53.290 --> 03:02.600
So what do we need to modify in the args? We need to modify the "rewrite" and the "slug" inside the rewrite.

34
03:02.620 --> 03:08.870
So let's set this to get_theme_() and then the name of the setting,

35
03:10.730 --> 03:21.850
this one. And the "default", let's default it to it "portfolio". So let's save now and let's go.

36
03:22.080 --> 03:28.040
And let's refresh. And let's modify this, maybe add an "s" here.

37
03:29.070 --> 03:33.310
And publish. And then let's go to your URL

38
03:33.320 --> 03:41.260
and then "/portfolios" and it's not gonna work. And I think you should know why,

39
03:41.270 --> 03:42.370
right?

40
03:42.440 --> 03:50.330
We need to update our rewrite rules. So let's save this and let's try to refresh again.

41
03:50.660 --> 03:52.190
And it's also not working.

42
03:52.190 --> 03:57.030
I think I've mistyped "portfolios".  

43
03:57.140 --> 04:01.620
And as you can see it's working and "portfolio" will not be working anymore.

44
04:02.190 --> 04:03.120
So that's great.

45
04:03.160 --> 04:11.060
But every time the user changes the slug, he'll need to go to the permalinks and save. So we can, you know

46
04:11.060 --> 04:16.910
write here in the description that you have to do that, but it will be great if we do that automatically

47
04:17.000 --> 04:20.630
when the user change this field, right?

48
04:21.670 --> 04:28.650
So what we can do is we can use a WordPress action that will fire every time you publish the Customizer.

49
04:29.110 --> 04:40.670
So let's go here and let's "add_action". And this one is called "customizer_save_after" or actually "customize_

50
04:40.670 --> 04:52.950
save_after". And let's create a function. Let's call it "_themename" and let's call it the same name.

51
04:53.860 --> 05:00.650
And let's create this function. And after saving this function will fire.

52
05:00.750 --> 05:08.670
So we can just call the flush_rewrite_rules() function.

53
05:08.740 --> 05:09.660
So let's see.

54
05:15.890 --> 05:21.450
And let's try to set it back to "portfolio". So now before saving

55
05:21.630 --> 05:25.220
let's imagine what will happen because it's not gonna work.

56
05:25.740 --> 05:27.640
So what will happen is we will publish,

57
05:27.630 --> 05:28.800
right?

58
05:28.950 --> 05:36.270
And this action will run, this function will run and flush rewrite rules will be called.

59
05:36.780 --> 05:43.690
But when flush_rewrite_rules() is called the post type is already registered with the old name. Or

60
05:43.690 --> 05:50.110
in other words when this function is called the "int" action has already fired and the post type has

61
05:50.110 --> 05:58.080
already been registered. And it's registered using this filter and this filter will contain the get_theme_mod()

62
05:58.090 --> 06:01.450
which will contain the old value.

63
06:01.600 --> 06:02.890
Right?

64
06:02.920 --> 06:09.550
So let's just try and publish. And let's go to "portfolio".

65
06:10.030 --> 06:12.200
And as you can see it's not gonna work.

66
06:12.310 --> 06:21.830
But now when we refresh the page this "init" action rerun and the filter for the arguments. And the filter for

67
06:21.880 --> 06:24.220
the arguments will contain the new value.

68
06:24.220 --> 06:25.260
Right?

69
06:25.330 --> 06:32.110
So now what we'll have to do is to save again so that when the flush_rewrite_rules() run, the custom post

70
06:32.110 --> 06:35.840
type will be registered with the new name.

71
06:35.890 --> 06:37.370
So I hope I'm making sense.

72
06:38.460 --> 06:45.500
So let's try now and save. Let's refresh and let's save this again.

73
06:47.190 --> 06:51.520
So let's change any value and save.

74
06:55.560 --> 06:57.500
And let's refresh now.

75
06:57.680 --> 06:59.150
And now we have it.

76
06:59.690 --> 07:05.300
So we introduced a new problem now. And this problem is similar to the one that happened when we were

77
07:05.300 --> 07:11.600
creating or activation and deactivation hooks for the plugin. And just in case you still don't understand

78
07:11.660 --> 07:12.350
the problem.

79
07:12.380 --> 07:18.980
In a nutshell when we click publish here the post type has already been registered and it's registered

80
07:19.280 --> 07:22.160
with the old name not the one that you update here.

81
07:23.720 --> 07:30.000
So when the flush_rewrite_rules() run it will see that you have a post type but with the old name.

82
07:30.200 --> 07:36.730
So that's why we have to save twice in order for the setting to reflect. So let's try and solve this problem

83
07:36.740 --> 07:37.780
in the next lecture.
