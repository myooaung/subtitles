00:03.180 --> 00:11.120
So in the last section we completed the single.php template. But we still have the comments part missing here,

1
00:11.130 --> 00:12.380
right?

2
00:12.450 --> 00:19.020
So let's in this section learn how to display the comments. And we'll also learn how to completely customize

3
00:19.320 --> 00:21.090
the markup for the comments.

4
00:21.480 --> 00:25.210
But before doing that let's just do some clean up in our code.

5
00:25.510 --> 00:31.350
So remember in the index.php and in the archive.php when we wanted to display the

6
00:31.350 --> 00:34.080
loop we used get_template_part() and then loop.

7
00:34.080 --> 00:40.050
And then if we are in the archive we use loop archive so that the child theme developers can create a custom

8
00:40.050 --> 00:42.440
template part just for the archive page,

9
00:42.450 --> 00:43.390
right?

10
00:43.410 --> 00:47.160
So let's do the same thing for the single.php.

11
00:47.400 --> 00:56.960
So here we have the loop index and the loop archive. So let's do loop single here and move this code to a template

12
00:56.970 --> 00:57.360
part.

13
01:00.070 --> 01:09.970
So let's open PHP and then get_template_part(). And this will be "loop" and then "single".

14
01:15.830 --> 01:28.100
So let's now create a new file in the root folder and let's call it loop-single.php. And just paste the content

15
01:28.100 --> 01:35.870
for the single.php.

16
01:35.930 --> 01:38.070
So now we have our single page.

17
01:38.090 --> 01:39.840
Nothing has changed.

18
01:39.860 --> 01:42.940
We just did some cleanup here.

19
01:43.030 --> 01:49.130
Let's now display the comments and to do that we'll use a function called comments_template().

20
01:49.220 --> 01:52.400
So this open PHP tag after the navigation.

21
02:03.560 --> 02:09.490
So let's save and take a look now. And as you can see we have a comment form now.

22
02:09.920 --> 02:11.480
But we also have warning.

23
02:11.800 --> 02:17.830
So WordPress will load the default comments form here but it also mentions that you should have your own comments.php

24
02:17.850 --> 02:19.160
file in your theme.

25
02:19.350 --> 02:21.650
And that's actually what we will do in the next lecture.

26
02:21.750 --> 02:26.580
But in this lecture let's tackle a couple of points before creating our comments.php.

27
02:26.610 --> 02:27.810
file.

28
02:28.080 --> 02:32.450
So let's go and find the post, let's type "comments" here.

29
02:35.010 --> 02:38.230
So we've here a post with comments disabled.

30
02:42.000 --> 02:46.950
And if you go to the comments part you'll find a string "Comments are closed", right?

31
02:47.280 --> 02:57.920
So when you create a post let's go to the wp-admin.

32
02:58.010 --> 03:02.600
So when you create a post you can have the option to disable comments, right, here in discussion.

33
03:02.600 --> 03:06.150
You can disable comments. So when comments are disabled

34
03:06.230 --> 03:11.570
we'll have this string here "Comments are closed." But we actually don't need to load the comments form at

35
03:11.570 --> 03:12.010
all,

36
03:12.140 --> 03:13.090
if comments are disabled.

37
03:13.130 --> 03:13.550
Right?

38
03:13.580 --> 03:24.990
So let's go to the loop-single.php. Let's and an if condition and we've function called comments_open(). So if comments

39
03:24.980 --> 03:32.630
are open for this post, we will display the comments template. So let's save now.

40
03:33.890 --> 03:38.280
And as you can see for the disabled comments post we don't have the form at all.

41
03:38.630 --> 03:42.500
But also there is a possibility that a post used to have comments open.

42
03:42.500 --> 03:44.300
So it has some comments in it.

43
03:44.690 --> 03:47.660
But then you decided to close or disable the comments.

44
03:47.840 --> 03:51.590
So we'll have some comments that we would like to display but at the same time you would like to stop

45
03:51.590 --> 03:53.050
people from commenting.

46
03:53.050 --> 03:53.800
Right?

47
03:53.870 --> 04:00.110
So let's modify this condition here in order to display the comments template if we have comments for

48
04:00.110 --> 04:07.030
this post. So or and then a function called get_comments_number().

49
04:07.370 --> 04:14.220
So if we have comments for this post even if the comments are disabled also display the comments template.

50
04:14.480 --> 04:18.740
And then when we create the comments template we'll make sure to display the comments. But if the

51
04:18.740 --> 04:24.800
comments are disabled we will display a message of the existing comments that you can't add comments anymore.

52
04:24.880 --> 04:25.610
Right?

53
04:25.880 --> 04:34.440
So let's go now to another post in the dummy post. And this one will be the "Template: Comments".

54
04:36.460 --> 04:40.020
And this one will have all sorts of comments that you could imagine.

55
04:40.510 --> 04:46.040
And this post is made just to test the comments template. So we have here a long

56
04:46.050 --> 04:52.990
a very long comment that contains all the HTML elements. And then we have some other comments.

57
04:53.280 --> 04:58.570
And as you can see comments can be nested. And this can be changed from the wp-admin. So let's go to

58
04:58.620 --> 05:06.370
wp-admin and Settings and Discussion. And here you have the comment setting.s So you can enable nested

59
05:06.460 --> 05:09.550
or a threaded comments. And you can choose a depth as well.

60
05:09.820 --> 05:10.900
So the default is 5.

61
05:10.900 --> 05:14.470
So here we have a maximum depth of 5.

62
05:14.470 --> 05:19.490
After that it will stay in the same level. So 6 and 7 and 8 are all at the same level as 5,

63
05:19.750 --> 05:20.360
right?

64
05:20.650 --> 05:23.950
And you also have a "Reply" button here.

65
05:24.100 --> 05:30.700
So if you click on the "Reply" button the page will refresh and then you will have a form at the bottom

66
05:30.880 --> 05:36.290
which will say "Leave a Reply to" and the person you want to reply for. And if you click "Cancel" the page with

67
05:36.290 --> 05:43.330
the refresh again and this form will be the regular comments form. And then you can reply to another

68
05:43.330 --> 05:43.890
one.

69
05:45.010 --> 05:46.740
So this is kind of weird right?

70
05:46.820 --> 05:49.900
To refresh the whole page if you want to reply to someone.

71
05:49.900 --> 05:52.720
It's a bit of an unexpected behavior, right?

72
05:52.720 --> 05:58.810
I would expect that if you click reply here a form will appear below the comment. And then you can reply.

73
05:59.260 --> 06:01.460
And WordPress actually allows us to do that.

74
06:01.570 --> 06:08.080
But it's done using JavaScript. So WordPress has some JavaScript functions that will trigger when you click

75
06:08.140 --> 06:13.420
on reply and add a form below the comment. And you can reply to the comment.

76
06:13.480 --> 06:16.780
But in order for this to work you have to enqueue these JavaScript functions

77
06:16.790 --> 06:19.990
in our theme. So let's go to enqueue scripts

78
06:22.930 --> 06:24.300
or enqueue-assets.

79
06:24.740 --> 06:32.420
And then when we enqueue script here in the "wp_enqueue_scripts" function or action we need to enqueue a certain file

80
06:32.420 --> 06:38.380
here. So "wp_enqueue_script()" and the "handle" for this file.

81
06:38.440 --> 06:39.770
This file is included in WordPress.

82
06:39.800 --> 06:44.380
So we don't have to type the source and dependencies and that sort of stuff.

83
06:44.480 --> 06:46.340
We just need to type the "handle".

84
06:46.580 --> 06:50.060
So the handle is called "comment-reply".

85
06:50.720 --> 06:56.180
So when we enqueue this handle WordPress will go and get the comments reply file from the WordPress

86
06:56.180 --> 06:56.770
core.

87
06:57.050 --> 07:03.070
So let's save that. And let's go back here and let's click "Reply" now.

88
07:03.470 --> 07:06.890
And as you can see our JavaScript functions are working.

89
07:08.470 --> 07:10.240
So let's just view source here.

90
07:11.440 --> 07:20.510
Let's search for "comment-reply" and as you can see comment-reply is included in wp-includes/js and

91
07:20.510 --> 07:21.170
so on.

92
07:21.170 --> 07:26.870
So when you enqueue a JavaScript file that is included in WordPress, in the wp-includes you just have to

93
07:26.990 --> 07:32.030
type its handle, its name and you won't have to type any other arguments here.

94
07:32.030 --> 07:38.640
One more thing we only need to load this file in the single page for this reply button to work.

95
07:38.940 --> 07:45.180
But in any other pages we won't actually have to load this file. So we can do an improvement here to avoid loading

96
07:45.180 --> 07:50.490
this file in other pages when we actually don't need it. So we can check is_singular().

97
07:50.970 --> 07:53.840
So is_single() will return "true" only for posts

98
07:53.910 --> 07:59.280
and post types, custom post types. But it will return "false" for pages and attachments.

99
07:59.470 --> 08:04.080
is_singular() will return "true" for posts, pages and attachments.

100
08:04.080 --> 08:07.710
And we use is_singular() because pages can also have comments,

101
08:07.890 --> 08:11.160
not only posts. So if you used is_single() for a page,

102
08:11.250 --> 08:12.760
it will return "false".

103
08:12.990 --> 08:18.330
So you also need to check that comments are open because if comments are closed nobody can reply

104
08:18.360 --> 08:20.600
and we won't have to load this file.

105
08:20.940 --> 08:24.520
We also need to check that nested comments are enabled in the wp-admin.

106
08:24.630 --> 08:26.850
So it's all here in the wp-admin settings

107
08:27.990 --> 08:32.820
that you can enable and disable threaded comments. So if threaded comments are disabled,

108
08:32.820 --> 08:34.000
there is no need to load this file.

109
08:34.020 --> 08:36.810
Because there will be no "Reply" button.

110
08:37.510 --> 08:44.050
And to get that we will use a function called get_option(). And the "option" name for the threaded comments

111
08:44.090 --> 08:52.610
is called "thread_comments".

112
08:52.720 --> 08:59.990
So this way we will make sure that the comment-reply file is only loaded when it's really needed, right?

113
09:00.660 --> 09:03.860
So let's make sure it's working fine now.

114
09:04.780 --> 09:08.790
And here let's reply and it's working fine.

115
09:09.000 --> 09:09.580
All right.

116
09:09.580 --> 09:13.510
So finally we need to create the comments.php file.

117
09:13.510 --> 09:18.270
So remember when we created the search form. We used the function called get_search_form() and the WordPress

118
09:18.280 --> 09:21.170
loaded a default markup for the search form.

119
09:21.320 --> 09:28.540
But then when we needed to customize this markup we created a file called searchform.php. Same

120
09:28.540 --> 09:32.260
for the comments. When we need to override the comments template

121
09:32.290 --> 09:39.760
we can create a function or a file called comments.php and this file will be used for the

122
09:39.820 --> 09:44.060
comments template. So actually create this in the lib.

123
09:44.230 --> 09:46.710
So let's delete this and create another one.

124
09:48.600 --> 09:58.340
So we need to create in the root directory. So comments.php and save

125
09:58.350 --> 10:07.210
now. And now we will have, let's just type one string. And now we'll have this file loaded instead of the default

126
10:07.210 --> 10:07.600
one.

127
10:07.740 --> 10:13.150
So in the next lecture let's see what we should do in order to fill this comments.php form.
