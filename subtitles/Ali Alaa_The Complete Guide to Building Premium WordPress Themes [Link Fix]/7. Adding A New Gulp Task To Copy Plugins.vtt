00:03.200 --> 00:10.050
So let's now create a gulp task that will go to our plugins folder. And by plugins folder I mean the plugins folder

1
00:10.050 --> 00:14.660
inside wp-content. And it will go to our plugin.

2
00:14.670 --> 00:24.210
And in the packaged folder, it will take this file and move it to our theme in the lib and plugins. So that

3
00:24.210 --> 00:27.980
it will be included automatically when we build our theme.

4
00:28.470 --> 00:38.480
Let's go to the gulpfile in our theme, all right, no in our plugin. And let's create another one of these

5
00:39.410 --> 00:40.940
for our plugins.

6
00:41.000 --> 00:43.100
So let's create a new key "plugins:"

7
00:45.710 --> 00:53.180
And the "src:" will be, it will be an array because we'llhave multiple plugins in the future.

8
00:53.480 --> 00:54.770
But for now we only have one plugin.

9
00:54.770 --> 01:02.210
So if you're currently inside our theme, gulpfile is inside our theme, so we need to go up and now we are

10
01:02.210 --> 01:03.260
in the theme's folder.

11
01:03.410 --> 01:04.410
So let's go up again.

12
01:04.430 --> 01:06.600
And now we are in wp-content.

13
01:06.860 --> 01:17.680
And then inside wp-content we need to go to plugins. And then I need to go to our plugin's name.

14
01:17.740 --> 01:23.690
So let's copy this. Then the packaged.

15
01:24.240 --> 01:29.490
So let's copy this. I like to copy and paste so that I won't make a silly typo.

16
01:29.910 --> 01:36.660
And then you can use the * here to get whatever inside the packaged folder which will be this

17
01:36.660 --> 01:36.840
one.

18
01:40.250 --> 01:52.070
And the destination, we need to put this zip file inside lib and plugins.

19
01:52.430 --> 01:56.710
So this task will be exactly like the "copy" task that we created,

20
01:56.930 --> 02:10.380
this one. So let's actually copy this and we will just have to, let's call it "copyPlugins" and paths of plugins. And here

21
02:10.560 --> 02:19.290
also. So the pipe() will just move the whatever in the source directories and put it in the destination.

22
02:21.060 --> 02:26.560
And when do we need to run this task? It's when we build and bundle our file.

23
02:26.690 --> 02:33.050
So in the build, after we run the "styles" and "scripts" and the this parallel tasks, let's run "copyPlugins".

24
02:35.210 --> 02:40.010
And when we bundle build will be run so, this task will be run as well.

25
02:40.590 --> 02:42.220
So let's try this now.

26
02:44.460 --> 02:50.720
So in our theme, let's remove it just to check if it's working

27
02:51.030 --> 02:56.520
when we build our theme. So inside our theme directory now let's run "npm run bundle".

28
03:01.870 --> 03:03.930
And as you can see it run copyPlugins.

29
03:03.930 --> 03:08.570
So let's go now to packaged and let's remove this.

30
03:08.570 --> 03:19.320
And let's unzip this. And go to lib/plugins. And as you can see here got this from the plugins folder.

31
03:19.570 --> 03:25.260
So right now when we update a plugin and build it again we won't have to worry about going to the

32
03:25.260 --> 03:31.700
packaged folder in the plug directly and copying the plugin in the plugins folder in the lib directory.

33
03:31.710 --> 03:34.260
This will automatically happen when we build our theme.

34
03:34.620 --> 03:38.620
So I think this was a good improvement for JavaScript workflow.

35
03:39.060 --> 03:43.550
So we've done a lot of work in this section and I know some of it might be confusing.

36
03:43.650 --> 03:49.410
Make sure to watch the last lecture again if you're still a bit confused. What we did in this section will

37
03:49.410 --> 03:55.760
actually save us a lot of time when we create other plugins for other features in our theme.

38
03:55.820 --> 03:57.830
So that was it for this section.

39
03:57.830 --> 04:04.140
Let me know if you would be interested in a course for creating like a many advanced custom fields 

40
04:04.160 --> 04:07.570
plugin on your own. And see you in the next lecture.
