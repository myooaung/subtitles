00:03.060 --> 00:08.190
So in the last lecture we took a quick look on how WordPress manages images. And then we mentioned

1
00:08.190 --> 00:14.670
that we may need to add some custom sizes other than the sizes that WordPress provides by default.

2
00:14.670 --> 00:15.520
Right?

3
00:15.690 --> 00:20.430
And to do that WordPress provides a function called add_image_size().

4
00:20.470 --> 00:28.060
So let's first take a look at the documentation for this function.

5
00:28.110 --> 00:31.630
So the add_image_size() function; it takes a "name" for the image.

6
00:31.740 --> 00:36.370
So we have "large", "medium" and so on. And here we can choose our own name for the image size.

7
00:36.540 --> 00:40.440
And it takes the "width" and the "height". And it also takes "crop".

8
00:40.650 --> 00:46.710
And this is a boolean or an array and it will decide if the image will be cropped and how exactly it will

9
00:46.710 --> 00:47.460
be cropped.

10
00:47.460 --> 00:56.330
So to use this function we should call it inside the theme-support action. So let's go to theme-support.

11
00:56.970 --> 01:01.830
And we should call it actually inside the after theme set up actions. So let's call it now.

12
01:01.860 --> 01:06.870
Let's add_image_size() and the name should also be prefixed.

13
01:06.870 --> 01:08.300
So let's call it "_themename-".

14
01:08.730 --> 01:11.800
And let's use the image size that we will create in our blog.

15
01:11.850 --> 01:20.430
So maybe we can call it "blog-image" or something. So let's say we want an image of a width of 1200 and

16
01:20.430 --> 01:22.260
a height of 500.

17
01:25.330 --> 01:27.240
So the "crop" is defaulted to "false".

18
01:27.250 --> 01:33.820
So if you did not define the crop the new custom size will have a maximum width of 1200

19
01:34.060 --> 01:39.690
and a maximum height of 500, but it won't be cropped it will be just scaled, right?

20
01:40.050 --> 01:46.910
But let's now try and set the crop to "true". Let's copy the name of the size.

21
01:47.110 --> 01:51.910
And when you call this function instead of medium, let's get the size that we've just created.

22
01:54.890 --> 01:55.600
Let's take a look now.

23
01:55.620 --> 02:02.360
And let's inspect or actually let's instead of this function, let's get the URL.

24
02:08.100 --> 02:11.250
And as you can see it returns to the original image.

25
02:11.280 --> 02:13.680
There is no size here after the image.

26
02:14.040 --> 02:19.650
And the reason is when you define new custom image sizes they will only get applied to images that

27
02:19.650 --> 02:24.520
you will upload in the future. Images that had already exist in the media will not be resized

28
02:24.690 --> 02:30.990
if you add in your custom size, right? And same thing applies to when you, if you change the sizes here

29
02:31.500 --> 02:35.540
that won't change the sizes of the images already in the media.

30
02:35.550 --> 02:38.770
It will also apply to images that you will create in the future.

31
02:38.790 --> 02:40.600
There is a solution for this problem.

32
02:40.740 --> 02:44.930
But before taking a look at the solution, let's add a new image.

33
02:47.310 --> 02:53.640
And let's upload an image. And let's see the ID for the image.

34
02:53.830 --> 02:58.110
And give this to the function instead.

35
02:58.930 --> 03:03.320
So this is a newly uploaded image. So it should have the new size.

36
03:04.130 --> 03:09.210
And as you can see we have an image that is 1200x500.

37
03:09.490 --> 03:13.370
Let's now go back and let's remove the URL.

38
03:13.420 --> 03:16.370
We need to see the image source.

39
03:16.810 --> 03:20.440
And if you look a look now it's not a responsive image anymore.

40
03:20.470 --> 03:25.210
So we will explain why this happens in more details in another lecture.

41
03:25.540 --> 03:30.500
But briefly how responsive images work is about choosing between different image sizes.

42
03:30.520 --> 03:35.860
But now that you have chosen to crop your image to a certain size, there will no be other sizes to choose

43
03:35.860 --> 03:36.560
from.

44
03:36.560 --> 03:40.580
All right? So if you confuse by this we will explain more later don't worry.

45
03:40.720 --> 03:48.460
But generally I don't recommend using the crop attribute when you define a custom image. If you want

46
03:48.610 --> 03:51.520
the images in your theme to have a certain aspect ratio,

47
03:51.730 --> 03:57.310
I recommend you instruct the users to use images with certain aspect ratio instead of just cropping their

48
03:57.310 --> 04:03.270
images to a certain size. So let's remove this or actually before we remove it.

49
04:03.490 --> 04:07.830
If you want to crop an image you can also choose how to crop it.

50
04:07.880 --> 04:14.260
So by default is cropped from the center, but you can define. Instead of defining the crop as a boolean

51
04:14.290 --> 04:16.410
you can define it as an array.

52
04:16.450 --> 04:17.760
So we have an example here.

53
04:17.770 --> 04:25.450
So array and then you can decide where do you want to start cropping from the left up or from the bottom

54
04:25.450 --> 04:27.350
right or stuff like that.

55
04:27.370 --> 04:31.930
So let's remove now the crop.

56
04:31.970 --> 04:38.450
So what we have right now means that the image that we will resize will not exceed 1200 in width and

57
04:38.450 --> 04:41.260
will not exceed 500 in height.

58
04:41.420 --> 04:49.820
So let's say we have a long image, an image with a width of let's say 100 pixels and the height of 600 pixels. When

59
04:49.820 --> 04:57.470
you resizing using the settings, it will be resized so that the height won't exceed 500. And then the width will

60
04:57.460 --> 04:59.720
be calculated to maintain the aspect ratio.

61
04:59.870 --> 05:00.630
Right?

62
05:00.820 --> 05:02.430
And same if you have a wide image.

63
05:02.480 --> 05:09.370
So an image with let's say a width of 1400 and the height of 400 let's say, it will be resized

64
05:09.440 --> 05:10.650
so that the width is

65
05:10.760 --> 05:17.310
1200 and the height will be calculated to maintain the aspect ratio. But let's say for the

66
05:17.310 --> 05:22.690
vertical image, the long one, so the width is 100 and the height is 600.

67
05:22.800 --> 05:24.250
We want to keep it as it is.

68
05:24.330 --> 05:26.010
We don't need to resize it.

69
05:26.010 --> 05:28.700
We don't want to resize an image based on the height.

70
05:28.770 --> 05:34.800
So if we set this to 0 the image will be forced to not have a width wider than 1200.

71
05:34.800 --> 05:36.810
But now the height will not be regarded.

72
05:37.140 --> 05:37.790
Right?

73
05:37.860 --> 05:42.850
So if we have an image of 100 pixels in width x 1200 pixels in height,

74
05:42.960 --> 05:47.710
it will not be resized as long its width does not exceed the 1200.

75
05:48.030 --> 05:49.780
So I hope this makes sense to you.

76
05:50.690 --> 05:58.320
So let's say we need to do that we need to only resize an image if its width is larger than 1200. So let's save.

77
05:58.400 --> 06:02.780
And let's use this new size in our blog.

78
06:03.170 --> 06:12.350
So I'm gonna copy the name and then we'll have to go to template-parts and post and content. And change

79
06:12.410 --> 06:19.700
this from "large" to our new size. And we'll have to do the same for all the post formats.

80
06:19.820 --> 06:24.520
So I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna probably skip this in the video.

81
06:24.650 --> 06:28.000
So I'm done now we have the post thumbnail in the 

82
06:28.010 --> 06:28.420
content-audio

83
06:28.430 --> 06:29.600
and the gallery

84
06:29.840 --> 06:32.640
and the video and the normal content.

85
06:32.750 --> 06:38.260
And I changed the large post thumbnail to our new sites in all of these.

86
06:38.460 --> 06:39.890
Let's take a look now.

87
06:40.550 --> 06:43.010
And as we mentioned, let's remove this image now.

88
06:50.300 --> 06:56.080
So as we mentioned this won't make any difference and that's because the new image size will not apply to

89
06:56.080 --> 06:57.220
the old images.

90
06:57.220 --> 07:03.820
I just want to inspect one of these. And I want to take a look at the "srcset" attribute.

91
07:03.850 --> 07:09.570
And even if you don't know what this means yet just take a look at the sizes of the images.

92
07:09.790 --> 07:12.130
So we have the original image,

93
07:12.160 --> 07:19.840
this one and then we have the medium 300 and then we have the medium_large and then we have the large.

94
07:19.930 --> 07:21.340
Right?

95
07:21.340 --> 07:29.960
So let's now go to Plugins. And let's say we need to loop through these images the old ones and check

96
07:29.960 --> 07:37.180
if we have new image sizes in our theme. And resize all of these images to the new sizes if new sizes are

97
07:37.190 --> 07:39.670
found. So to do that

98
07:39.730 --> 07:48.480
there is a very famous plugin called Regenerate Thumbnails. So let's add new plugin. And let's search for

99
07:51.470 --> 07:56.530
"regenerate" and it's this one. So let's install it.

100
07:58.020 --> 08:01.200
And let's activate.

101
08:01.320 --> 08:05.540
And now let's go to Tools and then Regenerate Thumbnails.

102
08:05.790 --> 08:09.660
And then all we have to do is to just click on one of these buttons.

103
08:09.720 --> 08:10.580
So this one will

104
08:10.590 --> 08:17.010
regenerate thumbnails for all your images and will regenerate only for featured images for your posts.

105
08:17.280 --> 08:18.600
But let's do all of them.

106
08:19.940 --> 08:21.910
And it's actually pretty fast.

107
08:22.240 --> 08:23.040
So it's done now.

108
08:23.080 --> 08:29.180
Let's take a look now at this image. Let's refresh.

109
08:29.380 --> 08:37.300
And now in the "srcset" in the sizes, we have a new size 1200 that we did not have before.

110
08:37.410 --> 08:38.210
Right?

111
08:38.550 --> 08:40.550
And let's also to make sure.

112
08:41.190 --> 08:53.260
Let's go to the wp-content and uploads and now we have for each image a new size, right?

113
08:53.310 --> 08:54.710
So let's in the next lecture

114
08:54.720 --> 08:58.880
let's understand what is this responsive image thing.

115
08:59.100 --> 09:00.120
So see you in the next lecture.
