00:03.090 --> 00:10.220
So in the last lecture we added the HTML for our fields here. Let's now sanitize them and save them before displaying

1
00:10.230 --> 00:13.080
the frontend for our widget.

2
00:13.470 --> 00:20.040
So let's go in the update() function. And we already did the "title".

3
00:20.040 --> 00:24.210
Let's do the rest of the fields. So we have the "post_count".

4
00:24.250 --> 00:34.010
So what we should do in order to sanitize the "post_count". Let's set "$instance['post_count']= $new_instance['post_count']".

5
00:35.810 --> 00:42.770
And what we can do is we can just make sure it's an integer, right?

6
00:43.450 --> 00:53.230
So using the intval() function we will make sure it's a number. Next we have the "include_date" which is

7
00:53.230 --> 00:57.930
a boolean. So we can do something similar.

8
00:57.940 --> 01:05.520
Let's copy this and "include_date". Instead of intval() we can use boolval().

9
01:07.210 --> 01:12.220
And this will also make sure that whatever the user sent in this variable, it will always be converted

10
01:12.490 --> 01:17.500
to a boolean. And saved in the database as a boolean, right?

11
01:17.590 --> 01:19.310
We finally have the "sort_by".

12
01:23.260 --> 01:28.310
And let's edit, let's remove the boolval().

13
01:28.720 --> 01:30.890
So what can we do here?

14
01:30.910 --> 01:39.290
Remember in the Customizer, let's go to the Customizer. Remember when we wanted to sanitize the

15
01:39.290 --> 01:46.960
dropdown menu we created a custom function called sanitize something and then we defined an array with

16
01:46.960 --> 01:48.460
all the possible values.

17
01:48.790 --> 01:52.390
And then we checked if the input is inside of this array.

18
01:52.690 --> 01:55.530
Then we return it otherwise we return a default value.

19
01:55.870 --> 01:57.720
So why don't we do something similar.

20
01:59.810 --> 02:07.990
Let's copy this function, let's maybe add it here. And let's say "sanitize_sort_by".

21
02:10.600 --> 02:15.370
So our possible values are "date" and "rand" and "comment_count".

22
02:15.450 --> 02:15.940
So

23
02:18.500 --> 02:21.150
"date" and "rand"

24
02:24.370 --> 02:28.900
and "comment_count". And let's default to date

25
02:28.910 --> 02:38.170
if the input is not one of these valid values, right? And then we can use this function to sanitize. So

26
02:38.780 --> 02:40.820
let's save now and

27
02:43.880 --> 02:51.940
let's type here maybe 3, and set this to "true" and random or Number Of Comments and save.

28
02:52.520 --> 02:53.910
So now they are not displayed here.

29
02:53.960 --> 03:01.070
We will do this now, but in the instance that we are var_dumping in the form() here we now have our

30
03:01.070 --> 03:01.480
values.

31
03:01.490 --> 03:08.660
We have "post_count" 3, "include_date" true and "sort_by" comment_count.

32
03:08.750 --> 03:10.990
So let's do this now.

33
03:11.540 --> 03:16.600
Remember we have to check if the value is set and set the default value.

34
03:16.850 --> 03:23.400
So let's duplicate this and do it for the "post_count".

35
03:23.840 --> 03:29.660
Make sure if you copy and paste like me, make sure not to make any silly mistakes.

36
03:30.350 --> 03:39.650
So let's default it to 3 maybe. And let's do a couple of more for the other fields.

37
03:39.860 --> 03:42.590
So this one will be the "include_date"

38
03:47.740 --> 03:57.990
defaulted to "false". And finally "sort_by". Let's default it to "date".

39
04:00.780 --> 04:04.550
And now we have to use these values $post_count, $include_date

40
04:04.550 --> 04:07.050
and $sort_by for the inputs.

41
04:07.070 --> 04:11.530
So here in the post_count we just have to add an input.

42
04:14.150 --> 04:14.660
Sorry

43
04:18.600 --> 04:26.140
and then "echo " and then "post_count". And here we can use the esc_attr

44
04:26.240 --> 04:37.450
or we can also use intval() to escape any HTML or any invalid HTML attributes. For the checkbox

45
04:37.550 --> 04:44.050
we need to add the attributes checked if $include_date is "true".

46
04:44.080 --> 04:44.770
Right?

47
04:44.810 --> 04:49.690
So you can do an if condition here and stuff like that but actually WordPress provide a function.

48
04:49.820 --> 04:57.230
So let's open PHP in the "input" attribute and let's call a function called checked(). And then it takes the

49
04:58.490 --> 05:00.190
value, boolean value.

50
05:00.200 --> 05:05.120
So in our case $include_date. And this function will output the checked attribute

51
05:05.260 --> 05:09.810
if this is "true" and that will not output it otherwise.

52
05:10.240 --> 05:17.840
And similarly we have a function called selected() for the options. So for the select options

53
05:17.860 --> 05:21.610
we need to output the "selected" attribute, right?

54
05:21.700 --> 05:31.510
So we have function called selected() and it takes, in our case two arguments: "selected" and "current". So "current" is the current

55
05:31.510 --> 05:38.010
value which here is "date" and selected is the selected value which is this

56
05:38.040 --> 05:38.560
$sort_by.

57
05:42.410 --> 05:43.080
So let's copy this

58
05:43.100 --> 05:45.680
and paste it for the other options.

59
05:45.680 --> 05:52.950
And then we just have to change the second argument to the value.

60
05:53.750 --> 05:54.820
I think that will be it.

61
05:54.960 --> 05:55.750
Let's take a look.

62
05:59.920 --> 06:09.540
And now we have 3, let's make it 8. Let's set this back to "false". Let's change this to "Random". Let's also change

63
06:09.580 --> 06:14.200
the Title to make sure everything is working. And let's refresh.

64
06:16.900 --> 06:24.760
And everything is looking fine. So let's also try to drag a new one to make sure the defaults are

65
06:24.760 --> 06:26.050
saved.

66
06:26.150 --> 06:26.700
So

67
06:29.780 --> 06:34.420
default 3 and "Most Recent" and "false". Let's refresh.

68
06:37.820 --> 06:39.300
And we have our values.

69
06:39.320 --> 06:44.820
So I think it's now time to remove this var_dump().

70
06:45.060 --> 06:51.650
And now we have our widget in the backend side completed. Let's

71
06:51.730 --> 06:57.970
now move to the frontend and display the posts instead of this.

72
06:57.990 --> 06:59.620
So see you in the next lecture.
