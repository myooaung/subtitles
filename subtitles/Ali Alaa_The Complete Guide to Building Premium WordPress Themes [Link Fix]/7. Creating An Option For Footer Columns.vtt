00:03.070 --> 00:06.900
So let's add the textfield for the footer columns now.

1
00:07.010 --> 00:13.920
So remember in, when we were writing the footer we mentioned that this will be a textfield and the

2
00:13.920 --> 00:17.920
user will be able to choose the columns layout using this field.

3
00:17.940 --> 00:23.270
So let's add a textfield and we already know how to do that. So let's do it quickly.

4
00:23.270 --> 00:24.630
So let's copy one of these.

5
00:27.700 --> 00:34.580
And let's call it "footer_layout". And a "default"

6
00:34.860 --> 00:44.880
let's make it the "3, 3, 3, 3" and it will be postMessage. And we need to refresh the footer layout when

7
00:44.880 --> 00:53.880
this setting is changed. So we can add the setting to the array of settings in the footer partial. "sanitize_

8
00:53.890 --> 00:54.560
callback",

9
00:54.600 --> 00:57.300
you can just use the WordPress "sanitize_

10
00:59.910 --> 01:04.460
text_field". And let's add a control for this setting.

11
01:04.710 --> 01:06.080
So it will be a textarea.

12
01:06.090 --> 01:08.220
So let's copy this and edit it.

13
01:11.820 --> 01:17.550
Same ID as the setting and "'type' => 'text'". And "label"

14
01:17.570 --> 01:18.750
let's call it "Footer Layout".

15
01:22.650 --> 01:23.400
And the "section"

16
01:23.410 --> 01:24.800
it will be the footer section.

17
01:25.060 --> 01:27.090
So let's check now.

18
01:28.180 --> 01:28.810
And

19
01:32.410 --> 01:36.840
we now have this textfield where we can edit layout.

20
01:36.940 --> 01:47.150
So let's go ahead now and use this field in the three files that we hardcoded the filled in, so we have this one.

21
01:47.400 --> 01:48.360
So get_theme_mod().

22
01:52.570 --> 01:59.050
And the name which is, we call it "footer_layout". Let's copy it.

23
02:02.130 --> 02:10.800
And the second argument is the default value. And they should match the default value in the the Customizer.

24
02:11.020 --> 02:14.430
And this is a value from the database so let's sanitize it.

25
02:22.010 --> 02:25.640
Actually have a typo here.

26
02:25.700 --> 02:27.390
Let's do one more thing.

27
02:27.390 --> 02:34.470
So now I'm getting this value from the user. So what if the user typed a space here or something. We need to

28
02:36.240 --> 02:38.760
remove all spaces before using the variable.

29
02:38.760 --> 02:46.460
So "footer_layout = preg_replace" and it takes a regular expression.

30
02:46.740 --> 02:53.430
So this one is, will find all spaces, sorry "/\s+/"

31
02:56.050 --> 03:02.880
and then the second argument is something to replace the spaces with which is nothing.

32
03:03.220 --> 03:10.660
And that argument is the string that contains these spaces. So it's $footer_layout. So now we modified footer layout

33
03:10.660 --> 03:14.750
out to remove spaces in case they exist.

34
03:14.950 --> 03:21.280
So of course you may think the user can type like something that is not aligned with this pattern here.

35
03:21.280 --> 03:23.870
He can type some letters or stuff like that.

36
03:24.070 --> 03:25.660
And we'll take care of this in a moment.

37
03:25.750 --> 03:33.190
But let's now save. And let's copy these and we'll use the same thing in the other files. So

38
03:35.960 --> 03:41.940
here and we don't need it in the info actually.

39
03:41.950 --> 03:44.840
So let's now refresh.

40
03:49.250 --> 03:59.150
And let's go to the Footer Options and change this. So you can't see because  we need to add some widgets for this.

41
03:59.260 --> 04:01.770
So let's go to the widgets and

42
04:05.420 --> 04:07.880
let's add a Gallery.

43
04:17.160 --> 04:18.270
And

44
04:21.700 --> 04:30.670
let's add, I don't know, Tag Cloud. So as you can see we now only have footer column 1 2 and 3. You don't have the fourth

45
04:30.670 --> 04:39.820
one and that's because of course we have now three columns here. So you can modify the layout

46
04:39.910 --> 04:45.250
in order to fit three columns and make it "4, 4, 4".

47
04:45.970 --> 04:49.400
And as you can see it now takes all this space.

48
04:49.510 --> 04:55.890
So I think that's perfectly. Let's just handle the case where a user can type some letters and stuff like that.

49
04:55.900 --> 05:02.020
So what we need to do is do something that will tell the user that the input that you entered does not

50
05:02.020 --> 05:04.420
match the pattern that we expect.

51
05:04.420 --> 05:11.740
So in addition to sanitization, settings can also accept validation callbacks.

52
05:11.740 --> 05:17.020
So let's add a validation callback here. And remember the difference between validation and sanitization. It's

53
05:17.020 --> 05:18.490
called "validate_callback"

54
05:18.490 --> 05:24.640
is that sanitization will happen before saving to the database and in validation if some conditions are

55
05:24.640 --> 05:28.730
not met the value will not be even submitted to the database.

56
05:28.810 --> 05:37.890
So let's create a new function that will do some validation. And let's call it "_themename_validate_footer_layout"

57
05:37.890 --> 05:45.260
"_themename_validate_footer_layout". So we need this function to check what the user typed.

58
05:45.370 --> 05:48.370
And if it matches the pattern that we need we will submit it.

59
05:48.400 --> 05:54.330
And if not we will display an error. And to display an error WordPress provides an easy way to do that.

60
05:54.430 --> 06:00.750
And we'll see this in a moment. So let's create a function.

61
06:01.050 --> 06:09.510
So the validation callback receives two arguments, an object called $validity  and the $value that

62
06:09.540 --> 06:10.690
we typed.

63
06:10.800 --> 06:16.260
So the validity object is used to manage errors that we need to display in the Customizer.

64
06:16.680 --> 06:23.560
So we need to check first if and I'm gonna use preg_match() here. And preg_match()

65
06:23.820 --> 06:26.330
will check if your string matches a certain pattern.

66
06:26.490 --> 06:28.610
So I'm gonna paste the pattern here.

67
06:28.620 --> 06:33.870
You don't have to know how to write this pattern but with the help of Stack Overflow I was able to figure out

68
06:33.870 --> 06:39.240
the pattern which we need, which is number, number, number, number and the number should

69
06:39.240 --> 06:44.170
not be greater than 12, which is the maximum of our grid system.

70
06:44.190 --> 06:49.110
So if you don't know about regular expressions don't worry I don't know either. But I was able to figure

71
06:49.110 --> 06:51.170
out this pattern using some help.

72
06:51.170 --> 06:57.210
So it takes the second argument which is the $value. This $value that we typed in the input.

73
06:59.860 --> 07:07.890
So if not, if the pattern did not match or if the value did not match this pattern, we need to display an

74
07:07.890 --> 07:08.440
error.

75
07:08.670 --> 07:17.960
So to do that we'll use the validity object. And a method called add(). And it takes an ID for the 

76
07:17.960 --> 07:18.650
error.

77
07:18.840 --> 07:25.830
So let's call it "invalid_footer_layout". And it takes a string that will be displayed to the user.

78
07:25.830 --> 07:36.730
So of course it should be escaped and translated. And let's call it, let's type "Footer layout is invalid"

79
07:41.220 --> 07:43.790
and text domain. 

80
07:44.550 --> 07:50.220
And then we'll have to return this object.

81
07:50.220 --> 07:52.720
So we will return this object either way

82
07:52.730 --> 07:59.160
in the validation function. But if we had an error we will add to it the error text.

83
07:59.160 --> 08:01.390
So let's see if this will work.

84
08:08.310 --> 08:16.740
And let's type 13 here. And as you can see "Footer layout is invalid". Let's type 12

85
08:17.030 --> 08:20.550
and now it's valid. Let's type some letters and so on.

86
08:20.540 --> 08:27.410
And if you try to publish, it won't publish an invalid field. And it will tell you here "Unable to save due 

87
08:27.410 --> 08:29.140
to one invalid setting.

88
08:29.570 --> 08:36.270
So great. So now, so we're now able to take the columns from the user and validate and refresh the footer

89
08:36.280 --> 08:39.560
without refreshing the whole website using partials.

90
08:40.310 --> 08:47.970
So I think that's it for the footer options. For the next part we will take care of this logo here.

91
08:48.210 --> 08:51.510
We need to take an image logo from the user and put it here.

92
08:51.680 --> 08:54.950
And if the user did not choose logo then we fall back to this

93
08:54.950 --> 08:57.260
site title. So let's do this in the next lecture.
