00:02.450 --> 00:10.410
In the last lecture we wrote a custom comment callback for the wp_list_comments() function.

1
00:10.410 --> 00:16.470
But then we found out that we have a problem that whenever we change attributes in the wp_list_comments() function

2
00:16.620 --> 00:23.490
that will not affect comments or comments callback because we haven't taken these arguments into consideration 

3
00:23.810 --> 00:30.620
while coding the comments callback. So now for example if some child theme developer needs to override the comments

4
00:30.660 --> 00:36.900
template and he call this function with our callback but different arguments here it won't work as

5
00:36.900 --> 00:38.920
expected.

6
00:38.920 --> 00:42.200
So first let's take care of the "avatar_size".

7
00:42.210 --> 00:46.300
So here we hardcore the avatar to 200.

8
00:46.380 --> 00:51.590
So we have to do is just get the avatar from the arguments. And we get the arguments of the wp_list_comments()

9
00:52.080 --> 01:01.190
function in this parameter here. So let's call "$args['avatar_size']" but also we don't need to

10
01:01.190 --> 01:05.090
call get_avatar() if the avatar size is zero.

11
01:05.240 --> 01:05.660
Right?

12
01:05.660 --> 01:11.030
If the avatar size is zero that means that the user doesn't need the avatar. So let's write an if condition

13
01:11.030 --> 01:11.390
here.

14
01:11.660 --> 01:19.870
And if the $args and the avatar_size in the $args is equals to or is not equals 0, we will echo

15
01:19.970 --> 01:23.800
get_avatar(). Otherwise we won't do anything.

16
01:24.080 --> 01:27.590
So you probably know if the if condition body is just one line.

17
01:27.620 --> 01:29.880
We don't have to add the { }.

18
01:30.170 --> 01:31.210
So this will be fine.

19
01:34.270 --> 01:39.050
So let's now try and change this to 0.

20
01:41.800 --> 01:44.830
And now the avatar disappears. Let's make it 50.

21
01:48.540 --> 01:54.340
So it's actually 50 but in my styling I limit the width and height.

22
01:54.630 --> 01:56.970
So I think that's not a best practice also.

23
01:57.210 --> 01:59.770
You need to style your avatar better than I did here.

24
01:59.790 --> 02:05.360
You shouldn't explicitly add width and height for the avatar. You should let the user define it.

25
02:05.880 --> 02:13.380
But anyways let's move to the Reply text. So the Reply text is not actually used in the comment-callback but

26
02:13.380 --> 02:22.130
it's used in the comment_reply_link() function. So what we have to do is we have to also pass it from the $args.

27
02:22.270 --> 02:30.050
So "reply_text" and then "$args['reply_text']".

28
02:30.300 --> 02:37.840
And this way we'll have "hello". So since we past some argument here to the comment_reply_link() and we're

29
02:37.850 --> 02:39.350
not sure if there is more.

30
02:39.430 --> 02:43.140
Maybe there is more that we need to pass to comment_reply_link().

31
02:43.180 --> 02:50.860
So maybe we can remove these and just pass all the arguments to the comments_reply_link(). So how to do that? We

32
02:50.860 --> 02:51.970
can use array_merge().

33
02:55.150 --> 02:56.560
And this will merge two arrays.

34
02:56.650 --> 02:58.610
So we need to merge the $args.

35
02:58.870 --> 03:06.710
from the wp_list_comments() function and this array that contains other arguments for the comment_reply_link().

36
03:06.770 --> 03:07.370
comment_reply_link().

37
03:09.250 --> 03:11.850
And let's see now and we have the "hello".

38
03:12.000 --> 03:15.920
And we also have the maximum width from the $args array.

39
03:16.400 --> 03:17.720
One more thing.

40
03:18.320 --> 03:29.240
Here we can pass a style, an argument called "style". And this could be either UL or OL, unordered list or ordered list 

41
03:29.310 --> 03:31.960
or a DIV, right?

42
03:32.080 --> 03:36.810
If you choose DIV you are responsible to change the ULs to 

43
03:36.820 --> 03:45.620
DIV. And this will basically just change instead of wrapping the comments in an LI, it will wrap it in a DIV, ok?

44
03:46.150 --> 03:54.320
So let's save now and as you can see you will have some weird stuff here.

45
03:54.700 --> 03:59.200
So we have the comments__list and then it's closed.

46
03:59.210 --> 04:01.520
It only has one comment and it's closed.

47
04:01.710 --> 04:08.200
And now we have the other comments and then we have this DIV and then another comment.

48
04:08.360 --> 04:09.870
So things are got massed up here.

49
04:09.980 --> 04:16.220
And that's because we specify the style to be DIV. But we're are using an LI here and we're not closing

50
04:16.220 --> 04:16.670
it.

51
04:16.670 --> 04:17.040
WordPress

52
04:17.040 --> 04:23.600
is automatically closing it. And it's now not closing it with an LI, it's closing it with a DIV. Because

53
04:23.690 --> 04:29.090
that's what we choose as style. So we need to check here first.

54
04:29.660 --> 04:32.600
Let's write a variable called $tag.

55
04:35.670 --> 04:48.740
And if $args and the style inside $args is equal to a "div" then the $tag will be a "div".

56
04:48.830 --> 04:51.860
Otherwise it can also be an OL or a UL.

57
04:52.040 --> 05:04.750
And in both cases the tag will be an "li". And what we'll have to do is just replace the "li"with "<?php" and echo the $tag.

58
05:04.970 --> 05:06.220
Right?

59
05:06.310 --> 05:16.820
And let's see now. And now we have our DIVs and they are all inside the comments__list as expected.

60
05:17.950 --> 05:18.880
Great.

61
05:19.320 --> 05:25.690
So let's get this back to the default which is a UL and

62
05:30.300 --> 05:31.940
one final thing.

63
05:32.670 --> 05:40.710
Let's search here for "pingbacks".

64
05:40.860 --> 05:46.490
So we have some common types that are called Pingbacks and Trackbacks. And pingbacks and trackbacks are I think a way

65
05:46.500 --> 05:50.370
to for two blocks to mention each other or something like that.

66
05:51.230 --> 05:59.270
But anyways they will look like a normal comment with a title and the body and a date. And you won't

67
05:59.270 --> 06:04.780
have to do anything about them except that the wp_list_comments() function.

68
06:05.030 --> 06:10.980
It takes an argument called "short_pings" and what this is supposed to do.

69
06:11.300 --> 06:16.880
If it's "true" it's just supposed to make this pingback shorter.

70
06:16.910 --> 06:23.260
It should just display the title and ignore the content. So what you can do is.

71
06:23.470 --> 06:26.260
I'm sorry it's called "short_ping" not "short_pings".

72
06:26.850 --> 06:30.540
So now is what we can do is in the comment-callback.

73
06:30.730 --> 06:37.040
Let's echo the comment_type property inside the $comment object.

74
06:44.030 --> 06:47.320
And the comment_type will be a pingback or a trackback

75
06:47.360 --> 06:48.220
in this case.

76
06:48.470 --> 06:55.890
So what we can do is we can, let's copy this. And we can add an if condition here before outputting the comment_text().

77
06:57.170 --> 07:04.940
So "if( )" and in this condition we need to check if it's a normal comment we need to output the comment_text().

78
07:05.180 --> 07:10.470
Or if it's a trackback or a pingback but the "short_ping" argument is set to "false",

79
07:10.490 --> 07:20.310
we will also need to output the comment_text(). So if the comment_type is an empty string or sorry,

80
07:20.490 --> 07:33.980
or let's open () here and then open other (). So comment_type is a "pingback" or comment_type

81
07:34.370 --> 07:47.680
is a "trackback". And then after these brackets and "$args['short_ping']".

82
07:48.100 --> 07:52.870
So this condition means if the comment is a pingback or trackback and the argument is

83
07:53.020 --> 07:55.910
or actually we need to check that "short_ping" is "false".

84
07:57.030 --> 08:00.530
Then we'll output the comment_text(), ok?

85
08:00.590 --> 08:06.640
So let's see now and we don't have the comment text for the short_pings and we have the comment text for the normal

86
08:06.650 --> 08:07.940
comments.

87
08:07.940 --> 08:16.680
Let's try and set this to "false". And we should have the comment text for the pingbacks and for the comment.

88
08:17.030 --> 08:17.720
All right?

89
08:17.750 --> 08:21.850
I think that was merrily all what you need to do about comments in WordPress.

90
08:21.980 --> 08:23.380
So see you in the next section.
