00:03.150 --> 00:07.960
So in the last lecture we created a plugin to register custom post types.

1
00:08.010 --> 00:17.560
So let's now go to this plugin and let's go to the file that we created portfolio-post-type and let's register our post type.

2
00:18.650 --> 00:20.620
So let's open PHP tags.

3
00:21.050 --> 00:27.670
And to register a post type you need to hook into the "init" action. So let's add_action() and then "init".

4
00:31.260 --> 00:40.150
And then let's create a function and let's call it "_themename__pluginname_

5
00:40.150 --> 00:41.480
setup_

6
00:42.300 --> 00:47.180
post_type". And let's create this function.

7
00:51.830 --> 01:01.320
So inside of this function we can call the function called register_post_type(). And register_post_type() will take a name for the

8
01:01.320 --> 01:01.950
post type.

9
01:01.950 --> 01:07.980
So in our case we need to create a portfolio. But also this needs to be prefixed.

10
01:07.980 --> 01:13.520
So portfolio is a very generic name and it might cause some conflicts with other plugins.

11
01:13.590 --> 01:22.400
So you have to prefix this with your theme name. So "_themename_portfolio". And then it takes

12
01:22.490 --> 01:23.500
an array arguments.

13
01:23.510 --> 01:31.090
So let's define a variable $args and let's see what arguments we can pass here.

14
01:31.130 --> 01:32.310
So this will be an array.

15
01:36.200 --> 01:41.370
So first you can pass an argument called "public". So we need our post type to be public.

16
01:41.370 --> 01:43.470
We need everybody to be able to see it.

17
01:43.470 --> 01:54.560
So let's set this to "true". We've also an argument called "has_archive". So we need our post type to have its own archives.

18
01:54.560 --> 01:59.350
So let's set this to "true". We also have "menu-icon".

19
02:02.820 --> 02:07.730
So this one will specify the icon that will appear here.

20
02:09.880 --> 02:15.650
And this argument takes an icon name from an icon set called Dashicons.

21
02:15.720 --> 02:17.140
So I'll put you a link to this.

22
02:17.140 --> 02:26.130
You can choose any one of these. So let's maybe search for "gallery" and let's copy this one. And this will

23
02:26.130 --> 02:28.930
be the name that we will give to this argument.

24
02:34.490 --> 02:37.190
So let's save now and see what we have in the admin.

25
02:40.630 --> 02:48.450
So let's go to the Dashboard. And as you can see we have a new item here but it's still called Posts and the icon

26
02:48.460 --> 02:50.570
is not working as well.

27
02:50.860 --> 02:56.260
I think this one is called "menu_icon". So let's refresh.

28
02:56.260 --> 03:04.310
And now we have the icon but it's still called Posts. And we here also we have "All Posts". And Posts here and no

29
03:04.310 --> 03:04.940
posts sound.

30
03:04.940 --> 03:12.530
So how do we change these labels is by passing an argument called "labels". And then let's pass it a variable

31
03:13.100 --> 03:19.270
that we will create now called $labels. And this will a huge array of labels.

32
03:19.280 --> 03:21.460
So I'm gonna copy and paste this.

33
03:21.500 --> 03:28.950
There's no need to type all of this. So here I'm gonna paste a variable called $labels and this is

34
03:29.010 --> 03:30.250
an array of labels.

35
03:30.360 --> 03:36.540
So we've the name. So "Portfolio" and it has to be a escaped and translated.

36
03:36.740 --> 03:39.360
And we have our text domain "_themename-"

37
03:39.680 --> 03:45.980
and then plugin name. So we can edit all of these labels, we have the singular name, the menu name, the add new

38
03:45.980 --> 03:51.370
label, add new item, added item and so on.

39
03:51.690 --> 03:56.780
So you can take a look at this and let's save now and see.

40
03:57.710 --> 03:59.130
And now we have "Portfolio".

41
03:59.190 --> 04:03.960
And "All Portfolio Items" and "No Portfolio Items found" and so on.

42
04:05.400 --> 04:08.460
So this is an important argument here.

43
04:08.520 --> 04:12.730
Let's now try and create a new portfolio item.

44
04:12.930 --> 04:16.180
And as you can see we have our title and the content.

45
04:16.210 --> 04:20.640
But we don't have for example, the featured image, we don't have the comment, we don't have the

46
04:20.720 --> 04:23.580
author and stuff like that.

47
04:23.610 --> 04:33.470
So to add these boxes we can add a new argument. And it's called "supports". And this can be an array of

48
04:33.580 --> 04:35.980
boxes to support this post type.

49
04:36.340 --> 04:45.690
So let's, we need the "title" and we need the "editor" which will have the content. We can also have

50
04:45.690 --> 04:50.270
the "author" and the "thumbnail", the

51
04:50.670 --> 05:00.770
featured image. We might also need an "excerpt". And maybe you need "comments" to your portfolio items. So we can

52
05:00.770 --> 05:02.010
add that well.

53
05:02.030 --> 05:03.190
And let's refresh now.

54
05:04.760 --> 05:11.930
And as you can see we have the featured image, we have the comments and the excerpt and the author. So this function,

55
05:12.020 --> 05:13.180
register_post_type().

56
05:13.370 --> 05:18.780
It takes a lot of other the arguments. You can search for it and see what other arguments it can take.

57
05:19.010 --> 05:22.950
But these are the ones that we will need to override.

58
05:23.060 --> 05:28.320
So that's it for the post type. Let's go now and define the custom taxonomies.

59
05:28.520 --> 05:36.420
So let's go to the project-type-tax. And let's open PHP and we also need to hook into the

60
05:36.900 --> 05:39.320
"init" action.

61
05:39.570 --> 05:47.710
And I'm gonna create a function called "_themename__pluginname_register

62
05:48.720 --> 05:55.900
_project_type_tax" or tax.

63
05:55.950 --> 06:00.050
So that's a long name but let's now create this function.

64
06:01.840 --> 06:07.040
And like the type we'll call a function called register_taxonomy().

65
06:07.140 --> 06:15.570
So let's call this one "_themename_", also be prefixed. So "_themename_project_type".

66
06:16.620 --> 06:18.660
And it will take an array of post types.

67
06:18.780 --> 06:23.020
And these are the post types that we need this taxonomy to appear in.

68
06:23.040 --> 06:26.340
So we need this taxonomy to appear in the post type that we just created.

69
06:26.340 --> 06:26.880
So,

70
06:29.700 --> 06:35.500
it will need the slug of the post type which is this one. So let's add this.

71
06:35.640 --> 06:46.160
And it also takes some arguments. So let's define arguments. And it will be an array.

72
06:46.180 --> 06:51.120
So the first argument we'll define is "hierarchical" and this one is important.

73
06:51.480 --> 07:00.950
So if we set this to "true" the taxonomy will have the UI of the categories where you can add children and parents,

74
07:00.960 --> 07:04.450
so project types and subtypes and stuff like that.

75
07:04.600 --> 07:11.460
If we set this to "false" we will have the UI of tags and we'll do that for the skill taxonomy.

76
07:11.630 --> 07:13.210
So let's set this is "true".

77
07:13.220 --> 07:23.120
And let's add another one called "show_admin_column". And let's set it "true" and we'll see what

78
07:23.300 --> 07:25.060
it means in a moment.

79
07:36.840 --> 07:46.530
And we also have "labels". And this will be similar to the labels for the custom post type. So I'm gonna

80
07:46.650 --> 07:49.520
also copy and paste this array.

81
07:52.600 --> 07:57.570
And similar to the custom post type we have the "name" and "singular_name", "search_items" and stuff like that.

82
07:58.000 --> 08:01.960
So let's save now and see what we have here.

83
08:03.190 --> 08:08.760
So now as you can see we have Project Types and here we can add new project types.

84
08:08.920 --> 08:16.540
And when we add a new portfolio item we have the Project Type here and it has the UI of the category.

85
08:16.540 --> 08:22.850
So we can add a project type. We can add one with a parent and so on.

86
08:23.350 --> 08:23.950
Great, so let's do now the 

87
08:23.960 --> 08:31.630
skills taxonomy. And for this one I'm just gonna paste it. It will be exactly like this

88
08:31.630 --> 08:39.400
one except that we will set the "hierarchical" to "false". So let's paste.

89
08:39.540 --> 08:46.540
And as you can see we'll just change the function name and the taxonomy name. And we'll set this to "false" and

90
08:46.540 --> 08:48.930
we'll also change the labels.

91
08:50.370 --> 08:55.650
So let's save and see now. And we have a new one.

92
08:55.970 --> 09:00.460
And also we have here skills where we can add skills like tags.

93
09:00.830 --> 09:07.300
So now let's actually create a new portfolio item that will have these tags and categories. And let's

94
09:07.300 --> 09:09.630
publish it. And let's try and view it.

95
09:11.330 --> 09:14.030
And you'll find the 404 page.

96
09:14.030 --> 09:17.690
So let's see why this happens and how can we solve this in the next lecture.
