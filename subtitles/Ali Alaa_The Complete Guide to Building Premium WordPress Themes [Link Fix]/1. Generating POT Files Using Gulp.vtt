00:03.340 --> 00:05.370
So we are almost done with our theme now.

1
00:05.460 --> 00:12.860
Let's do one final step which is localization. So during the course we will constantly internationalizing

2
00:12.910 --> 00:13.980
our theme.

3
00:14.320 --> 00:22.990
So when we for example had strings like "Posted on", "Read More" stuff like that we put these things in some

4
00:22.990 --> 00:28.790
special functions like the "__" ,"_n", "_x" and so on.

5
00:28.810 --> 00:34.600
So as theme developers it's not our responsibility to actually translate the theme into other languages

6
00:35.080 --> 00:41.330
but it is our responsibility to create a file that translators will use in order to translate our theme.

7
00:42.370 --> 00:43.760
So let's take a look here at

8
00:45.330 --> 00:46.530
this article.

9
00:46.840 --> 00:50.260
So we have three kinds of files, a POT file.

10
00:50.820 --> 00:56.580
And this is the file that we are responsible for generating. This file will contain all the strings that

11
00:56.580 --> 00:58.990
we added in these functions.

12
01:00.000 --> 01:02.090
But it will not contain any translation.

13
01:02.100 --> 01:05.920
It will just be a template that translators can use to translate

14
01:05.980 --> 01:11.530
the theme. PO files on the other hand will contain translations.

15
01:11.630 --> 01:18.610
PO files will be exactly like the POT files, except that POT files will not contain translations PO

16
01:18.630 --> 01:26.910
files will contain translations. But they both have the same format. And finally PO files should be compiled

17
01:26.910 --> 01:32.770
into MO files, Machine Object files. MO files are the most important files.

18
01:32.830 --> 01:40.190
They're actually the files that functions like this one use in order to load the translation.

19
01:40.200 --> 01:46.410
So if you're loading a language different than English this function will go to the MO file and see what

20
01:46.560 --> 01:50.340
the translation for this string and loads from there.

21
01:50.340 --> 01:55.520
The POT and the PO files are just for normal users and translators to use.

22
01:55.680 --> 02:02.670
But eventually they should be compiled into MO files. And as I mentioned it's not our responsibility

23
02:02.670 --> 02:06.280
to generate PO and MO files, the actual translations.

24
02:06.300 --> 02:12.680
It's only our responsibility to generate the POT files. So let's do this in this lecture and then

25
02:12.680 --> 02:16.100
we will also learn how to create actual transitions.

26
02:16.370 --> 02:22.850
It's not required but as an extra thing you can also provide actual transitions with your theme.

27
02:23.480 --> 02:27.780
So there are many ways to generate POT files and you can find a lot of them here.

28
02:28.100 --> 02:34.840
But I'm gonna use, since we are using gulp, I'm gonna use gulp to generate POT files.

29
02:35.090 --> 02:40.280
So lets Google "gulp wp pot".

30
02:44.410 --> 02:47.250
And let's install it. Let's copy this command and

31
02:52.680 --> 02:55.530
and now it's done. Let's run "npm start" again.

32
03:02.350 --> 03:04.740
And let's actually see how to use this.

33
03:04.850 --> 03:14.700
So let's go to our gulpfile. And that is the final task we're gonna do in the gulpfile.

34
03:14.830 --> 03:16.500
And let's import it.

35
03:17.070 --> 03:30.880
So "import wpPot from 'gulp-wp-pot'". And let's create a new task. Anywhere here so "export".

36
03:31.020 --> 03:33.960
And let's call it "pot".

37
03:39.240 --> 03:42.330
and let's "return gulp.src".

38
03:42.360 --> 03:51.840
So the src() will take the files that contains the strings that we want to translate. So any files we have in

39
03:51.840 --> 03:56.800
our theme that contain functions like this one and strings like this one.

40
03:57.080 --> 04:01.170
We should include it here. So we can actually include all PHP files.

41
04:01.500 --> 04:14.470
So "**/*.php" and we will pipe our wpPot() function. And this will take some arguments.

42
04:14.530 --> 04:19.660
So it will take the text domain and our text domain, we call it "_themename".

43
04:20.690 --> 04:27.630
And it also takes a "package". And this can just be the name of your project. So we can call it the actual

44
04:27.860 --> 04:37.080
theme name which is "info.name". And then finally let's pipe to our destination.

45
04:37.090 --> 04:43.980
So we should include our POT file inside a folder in our theme code languages.

46
04:44.030 --> 04:50.970
Let's call "gulp.dest() and then it's open a "`" and then "languages/".

47
04:50.970 --> 04:56.460
And then let's call our file the theme name which is "info.name".

48
04:57.060 --> 05:00.450
And then ".pot".

49
05:00.520 --> 05:04.670
So let's save this and let's try to run our task.

50
05:04.690 --> 05:10.100
So let's stop and run

51
05:10.910 --> 05:11.420
"gulp pot".

52
05:17.410 --> 05:25.060
And let's see in our folder. We should know have languages and a POT file here.

53
05:26.320 --> 05:31.010
So if you open this file you will find all the strings that we use in our theme.

54
05:31.210 --> 05:38.530
Now translators can take this and translate these strings in many ways. They can directly type the translations

55
05:38.530 --> 05:46.030
here and then rename this to "something.po". And this something should be the language code.

56
05:46.210 --> 05:53.190
Or they can use a software like Poedit to have some user interface to translate the strings.

57
05:53.560 --> 05:55.560
And that's what we're gonna do in the next lecture.

58
05:55.930 --> 05:59.140
So as I mentioned this POT file should not contain any translations.

59
05:59.140 --> 06:02.490
So let's move this and let's save.

60
06:02.620 --> 06:04.530
And let's find in our gulpfile.

61
06:04.630 --> 06:06.000
We want to run this task

62
06:06.420 --> 06:07.840
every time we build our theme.

63
06:07.840 --> 06:08.650
Right?

64
06:08.740 --> 06:13.550
So that if we added some new strings this file will get updated.

65
06:13.600 --> 06:21.370
So let's go to the "build" task and let's just add our "pot" task.

66
06:22.810 --> 06:24.610
So that's all what you have to do.

67
06:24.880 --> 06:30.760
But let's also take a look in the next lecture at how to provide actual translations in your theme.

68
06:30.910 --> 06:31.930
So see you in the next lecture.
