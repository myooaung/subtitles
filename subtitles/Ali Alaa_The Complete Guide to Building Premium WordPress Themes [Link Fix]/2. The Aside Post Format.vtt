00:02.900 --> 00:05.670
So let's now create the Aside Post Format.

1
00:05.670 --> 00:11.620
Let's take a look at this guide here. And the aside should be a post without a title.

2
00:11.850 --> 00:14.610
And it's similar to a Facebook note update.

3
00:14.670 --> 00:20.250
So what we are  gonna do is we're gonna display the content of the post without any title. And

4
00:20.250 --> 00:27.080
we'll also display the date and the author. So that you can click on the date and go to the single post.

5
00:27.120 --> 00:28.810
So let's do that.

6
00:29.250 --> 00:32.090
Let's go to the content-aside.

7
00:33.930 --> 00:35.890
Let's actually copy the content.

8
00:36.850 --> 00:41.190
And let's see what we can remove and what we can keep.

9
00:41.560 --> 00:48.140
So we don't need the title now. So let's remove the movie header, but the header contains the title and the metadata.

10
00:48.430 --> 00:49.620
And we need the metadata,

11
00:49.630 --> 00:58.200
so we'll have to go and grab that from the header later. And we also won't have to display the post's thumbnail.

12
00:58.450 --> 01:03.880
We'll just have to display the content. And we'll actually display the content in the single page.

13
01:03.880 --> 01:09.470
And also in the loop, in the archive, and index and the search and these kind of pages.

14
01:10.120 --> 01:19.280
So let's remove the if condition that checks if single and displays the excerpt if not  single.

15
01:19.540 --> 01:21.390
And let's keep just the content.

16
01:21.640 --> 01:23.960
And let's also remove the pagination.

17
01:24.100 --> 01:31.480
These kinds of posts should not have pagination. And then we'll display the also the footer, the tags

18
01:31.480 --> 01:32.920
and categories.

19
01:33.310 --> 01:37.270
And we also need to display the meta information.

20
01:37.850 --> 01:41.030
Right, let's see what this looks like before doing that.

21
01:41.560 --> 01:44.530
And as you can see we have just the content of the post.

22
01:44.560 --> 01:49.180
We can also remove the "Read More" because it's gonna doesn't make any sense because here

23
01:49.180 --> 01:53.170
we are displaying all the post not the except. So "Read More"

24
01:53.170 --> 01:58.130
kind implies that there is more to read, but we're actually displaying everything here.

25
01:58.160 --> 02:07.990
So let's remove the "Read More" link. And we need to display instead of the "Read More" link, we need to display the date

26
02:08.000 --> 02:12.170
and the author after the content.

27
02:12.170 --> 02:14.750
So let's go to the header and let's copy this part.

28
02:17.280 --> 02:19.400
And let's put it after the content.

29
02:22.200 --> 02:25.930
And let's save now. And now we have some text.

30
02:25.940 --> 02:32.400
It's like Facebook notes with a date and the author. And you can go to the single post by clicking on the date

31
02:33.570 --> 02:35.590
and will have the same thing.

32
02:36.060 --> 02:38.730
So that's how aside post formats can look like.

33
02:38.730 --> 02:42.260
Of course you can choose a different approach to display the aside post format.

34
02:42.570 --> 02:44.230
But I think that's a fine approach.

35
02:44.240 --> 02:46.580
So let's go to the next post format.

36
02:46.800 --> 02:49.450
Let's do the, it's just Status Post Format,

37
02:49.500 --> 02:57.210
we're not supporting that because it's it will be exactly like the aside post format as you can see here.

38
02:57.280 --> 03:02.530
A short status update or similar to Twitter status updates, that can be exactly like the aside post format.

39
03:02.830 --> 03:05.290
Let's do the Link Post Format it in the next lecture.
