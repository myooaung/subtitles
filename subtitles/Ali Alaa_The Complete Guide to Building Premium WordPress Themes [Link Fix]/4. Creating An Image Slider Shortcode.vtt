00:03.380 --> 00:03.880
So let's create

1
00:03.880 --> 00:06.130
in this lecture a slider shortcode.

2
00:06.480 --> 00:12.730
So let's go to "Slick Slider" and this is a famous JavaScript slider.

3
00:12.820 --> 00:19.160
And we want to allow users to be able to define some images in a shortcode and then this shortcode will

4
00:19.210 --> 00:21.690
turn these images into a slider.

5
00:22.060 --> 00:29.500
So let's take a look at this and let's go to the Github link.

6
00:30.310 --> 00:41.050
And we need to install it using NPM so let's copy this. And in the plugin, in the command line,

7
00:42.700 --> 00:47.530
in the plugin all right not in the theme, let's install this.

8
00:47.550 --> 00:53.060
And also "--save". Now let's run "npm start" again.

9
00:56.750 --> 01:04.220
So Slick Slider will need a DIV and you can pass some options to DIV using "data-slick" attribute. And

10
01:04.220 --> 01:06.880
inside of this DIV we will have other DIVs.

11
01:07.040 --> 01:09.480
And each one will represent a slide.

12
01:09.770 --> 01:12.800
So what we need to do is we need to create a shortcode.

13
01:13.940 --> 01:22.020
So let's call it "_themename_slider" and then we have two approaches to create the slider.

14
01:22.030 --> 01:29.260
We might make it a self-closing tag and then give it an attribute called "images" and these images can

15
01:29.260 --> 01:32.530
be a comma separated IDs string like 

16
01:32.630 --> 01:39.210
so. And then the shortcode, we can loop through these IDs and generate the images.

17
01:39.260 --> 01:48.190
Or another approach and that's what we'll be using is to make it an enclosing shortcode so let's close it. And

18
01:48.190 --> 01:54.800
the content of this enclosing shortcode will be other shortcodes and each one will represent a slide,ok? So

19
01:56.230 --> 01:59.260
"_themename_" and then "slide".

20
01:59.280 --> 02:04.280
So this will be one slide. And this can be self-closing.

21
02:04.910 --> 02:09.170
So maybe each slide will have an image and this will be an ID.

22
02:09.210 --> 02:13.890
So let's go to media and let's get some IDs for images.

23
02:14.850 --> 02:28.100
So this one is 1691. So it will have an image and let's say it will also have a "caption".

24
02:28.240 --> 02:32.080
So in the first approach we can only have a string that contains images' IDs.

25
02:32.300 --> 02:40.960
But using this approach each single slide can contain other attributes like "caption" in this case.

26
02:41.090 --> 02:44.820
So let's add another one and let's get a another image.

27
02:50.040 --> 02:52.230
And let's remove the caption for this one.

28
02:55.190 --> 03:04.540
Now let's go and create these shortcodes. So in our plugin in the lib or sorry in the includes. And

29
03:04.540 --> 03:12.760
in the shortcodes folder I'm gonna create a new folder called "slider". And inside the slider let's create

30
03:12.760 --> 03:18.220
a new file called slider.php.

31
03:18.410 --> 03:21.310
And here we will define our shortcodes.

32
03:21.330 --> 03:26.540
So let's open PHP and let's create our first shortcode.

33
03:26.990 --> 03:32.780
So we call this one "_themename_slider" and the function with the same name.

34
03:37.610 --> 03:40.970
And this function will always receive these three arguments.

35
03:44.170 --> 03:49.740
And then like we did for the button we will extract() and then call shortcode_atts().

36
03:50.820 --> 03:52.200
And add our attributes here.

37
03:52.210 --> 03:55.200
So let's say, let's go to Slick Slider again. 

38
03:56.970 --> 04:02.200
And we need the shortcode to support some of these options for the slider.

39
04:02.940 --> 04:05.770
So let's choose couple of options. 

40
04:06.130 --> 04:09.800
Right, maybe the "autoplay" option.

41
04:12.090 --> 04:14.040
And default it to "false".

42
04:14.520 --> 04:21.090
And there is an option called "arrows" and this will add next and previous arrows. And let's default it to

43
04:21.090 --> 04:22.220
"false" also.

44
04:22.530 --> 04:27.320
And then we'll pass the attributes and the shortcode which we called $tag here.

45
04:27.350 --> 04:29.840
So let's call it $tag.

46
04:29.870 --> 04:34.480
So this shortcode will be responsible for displaying the opening tags for the slider.

47
04:34.700 --> 04:38.470
So let's go to Slick Slider and see what we should do.

48
04:38.670 --> 04:39.820
We should create a DIV like this

49
04:39.870 --> 04:41.230
and pass it the options.

50
04:41.280 --> 04:49.840
So let's do that. Let's create a new variable. Let's call it $o for output. And then let's modify this to

51
04:49.880 --> 04:50.920
"autoplay"

52
04:51.330 --> 04:57.870
and "arrows". Not sure if it's called arrow or arrows, and it's "arrows".

53
05:01.900 --> 05:04.150
And let's modify these strings.

54
05:04.150 --> 05:11.300
So we need to escape this and this and we need to close.

55
05:11.290 --> 05:13.120
This might be a bit confusing.

56
05:13.180 --> 05:19.060
We need to close this string and then concatenate we'll replace this 4 and then concatenate again.

57
05:19.150 --> 05:20.950
And open string

58
05:24.410 --> 05:27.460
and close it and open it.

59
05:30.440 --> 05:38.020
And we here will have the $arrows and here the $autoplay.

60
05:38.840 --> 05:41.030
And we also need to escape these values.

61
05:41.030 --> 05:47.900
So these will always be booleans so you can use a function called boolval() that will convert anything

62
05:47.900 --> 05:51.690
to a boolean.

63
05:51.760 --> 06:03.150
So this way we will make sure that these are booleans, right? And then le's close it. And let's return the output.

64
06:03.210 --> 06:08.210
I want to make sure that we've done this string correctly.

65
06:08.220 --> 06:10.640
So that's see now.

66
06:11.790 --> 06:27.250
And we forgot to add our new shortcode in the index.php f or the plugin.

67
06:27.570 --> 06:34.320
So let's now inspect after the button and great. As you can see we have a DIV with "data-slick".

68
06:34.570 --> 06:36.620
And then we have "autoplay" and the "arrows".

69
06:36.790 --> 06:40.270
We have a problem with the values.

70
06:40.300 --> 06:43.150
So apparently booleans won't concatenate with the string.

71
06:43.210 --> 06:47.890
I expected this to be "false" and "false" here. But it's a no problem,

72
06:47.920 --> 06:53.450
we can remove the boolval() here and then write a small ternary expression.

73
06:53.680 --> 07:00.250
If this is true then output a string "true", otherwise a string "false". And same here.

74
07:06.280 --> 07:15.120
So now that we have "true" and "false" as strings. We should have them now in the HTML for the slider. And

75
07:15.140 --> 07:21.230
here we have them. So now we have the shortcode that will output the opening DIV for the slider. Let's

76
07:21.230 --> 07:22.310
in the next lecture create

77
07:22.360 --> 07:26.930
the other shortcode that will be responsible for outputting one single slide.

78
07:26.960 --> 07:27.950
So see you in the next lecture.
