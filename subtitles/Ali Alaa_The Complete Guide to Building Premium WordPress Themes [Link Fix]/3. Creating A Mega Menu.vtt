00:03.600 --> 00:10.700
So we need to create a mega menu like this one. So let's go to the menus page in the admin. And the structure

1
00:10.700 --> 00:16.840
we need to follow in order to create a mega menu will be as posts. Let's add some pages first.

2
00:16.940 --> 00:21.820
So I'm gonna add some stuff to fill our menus.

3
00:25.120 --> 00:31.590
So all I have to do is  for example this page, "Sample Page" to be a mega menu.

4
00:32.230 --> 00:36.900
So in order to do that we create for example, four submenus.

5
00:37.110 --> 00:39.740
One, two, three and four.

6
00:39.880 --> 00:46.210
And each one of these submenus will be a column in the mega menu. And the label of each one will be the title

7
00:46.330 --> 00:48.400
of the column of the mega menu.

8
00:48.400 --> 00:49.850
So let's go back here.

9
00:50.560 --> 00:59.200
And for this one you can imagine the "Blog" as the "Sample Page" and "Mega Title", "Mega Title", Mega Title"

10
00:59.200 --> 01:03.610
and so on is "Page A", Page B", "Blog" and "Front Page".

11
01:03.610 --> 01:12.250
So these will be the titles and submenus for these titles will be these pages.

12
01:12.730 --> 01:13.550
So let's add some.

13
01:18.920 --> 01:22.340
And let's get one from here.

14
01:26.000 --> 01:33.620
And save. So right now what we've done is it's just creating a normal menu.

15
01:33.730 --> 01:40.000
So now we have another normal menu like this one with multiple submenus.

16
01:43.210 --> 01:44.260
In the Admin page

17
01:44.260 --> 01:52.560
there is a sort of a hidden feature. If you click on "Screen Options" toggle here and enable CSS classes.

18
01:52.660 --> 01:59.050
This would allow you to add custom CSS classes for each menu item.

19
01:59.050 --> 02:07.010
We now have this field. So we can add class called "mega" and another class to choose the number of columns.

20
02:07.410 --> 02:14.070
So we created four menus. So let's choose "cols-4".

21
02:14.880 --> 02:21.450
And in my CSS I styled  menus that has the "mega" and "cols" class differently

22
02:21.450 --> 02:23.360
in order to mega menu. So let's save now

23
02:26.520 --> 02:28.740
and fresh.

24
02:29.110 --> 02:33.040
And now we have a mega menu. And it's all about the styling here.

25
02:33.040 --> 02:37.480
Let's add class "open" for this menu.

26
02:37.840 --> 02:42.570
So this menu item as you can see will have the class "mega" and class "cols-4".

27
02:42.670 --> 02:45.940
And these are arbitrary class names that I choose.

28
02:45.980 --> 02:53.960
And now let's take a look at the submenu. And let's take a look at the styles.

29
02:54.040 --> 03:02.450
Now as you can see if the menu item has a class "mega" I styled the submenu differently.

30
03:02.500 --> 03:09.150
So it now takes the full width and also "display : flex" instead of "block" in order to create these columns.

31
03:09.310 --> 03:10.630
And for submenus

32
03:13.880 --> 03:18.260
I will have a width of 25% because it's four columns.

33
03:18.260 --> 03:22.450
So if you have a class "mega" and class "cols-4" we will give it a width of 25.

34
03:22.460 --> 03:28.270
And if "cols-3" then three columns then 33.33%.

35
03:28.280 --> 03:29.330
So let's try and do this. Let's

36
03:32.400 --> 03:37.650
change the "cols-4" for into 3 columns.

37
03:39.810 --> 03:43.060
And in my CSS I style the 3 columns differently.

38
03:43.230 --> 03:46.200
So if we take a look now. The three columns

39
03:46.200 --> 03:48.550
And the other one collapsed in a new row.

40
03:48.900 --> 03:51.300
So as I mentioned this, it's whole about the styling.

41
03:51.450 --> 03:54.090
And as you know this is not what this course is about.

42
03:54.090 --> 03:55.280
I'm pretty sure you can

43
03:55.560 --> 04:03.220
you can change the style of the menu as you like using these classes. Or any classes that you will instruct

44
04:03.490 --> 04:04.760
your users to add here.

45
04:04.900 --> 04:13.380
So you can take a look at in header.scss. And this is my CSS.

46
04:13.450 --> 04:15.410
You can take a look at it if you want.

47
04:15.970 --> 04:19.020
And so here is the styling of menu item

48
04:19.060 --> 04:22.600
if it does not have a class "mega". So "not(.mega)".

49
04:23.110 --> 04:26.190
And here is the one with a class "mega".

50
04:26.200 --> 04:34.420
So you know different styling and then we have a loop for the number of columns from 1 to 6 and stuff

51
04:34.420 --> 04:35.000
like that.

52
04:35.200 --> 04:38.470
So I don't want to get much deeper into the CSS stuff.

53
04:38.500 --> 04:41.260
I'm pretty sure you can do this yourself.

54
04:41.380 --> 04:45.270
So this is the easiest way to create mega menus.

55
04:45.370 --> 04:50.320
I know it might not be the most user friendly as you should type some stuff here.

56
04:50.410 --> 04:56.160
Maybe in the advanced sections at the end of this course we'll try to explore a better way to do it.

57
04:56.200 --> 04:58.810
But for now I think this is perfectly fine.

58
04:58.830 --> 05:02.660
Just start working in the accessibility bit in the next lectures.
