So let's do the Link Post Format in this lecture.

1
00:05.670 --> 00:11.620
So let's go and create a file called content-link.

2
00:15.850 --> 00:20.610
And let's go to the guide and see what the link format should look like.

3
00:20.670 --> 00:23.250
So Link Post Format is a link to another site.

4
00:23.250 --> 00:30.080
Themes may wish to use the first A tag in the post as the external link for the post.

5
00:30.120 --> 00:33.810
An alternative approach could be if the post consists of only a URL

6
00:33.820 --> 00:40.090
then that will we the URL of the post and the post title will be the name attached to the anchor for it.

7
00:40.100 --> 00:42.890
So let's go to this post.

8
00:42.910 --> 00:49.190
And it's gone now because we created an empty content-link file.

9
00:49.200 --> 00:58.200
So let's go to this post in the backend. Let's search for "link". And let's edit it.

10
00:58.450 --> 01:03.880
And what this guide suggested is that this post will only contain

11
01:03.880 --> 01:09.470
a URL. And then we will display this URL in a certain way. So what we'll do is

12
01:09.480 --> 01:13.280
basically the same thing we did for the "aside".

13
01:13.290 --> 01:15.390
So let's copy this and paste.

14
01:16.090 --> 01:22.390
What we do is, we display the content. And the content will just a URL. And we'll also display the date.

15
01:22.400 --> 01:26.960
And in the single page we display the tags and categories. 

16
01:27.100 --> 01:31.480
So let's see what will this look like. And as you can

17
01:31.480 --> 01:34.920
see we've post content which will be just a link. And we want to

18
01:33.310 --> 01:37.270
display this link maybe in a more significant way.

19
01:37.850 --> 01:45.030
So I think I added some styling but if this is called "excerpt" and not "content".

20
01:45.040 --> 01:47.530
So let's do that.

21
01:47.560 --> 01:53.180
And for this class I added a background color and I made the text for the link a little bit bigger.

22
01:53.190 --> 02:00.170
So let's inspect. So since you are using the post_class() function

23
02:00.170 --> 02:04.130
each post will have some classes and you already know that. One of 

24
02:04.140 --> 02:07.990
these classes will have the "format" . So we have "format-link" here. So I

25
02:08.000 --> 02:12.170
used this class "format-link" and then "post__excerpt" and then P tag.

26
02:12.170 --> 02:12.750
And the P tag 

27
02:13.780 --> 02:16.400
is the P tag that will be automatically added by the WordPress editor.

28
02:16.420 --> 02:21.400
And then style this P tag and the link to look a little bit different.

29
02:22.200 --> 02:25.930
So that's actually it for the Link Post Format.

30
02:25.940 --> 02:32.400
Your post format will be just a link. And then you'll display the content here in a certain way.

31
02:32.570 --> 02:35.590
So let's see the Quote Post Format in the next lecture.

32
02:35.600 --> 02:40.050
It will be a bit similar to the Link Post Format. So see you in the next lecture.
