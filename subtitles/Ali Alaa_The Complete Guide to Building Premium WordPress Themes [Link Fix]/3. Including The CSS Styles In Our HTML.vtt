00:03.460 --> 00:05.600
So in the last lecture we've added our CSS styles.

1
00:05.660 --> 00:09.330
Let's now use these styles actually to make this look a bit better.

2
00:09.330 --> 00:16.510
So we need to use our CSS grid now. So let's go to index.php.

3
00:17.400 --> 00:25.680
And I'm gonna add our container class, so "<div class=" with a class of

4
00:28.480 --> 00:37.670
"o-container" and remember "o" stands for object and then "u-margin-bottom-

5
00:40.250 --> 00:42.930
40" and this is a utility class.

6
00:46.830 --> 00:47.980
And let's close it. 

7
00:52.950 --> 00:54.310
And then I'm gonna add a row.

8
01:00.080 --> 01:00.880
And my class is called

9
01:00.890 --> 01:02.270
"o-row".

10
01:05.440 --> 01:11.330
And then a column.

11
01:11.450 --> 01:19.350
So it's "o-row__column". And that's following the BEM convention.

12
01:20.000 --> 01:28.300
And then I'm gonna copy that to save time and then paste it and then "--span-12".

13
01:28.310 --> 01:38.000
So this will span the entire row. And then for medium screens we need it to span just 8. So "8

14
01:39.170 --> 01:40.310
@medium".

15
01:40.310 --> 01:48.260
And that's also a convention I'm using. The "@" and then the screen size for media queries.

16
01:49.010 --> 01:51.430
So this will span 8 for medium screens and 12

17
01:51.540 --> 01:56.590
otherwise. I'm gonna also add a HTML5 MAIN tag here.

18
02:00.460 --> 02:07.510
And you should use these tags whenever you can. So "main" means that this is the main content of the page

19
02:07.600 --> 02:14.890
because we will have a sidebar in a moment. So the sidebar will have a different tag also which would signify

20
02:14.890 --> 02:18.460
that. This is not the main content it's just the side content.

21
02:18.460 --> 02:20.890
So let's now close our tags.

22
02:24.210 --> 02:25.400
We have the "/main".

23
02:28.160 --> 02:30.370
And two "/div".

24
02:38.000 --> 02:43.810
Great. So inside the row we'll have another column for the sidebar.

25
02:43.850 --> 02:55.740
So I'm gonna just copy this to save time and close it. And just instead of "8", it will be "4". And inside

26
02:55.740 --> 03:02.700
of here we will fetch the sidebar and to do that we will use get_sidebar().

27
03:07.080 --> 03:16.030
So get_sidebar() will get a file in your theme called sidebar.php. So let's create an empty file now.

28
03:16.140 --> 03:25.890
And in the next lecture we will see how to fill our sidebar. So sidebar.php. And let's type some text.

29
03:29.910 --> 03:31.660
And I think that will should do it.

30
03:31.660 --> 03:34.870
So let's see our browser now.

31
03:35.080 --> 03:37.720
And it's looking much better now and we have a sidebar

32
03:37.720 --> 03:42.090
and our main content. Let's now add some style to the posts.

33
03:42.580 --> 03:53.230
So at the start of the posts I'm gonna wrap it in an ARTICLE tag and this is a good HTML5 tag to use

34
03:53.330 --> 03:56.860
for a blog post.

35
03:56.860 --> 03:59.770
So "article" and then close it.

36
04:05.200 --> 04:12.910
Let's just add some space here.

37
04:13.050 --> 04:20.580
So the class name I gave for a blog post is "c" because it's a component and "-post". However only give

38
04:20.580 --> 04:30.630
a class name to a post you should use the PHP function, WordPress function actually which is called "post_class()". And

39
04:30.630 --> 04:35.160
post_class() will generate some classes for each post.

40
04:35.340 --> 04:42.510
And this could be very useful in styling, you know, special type of posts like sticky post. WordPress will automatically

41
04:42.540 --> 04:44.070
give it a sticky class.

42
04:44.470 --> 04:50.490
And all sort of stuff we'll see that in a moment. And it takes as an argument extra classes that we want

43
04:50.490 --> 04:53.410
to give so "c-post".

44
04:53.610 --> 04:56.450
And let's also give it a margin "u-margin-bottom

45
04:59.690 --> 05:04.200
-20". So let's save and see how it looks like.

46
05:04.220 --> 05:07.090
So here, we have some improvements here.

47
05:07.760 --> 05:17.230
So let's inspect and as you can see, we have some classes here that WordPress generated aside from our classes. So we've the "post"

48
05:17.410 --> 05:20.710
and "-" the post id and than "post type-post".

49
05:21.190 --> 05:27.250
So we'll have all sorts of information about the post in the class so that you can target specific posts.

50
05:27.310 --> 05:30.280
So we have the post formats, the category, and the tags.

51
05:30.310 --> 05:35.680
So as you can see, I styled the sticky post, you know, with a border here.

52
05:35.680 --> 05:37.890
So this will be very useful.

53
05:38.020 --> 05:42.280
It's actually mandatory to add this post_class() function.

54
05:42.370 --> 05:43.280
You should add it.

55
05:43.360 --> 05:44.290
It's not optional.

56
05:44.300 --> 05:45.110
So let's carry on here.

57
05:45.130 --> 05:56.820
I have my class name for the title which is "c-post__title".

58
05:57.260 --> 06:01.730
I also have a class for the meta information

59
06:01.740 --> 06:07.310
which is "c-posts__meta". Also

60
06:07.890 --> 06:13.400
same thing for the excerpt.

61
06:13.580 --> 06:15.850
And finally the "readmore_link".

62
06:15.910 --> 06:21.450
Let's go to the helpers functions in the lib folder.

63
06:22.040 --> 06:33.120
And we already added the "screen-reader" class here. We just need to add another class for the link itself. So "c-post

64
06:34.240 --> 06:38.260
__readmore".

65
06:39.730 --> 06:42.620
So I think that's it. Let's see how it looks like now.

66
06:43.020 --> 06:44.830
And yes, it looks a lot better.

67
06:44.840 --> 06:56.540
And as you can see now the read more screen reader text has disappeared because we have loaded our classes. So this can be much

68
06:56.540 --> 06:57.200
better now.

69
06:57.200 --> 07:05.540
One last thing we should add like the post_class() function that we added for the post.

70
07:05.680 --> 07:09.970
There is a similar class that we should add for the BODY.

71
07:10.580 --> 07:17.590
So let's open PHP and it's called body_class(). And you can add more classes but we don't need to do

72
07:17.590 --> 07:20.350
that in our case.

73
07:20.800 --> 07:24.290
So let's see what this did.

74
07:24.370 --> 07:25.900
And let's refresh and

75
07:28.840 --> 07:30.240
inspect.

76
07:30.580 --> 07:39.430
And as you can see it adds some classes here. So "blog logged-in admin-bar" and this will change whenever you.

77
07:39.690 --> 07:41.300
Let's visit a single post.

78
07:41.420 --> 07:45.520
And now we have different classes "single", "postid" and stuff like that.

79
07:45.520 --> 07:49.420
So this also could be useful for you and it's also mandatory to add.

80
07:49.540 --> 07:54.380
So even if you are not gonna use it add it to avoid theme rejections and stuff like that. 

81
07:54.430 --> 07:56.810
So I think that's it for this lecture.

82
07:57.430 --> 08:04.620
Let's see how to create sidebars and widgets in the next lecture.
