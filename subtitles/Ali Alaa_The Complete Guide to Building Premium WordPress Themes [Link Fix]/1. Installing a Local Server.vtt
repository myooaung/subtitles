In this lecture we'll see how to set up a local server in your machine in order to run a WordPress website.

1
00:10.830 --> 00:15.390
If this is not the first time for you to work with Wordpress or PHP and you already know how to

2
00:15.390 --> 00:16.750
set up a local server,

3
00:17.010 --> 00:18.760
you can go ahead and skip this lecture.

4
00:20.780 --> 00:26.300
In order to have a WordPress website up and running, you're gonna need a server to work on and there

5
00:26.300 --> 00:31.390
are some specifications for your server that WordPress require in order to run properly.

6
00:31.400 --> 00:36.580
So first you need an HTTP Server. And WordPress recommends using Apache.

7
00:36.950 --> 00:41.560
And second you need PHP version 5.2.4 or higher.

8
00:42.140 --> 00:51.300
And finally you need MySQL version 5.0.15 or higher or any version of MariaDB. But you don't need

9
00:51.300 --> 00:55.080
to have a real server in order to develop WordPress locally.

10
00:55.440 --> 01:01.590
You can install all of these requirements on your computer and run your website locally. So we can go

11
01:01.590 --> 01:06.140
ahead and install PHP and Apache and MySQL separately.

12
01:06.450 --> 01:12.960
However there are many softwares that do that for you without the hassle of dealing with each one separately.

13
01:12.960 --> 01:22.200
Amongst these softwares are MAMP, WAMP, LAMP, XAMPP, Laragon and many more. And they all do pretty much

14
01:22.290 --> 01:23.450
the same thing.

15
01:23.690 --> 01:26.280
In this course I'll be using the MAMP.

16
01:26.310 --> 01:31.200
It runs on both Windows and Mac. And it's pretty easy to use.

17
01:31.220 --> 01:35.940
So let's go ahead now and install MAMP. So to install MAMP,

18
01:35.990 --> 01:38.520
it's a very simple procedure.

19
01:38.550 --> 01:45.120
I'm on Google Chrome now and I'm gonna google MAMP and it's mamp.info.

20
01:47.310 --> 01:51.480
So all you have to do is just choose your platform and download it.

21
01:53.660 --> 01:59.390
It's I think a 300 megabytes download or something like that.

22
01:59.440 --> 02:06.340
So after downloading and installing MAMP, I am gonna grab my Mac Finder here. And on Windows you can

23
02:06.340 --> 02:15.130
open the C Drive. And inside of the applications folder in Mac, you will find a couple of folders MAMP and

24
02:15.190 --> 02:19.290
MAMP PRO. In this course we'll use the regular version MAMP.

25
02:19.430 --> 02:24.920
So let's now launch the MAMP application.

26
02:25.120 --> 02:34.190
And as I mentioned we'll use the regular version. And all you have to do here is just press Start Servers. And

27
02:34.190 --> 02:41.050
this will take a while and then it will open up this information page. And this will contain some information

28
02:41.050 --> 02:47.440
about your MySQL configuration, reports and the passwords and stuff like that.

29
02:47.770 --> 02:57.120
And you may have noticed that this page runs on port 8888. So any website that we will install on this

30
02:57.120 --> 03:00.870
server, we will access it using this URL.

31
03:01.170 --> 03:02.720
So let's try this out now.

32
03:02.750 --> 03:11.420
So let's open the MAMP folder. And in the MAMP folder you will find a folder called htdocs. And this is

33
03:11.420 --> 03:16.510
the folder that you will use in order to put any files that you want to put on the server.

34
03:16.990 --> 03:21.640
So inside this folder let's create a new folder and let's call it test.

35
03:25.440 --> 03:32.250
And let's go to localhost and the port and then slash test. And as you can see there is something here

36
03:32.580 --> 03:36.730
So let's try now and create a new file in this folder that we've just created.

37
03:38.290 --> 03:40.330
I'm gonna  open my text editor now.

38
03:40.440 --> 03:46.840
I'm using Visual Studio Code and you can use any text you like. But I really recommend using the Visual Studio Code

39
03:46.880 --> 03:50.860
if you don't already have a favorite text editor.

40
03:51.330 --> 03:55.840
But anyways let's open the folder that we just created inside of our text editor.

41
03:59.710 --> 04:08.880
And let's create a new file index.html. And now inside of this file let's type any text and then save.

42
04:11.290 --> 04:13.270
And let's go to the browser and refresh.

43
04:13.340 --> 04:16.940
And as expected we find the text that we just typed.

44
04:16.980 --> 04:22.520
So now we are ready to install WordPress on this server and create a database and all the stuff required

45
04:22.520 --> 04:24.240
to run our WordPress websites.

46
04:24.440 --> 04:25.160
So see you in the next lecture.
