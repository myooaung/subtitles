00:03.120 --> 00:08.970
So in the last lecture we installed a local server on our machine. And then we confirmed everything is working

1
00:08.970 --> 00:13.700
fine by creating a dummy folder with an index.html file.

2
00:14.190 --> 00:20.370
So now we need to install WordPress on this server. And to do that we will have to download the latest

3
00:20.370 --> 00:22.050
copy WordPress.

4
00:22.260 --> 00:27.860
So let's go to wordpress.org and make sure it's .org and not .com.

5
00:31.140 --> 00:37.660
And all you have to do is just press downloads and it's a small download it's about 9 megabytes.

6
00:38.900 --> 00:45.930
And as I'm recording this the latest version is 4.9.5. And if yours is different doesn't

7
00:45.930 --> 00:49.350
matter just download the latest version.

8
00:49.380 --> 00:56.690
So after downloading open the htdocs folder and then copy your WordPress zip file that you

9
00:56.780 --> 01:02.390
just downloaded into this folder. And let us also unzip it.

10
01:03.700 --> 01:04.940
And now we have a folder.

11
01:05.490 --> 01:12.180
So this WordPress folder is gonna be the core of our website. And this folder only belongs to just

12
01:12.330 --> 01:13.550
one WordPress website.

13
01:13.680 --> 01:18.690
So if you want to develop another WordPress website, you're gonna have to repeat the same process again and

14
01:18.690 --> 01:23.820
create a new WordPress folder. So one folder means one website.

15
01:23.840 --> 01:29.810
So I think it's a good idea to rename the folder from WordPress to the particular website that we are

16
01:29.810 --> 01:31.520
developing.

17
01:31.550 --> 01:39.800
So in our case I'm gonna rename it to, I don't know, myfirsttheme maybe. So let's now try to visit our website on

18
01:39.920 --> 01:50.850
localhost and then the 4 eights and then /myfirsttheme.

19
01:51.240 --> 01:57.660
So we will be taken to an installation wizard. So you'll be asked to choose a language first

20
01:58.230 --> 02:02.370
and then you will be asked to type some database information. So let's hit Continue.

21
02:02.970 --> 02:08.120
And we haven't yet mentioned anything about how to manage databases in MAMP, right?

22
02:08.160 --> 02:11.520
So let's discuss that briefly.

23
02:11.550 --> 02:18.960
So in order to easily manage databases most PHP servers come with a web application called phpMyAdmin.

24
02:19.410 --> 02:26.490
phpMyAdmin provides an interface to manage databases without writing any code. And to access phpMyAdmin

25
02:26.620 --> 02:34.880
let's go to localhost and then our port and /phpmyadmin. And I'm already logged in here,

26
02:34.920 --> 02:42.220
but ypu'll probably have to login. And for MAMP the default username and password are root, both are root. r double

27
02:42.220 --> 02:43.140
o t.

28
02:43.200 --> 02:46.580
So here we have the list of all databases that we have in MAMP.

29
02:46.620 --> 02:48.060
So let's create a new one.

30
02:48.150 --> 02:52.650
So let's click new and then just type the name of the database.

31
02:52.690 --> 02:53.290
Let's call it

32
02:53.470 --> 02:59.210
also myfirsttheme and let's click create and that's it.

33
02:59.610 --> 03:00.380
So let's go back now

34
03:00.380 --> 03:05.280
to the installation tab and let's carry on with our installation.

35
03:07.790 --> 03:14.720
And here we'll have to type the database name and the username and password which are for me root and root.

36
03:17.300 --> 03:21.990
And we won't have to change the host or the table prefix.

37
03:22.190 --> 03:24.370
So let's just leave it like to.

38
03:24.740 --> 03:27.320
And if you mistype anything you will get an error here.

39
03:27.340 --> 03:37.110
But in our case  let's just run the installation. And here we'll have to type a Site Title, let's type My First Theme and

40
03:37.110 --> 03:45.150
then a Username. Let's call it admin and a Password. Let's also call it admin for simplicity. And then type

41
03:45.150 --> 03:48.190
your Email.

42
03:48.250 --> 03:56.860
So let's install and if we switch back to phpMyAdmin now, we'll find that WordPress has populated our database

43
03:57.220 --> 03:58.960
with some tables.

44
03:58.960 --> 04:02.990
So let's go back now and login with admin admin. Our username and password.

45
04:06.940 --> 04:11.890
And now you'll get the default WordPress admin dashboard.

46
04:12.120 --> 04:22.170
And if you visit the actual website you will find, you know, a default theme. And to change it we can go

47
04:22.170 --> 04:28.330
to Appearance and Themes and you'll find, you know, a bunch of default themes.

48
04:28.450 --> 04:33.480
And now it's our job to create our own theme and we'll start doing that in the next lecture.
