00:02.790 --> 00:10.260
So in the last lecture we created a template for the author. Let's now create a couple of more templates. And

1
00:10.310 --> 00:12.470
let's start by search.

2
00:12.600 --> 00:20.210
So when you search for something, you get a page and this page will fallback to archive.php

3
00:20.450 --> 00:21.240
or actually

4
00:21.250 --> 00:30.000
I think index.php. And you can create a search.php file in order to override the index.php template.

5
00:30.050 --> 00:32.940
So let's do that. Let's create a new file

6
00:34.360 --> 00:41.110
search.php. And this will also be exactly like the archive.

7
00:43.950 --> 00:46.320
But we'll just have to change the HEADER

8
00:46.320 --> 00:47.640
here, the title.

9
00:47.820 --> 00:48.920
So let's remove these.

10
00:49.000 --> 00:55.990
And we'll also have to instead of "archive" let's type "search" and for the HEADER let's output an H1 tag. And

11
00:55.990 --> 01:06.710
let's open PHP. And here we'll output some title. So let's do a printf() and escaped and translated text. So

12
01:07.620 --> 01:13.150
this will be the first argument and the text will be "Search results for: "

13
01:14.850 --> 01:24.850
and then a placeholder. And of course the text domain. And the second argument for the printf()

14
01:24.970 --> 01:28.330
will be what we need to replace the placeholder with.

15
01:28.480 --> 01:35.030
So let's use a function called get_search_query(). And this will get what we are searching for.

16
01:35.220 --> 01:40.970
I think we used this before in the search form. So the let's see now.

17
01:44.230 --> 01:46.960
And as you can see we now have "Search results for: "

18
01:47.320 --> 01:49.070
And then what we typed here.

19
01:49.330 --> 01:56.490
And that will be it for the search template. Let's also create another template.

20
01:56.530 --> 01:59.550
And this one is called 404.php.

21
02:02.520 --> 02:07.370
And of course this will be for the not found pages.

22
02:07.430 --> 02:14.280
So let's also copy the archive just for the, instead of typing the layouts, the rows and columns. And we don't

23
02:14.280 --> 02:18.330
need a sidebar.

24
02:18.510 --> 02:19.950
We don't need any template parts.

25
02:20.000 --> 02:21.710
There is no loop here.

26
02:21.900 --> 02:22.790
You don't need a title.

27
02:25.960 --> 02:32.670
And this will always be 12, actually you can remove this.

28
02:36.210 --> 02:42.070
And output some text to in an H3 tag maybe.

29
02:42.430 --> 02:49.120
And let's open PHP and escaped and translated text.

30
02:49.290 --> 02:50.320
Sorry "html".

31
02:53.580 --> 02:55.010
So we can type

32
02:55.220 --> 02:56.880
"Nothing found here,

33
02:57.090 --> 03:03.000
maybe you can try to search?".

34
03:03.190 --> 03:10.910
And then below this text will output the search form. So after the H3 let's open another PHP 

35
03:13.140 --> 03:15.960
and get_search_form().

36
03:16.410 --> 03:19.130
And of course you can do whatever you want in the 404 page.

37
03:19.300 --> 03:20.910
And this is just an example.

38
03:21.390 --> 03:25.650
And let's see now. Let's go to a page that is not found.

39
03:25.950 --> 03:32.480
So maybe you can go to a post ID that is not exist or something.

40
03:32.670 --> 03:38.480
And as you can see we'll have our text and the search form. And of course you can style this better than i did here but

41
03:38.720 --> 03:41.110
it is just an example.

42
03:41.280 --> 03:47.070
You probably have noticed that most of the templates that we created were for the posts, right?

43
03:47.090 --> 03:52.840
The archives and the single and the author. But we haven't done yet anything for the pages.

44
03:52.980 --> 03:58.700
So let's go to a page now and it's actually still falling back to the index.php.

45
03:58.800 --> 04:05.250
So if we take a look at this chart here we'll find that for a single page we have to create a file

46
04:05.250 --> 04:07.140
called page.php.

47
04:07.380 --> 04:09.730
So let's create this file in the next lecture.
