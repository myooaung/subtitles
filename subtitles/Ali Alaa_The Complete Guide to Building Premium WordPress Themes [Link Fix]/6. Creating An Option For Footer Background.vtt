00:03.760 --> 00:11.100
Remember when we creating the footer and registering sidebars we defined some variables here. And we mentioned

1
00:11.100 --> 00:14.540
that these variables will be in the options page later.

2
00:14.670 --> 00:20.690
So let's do this now. Let's do couple of options for the footer kayout and the footer background.

3
00:20.850 --> 00:28.070
So these variables exist in three places; in the info, we have the background and in the widgets, we have the

4
00:28.070 --> 00:28.830
layout and background.

5
00:28.850 --> 00:34.320
And also when we registered the sideboards we have them here.

6
00:34.760 --> 00:40.990
So let's have these three files open and let's create some new fields in the Customizer.

7
00:41.480 --> 00:42.640
So I've added some widgets here.

8
00:42.820 --> 00:44.530
In order to see what we're doing.

9
00:44.660 --> 00:55.890
So now let's add some more settings and controls in the Footer Options. So let's go to customize.php and let's

10
00:55.900 --> 01:04.500
start by adding the footer background. So let's add a new control or setting to the $wp-customize class.

11
01:10.540 --> 01:23.620
And let's call it of course prefixed and "_themename_footer_bg" and give it an array options.

12
01:24.890 --> 01:31.820
So I have a "default" value and it's defaulted to "dark". 

13
01:35.260 --> 01:37.590
and we also have to sanitize.

14
01:38.320 --> 01:41.240
So let's add a function to sanitize.

15
01:41.680 --> 01:44.480
So the this option will be a drop down.

16
01:44.620 --> 01:46.650
It will be either dark or light.

17
01:46.720 --> 01:52.480
So to sanitize that we can use sanitized_text_field because a dropdown will return a text eventually.

18
01:52.510 --> 01:59.260
But we will also need to make sure that this text is either dark or light and not something else.

19
01:59.260 --> 02:04.770
So let's create a custom function and let's call it first prefix and "sanitize_

20
02:07.900 --> 02:08.820
footer_bg"

21
02:12.260 --> 02:13.890
And let's write this function now.

22
02:16.830 --> 02:17.690
So "function".

23
02:21.190 --> 02:25.480
And it receives the inputs.

24
02:25.560 --> 02:31.290
So we'll define a variable called $valid and it will be an array of valid options.

25
02:31.290 --> 02:35.730
So we have "light" and we have "dark".

26
02:35.790 --> 02:38.190
These are the only valid options.

27
02:38.370 --> 02:46.950
And then we need to check that our input exists in this array so we will use in_array() function.

28
02:47.580 --> 02:57.120
And it takes the input and the array that we will check against. And it can take a third argument which

29
02:57.810 --> 03:01.930
is a boolean and if it's true it will check for the value on type. I set it to "true".

30
03:01.950 --> 03:07.580
And if the value is in the array we'll return it.

31
03:12.650 --> 03:21.040
And if not we will return the default value which is "dark".

32
03:21.160 --> 03:26.160
So now we're sanitizing the footer background. Let's now create a control for this setting.

33
03:26.550 --> 03:27.510
To, let's copy that

34
03:30.110 --> 03:38.960
and it should be called after the setting. And an array of options.

35
03:39.120 --> 03:41.040
So we need the type to be dropdown.

36
03:41.070 --> 03:43.700
So it will be an HTML select.

37
03:44.020 --> 03:46.520
So let's call "select".

38
03:47.220 --> 03:48.060
We have a "label"

39
03:50.790 --> 03:57.570
let's call it, of course escaped and translated, "Footer Background"

40
04:01.310 --> 04:09.140
and theme domain, our text domain. And for the select we also have an option to add the choices.

41
04:13.520 --> 04:21.780
And it will be an array and the array will hold the values and the keys. So "light", we have "light" and "dark".

42
04:21.890 --> 04:28.790
So the key would be the value of the input and the value in the array would be the text that appears

43
04:28.910 --> 04:29.570
in the dropdown.

44
04:29.570 --> 04:35.070
So of course any text should be escaped and translated.

45
04:49.540 --> 04:57.340
And we need to add this in the footer section so let's copy the section from the site info control. It will

46
04:57.340 --> 04:59.560
be the same.

47
04:59.560 --> 05:05.200
So let's save now and see. We should have a dropdown in the section, footer section.

48
05:05.300 --> 05:09.100
So let's reload.

49
05:09.320 --> 05:10.540
And here we have it.

50
05:10.550 --> 05:12.710
So let's now change it.

51
05:12.740 --> 05:16.970
And of course nothing will happen because we haven't use it in our template yet.

52
05:17.000 --> 05:18.850
So let's do that.

53
05:18.890 --> 05:24.430
Let's now go to the places that we need to replace the hard coded variables with the options.

54
05:24.430 --> 05:32.650
So let's start by the sidebars and let's replace the hard coded text by "get_theme_mod"

55
05:35.810 --> 05:37.300
and the "name" let's copy it.

56
05:41.500 --> 05:45.130
And the "default" value which we chose to the "dark".

57
05:45.640 --> 05:51.160
But remember this is a value from the database so we need to escape it or sanitize it. So what we can do 

58
05:51.160 --> 05:56.280
is we can actually use the same function that we used here.

59
05:56.740 --> 06:05.800
We already defined. So let's do that. And this will ensure that whatever comes from the get_theme_mod() it will be

60
06:06.100 --> 06:12.750
either the value if it's a valid value in this array or the "dark"which is a default value.

61
06:12.820 --> 06:15.170
So this should be perfect for sanitization here.

62
06:15.250 --> 06:20.260
So let's copy this and we'll use the same thing in the other files.

63
06:21.920 --> 06:25.340
Here and in the info.

64
06:29.110 --> 06:30.830
Just one quick notes.

65
06:31.000 --> 06:34.790
If you're submitting this theme to Theme Forest,

66
06:34.850 --> 06:40.370
I'm not sure if they still do that, but from my experience they will search your theme for echo and

67
06:40.370 --> 06:41.530
then $.

68
06:41.810 --> 06:48.470
And if they find any "echo $" for them that will mean that you're echoing an unescaped variable.

69
06:48.530 --> 06:53.170
So although we sanitize that here and we're just echoing it

70
06:53.210 --> 07:02.490
sometimes the reviewers there will consider this unescaped. So you can either just add, instead of adding this function 

71
07:02.510 --> 07:10.090
here, just add it here directly. Or maybe you can just use esc_attr here before echoing.

72
07:10.220 --> 07:14.810
It won't make any difference but just to avoid rejections for this reason.

73
07:15.330 --> 07:18.760
So I'm not gonna do it now but I just thoughtI should tell you.

74
07:18.750 --> 07:21.290
So let's go now to the Customizer.

75
07:22.130 --> 07:24.680
And we should now have.

76
07:25.030 --> 07:25.960
All right.

77
07:26.100 --> 07:27.190
Ok. So

78
07:28.470 --> 07:29.030
We 

79
07:29.270 --> 07:30.660
We define the function here.

80
07:32.540 --> 07:38.330
And we are using in sidebars.php and however in functions.php

81
07:40.980 --> 07:44.080
we include this file after this file.

82
07:44.170 --> 07:49.340
So we just need to include this file first so that when we use the function this file

83
07:49.350 --> 07:54.130
it will be already defined. And let's refresh now.

84
07:56.820 --> 08:03.950
And let's go to Footer Options and change this to "Light". And it's changed.

85
08:03.970 --> 08:09.300
But right now it's refreshing the whole website. So let's change that.

86
08:09.310 --> 08:11.640
So let's add

87
08:11.640 --> 08:13.450
postMessage here, 

88
08:13.600 --> 08:13.990
"transport".

89
08:21.530 --> 08:26.540
And Let's create a partial or actually instead of creating a new partial let's use this one but modify

90
08:26.560 --> 08:26.960
it.

91
08:26.990 --> 08:33.380
So now we will need to add the background setting here as well to refresh this partial when the setting

92
08:33.380 --> 08:34.400
is changed.

93
08:34.400 --> 08:44.200
So this is a comma. And also the partial should not only get the info template but also the widgets template.

94
08:47.670 --> 08:50.550
So now we will get the widgets and the info.

95
08:50.710 --> 08:58.160
So now we have to change the selector.  So the selector that holds both of them is and it looks like I 

96
08:58.180 --> 09:02.520
forgot to save the widgets that I put. So let's add one.

97
09:09.200 --> 09:10.850
So the DIV that holds,

98
09:13.370 --> 09:21.250
apparently we don't have a DIV that holds both the site info and the widgets part. So let's do that

99
09:22.620 --> 09:23.370
in the footer.

100
09:26.170 --> 09:29.680
and we can use an HTML5 FOOTER tag here.

101
09:29.800 --> 09:35.030
So let's give it an ID so the "footer".

102
09:35.540 --> 09:39.340
And it also takes a "role of "contentinfo"

103
09:40.580 --> 09:43.800
"contentinfo".

104
09:43.990 --> 09:50.410
And let's close the FOOTER.

105
09:50.790 --> 09:55.700
And so now we have this footer DIV and it holds both template parts.

106
09:55.800 --> 10:00.880
So in the Customizer we'll change this to the ID of the footer.

107
10:01.350 --> 10:05.970
And this way we will just need to replace the contents and not the whole footer ID.

108
10:05.970 --> 10:13.620
So we'll set this to "false". And when this's refreshed it will get these parts and put them inside the

109
10:13.620 --> 10:17.980
footer without replacing the footer DIV itself.

110
10:18.150 --> 10:20.990
So I think it should work now.

111
10:20.990 --> 10:26.100
So let's try.

112
10:26.180 --> 10:28.220
I always forget to save the widget.

113
10:28.230 --> 10:29.130
So let's add it.

114
10:32.420 --> 10:36.880
And let's publish this time.

115
10:37.050 --> 10:43.370
All right so now we need to try and change this one.

116
10:43.520 --> 10:45.930
And as you can see it only loaded the footer.

117
10:48.570 --> 10:55.410
And now we change this it will also run the same partial because we have now two settings in this

118
10:55.410 --> 11:01.520
partial and both of them will load the both template parts inside the footer that contain them.

119
11:01.830 --> 11:10.560
So I think for this one we might remove it. And it's working fine with the JavaScript postMessage

120
11:10.650 --> 11:23.720
technique so let's just make sure. And this's fine and this is also fine. So let's go ahead now and create

121
11:23.740 --> 11:28.320
our last field for the footer which is the columns for the widgets.

122
11:28.320 --> 11:29.180
See you in the next lecture.
