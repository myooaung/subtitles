So in the last lecture we created a template for pages. And then we mentioned that we have a feature in WordPress

1
00:08.910 --> 00:14.150
called page templates where we can easily create different templates for pages.

2
00:14.200 --> 00:20.700
So let's see how to do that. Let's go to our folder and let's create a new folder in the root directory.

3
00:20.900 --> 00:27.210
And let's call it page-templates. And you can create page templates anywhere in your theme. I just

4
00:27.210 --> 00:33.360
created a new folder just for organization. And let's create a new file and the file can also be called

5
00:33.390 --> 00:34.020
anything.

6
00:34.230 --> 00:38.630
But as a convention it's usually called page-something.

7
00:39.120 --> 00:45.450
So the full page we had had a sidebar, so let's create another page template that will have the full width.

8
00:45.660 --> 00:51.190
So let's call it  page-full.php. 

9
00:54.420 --> 01:03.040
And it'll be the same as page.php which is here. So let's copy this.

10
01:03.210 --> 01:11.050
And the only difference is that we will remove the sidebar and this will be 12 instead of 8.

11
01:11.880 --> 01:14.710
So now we created a page template. how to use it?

12
01:14.730 --> 01:21.320
So when you're editing a page you should have an option here for the page template. But we don't see any option,

13
01:21.330 --> 01:27.930
right? And that's because any page template you create you must define at the very top of the page in

14
01:27.940 --> 01:33.610
a comment, in a PHP comment, that this is page template.

15
01:33.740 --> 01:41.100
So we have to type "Template Name: " and then the name of the template.

16
01:41.330 --> 01:42.550
So let's call it "Full 

17
01:43.460 --> 01:50.310
Width Page". And let's go back to edit the page.

18
01:50.320 --> 01:55.350
And now you will have in the Page Attributes, you will have the templates and you can choose the "Default

19
01:55.350 --> 02:00.720
template" which is page.php or the "Full Width Page" that we've just created.

20
02:00.720 --> 02:02.540
So let's choose this one.

21
02:02.940 --> 02:04.390
And let's view the page now.

22
02:07.270 --> 02:10.870
And now as you can see it will take the full width.

23
02:10.920 --> 02:17.240
So one thing you might want to create also in your theme. You might want to create a page template that

24
02:17.250 --> 02:18.580
is completely blank.

25
02:18.810 --> 02:31.890
So let's go to page templates and create a new file page. And call it page-blank.php. And let's copy the page-full.

26
02:31.930 --> 02:35.320
So this one will be blank.

27
02:35.320 --> 02:40.270
So the blank page should not contain any containers or rows or columns. So let's remove these.

28
02:45.570 --> 02:50.310
And we'll just have the MAIN tag and the content of the page.

29
02:50.460 --> 02:54.640
So let's go now and let's make this a blank page.

30
02:59.260 --> 03:01.860
And we actually don't also need this white background.

31
03:01.900 --> 03:02.740
So let's actually write

32
03:02.830 --> 03:07.270
instead of using this template parts let's write a custom loop for this one.

33
03:07.330 --> 03:10.900
So "while( have posts()) {the_post(); "

34
03:19.450 --> 03:26.710
and let's close the while. And we would like to display the ARTICLE tag also

35
03:26.730 --> 03:29.850
but now without any classes. We don't need any styling for this one.

36
03:33.460 --> 03:40.020
So let's remove the custom classes that we added. And we'll just display the content.

37
03:46.420 --> 03:52.750
So as you can see we now have a blank page completely. And the purpose of this page is that if you have for

38
03:52.750 --> 03:59.410
example a drag and drop editor like visual composer integrated within your theme, you'd like to allow the

39
03:59.740 --> 04:02.580
user to completely build their page.

40
04:02.740 --> 04:07.720
So maybe they would like to add some component that will take the full width like a slider for example

41
04:08.170 --> 04:12.850
and then after that maybe they would like to add rows and columns and stuff like that.

42
04:12.880 --> 04:18.160
So this way you will allow users to have all of the space to create whatever they want

43
04:18.280 --> 04:24.820
using some drag and drop components. And in this course we will probably take a look at how to integrate a

44
04:25.060 --> 04:30.640
visual composer in your theme. Not completely sure yet but it's in my list of things to do.

45
04:30.700 --> 04:33.070
So I think that's it for templates.

46
04:33.070 --> 04:39.220
We now have all the templates that are required for you to release your theme. Let's in the next section discuss

47
04:39.340 --> 04:40.180
another topic.
