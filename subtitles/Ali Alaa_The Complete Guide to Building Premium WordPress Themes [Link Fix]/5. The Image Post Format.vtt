Let's do the Image Post Format in this lecture.

1
00:06.100 --> 00:15.940
So let's search for "post format image". Sorry. And let's also find these in the backend.

2
00:19.210 --> 00:23.940
So we've three images with post format image. So let's see the first one.

3
00:25.850 --> 00:33.800
So like the link and the quote, a post for the post format image can just be a post with only an image in

4
00:33.800 --> 00:34.870
the content.

5
00:35.000 --> 00:39.700
And all we have to do is just display the content which will display this image.

6
00:40.040 --> 00:41.130
So let's do that.

7
00:41.480 --> 00:52.130
And that will also be exactly like the link and the quote. Let's copy that. And let's create content-image

8
00:52.790 --> 00:55.940
and paste.

9
00:55.940 --> 00:59.150
And then let's take a look.

10
00:59.560 --> 01:04.960
And as you can see we have an image and you also have an image with a caption. And that's all what we have

11
01:04.960 --> 01:05.450
to do.

12
01:05.530 --> 01:08.560
Maybe we can just add some spacing here.

13
01:08.810 --> 01:13.520
But you know you can do that. And that will be the image post format.

14
01:13.530 --> 01:17.380
I just noticed we have some weird border here.

15
01:17.380 --> 01:20.710
I think that could be a problem with the post itself.

16
01:20.710 --> 01:27.940
So let's take a look. And yeah, we have some space here so let's remove that.

17
01:28.220 --> 01:30.080
And let's take a look.

18
01:31.770 --> 01:33.240
And yeah it's fine now.

19
01:33.820 --> 01:39.520
So the image post format is just an image that you display. And you should instruct your users that they

20
01:39.520 --> 01:43.530
only have to add an image in the content and nothing more.

21
01:44.080 --> 01:47.410
So you still have three post formats missing.

22
01:47.890 --> 01:54.650
So if you go to theme support we still have, we did the aside and the image. We still have the video and

23
01:54.650 --> 01:58.440
the gallery and the audio. And these ones there will be a little more challenging

24
01:58.570 --> 02:00.030
that what we've done so far.

25
02:00.280 --> 02:01.970
But not very hard as well.

26
02:02.350 --> 02:06.130
So let's take a look at the maybe the video in the next lecture.

27
02:06.340 --> 02:07.210
So see you in the next lecture.
