00:02.710 --> 00:10.500
So we now created our button instead of the just the arrow icon. And now we need to create and add click event

1
00:10.590 --> 00:11.370
on the button.

2
00:11.370 --> 00:17.620
So when a user using the keyboard clicks into, the click event will trigger and the menu will open. 

3
00:17.850 --> 00:28.200
So let's go to the JavaScript navigation.js file. And let's add another event on the "c-navigation".

4
00:29.990 --> 00:39.540
And then "on('click')". And we need to target the menu button.

5
00:43.630 --> 00:48.120
So remember we, let's get this close.

6
00:48.230 --> 00:52.070
Remember we gave a class "menu-button" to the button.

7
00:52.340 --> 00:54.340
So we need to add a click event to that.

8
00:54.330 --> 01:02.710
So let's add a callback function and it will receive the events. And then we'll write our logic here.

9
01:02.870 --> 01:08.050
So before typing anything let's just see the default behavior when we click enter

10
01:08.390 --> 01:17.580
while this button is focused. And we'll taken actually to the link. It will take you to the page which is inside

11
01:17.580 --> 01:19.720
this A tag when you click enter

12
01:19.800 --> 01:28.400
when this button is focused. So we need to prevent this behavior. So to do that  you can call e.preventDefault().

13
01:28.560 --> 01:33.060
And this will prevent any default behaviors. So that we can write our own logic.

14
01:33.060 --> 01:40.530
So now if we focus on the button and click enter nothing will happen. So we can now start typing our logic.

15
01:40.770 --> 01:47.110
So let's define some variables. That's  the one variable called "menu_button".

16
01:48.540 --> 01:53.700
And this wil be the "$(e.currentTarget)".

17
01:53.700 --> 02:02.560
So "menu_button" will be the actual button which we clicked on. And let's define "menu_link" and this will be "menu

18
02:02.580 --> 02:05.630
.button.parent()".

19
02:06.300 --> 02:13.300
And that's because the "menu_link" is the direct parent for the button.

20
02:13.360 --> 02:16.300
So this variablewill now hold the A tag.

21
02:16.420 --> 02:20.100
And another one for the "menu_item" which is the LI.

22
02:21.250 --> 02:27.120
And this will be the "menu_link.parent()".

23
02:28.910 --> 02:34.710
And now we need to do two different things depending on whether the menu is opened or not.

24
02:34.710 --> 02:43.070
So how do you know if the menu is opened or not? It's about checking if the "menu_item" which is the LI "hasClass",

25
02:44.340 --> 02:47.530
sorry, "hasClass('open')".

26
02:47.940 --> 02:52.440
So if the "menu_item" has class "open" then the menu is opened and we'll do something. Else

27
02:52.440 --> 02:59.250
it's close and we do something else. So let's start by when the menu is closed which is the

28
02:59.430 --> 03:00.670
else case here.

29
03:01.280 --> 03:07.360
So what we need to do when the menu is closed, I need to open it. So "menu_item" which is the LI,

30
03:07.760 --> 03:09.960
we'll add a class "open" to it.

31
03:12.310 --> 03:12.960
Right?

32
03:13.240 --> 03:15.880
And let's save now and see.

33
03:16.100 --> 03:18.700
Now let's focus on the button and click enter.

34
03:19.020 --> 03:22.580
And it will add class "open" to the LI which will open the menu.

35
03:22.740 --> 03:25.340
So what else do we need to do when the menu is opened.

36
03:25.770 --> 03:33.030
We need to change "aria-expanded" to "true". And we need to reverse these texts, right? We need to add here "aria-hidden="

37
03:33.270 --> 03:33.790
"true".

38
03:33.850 --> 03:36.190
And "aria-hidden="false"" for this one.

39
03:36.300 --> 03:38.580
So let's do that.

40
03:39.450 --> 03:49.530
So "menu_link" which is the A tag ".attr" and the "aria-expanded" attribute. We'll change

41
03:49.530 --> 03:51.780
it to "true".

42
03:52.700 --> 04:06.270
And then the "menu_button". We'll search inside, sorry ".find". We'll search inside of it for, remember the show and hide classes,

43
04:06.450 --> 04:14.360
so we search for this one. And change its attribute of

44
04:14.820 --> 04:17.390
" aria-hidden" to "true".

45
04:20.230 --> 04:23.180
So we'll hide the "Show" text.

46
04:23.260 --> 04:25.050
Then we'll find the "Hide" text.

47
04:26.340 --> 04:31.390
And this should be a string. And change its value to "false".

48
04:31.440 --> 04:32.820
We don't need to hide it.

49
04:32.910 --> 04:43.350
So let's see now. And I'm gonna click. And now we have "aria-expanded="true"". And now let's expand this.

50
04:43.350 --> 04:47.720
And now this has "aria-hidden="true"" and this one "aria-hidden="false"".

51
04:47.730 --> 04:53.480
So if this button is focused now the screen reader will read the "Hide" text and not the "Show" text.

52
04:53.480 --> 04:57.570
So let's do the opposite for the, when the menu is opened.

53
04:57.650 --> 05:02.210
So what we can do is we can actually copy these and just reverse them.

54
05:02.210 --> 05:03.450
So this will be "false"

55
05:06.070 --> 05:10.410
and this will be "false". And this w ill be "true".

56
05:10.850 --> 05:16.040
So let's save and see.

57
05:16.230 --> 05:18.450
I'm now using my, just my keyboard.

58
05:18.760 --> 05:28.700
So I'm clicking enter now. And it open,  click again and we  oh Ok, we forgot to remove the class.

59
05:28.790 --> 05:30.250
So let's copy this one and

60
05:33.920 --> 05:36.570
instead of add_class(), remove_class().

61
05:41.740 --> 05:45.040
So now I click enter, it opens. A click again it closes.

62
05:45.190 --> 05:49.360
And as you can notice the "aria" attributes are reversed and everything.

63
05:49.740 --> 05:51.000
So let's try something.

64
05:51.410 --> 05:54.770
If we now click enter now and then we click enter.

65
05:54.810 --> 05:58.730
And this it will toggle the submenu.

66
05:59.290 --> 06:02.000
If we go back and close this one and then open it again.

67
06:02.160 --> 06:04.230
This one will still be opened.

68
06:04.350 --> 06:07.230
So when you close the menu we need also to close

69
06:07.230 --> 06:09.320
it's submenus.

70
06:09.540 --> 06:17.090
So let's do that. So instead of removing class "open" from the menu item would add another thing.

71
06:17.660 --> 06:26.960
So "add" will add another elements. And what we will add is "menu_item" which is the LI and if this LI has children

72
06:27.410 --> 06:37.570
we'll find them using "find". So we'll will find other menu items that has class "open".

73
06:40.850 --> 06:44.970
And remove class "open". And same for the "aria-expanded" attribute.

74
06:45.070 --> 06:53.120
We'll add another one which will be the "menu-item" and any child A tag.

75
06:55.740 --> 06:56.700
So let's save now and see.

76
07:01.290 --> 07:06.230
And let's open and open and then go back and close and open again.

77
07:06.270 --> 07:07.450
And now it's closed.

78
07:07.560 --> 07:14.530
So what we've done is we're finding all the A tags and LIs inside of this, the parent LI.

79
07:14.750 --> 07:22.040
So inside this LI we have the submenu which has LIs and if any of them has a class "open" we remove it.

80
07:22.320 --> 07:25.080
And we're also finding the A tags inside the LI.

81
07:25.170 --> 07:27.370
And you are setting the "aria-expanded" to "false".

82
07:27.390 --> 07:28.820
And the same thing.

83
07:28.940 --> 07:31.630
Let's see now another problem that could happen.

84
07:31.910 --> 07:39.540
So imagine we are now having this one opened and then we navigate through it and went to this one and

85
07:39.570 --> 07:43.310
open it and now we have both menus opened. So we need

86
07:43.320 --> 07:47.630
When you open a menu to close the other ones. And to do that we go here.

87
07:47.970 --> 07:54.990
And what we need to do is when we click on a menu item we need to find all it's siblings. So all

88
07:55.080 --> 08:04.460
the other LIs and remove class "open" from them if they have one. So the "menu_item.siblings"

89
08:07.410 --> 08:12.270
and we need to find all siblings that have class "open" and we need to close them. And to close them we

90
08:12.270 --> 08:14.820
need to not just remove the class "open",

91
08:14.820 --> 08:19.690
we need also to do the other things. we need to set the "aria-expanded" and all that stuff.

92
08:20.000 --> 08:24.730
So all we can do is instead of retyping this logic we can find

93
08:24.910 --> 08:28.480
inside the LI, we can find the menu button of this LI.

94
08:28.560 --> 08:36.920
So how do we find it? It will be the direct A tag child and then the direct menu button.

95
08:40.340 --> 08:50.340
So ">a>menu-button" and trigger a click event on this button.

96
08:51.110 --> 08:58.250
So triggering a click event will actually run this function again and run these for the open submenus.

97
08:59.050 --> 09:00.760
So let's save now.

98
09:03.760 --> 09:07.620
Let's open and navigate and open again.

99
09:07.620 --> 09:10.270
And as you can see this one is closed now.

100
09:10.300 --> 09:19.270
So what we've done is when we click enter now we will find all the siblings which are the LIs

101
09:19.420 --> 09:24.950
that has "Sample Page", "Page Pi", "Front Page" and "About The Tests". But we only find siblings that have class

102
09:24.970 --> 09:25.920
"open".

103
09:25.990 --> 09:32.280
And in that case it will be just the LI  with "About The Tests" and then inside this LI we find the menu

104
09:32.290 --> 09:34.480
button and trigger click event on it.

105
09:34.480 --> 09:38.470
So what will happen when we trigger a click event on it? It will close the submenu.

106
09:38.470 --> 09:40.690
It's as if we clicked on the button, like 

107
09:41.380 --> 09:47.630
so. We also have another scenario where we can have a menu opened by clicking on it. 

108
09:47.740 --> 09:51.120
And then if we hovered on another one it will still be opened.

109
09:51.160 --> 09:52.970
So we need to close it.

110
09:53.150 --> 09:58.960
So to do that we'll add a line in the "mouseenter" event. So add an if condition.

111
09:58.960 --> 10:04.280
So if and this if condition will check if we are hovering on a parent element and not on a child

112
10:04.290 --> 10:05.920
element.

113
10:05.980 --> 10:10.300
So "if(!$(e.currentTarget).

114
10:13.970 --> 10:14.740
parents

115
10:18.700 --> 10:21.670
('.sub-menu').lenght)"

116
10:24.850 --> 10:26.080
you have a typo here. 

117
10:26.680 --> 10:30.550
And if the length is more than zero then we have a parent of "sub-menu".

118
10:30.670 --> 10:38.160
So this means that the item hovered on is in the submenu. And if not we need to do something.

119
10:38.410 --> 10:40.270
So what do we need to do here?

120
10:41.280 --> 10:44.920
So imagine we have a menu opened again by clicking.

121
10:45.240 --> 10:50.260
So when we hover on another menu item we need to close all opened menus.

122
10:50.310 --> 11:00.990
So what we need to do is to find ".menu" and the " > .menu-item" which will be a parent menu

123
11:00.990 --> 11:02.700
item that has a class "open".

124
11:05.560 --> 11:06.790
And we need to find

125
11:11.530 --> 11:17.180
the menu, its menu button and trigger an event on it to close it.

126
11:17.200 --> 11:20.800
Same as we did before.

127
11:20.830 --> 11:23.950
So "trigger('click')".

128
11:27.190 --> 11:32.420
Let's save this and I'm gonna open this by clicking.

129
11:32.650 --> 11:40.840
And then hover on this one and it closed the others. Las thing we need to do is if we have a menu

130
11:40.840 --> 11:44.880
item open and we click outside anywhere we need to close it.

131
11:44.920 --> 11:48.010
So let's add a click event on the document.

132
11:58.000 --> 11:59.020
And let's check

133
12:03.370 --> 12:05.830
if we have any opened menu items.

134
12:10.940 --> 12:16.160
".length". So the length will be more than zero

135
12:16.220 --> 12:22.910
if we have any opened menu items. And if so we'll find the". menu"

136
12:25.610 --> 12:30.590
and the "> .menu-item" that is opened

137
12:33.550 --> 12:35.790
and its ".menu-button".

138
12:39.600 --> 12:44.070
And trigger click on it to close it.

139
12:54.340 --> 12:57.410
So now I'm focusing on the button and clicking and nothing happens.

140
12:57.670 --> 13:00.760
And that's because of event bubbling. And event bubbling,

141
13:00.950 --> 13:05.770
you can read about it more but, simply when we click enter here two events are gonna happen.

142
13:05.950 --> 13:10.220
The event for this button and the event for clicking on the document.

143
13:10.330 --> 13:13.390
So what we're actually doing is we are running these two functions.

144
13:14.990 --> 13:17.800
So this one will open the menu and this one will close it.

145
13:18.350 --> 13:27.090
So to avoid that we will type here "e.stopPropagation". And this will avoid running this event listener.

146
13:27.140 --> 13:28.700
when we click on the button.

147
13:31.330 --> 13:32.190
So let's check now.

148
13:35.040 --> 13:39.840
And let's click outside and it's working.

149
13:40.430 --> 13:44.520
So now we have a fully accessible menu.

150
13:46.290 --> 13:49.590
So I know this section was maybe a little bit complicated.

151
13:49.800 --> 13:55.790
I really urge you to read this script and try to understanding line by line.

152
13:56.040 --> 14:00.880
And if you have any questions don't hesitate and ask me on e-mail or Twitter.

153
14:01.040 --> 14:04.300
We'll do a minor improvement for the menu in the next lecture.

154
14:04.710 --> 14:06.650
And then we carry on to the next section.
