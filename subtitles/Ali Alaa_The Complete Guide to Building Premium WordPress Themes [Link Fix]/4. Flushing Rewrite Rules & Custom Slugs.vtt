00:03.150 --> 00:05.860
So in the last lecture we registered a custom post type.

1
00:05.940 --> 00:12.780
But then when we created a new portfolio item and we tried to view it, we got a 404 page.

2
00:13.140 --> 00:15.940
And the reason is we are using pretty permalink.

3
00:16.320 --> 00:22.140
So if you take a look at the URL here you'll find it's "_themename_portfolio/" the name of the item that

4
00:22.140 --> 00:23.670
we created.

5
00:23.670 --> 00:32.640
So let's go to Settings and Permalinks. And I think we mentioned this before but in WordPress you can use

6
00:32.820 --> 00:38.850
a plain permalink which will have the query args like so. Or you can have a pretty permalink which will

7
00:38.850 --> 00:45.540
have a certain format like one of these. But the server actually needs the plain permalink in order to

8
00:45.540 --> 00:48.360
process your request, in order to display your page.

9
00:48.360 --> 00:53.820
So if you use pretty permalinks WordPress creates some configuration in your server that will map

10
00:54.000 --> 00:58.710
these pretty permalinks to the actual plain permalink.

11
00:58.710 --> 01:04.860
So when you are using pretty permalinks, somehow they are converted to plain permalinks eventually.

12
01:04.860 --> 01:11.870
So let's go to post categories to illustrate more. And let's try to view a category.

13
01:11.880 --> 01:15.900
And as you can see the URL is "category/" category name.

14
01:16.110 --> 01:17.180
So that's what you'll see here.

15
01:17.190 --> 01:25.230
But on the server this will be seen as a normal query arg that is called "category_name="

16
01:25.340 --> 01:26.770
the name of the category.

17
01:26.850 --> 01:29.370
And this will lead to the same page. 

18
01:29.400 --> 01:37.110
And actually URL will be converted back to the pretty URL. So WordPress stores this configuration

19
01:37.230 --> 01:46.880
or this URL mapping thing in the database in a table called wp_options. So let's browse this table.

20
01:46.880 --> 01:55.260
And here you'll find rewrite rules. So let's copy this key and to get something from wp_options table we

21
01:55.260 --> 01:58.840
can call a function called get_option().

22
01:59.010 --> 02:06.090
So I'm here having the header.php and I'm gonna open PRE tags and then PHP

23
02:06.150 --> 02:09.080
tags and then "var_dump (get option())"

24
02:12.130 --> 02:17.690
And then "rewrite_rules" to and let's remove the $default.

25
02:18.580 --> 02:27.440
And let's take a look now at our website. As you can see we have here some rewrite rules and it's an array

26
02:27.440 --> 02:28.610
of keys and values.

27
02:28.610 --> 02:32.110
So for example we were taking a look at the category archive.

28
02:32.240 --> 02:39.990
So somewhere here you will find "categories/" something and this will get mapped to "category_name="

29
02:40.010 --> 02:42.130
something, right?

30
02:42.140 --> 02:48.200
So you don't have to understand all of this. But you can just get an idea of what rewrite rules are and

31
02:48.200 --> 02:55.420
if you do now Cmd+F and search for "portfolio", we won't find here anything that will map the portfolio 

32
02:55.440 --> 02:56.090
URLs.

33
02:56.210 --> 02:56.780
Right?

34
02:56.810 --> 03:00.240
And that's why this URL is not working.

35
03:01.220 --> 03:08.450
So if you go now back to the permalink settings and resave this permalinks WordPress will update

36
03:08.560 --> 03:11.770
the rewrite rules. And let's refresh now.

37
03:13.270 --> 03:17.320
And as you can see we have new rules for "_themename_portfolio".

38
03:17.890 --> 03:26.350
So if we go now to the portfolio item and refresh, we will now have our portfolio item. And currently it uses

39
03:26.510 --> 03:32.350
the single.php but we can create a separate single page for it. We'll see how later.

40
03:32.770 --> 03:37.990
So that was a brief idea on how pretty permalinks work on WordPress.

41
03:38.020 --> 03:46.270
Let's remove this now and what we need to do now is we need whenever you activate the custom fields plugin

42
03:46.320 --> 03:54.860
oh sorry, the custom post types plugin, we need to automatically refresh these rewrite rules, right? Without

43
03:54.860 --> 03:59.580
actually having to go to the permalinks and saving the permalink settings.

44
03:59.870 --> 04:06.650
So WordPress actually provides a function called flush_rewrite_rules(). And the function will update the rewrite

45
04:06.650 --> 04:09.330
rules without having to save them here.

46
04:09.920 --> 04:12.620
But when can we run this function?

47
04:12.770 --> 04:21.160
Let's go to the index of the plugin. And plugins have a nice feature where you can run some code

48
04:21.230 --> 04:28.210
once the plugin is activated. And to do that we can call a function called register_activation_hook().

49
04:29.780 --> 04:37.400
And it takes the entry file of the plugin, the index.php. So we can get that using the PHP magic constant

50
04:37.660 --> 04:38.040
__FILE__.

51
04:40.880 --> 04:45.620
And it takes a function. And this function will run once the plugin is activated.

52
04:45.620 --> 04:54.230
So let's call it "_themename__pluginname_activate". And let's create

53
04:54.380 --> 04:55.490
this function.

54
04:56.090 --> 05:00.790
And here we can call flush_rewrite_rules(), right?

55
05:03.470 --> 05:04.730
And in order to test this,

56
05:04.760 --> 05:09.950
we need to somehow remove the rewrite rules that we already created for the portfolio items.

57
05:09.950 --> 05:17.360
So let's save. And now the portfolio item link will work and we need to get it back to not working.

58
05:17.390 --> 05:18.100
Right?

59
05:18.500 --> 05:28.590
So if we can do is we can deactivate our plugin. So let's go to Plugins and deactivate the post type plugin.

60
05:29.690 --> 05:35.120
And let's go to the permalink settings and let's save  and now WordPress will update rewrite rules and now we don't have

61
05:35.120 --> 05:37.400
the portfolio post type.

62
05:37.400 --> 05:40.830
So the rewrite rules will not have the portfolio post types anymore.

63
05:40.960 --> 05:41.440
Right?

64
05:43.210 --> 05:51.680
Let's save a couple of times. And let's refresh this page and "Nothing found", right? Now let's activate the

65
05:51.680 --> 05:52.390
plugin.

66
05:52.580 --> 05:57.860
And now when we activate the plugin this function should run and flush_rewrite_rules() should run and we

67
05:57.860 --> 06:00.480
should have our link working, right?

68
06:00.530 --> 06:06.020
But the thing is we register or post type in the "init" action, right?

69
06:06.410 --> 06:11.660
And when we activate our plugin here the "init" action has already fired.

70
06:11.660 --> 06:17.030
So when we click activate now the "init" action won't rerun again. "init" action will run only

71
06:17.030 --> 06:19.220
if we refresh the page.

72
06:19.220 --> 06:24.050
So basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna activate the plugin. But we actually don't have

73
06:24.050 --> 06:28.610
any post types registered because we actually registered them on the "init" action.

74
06:28.730 --> 06:31.560
And here the "init" action has already fired.

75
06:32.150 --> 06:35.150
So click on Activate and this function will run.

76
06:35.150 --> 06:41.680
flush_rewrite_rules() will run but the URLs won't get updated because we don't have post types yet.

77
06:41.780 --> 06:51.140
So to tackle this we can also run the function that registers the post type in the activation function, ok?

78
06:51.590 --> 06:58.810
So now when you call flush_rewrite_rules() the post type will already be registered.

79
06:59.120 --> 07:05.660
So let's save this and let's refresh. And let's activate the plugin.

80
07:06.240 --> 07:08.890
And now let's refresh this.

81
07:09.140 --> 07:12.890
And it's working without saving the permalinks or doing anything.

82
07:12.890 --> 07:18.710
So this step is important. And I hope you understood why we have to do this and if not let me know if

83
07:18.710 --> 07:20.310
you have any questions.

84
07:21.450 --> 07:27.450
So the final thing we need to do, we need to do the same thing when we deactivate the plugin. We need to

85
07:27.630 --> 07:34.610
unregister the post type and then flush_rewrite_rules() to remove the portfolio rules in the rewrite

86
07:34.610 --> 07:35.040
rules.

87
07:35.070 --> 07:36.060
Right?

88
07:36.060 --> 07:38.250
So let's copy this actually.

89
07:38.580 --> 07:44.220
And we have another one called "deactivation". And let's create a function called "deactivate".

90
07:46.860 --> 07:56.530
Inside of it we can call a function called unregister_post_type() and it's called "_themename_portfolio".

91
07:59.300 --> 08:01.550
And then call flush_rewrite_rules().

92
08:01.570 --> 08:09.260
So this way when we remove the plugin, deactivate it, the rewrite will no longer be saved in WordPress.

93
08:09.340 --> 08:11.980
We still have one final thing for this lecture.

94
08:12.430 --> 08:18.910
If you go to Portfolio now and one of the taxonomies we'll have the same problem. If we try to

95
08:18.910 --> 08:23.450
view one of these taxonomies  the URL will not be found.

96
08:23.490 --> 08:24.630
Right?

97
08:25.450 --> 08:36.870
So what we need to do is we need to simply also call the functions to register the taxonomies on plugin

98
08:36.870 --> 08:39.680
activation. So let's copy the function names.

99
08:43.380 --> 08:48.080
And on the activation we probably have also a function called unregister_taxonomy(),

100
08:48.510 --> 08:52.700
yes, and our taxonomy names,

101
08:52.930 --> 08:53.540
these ones.

102
08:57.580 --> 09:00.340
And the skills.

103
09:04.580 --> 09:06.420
So let's save now and let's

104
09:09.110 --> 09:16.020
deactivate and then activate the plugin again to run these functions again. And let's go now

105
09:16.020 --> 09:23.900
to the project type. And refresh and we have it here.

106
09:23.940 --> 09:26.640
Let's also do one final thing before ending this lecture.

107
09:26.850 --> 09:33.920
As you can see in the URL we have "_themename" and "project_type" and probably your theme users will not like your theme name

108
09:33.930 --> 09:34.760
appear in the URL,

109
09:34.800 --> 09:35.820
right?

110
09:35.880 --> 09:40.980
And this also happens in the post type and in the taxonomy.

111
09:40.980 --> 09:47.020
So what we can do is when we register the post types and taxonomies we can add a new argument here

112
09:48.080 --> 09:48.580
called 

113
09:48.590 --> 09:50.120
"rewrite".

114
09:50.480 --> 09:55.370
And it takes an array and you can add a custom "slug" here.

115
09:58.250 --> 10:07.790
So let's call it "portfolio" and let's do the same for, let's copy this and do the same for the taxonomies. Let's call this

116
10:07.820 --> 10:11.070
one "project_type".

117
10:14.100 --> 10:16.430
And let's call this one.

118
10:16.680 --> 10:24.270
Or actually we're gonna paste it this one it already had the rewrite rule. So great, let's save now.

119
10:25.060 --> 10:32.900
And what we have to do now is we need to refresh our rewrite rules in order for these changes to reflect.

120
10:33.070 --> 10:41.300
So we can either deactivate and activate the theme or we can just refresh the permalinks page and save.

121
10:41.690 --> 10:53.950
And now if we go back to one of these, it's now "portfolio". And also here it's "not found", let's remove

122
10:54.190 --> 10:58.550
the themename and we have it.

123
10:58.620 --> 11:05.320
So what we're gonna do later in this section we're gonna make this an option in the Customizer.

124
11:05.520 --> 11:10.210
We're gonna let the user choose his own slug that will appear in the URL.

125
11:10.470 --> 11:12.340
So I think that's it for this lecture.

126
11:12.540 --> 11:15.260
Let's in the next lecture create archives

127
11:15.420 --> 11:19.960
and the single page for the portfolio items. So see you in the next lecture.
