00:03.170 --> 00:11.380
So in the last lecture we created this post gallery with the Gutenberg editor. But then we did not have any sliders

1
00:11.390 --> 00:18.770
here like we expected. And that's because gallery is created in Gutenberg are created differently than

2
00:18.780 --> 00:22.270
the old editor. And get_post_gallery() function 

3
00:22.280 --> 00:24.170
will only work for the classic editor.

4
00:24.380 --> 00:29.630
So in this lecture we will create another content-gallery file and this one will be if you want to

5
00:29.630 --> 00:31.960
support the Gutenberg editor.

6
00:32.450 --> 00:42.380
So let's copy this and let's rename this one to maybe classic.

7
00:42.430 --> 00:46.220
So this one will not be used now just have it here for reference.

8
00:47.460 --> 00:54.880
And let's create a new file here and call it content-gallery. And let's paste.

9
00:54.880 --> 00:58.170
Another problem is get_post_gallery is not working, right?

10
00:58.370 --> 01:04.390
So open some PHP tags here and let's try a function.

11
01:04.510 --> 01:17.310
Let's var_dump() and let's try a function called gutenberg_parse_blocks(). And it takes the content, so get_the_content().

12
01:20.810 --> 01:23.070
And let's see what this will return.

13
01:23.510 --> 01:28.890
And judging by the name it should return all the blocks in our post.

14
01:29.070 --> 01:29.840
So let's see.

15
01:33.540 --> 01:41.670
Looks like we actually forgot to add the post type "Gallery" here but it wouldn't make any difference.

16
01:41.670 --> 01:45.510
Still the get_post_gallery() function will not work.

17
01:45.780 --> 01:48.600
So just to make sure let's remove this

18
01:53.720 --> 01:56.630
and refresh. And as you can see this now has a  gallery post format.

19
01:56.640 --> 01:58.710
And we still don't have a slider right.

20
01:58.710 --> 02:04.860
So let's return this var_dump().

21
02:04.960 --> 02:11.300
So now we have an array because we have one block and the block name is core/gallery.

22
02:11.560 --> 02:19.920
And then we have attributes NULL and we have inner HTML. And the inner HTML contains our gallery.

23
02:20.050 --> 02:20.610
Right?

24
02:20.800 --> 02:22.600
So let's just to add some more blocks.

25
02:26.120 --> 02:28.870
Maybe add some text here.

26
02:33.380 --> 02:38.300
And refresh. And now I've array of three.

27
02:38.590 --> 02:43.830
I don't know why three but we have our gallery and we have 

28
02:44.060 --> 02:45.820
I don't know, some empty block here.

29
02:46.140 --> 02:46.980
But anyways.

30
02:47.000 --> 02:50.190
And then we have our paragraph which is called "core/paragraph".

31
02:50.190 --> 02:57.390
So anyways we need to loop through this array and once we find a gallery we'll save it into a variable.

32
02:57.810 --> 03:03.260
And then carry on and do the same thing we did for the get_post_gallery().

33
03:03.270 --> 03:09.410
The only difference here is we don't have any information about the images, the IDs and stuff like that.

34
03:09.600 --> 03:13.120
We just have the HTML for the gallery. So to support Gutenberg

35
03:13.260 --> 03:19.680
we'll just put this HTML in the instead of the slider. Because now we are not able to create

36
03:19.680 --> 03:23.210
a slider. So let's copy the name of this block.

37
03:24.000 --> 03:27.480
And let's here call this $blocks.

38
03:31.260 --> 03:42.720
And let's loop through it. So "foreach ($blocks as $block)". And let's create another variable called $gallery and let's set

39
03:42.730 --> 03:46.120
it to maybe "false" or "null".

40
03:47.230 --> 04:03.690
And now whenever we find, so the keys called "blockName", so if $block of "blockName" is equals to "core/gallery",

41
04:03.760 --> 04:10.630
we will set this $gallery variable to this $block.

42
04:10.680 --> 04:13.700
Right?

43
04:13.710 --> 04:20.010
And maybe after that we can also break out of the loop because we only need the first gallery. So we

44
04:20.010 --> 04:21.540
don't have to continue in the loop.

45
04:21.570 --> 04:23.990
We already found one.

46
04:24.470 --> 04:31.020
Let's now var_dump() the gallery and see if we have any mistakes in this loop.

47
04:31.530 --> 04:35.370
So it's "core/gallery", I think I made a mistake.

48
04:35.500 --> 04:45.860
We need the whole block and not just the "blockName". So now we've the gallery block in this $gallery 

49
04:46.070 --> 04:47.620
variable.

50
04:47.630 --> 04:52.410
And now we can use this $gallery variable instead of the get_post_gallery().

51
04:52.460 --> 04:53.090
Right?

52
04:53.120 --> 04:58.170
So let's change these to $gallery.

53
04:58.680 --> 05:07.350
And then instead of this loop we will just echo the $gallery and then the "innerHTML" for the gallery.

54
05:08.550 --> 05:10.770
Right?

55
05:10.800 --> 05:13.030
So I'm using the MAMP port

56
05:13.110 --> 05:15.610
that's why it's not automatically refreshing.

57
05:15.910 --> 05:24.340
Let's use. And as you can see we still have a little problem with our initializing the Slick Slider on this post gallery.

58
05:24.480 --> 05:26.710
But we don't need to do that anymore.

59
05:27.300 --> 05:29.880
So let's call this "gallery" maybe "-gutenberg".

60
05:33.240 --> 05:38.450
And now we have a gallery as a featured content for this post.

61
05:38.700 --> 05:44.880
So maybe that's not what you need maybe you need a slider like we did for the old editor. But right now

62
05:44.880 --> 05:48.040
for Gutenberg that's the only available options.

63
05:48.060 --> 05:54.960
I think by the time maybe they will add more options to allow more control for these galleries.

64
05:55.120 --> 05:57.520
But for now I think that's fine.

65
05:58.120 --> 06:04.350
And I think that's all what you need to do for post formats.

66
06:04.370 --> 06:08.010
So let me know if you have any questions in the Q&A for any for any lecture.

67
06:08.650 --> 06:12.500
And let's now move on to another topic in the next section.

68
06:12.520 --> 06:13.310
A quick note here.

69
06:13.330 --> 06:17.160
I just noticed something after ending this lecture.

70
06:17.370 --> 06:21.850
If you go to the gallery settings you can have a switch here.

71
06:21.900 --> 06:28.910
"Crop Images" and you can choose not to crop images. So the images will have their natural aspect ratio.

72
06:28.910 --> 06:35.030
And let's update that and then let's go here. And let's inspect the image.

73
06:35.200 --> 06:38.450
And as you can see WordPress will load the full image size.

74
06:38.520 --> 06:43.540
So this not resized and each gallery item is inside an LI,

75
06:43.830 --> 06:47.450
inside a UL called "wp-block-gallery",

76
06:47.520 --> 06:48.120
right?

77
06:48.310 --> 06:52.240
So why don't we try and copy this ID, the "gallery-gutenberg".

78
06:55.510 --> 07:06.270
And let's add another selector here. It will be the "gallery-gutenberg" and then we need to initialize Slick on this.

79
07:06.730 --> 07:07.600
UL, right?

80
07:12.600 --> 07:13.710
So let's try this.

81
07:18.740 --> 07:21.110
And we actually have a slider also.

82
07:21.350 --> 07:23.290
So great.

83
07:23.390 --> 07:26.700
We created the same gallery with Gutenberg.

84
07:27.020 --> 07:32.510
So I just thought I should tell you that and if any update happens to Gutenberg I will also keep you

85
07:32.600 --> 07:33.280
updated.

86
07:33.440 --> 07:34.650
So see you in the next section.
