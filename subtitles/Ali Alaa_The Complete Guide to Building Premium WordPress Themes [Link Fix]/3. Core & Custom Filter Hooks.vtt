00:02.770 --> 00:10.170
So we've seen what actions are, let's now discuss filters. Filters give you the ability to change data during the

1
00:10.170 --> 00:11.810
code execution.

2
00:11.860 --> 00:17.940
The difference between actions and filters is that in actions as we saw, we can run whatever PHP functions

3
00:17.940 --> 00:22.230
we like. We can change global variables. We can echo something

4
00:22.260 --> 00:28.470
and all the script we would like to run. In filters however, you get an input, you modify it, you return

5
00:28.470 --> 00:34.640
it. And that's it. You're not allowed to change any global variables or to echo anything.

6
00:34.800 --> 00:40.560
Or in other words the functions should not have any side effects, should be a pure functions. Just get an

7
00:40.560 --> 00:43.470
input and return an output.

8
00:43.470 --> 00:46.740
So let's start coding now and you will see what I mean.

9
00:46.740 --> 00:55.260
So WordPress actually recommends using filters in any place in your theme where you use some text like

10
00:55.260 --> 00:57.000
here for example.

11
00:57.030 --> 01:03.330
So what we would like to do and what filters allow us to do is to allow other developers to modify this

12
01:03.450 --> 01:07.920
string, if they needed without actually getting into your code.

13
01:07.930 --> 01:15.210
So to do that like the do_action() function, this one is called apply_filters().

14
01:19.140 --> 01:23.320
And it gets also the filter name which should be prefixed.

15
01:23.510 --> 01:24.880
So "_themename".

16
01:27.790 --> 01:34.060
Let's call it "no_posts_text".

17
01:34.420 --> 01:41.990
And the second argument is the thing that we would like to filter. So right now this function will just

18
01:42.710 --> 01:45.970
output this function. It will output "Sorry no posts

19
01:45.980 --> 01:47.000
match your criteria."

20
01:47.000 --> 01:52.130
So let's actually, you know, type any text here in order to get this text.

21
01:55.090 --> 02:05.870
And let's now add a filter. So in functions I'll create a new function "no_posts_text". Of course in real life you should

22
02:06.040 --> 02:06.980
prefix your functions.

23
02:11.750 --> 02:13.040
And than it will receive the

24
02:15.730 --> 02:19.850
the actual text, which is this one by default.

25
02:21.000 --> 02:24.900
And what you can do is you can modify this text and then return a new one.

26
02:25.110 --> 02:33.400
So what we can do is "return $text" and let's append  to it some.

27
02:33.570 --> 02:45.640
And now let's add_filter(), same like add_action(), takes the filter name which we called "_themename_no_posts_text" 

28
02:47.590 --> 02:56.570
and the function name, the function which we will use to filter. And let's also text the priority and the accepted

29
02:56.590 --> 03:02.590
arguments like the actions. So let's see what would happen now.

30
03:02.600 --> 03:07.330
So looks like we've done something wrong.

31
03:13.630 --> 03:22.070
All right, ok. Now we don't need to escape HTML and echo. We apply filters as a function so it accepts

32
03:22.070 --> 03:29.780
an argument not an echoed string, right? So just echo here and pass the text.

33
03:35.760 --> 03:37.880
I missed an "_".

34
03:38.000 --> 03:47.010
So now it should work. The original one and then the appended text. But in this sort of situation we probably have to

35
03:47.010 --> 03:49.330
return a new text completely.

36
03:49.470 --> 03:56.310
We don't need to modify it. So you can simply just do something like this.

37
03:57.080 --> 04:01.680
"No posts". And it will work fine.

38
04:01.690 --> 04:08.760
However you should let other developers that will use these filters know that you need the filter

39
04:08.780 --> 04:12.670
result to be also escaped and translated.

40
04:12.940 --> 04:19.790
So it's the responsibility for the other developer to actually add this call and then add the text domain

41
04:19.840 --> 04:26.200
for his theme, which will be a child theme. We'll get into this in a moment. So this will probably be called

42
04:27.130 --> 04:36.480
"something" and then "-child". This should be a text domain other than your theme text domain. So

43
04:36.700 --> 04:37.640
this will also work.

44
04:37.650 --> 04:45.170
However it will be escaped and translated properly. So whenever you use filters and you intend your theme

45
04:45.290 --> 04:50.120
to be used by other developers just let them know in the documentation,

46
04:50.390 --> 04:55.410
you know, the proper way to use your filters. All right.

47
04:55.510 --> 04:57.370
The similar to actions

48
04:57.600 --> 04:58.810
filters also

49
04:59.020 --> 05:04.650
WordPress also includes some filters that will filter things in the WordPress core.

50
05:05.220 --> 05:08.560
So let's for example filter the post title.

51
05:09.590 --> 05:11.270
So let's create a function called

52
05:15.090 --> 05:15.810
"filter_title()"

53
05:20.470 --> 05:22.330
and this one will receive the "$title"

54
05:25.750 --> 05:28.990
and return filtered one. So let's do "Filtered "

55
05:31.620 --> 05:32.670
and then the $title.

56
05:35.820 --> 05:36.610
And add_filter().

57
05:40.660 --> 05:47.270
And this filter is called "the_title" and the function is "filter_title".

58
05:48.850 --> 05:50.710
So let's see.

59
05:51.500 --> 05:53.090
Let's go back to the index and.

60
05:53.180 --> 06:00.770
And as you can see we have "Filtered " and then the post title. I just want to do something real quick here.

61
06:00.940 --> 06:03.060
Let's remove this background.

62
06:03.410 --> 06:05.400
You know, in order to see better.

63
06:05.820 --> 06:07.380
Yeah, that's much good.

64
06:07.420 --> 06:10.330
So I think that it for filters for now.

65
06:10.690 --> 06:15.480
So just one more thing that's "filter reference".

66
06:21.130 --> 06:25.500
And like the actions we have a list of all filters that you can use with WordPress.

67
06:25.540 --> 06:29.270
Pretty much anything you want to filter you will find the filter for it here.

68
06:29.270 --> 06:32.290
Just Google it and you will probably find something.
