Let's add in this lecture couple of buttons here that will navigate through the posts.

1
00:08.010 --> 00:12.150
So one button will be the next post and the other will be the previous post.

2
00:12.180 --> 00:24.260
So let's go to single.php. And let's add another template part after the author info. And this one will

3
00:24.270 --> 00:26.240
also be in the single folder.

4
00:26.400 --> 00:30.130
And we call it navigation.

5
00:30.510 --> 00:35.110
So let's create this file in template-parts/

6
00:35.110 --> 00:36.100
single/

7
00:37.010 --> 00:41.150
and navigation.php. So first let's open

8
00:41.170 --> 00:42.250
PHP tag.

9
00:42.690 --> 00:45.520
And let's get the next and previous posts.

10
00:46.170 --> 00:53.590
So to get the previous post we call a function called get_previous_post().

11
00:57.730 --> 01:04.660
And we will ignore any arguments. And this will return the post object of the previous post or it will

12
01:04.810 --> 01:05.470
return "false"

13
01:05.500 --> 01:14.130
if we are in the first post. And same for next, it's called get_next_post() and will return the

14
01:14.130 --> 01:14.750
post object.

15
01:14.780 --> 01:22.770
Or if you are in the last post it will just return "false".

16
01:23.020 --> 01:24.400
So let's display these

17
01:24.470 --> 01:27.680
post now. We can use the NAV HTML tag

18
01:27.780 --> 01:33.300
for that. And give it a class "c-post-

19
01:33.380 --> 01:40.130
"c-post-navigation" and a "role" of "navigation".

20
01:40.180 --> 01:47.650
But notice we only need to display this navigation only if we have either a previous or a next post.

21
01:47.650 --> 01:54.580
If you don't have any of these we don't need to display this navigation section here. So let's add another if condition.

22
01:57.040 --> 02:02.520
"if ($previous || $next)"

23
02:06.620 --> 02:10.380
we will display this section.

24
02:10.870 --> 02:17.980
Also remember in the author we had this H2 tag for screen readers. Let's do the same thing here. Let's copy it.

25
02:19.870 --> 02:24.900
And this will be maybe "Post Navigation".

26
02:27.680 --> 02:33.000
And now let's finally display the links. So I have a class called

27
02:34.230 --> 02:38.440
"c-post-navigation

28
02:38.510 --> 02:46.080
"c-post-navigation__links". And inside of this DIV we'll output the previous and next posts.

29
02:46.180 --> 02:49.560
So let's start by the previous. So we need to check first

30
02:49.580 --> 02:53.190
if we have a previous post. And if so let's output a DIV

31
02:56.270 --> 02:57.370
with a class

32
02:57.400 --> 02:59.070
"c-post-

33
02:59.120 --> 03:02.620
"c-post-navigation__post" and

34
03:02.740 --> 03:08.630
"c-post-navigation__post" with a modifier of previous or "--prev".

35
03:12.380 --> 03:20.820
And then we'll have an A tag with a class of "c-post-navigation__link" and

36
03:20.820 --> 03:21.800
with an href.

37
03:22.010 --> 03:26.090
And this will point to the URL for the previous post.

38
03:26.100 --> 03:27.200
So how to get that?

39
03:27.250 --> 03:37.250
Open a PHP and call the_permalink() for the previous link so I need the ID of the previous.

40
03:37.310 --> 03:47.660
So let's call ID of previous. Inside this A tag we'll put the title and the thumbnail of the previous

41
03:47.660 --> 03:49.090
post.

42
03:49.350 --> 03:53.510
Now we have + here. So let's add first the thumbnail.

43
03:53.630 --> 04:01.400
So let's open PHP and let's write an if condition check that this post has a thumbnail. So we can call

44
04:01.400 --> 04:14.210
has_post_thumbnail() and give it the ID and close the if condition. And if it has a post thumbnail let's display

45
04:14.230 --> 04:21.980
it. So DIV with a class "c-post-navigation__thumbnail".

46
04:24.920 --> 04:25.650
And then PHP tags.

47
04:29.810 --> 04:42.500
And then let's "echo get_the_post_thumbnail()". So we need the ID which is one.

48
04:42.560 --> 04:50.240
And we need a "size". So we need the thumbnail size which is a square of 150 X150 pixels. And we don't need

49
04:50.240 --> 04:52.890
any attributes.

50
04:53.150 --> 04:54.880
So now we have the thumbnail.

51
04:55.250 --> 04:59.120
Let's now display the title and the other stuff.

52
04:59.120 --> 05:04.270
So I'm just gonna copy this class name and let's create a new DIV with

53
05:04.740 --> 05:11.310
class "c-post-navigation__content".

54
05:11.390 --> 05:14.120
And here we have a SPAN with a class

55
05:17.000 --> 05:17.950
"c-post

56
05:18.030 --> 05:20.330
"c-post-navigation__title".

57
05:26.210 --> 05:28.640
And inside of it we'll echo the title.

58
05:28.700 --> 05:40.970
So PHP tags and "echo esc_html( get_the_title() )". But this tme we need to get the 

59
05:40.970 --> 05:43.250
title of the previous post.

60
05:43.400 --> 05:47.220
So.

61
05:47.620 --> 05:53.460
So before the title we just need to display some text that indicates that this is the previous

62
05:53.460 --> 05:54.160
post, right?

63
05:54.230 --> 05:55.110
Let's add another SPAN.

64
05:58.620 --> 06:02.670
And instead of "title" this will be "subtitle". 

65
06:03.420 --> 06:09.720
And let's open PHP and echo some escaped and translated string.

66
06:09.840 --> 06:10.890
So esc_html_e().

67
06:13.480 --> 06:16.020
And I'll just say "Previous

68
06:19.500 --> 06:20.070
Post"

69
06:23.450 --> 06:28.010
and "_themename". So that was a lot of typing.

70
06:28.110 --> 06:34.760
Let's see now. As you can see we have "Previous Post" and the title. And this post probably doesn't have

71
06:34.760 --> 06:35.450
thumbnail.

72
06:35.540 --> 06:36.780
So let's go to our post.

73
06:40.540 --> 06:46.570
Let's go to this post and the previous post we have a thumbnail now.

74
06:47.560 --> 06:56.450
So I think that's it. We will just have to copy this if condition and just change any "previous"  with "next". So let's do

75
06:56.470 --> 06:56.910
this

76
06:57.000 --> 06:58.880
real quick here.

77
06:59.920 --> 07:02.290
Let's Cmd+D and select all the "prev".

78
07:04.900 --> 07:13.170
And instead let's type next. And here we have to "Next Post".

79
07:13.480 --> 07:14.870
Now I think this will do it.

80
07:14.890 --> 07:20.340
So let's see. And great, we now have the "Next Post" and the "Previous Post".

81
07:24.980 --> 07:29.180
So I know that was a bit boring but I just wanted to show you how to do it.

82
07:30.200 --> 07:33.760
So in the next lecture let's go through.

83
07:34.100 --> 07:36.650
Remember the dummy posts that we imported.

84
07:36.900 --> 07:41.420
Let's now go through each one of them and see if they are displayed completely.

85
07:41.570 --> 07:45.840
And if they're not displayed correctly let's see what we can do in order to fix it.

86
07:45.950 --> 07:46.940
So see you in the next lecture.
