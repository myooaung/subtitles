00:02.950 --> 00:10.860
So in the last lecture we've added these custom fields but then we mentioned that it's a much better practice to add these fields

1
00:11.010 --> 00:17.570
using a plugin rather than adding them directly in the theme. So that your theme users will be able to still

2
00:17.580 --> 00:23.040
access these fields even if they decided to change your theme.

3
00:23.190 --> 00:24.540
So let's do that.

4
00:24.550 --> 00:26.350
Let's create a plugin now.

5
00:27.270 --> 00:37.260
So to do that we will go to our folder wp-content folder. And then instead of the themes we now will

6
00:37.260 --> 00:41.630
go to plugins. And here we'll find all the plugins that we've installed so far.

7
00:41.820 --> 00:50.010
So let's create our own now. And to do that we'll create a new folder. And let's also call it "_themename"

8
00:50.010 --> 00:54.200
"_themename-metaboxes".

9
00:58.780 --> 01:04.740
So when you create a plugin that belongs to your theme, it's a good practice that you prefix it with your theme name

10
01:04.750 --> 01:06.100
and then "-metaboxes.

11
01:06.220 --> 01:09.660
So I also used here the "_themename" placeholder.

12
01:10.000 --> 01:14.670
And the reason is we would like to use this folder only for development.

13
01:14.800 --> 01:20.290
And then as we did for our theme, we will add some gulp tasks to bundle the theme and zip it. And

14
01:20.290 --> 01:22.690
then rename it to our actual theme name

15
01:22.690 --> 01:27.610
-metaboxes. So instead of rewriting the whole legal stuff from scratch,

16
01:27.730 --> 01:34.150
we'll try to borrow the gulpfile from our theme. And then just modify it a little bit in order to match

17
01:34.150 --> 01:35.710
our needs for the plugin.

18
01:35.710 --> 01:44.970
Let's go to the code editor. Aand then let's add this folder,  the plugins folder in our workspace.

19
01:52.960 --> 02:01.940
So plugins and our folder. And add it.So you now have two folders here.

20
02:02.400 --> 02:08.880
So what we need to do is we need to copy this package.json. And this package.json contains all the plugins

21
02:09.060 --> 02:18.120
that we need to run our gulp tasks. So let's copy this and create a new file in our plugin. Let's call it

22
02:18.230 --> 02:19.680
also package.json.

23
02:25.290 --> 02:28.840
And let's see what we need and what we don't need in these plugins.

24
02:28.890 --> 02:32.700
So we don't need the "dependencies", the front and dependencies.

25
02:35.760 --> 02:44.380
So we'll need our CSS plugins. You also need run tasks or CSS and JavaScript maybe your plugin

26
02:44.430 --> 02:53.310
will have CSS and JavaScript. So I'm gonna leave these also the image minification plugin and gulp-replace

27
02:53.360 --> 02:54.760
will definitely need that.

28
02:54.930 --> 02:57.840
And sass, sourcemaps. So you probably need most of these.

29
02:57.930 --> 03:03.860
Maybe except browserSync, you wouldn't need it.

30
03:04.050 --> 03:05.790
I think that's it.

31
03:05.910 --> 03:16.950
So here in the name let's type a plugin name, "metaboxes". And then let's add another field and call it "theme".

32
03:18.130 --> 03:20.620
And this will be the theme that this plugin belongs to.

33
03:20.790 --> 03:30.970
So in our case it's, I think called it "firsttteme", yes.

34
03:31.590 --> 03:38.130
So let's save. And we now need to run "npm install". So install these plugins.

35
03:39.100 --> 03:45.440
So let's, I'm gonna open a new tab in my terminal and on  windows you can open a new cmd window.

36
03:45.800 --> 03:54.940
I'm gonna change to my plugins folder and then run "npm install"

37
04:01.610 --> 04:05.650
So this might take some time I paused the video and it's done for me.

38
04:06.070 --> 04:12.800
So now in your folder you should have the node_modules folder with all your plugins and package

39
04:12.900 --> 04:14.720
package-lock.json.

40
04:15.100 --> 04:16.780
So what we need to do now.

41
04:16.960 --> 04:19.680
We also need the .babelrc file.

42
04:22.510 --> 04:26.200
Because we'll use Babel in this plugin in the gulp tasks.

43
04:26.200 --> 04:31.580
So let's create a new file and call it .babelrc.

44
04:31.780 --> 04:34.690
And then paste

45
04:37.560 --> 04:37.980
paste this

46
04:40.960 --> 04:42.120
and save.

47
04:42.230 --> 04:47.700
And we also, if you are using GIT, which is a good idea,

48
04:47.750 --> 04:53.870
you should also add a .gitignore file and ignore the node_modules folder. And the last thing we need is of

49
04:53.870 --> 05:03.530
course the gulpfile.babel.js. So let's copy that from the theme and let's create a new one in the plugin.

50
05:08.520 --> 05:13.900
And let's paste and now let's go through it and see what we need to modify.

51
05:14.550 --> 05:26.550
So we don't need browserSync. So let's remove this. And in the "paths" we'll only need admin.scss because

52
05:26.700 --> 05:31.800
this plugin will only deal with the backend, the metaboxes. So we don't need to enqueue styles in the 

53
05:31.800 --> 05:32.520
frontend.

54
05:32.820 --> 05:44.750
Same also of for the "scrips". Let's remove the "customize-preview" and  the "bundle". And in the "package" let's see if we need

55
05:44.750 --> 05:49.140
to modify anything. And no, I think this will be fine.

56
05:49.620 --> 06:01.090
Let's now remove the browserSync stuff. So the "serve" and "reload" tasks. And the "server.stream()" in the

57
06:01.110 --> 06:07.500
sass. And in "watch" tasks we will have to remove the "reload"s.

58
06:07.850 --> 06:08.170
So

59
06:26.810 --> 06:29.650
and in the "scripts", it's fine.

60
06:29.700 --> 06:38.410
And we'll have to do some modifications in the "compress". BÄ±t let's first remove the "serve" from here.

61
06:38.450 --> 06:40.760
And I think that's it.

62
06:41.120 --> 06:46.710
So we're basically now doing the same thing as in the theme but we just remove the browserSync because

63
06:46.710 --> 06:49.610
it will not be very useful in this case.

64
06:49.640 --> 06:56.850
So in the "compress" task instead of "_themename" we now want to replace a placeholder called "_pluginname"

65
06:56.850 --> 07:06.240
with the "info.name" which will be this. And then also replace the "_themename"

66
07:09.550 --> 07:17.940
with "info.theme". So we'll have also to reference the theme name when prefix our functions in plugin.

67
07:18.070 --> 07:24.700
So we will replace both of them. And then we need finally to call the plugin "${info.theme}

68
07:28.370 --> 07:31.170
"${info.theme}-${info.name}.zip".

69
07:31.280 --> 07:34.930
So it will be called firsttheme-metaboxes.zip.

70
07:34.930 --> 07:35.580
firsttheme-metaboxes.zip.

71
07:35.630 --> 07:37.000
That's what we need.

72
07:37.010 --> 07:43.550
So to create a plugin it's required to add a file in your plugins folder called index.php.

73
07:43.670 --> 07:47.180
And in this file we will type some information about this plugin.

74
07:47.180 --> 07:55.190
It's like we did in the theme's style.css. So in a comment block we will type some information

75
07:55.190 --> 08:01.280
about the theme. So instead of typing this whole thing to save some time I'm gonna paste it.

76
08:01.610 --> 08:02.890
And let's go through it quickly.

77
08:03.050 --> 08:07.850
So we have the "Plugin Name" and I'm gonna call it "_themename " and then the "_pluginname".

78
08:07.850 --> 08:12.460
So this will be the "firsttheme metaboxes". And then a "Description".

79
08:12.590 --> 08:20.820
So "Adding Metaboxes for" and then the "_themename". And then "Version" and "Author" and yo know "License" and stuff like that.

80
08:20.860 --> 08:25.850
And then the "Text Domain". And this should be different than your theme's text domain.

81
08:25.900 --> 08:30.180
So it's usually called the "_themename" and then "-_pluginnamename".

82
08:30.190 --> 08:33.440
So when we build our plugin this will be firsttheme-metaboxes.

83
08:33.470 --> 08:41.860
firsttheme-metaboxes. So let's save that. And also in index.php you should add an if condition

84
08:41.860 --> 08:42.310
here.

85
08:42.490 --> 08:50.120
As the first thing in your code. And then the condition will be "!defined".

86
08:50.660 --> 08:53.330
And then here "WPINC"

87
08:56.040 --> 08:57.550
"die".

88
08:58.270 --> 09:04.660
And these couple of lines here will prevent direct access to your index.php file. And I'll put you

89
09:04.770 --> 09:07.090
a link if you want to read more about that.

90
09:07.110 --> 09:16.910
Now let's try and activate our theme. So as to go to the Plugins and now we have our theme. So let's

91
09:16.940 --> 09:21.460
activate it. And our theme does nothing right now.

92
09:21.710 --> 09:22.440
So let's continue in the next 

93
09:22.440 --> 09:28.190
lecture and move our code that adds the metaboxes from our theme to our plugin.
