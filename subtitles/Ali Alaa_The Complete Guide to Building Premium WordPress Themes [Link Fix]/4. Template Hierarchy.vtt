00:03.350 --> 00:09.170
So at this point now we should know what template files are and  also template tags.

1
00:09.340 --> 00:14.080
And we mentioned that we will discuss page templates later in the course.

2
00:14.170 --> 00:16.950
So let's now discuss template hierarchy.

3
00:16.990 --> 00:23.830
So we've seen some kind of template files like the header and the footer that will be used throughout the whole website.

4
00:24.220 --> 00:30.340
And we mentioned that this kind of template files are called template partials. Sometimes template files are

5
00:30.340 --> 00:38.120
only loaded under certain conditions. So depending on the URL or the request that you are requesting

6
00:38.430 --> 00:44.880
WordPress will determine what template to use. And that will be according to a specific hierarchy that

7
00:44.880 --> 00:48.050
WordPress uses in order to decide what template to load.

8
00:49.220 --> 00:50.880
So to make this clearer.

9
00:50.900 --> 00:53.240
Let's take a look at an example.

10
00:53.290 --> 00:59.750
So let's say we are requesting this page. Now WordPress will know that this is a category page. So it will

11
00:59.750 --> 01:05.360
look in your theme and try to find a template that is responsible for displaying a category archive.

12
01:05.600 --> 01:12.260
So first it will look for a file called category-unicorns.php and this will be a very specific template.

13
01:12.800 --> 01:16.780
It will does display the posts that have the category unicorn.

14
01:17.090 --> 01:22.270
And if this template is not found it will search for category-id.

15
01:22.340 --> 01:26.760
So assuming the unicorns category has an id of 4, it will look for category-4.

16
01:26.780 --> 01:34.710
And then if that's not found, it will search for a template called category.php. And this

17
01:34.710 --> 01:39.090
template will be responsible for displaying any category, not just a specific one.

18
01:39.560 --> 01:45.870
And if that's not found it will search for an even more generic file archive.php. 

19
01:45.870 --> 01:46.290
archive.php

20
01:46.450 --> 01:49.180
is responsible for displaying any archive,

21
01:49.280 --> 01:50.620
not only the category.

22
01:50.720 --> 01:53.830
Also the tags and the time archives and so on.

23
01:53.930 --> 01:57.730
So it's more generic then category.php.

24
01:57.840 --> 02:01.710
And if that's not found it will fall back to index.php.

25
02:02.020 --> 02:07.990
So remember when we mentioned that index.php  is the only required template for your theme.

26
02:08.250 --> 02:14.790
That's the reason why. Any request that WordPress will not find a template for it will always fall back

27
02:14.790 --> 02:16.760
to index.php.

28
02:17.190 --> 02:19.540
That's why it should always be there.

29
02:19.560 --> 02:25.450
So this diagram summarizes the template hierarchy and file names for WordPress.

30
02:25.500 --> 02:31.630
So whenever you want to know a file name for a certain page you want to display or you want to know 

31
02:31.730 --> 02:35.430
template has a higher priority in the hierarchy,

32
02:35.520 --> 02:40.850
you could always refer to this diagram. And I will put a link to it in the lecture links.

33
02:41.100 --> 02:47.300
But let's now try to use this diagram for the example we've seen in the last slide.

34
02:47.760 --> 02:50.570
So we wanted to display a category page.

35
02:50.580 --> 02:54.810
So it's an archive page and it's a category archive.

36
02:56.340 --> 03:04.290
So WordPress will search for category-slug as we saw and then category-id and then category.php

37
03:04.360 --> 03:08.250
and then archive and then index.

38
03:08.290 --> 03:13.250
And as you can see index is default back fall any unfound template.

39
03:13.270 --> 03:16.110
So I think that's it for template file for now.

40
03:16.150 --> 03:20.990
We will use them a lot throughout this course and things will be more clear.

41
03:21.010 --> 03:22.940
So let's move on now to the next lecture.
