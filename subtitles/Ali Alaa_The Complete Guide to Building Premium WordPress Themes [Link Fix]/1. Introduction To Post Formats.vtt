In this section we will talk about post formats and post formats is a feature that your theme may choose

1
00:09.420 --> 00:16.890
to support. And by supporting this feature you will allow users to change how posts look like.

2
00:16.890 --> 00:31.960
So let's go to our folder and to the lib and theme-support. And let's add theme support for post formats. So "add_theme_support()"

3
00:33.560 --> 00:40.490
and the feature's called "post-formats". And then we give it a second argument. And this second argument

4
00:40.490 --> 00:43.720
will be an array of formats we would like to support.

5
00:43.730 --> 00:49.550
So I'm gonna paste the formats that we are going to support. And then we will see how each one of these

6
00:49.670 --> 00:50.300
should look like.

7
00:50.300 --> 00:56.780
So we have the "aside", "image", "video", "quote" and "link", "gallery" and "audio". So let's save.

8
00:57.760 --> 01:00.140
And now when you edit a post in the dashboard

9
01:05.240 --> 01:10.490
you should have a post format field here. And the default is "Standard".

10
01:10.820 --> 01:14.740
And then we have the other formats that we chose to support.

11
01:14.870 --> 01:21.980
So we have the Theme Handbook here and we have a section for Post Formats. And in this guide it describes

12
01:22.310 --> 01:24.500
how these formats should look like.

13
01:24.710 --> 01:30.230
And it's actually you have some freedom on how the formats that can look like, but these are just some

14
01:30.230 --> 01:34.590
general guidelines on how post formats should look like.

15
01:34.610 --> 01:39.830
So during this section we will read every one of these and then we will decide how our post format should

16
01:39.830 --> 01:40.420
look like.

17
01:40.430 --> 01:45.240
But first remembering the dummy posts.

18
01:45.260 --> 01:55.340
Let's search for "format" or actually search for "post format". And we had some posts here that

19
01:55.340 --> 02:00.080
start with a "Post Format" and when we were going through the posts we mentioned that we will discuss

20
02:00.140 --> 02:05.720
these in a separate section. So let's do that. We have the Standard Post Format here which is the default one.

21
02:06.380 --> 02:08.700
And then we have other post formats.

22
02:08.750 --> 02:11.470
And currently they are all using the default template.

23
02:11.960 --> 02:23.900
So if we go to the, let's say, single.php. Oh sorry the index.php, all of the posts are using the loop template part.

24
02:23.930 --> 02:30.580
So let's go to the loop template part. And then we'll find that all of the posts are using the post and

25
02:30.580 --> 02:32.140
then content template part.

26
02:32.470 --> 02:33.970
So we want to change that.

27
02:34.000 --> 02:37.270
We want every post format to have its own template.

28
02:37.270 --> 02:42.470
So in the page template folder or sorry in the template-parts folder,

29
02:42.880 --> 02:47.820
and in the post, we would like to have different content for each post format.

30
02:47.830 --> 02:56.650
So let's create a new file for example and call it content-aside.php. And this is one of the post

31
02:56.660 --> 03:03.660
formats. And we would like for posts that have the aside post format use this template instead of the

32
03:03.720 --> 03:05.180
content.

33
03:05.250 --> 03:10.920
So to do that we can pass a second argument here and you already know that we can pass a second argument.

34
03:10.950 --> 03:18.090
So if we pass "aside" here the get_template_part() will go and find a file called content-aside.

35
03:18.390 --> 03:21.110
And if that's not found it will fall back to content.

36
03:21.150 --> 03:23.940
So now that we are passing "aside" here it will go to content-aside.

37
03:23.940 --> 03:29.880
But actually this way we will use the content-aside for all our posts but we need this to be dynamic.

38
03:30.380 --> 03:36.270
So we can use a function called get_post_format() and this will return the post format for the current

39
03:36.270 --> 03:37.160
post.

40
03:37.170 --> 03:39.630
So this will be "aside", "audio", "video" and so on.

41
03:40.020 --> 03:46.180
And this way we can create different files for each post format here that will be called content-

42
03:46.290 --> 03:48.340
and then the post format name, right?

43
03:49.490 --> 03:52.920
So let's type "aside" here. 

44
03:54.980 --> 04:04.220
And let's go to our index. And actually we have to do the, we have to add the get_post_format() in the other

45
04:04.220 --> 04:12.360
loops. So in loop-single and also we should add the get_post_format() in the author and the archive, but we

46
04:12.360 --> 04:18.650
are actually in the author, in the archive, we're using get_template_part() loop and author. But we don't have 

47
04:18.760 --> 04:19.490
loop-author here.

48
04:19.510 --> 04:26.580
So it's falling back to loop and we already added the get_post_format here. So this should be working.

49
04:26.840 --> 04:34.540
So we should find. Yeah as you can see we have "aside" here instead of displaying the post from the content.php,

50
04:34.610 --> 04:40.870
we're now displaying from content-aside. So in content-aside now we can create another template

51
04:40.870 --> 04:43.420
specifically for the aside post format.

52
04:43.870 --> 04:46.510
So let's start coding the aside post format in the next lecture.

53
04:46.540 --> 04:52.570
But before that lets go to content and we have some parts in the content that will be shared between

54
04:52.990 --> 04:53.830
post formats.

55
04:53.830 --> 05:01.600
So for example, we have the HEADER that will display the title and the metadata. And we also have the FOOTER

56
05:01.610 --> 05:03.740
that will display the categories and tags.

57
05:03.970 --> 05:11.910
So if we want to display this FOOTER in another post format, let's see the aside, we'll have to paste this whole code.

58
05:12.140 --> 05:15.830
And that's of course not a best practice if you want to modify this later,

59
05:15.940 --> 05:18.130
you'll have to go through all the post formats.

60
05:18.410 --> 05:23.510
So let's create a template parts for the HEADER and the FOOTER for the post.

61
05:24.080 --> 05:34.690
So inside the post I'll create a new file and I'm gonna call it header.php. And inside of it I'm gonna cut the

62
05:34.690 --> 05:41.100
HEADER from the post, from the content. And paste it here.

63
05:44.830 --> 05:50.380
And then open PHP here and get_template_part().

64
05:50.880 --> 05:56.070
And this will be "template-parts/post/header".

65
06:00.290 --> 06:07.860
And let's do the same for the FOOTER but let's just make sure this is working fine. And if we go to any

66
06:07.860 --> 06:10.090
post the header is displaying correctly.

67
06:10.090 --> 06:15.950
So let's go to, let's copy this and paste it here,

68
06:16.610 --> 06:24.150
after the single if condition. And change this "footer". And copy this or cut it.

69
06:27.370 --> 06:31.120
And then let's go create the footer in the post folder.

70
06:34.480 --> 06:34.920
And paste.

71
06:38.510 --> 06:39.910
And it's working fine.

72
06:40.890 --> 06:45.190
So let's in the next lecture write some code for the aside post format.
