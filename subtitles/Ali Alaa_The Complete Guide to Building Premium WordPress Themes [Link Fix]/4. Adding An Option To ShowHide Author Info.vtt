00:03.170 --> 00:08.550
So in the last lecture we added this author info box and then we said why don't we add an option

1
00:08.550 --> 00:10.210
to show or hide

2
00:10.290 --> 00:12.840
this box in the Customizer.

3
00:13.220 --> 00:22.730
So let's go back now to customize.php. And let's add a new section in the Customizer that is called

4
00:23.810 --> 00:24.830
Single Settings.

5
00:27.670 --> 00:38.810
So I'll only just copy a section and let's call it "single_blog_options". 

6
00:38.830 --> 00:39.340
And a title.

7
00:50.010 --> 00:54.440
And now let's add a new setting. So "$wp_customize"

8
00:56.950 --> 01:05.560
and "add_setting" and then ID. So, "_themename_" and let's call it "display_author_info".

9
01:08.480 --> 01:13.450
And an array of options.

10
01:13.760 --> 01:15.010
So we have a default value.

11
01:18.430 --> 01:26.400
And let's say it will be "true". And we'll have to sanitize the values so "sanitize_callback".

12
01:30.250 --> 01:32.170
So let's write a custom function for this one.

13
01:32.180 --> 01:33.980
This will either be "true" or "false".

14
01:33.980 --> 01:37.770
Any other value will be invalid. So let's write a function that will do that.

15
01:37.780 --> 01:47.880
So "_themename_sanitize_checkbox". And then let's define this function maybe 

16
01:47.900 --> 01:52.320
here. And this will get the value as an argument.

17
01:52.320 --> 01:53.340
So let's call it $checked.

18
01:56.430 --> 01:59.980
And it will return either "true" or "false".

19
01:59.990 --> 02:06.220
So we have a condition here, a ternary operator. And if this condition is "true" we'll return "true".

20
02:06.530 --> 02:11.610
Otherwise we will return "false".

21
02:11.810 --> 02:13.600
So what do we put in this condition.

22
02:13.640 --> 02:21.520
We'll have to check that this variable exists or isset()

23
02:21.760 --> 02:24.190
and also that it's "true".

24
02:28.050 --> 02:29.910
And if so we'll return "true".

25
02:30.280 --> 02:35.560
Otherwise if this value is not set or it's anything a string or any other thing other than "true", we

26
02:35.560 --> 02:37.150
will return "false".

27
02:37.150 --> 02:40.330
So that will be fine for sanitizing the checkbox.

28
02:40.570 --> 02:44.760
Let's also add the controls for this setting.

29
02:48.890 --> 02:50.260
And it will have the same ID.

30
02:55.500 --> 03:07.750
And now in the "type" we will give it a "checkbox" type and let's give it a "label". Escaped and translated of course.

31
03:12.280 --> 03:14.970
Let's call it "Show Author Info"

32
03:17.620 --> 03:21.520
and text domain.

33
03:22.140 --> 03:28.380
And finally we need to define a section that this control will appear in. And in our case we just created

34
03:28.380 --> 03:30.920
a section for the single options.

35
03:30.920 --> 03:33.310
So let's add this one.

36
03:33.630 --> 03:36.030
And I think that will be fine.

37
03:36.030 --> 03:42.800
So let's go now to the Customizer. And remember anything we do in the Customizer we must

38
03:42.800 --> 03:52.440
change the port to 8888. And let's go to the Single Blog Options. And we now have the checkbox.

39
03:53.030 --> 03:57.430
So let's use the value to show and hide this box here.

40
03:57.760 --> 04:04.580
So let's go to single.php and just add an if condition here before the get_template_part().

41
04:05.150 --> 04:10.930
If this option is true which means the checkbox is checked then we will get the template part.

42
04:10.940 --> 04:12.660
Otherwise we will do nothing.

43
04:12.710 --> 04:22.670
So to get the options we use get_theme_mod and the name of this setting which was this one. And a default value

44
04:22.770 --> 04:23.570
which is "true".

45
04:26.750 --> 04:29.460
And that's it.

46
04:29.570 --> 04:39.660
So let's see now.

47
04:40.230 --> 04:44.050
And as you can see it disappears when we uncheck the box.

48
04:44.070 --> 04:46.320
So let's do a couple of improvements.

49
04:46.410 --> 04:53.370
So of course as you notice we refresh the whole iframe now. So we will take care of this in a moment.

50
04:53.370 --> 04:59.640
But let's first add a new option that we haven't mentioned in the Customizer section. And this option

51
04:59.640 --> 05:07.020
will allow you to show or hide these sections depending on a certain condition.

52
05:07.020 --> 05:09.540
So back to the customize.php.

53
05:10.050 --> 05:15.170
And let's go to the section that we just created. And let's add another option called "active_callback".

54
05:20.500 --> 05:23.640
And this will take a function name or a function.

55
05:24.140 --> 05:31.010
And if this function returns "true" the section will appear and otherwise this section won't appear. So let's

56
05:31.230 --> 05:33.890
name the function and then we will explain more in a moment.

57
05:33.890 --> 05:42.380
So "_themename_show_single_blog_section".

58
05:42.380 --> 05:51.450
So let's just comment this for a moment. And what I mean is we only need this section to appear if we are 

59
05:51.510 --> 05:56.630
in the single page here. But let's say we are on a page or on the archive

60
05:56.760 --> 05:58.110
maybe we need this.

61
05:58.110 --> 06:01.390
We don't need this section to appear. It will be useless.

62
06:01.410 --> 06:03.780
It will change nothing in this page.

63
06:03.900 --> 06:06.200
So this might be a nice feature to add.

64
06:06.260 --> 06:11.030
So let's add this function now.

65
06:12.480 --> 06:14.510
So what do we need to check here?

66
06:14.700 --> 06:18.950
We can just return the output of is_single(), right?

67
06:22.980 --> 06:25.060
So if you go back now to the Customizer.

68
06:28.290 --> 06:31.740
And we have this setting because we are in a single page.

69
06:31.800 --> 06:33.900
But let's go to another page.

70
06:33.900 --> 06:39.660
And as you can see it disappears. But there is also one more thing we need to check.

71
06:39.680 --> 06:41.160
We need to check the post type.

72
06:41.160 --> 06:48.130
So in our function we return is_single(), but we only need this section to appear only for a single blog

73
06:48.130 --> 06:49.020
post.

74
06:49.050 --> 06:54.570
So in the future when we create custom post types so let's say we have a portfolio and you add portfolio

75
06:54.570 --> 06:57.500
items and this portfolio is a custom post type.

76
06:57.540 --> 07:03.480
So when you add the portfolio items and you are in a portfolio item page is_single() will return "true"

77
07:03.570 --> 07:06.370
because it's a single post type.

78
07:06.860 --> 07:09.980
So is_single() works for any post type except pages

79
07:10.020 --> 07:19.140
and I think attachments. So we'll also need to check that post type of this post is a post, right? And not any other custom post

80
07:19.190 --> 07:19.570
type.

81
07:19.590 --> 07:24.660
So you can access the global $post which is the current post.

82
07:27.570 --> 07:42.200
And then add another condition here. So "$post->post_type === 'post'". So we don't have any custom post

83
07:42.330 --> 07:48.650
types so we can't check if this is working. But we will have a section about custom post types so

84
07:48.770 --> 07:50.430
we can check this later.

85
07:50.510 --> 07:56.570
So right now it's appearing in the single blog and anywhere else it's not appearing.

86
07:56.870 --> 08:03.030
So let's go back to a single blog. And now we need to tackle the issue of

87
08:03.110 --> 08:07.330
refreshing the whole iframe. And we already know how to do that, right?

88
08:07.370 --> 08:11.230
So let's add "transport" in the setting.

89
08:16.450 --> 08:17.590
And "postMessage".

90
08:23.480 --> 08:30.470
And you already know that we can either write JavaScript callbacks or use partials. And in this case

91
08:30.470 --> 08:33.190
I think partials will be unnecessary.

92
08:33.200 --> 08:41.610
We can just use JavaScript callbacks and show or hide this box depending on the value of this setting.

93
08:41.660 --> 08:42.710
Right?

94
08:42.740 --> 08:45.650
We don't have any PHP duplication issues here.

95
08:45.650 --> 08:48.500
So I think JavaScript will be fine.

96
08:49.310 --> 08:56.550
So let's go to src/assets and the customize-preview file.

97
08:56.810 --> 08:58.260
And let's add another one.

98
09:00.160 --> 09:07.160
It is and we need this setting.

99
09:07.550 --> 09:08.750
So what do we need to do here?

100
09:08.760 --> 09:20.190
Let's first "console.log(to) to make sure this callback is working. And let's open the console and refresh.

101
09:24.480 --> 09:28.770
And let's "Single Blog Options".

102
09:33.450 --> 09:33.860
Sorry.

103
09:43.740 --> 09:46.370
So in the Single Blog Options check and uncheck.

104
09:46.420 --> 09:51.930
And returned "true" or "false" depending on if the check box is checked or not.

105
09:51.940 --> 09:54.210
So we can check with an if condition.

106
09:57.840 --> 10:09.420
And if "true" if it's checked we can get this item which is "c-post-author". And use jQuery

107
10:09.430 --> 10:13.230
to select it. And use ".show()".

108
10:16.240 --> 10:17.440
Ok, otherwise

109
10:20.240 --> 10:23.870
do the same thing except that we will "hide()" instead of "show()".

110
10:26.790 --> 10:29.030
So let's close this and refresh.

111
10:33.310 --> 10:33.830
And now

112
10:36.760 --> 10:44.470
it's updated almost instantly with JavaScript and we didn't have to do a lot of duplication or anything.

113
10:44.470 --> 10:50.830
So this example is where JavaScript will be useful otherwise if you find yourself duplicating a lot

114
10:50.830 --> 10:55.110
of PHP codes just code with the partials options.

115
10:55.480 --> 10:58.470
Great, so let's carry on with our single blog.

116
10:58.510 --> 11:04.120
And now we need to add, after the single blog we need to add next and previous posts to navigate through

117
11:04.120 --> 11:06.520
the posts in the single page.

118
11:06.520 --> 11:07.540
So see you in the next lecture.
