00:02.680 --> 00:06.850
So in the last lecture we created a plugin and we activated it.

1
00:07.030 --> 00:09.200
But right now it doesn't do anything.

2
00:09.240 --> 00:20.260
So let's in functions.php in the theme let's remove the metaboxes file.

3
00:20.410 --> 00:26.620
And so now if we edit a post we won't get our metaboxes here.

4
00:27.160 --> 00:32.950
So now we need to move this code from the plugin to the theme or actually from theme to our plugin.

5
00:33.070 --> 00:41.530
So let's go to the metaboxes.php. And let's copy and just like the theme any code you would like

6
00:41.530 --> 00:45.630
to run in a plug in you should add it in the index.php.

7
00:45.670 --> 00:52.850
It's like the functions.php for a theme. But instead of doing that let's create a new folder just for better

8
00:52.930 --> 00:55.820
organization and call it includes.

9
00:58.770 --> 01:02.110
And a new file and let's call it metaboxes.php.

10
01:07.640 --> 01:09.000
And let's include.

11
01:12.180 --> 01:25.340
So let's use include_once() and this will be "includes/metaboxes.php".

12
01:25.560 --> 01:27.540
So let's see now

13
01:27.590 --> 01:30.810
our edit page. And we still don't have it.

14
01:30.810 --> 01:33.160
I'm wondering why we have our plugin active.

15
01:37.300 --> 01:43.250
Case who apparently I discovered that I just did not save the metaboxes.php file.

16
01:43.790 --> 01:47.260
So I saved it and now our field appear here.

17
01:47.980 --> 01:54.930
But let's just see if we will have to change anything in this code. So we've our prefixes here which we

18
01:54.930 --> 01:58.830
will replace in the plugins gulp tasks.

19
01:58.980 --> 02:05.130
However in the text domains it's not "_themename" anymore.

20
02:06.920 --> 02:10.490
It's "_themename-_pluginname".

21
02:10.610 --> 02:22.470
So we'll have to go through all the text domains and you can use Cmd+D and select all of them.

22
02:22.740 --> 02:34.230
And then just replace.

23
02:34.280 --> 02:36.900
So I think that would be it.

24
02:37.100 --> 02:43.780
You can if you want prefix your functions with the theme name and the plugin name. So "__"

25
02:43.790 --> 02:49.640
"__pluginname" but I think the "_themename"s will be fine.

26
02:49.640 --> 02:53.660
So let's now try to run our tasks. We need to create a folder called src.

27
03:00.250 --> 03:06.150
And there're inside of it assets, remember.

28
03:06.400 --> 03:12.810
And then in our case we might not need CSS and JavaScript on plugin.

29
03:12.890 --> 03:19.170
But let's just create a general plugin that we can use for any plugin that we will create throughout

30
03:19.170 --> 03:19.680
this course

31
03:24.290 --> 03:30.710
And you might actually need to enqueue some styles to maybe change the styles of these fields.

32
03:31.100 --> 03:34.190
So let's create our admin.js.

33
03:38.180 --> 03:42.460
And our admin.scss.

34
03:42.960 --> 03:47.170
And let's add some dummy CSS here.

35
03:50.880 --> 03:51.790
And of course.

36
03:54.750 --> 03:58.030
And also some dummy CSS, javascript.

37
04:03.190 --> 04:06.690
And now we should be able to run our tasks.

38
04:06.690 --> 04:09.520
So let's run "npm start"

39
04:15.310 --> 04:19.580
And this will build and clean and watch and all the stuff that we did before.

40
04:20.400 --> 04:29.350
And we now should have this foldew with our compiled assets. So the _themename-metaboxes

41
04:29.380 --> 04:31.560
folder will only be for development.

42
04:31.590 --> 04:34.100
We'll have the uncompiled files and stuff like that.

43
04:34.590 --> 04:40.590
And then when we build and compile, we will have our final plugin in the package folder. And we'll see this

44
04:40.590 --> 04:47.480
in a moment but let's just now enqueue our scripts. So in the includes folder let's create a new file. And let's call

45
04:47.490 --> 04:51.230
it enqueue-assets.php.

46
04:55.290 --> 05:03.000
And let's open PHP and we've done this before so I'm gonna paste it and let's go through it quickly.

47
05:03.550 --> 05:09.790
So the difference now is that we'll only enqueue for admin.

48
05:10.160 --> 05:15.590
And then the function name, since in the theme we had a function called "_themename_admin_scripts",

49
05:15.620 --> 05:18.370
I decided to add the also the plugin name prefix.

50
05:18.380 --> 05:22.780
So when we build our plugin this function will be called "firsttheme_"

51
05:23.060 --> 05:26.060
"firsttheme_metaboxes_admin" and so on.

52
05:26.310 --> 05:32.270
And also when we enqueue our script I added "_themename-_pluginname" -admin-scripts in order not to clash with

53
05:32.750 --> 05:37.090
the "_themename-admin-scripts". And to get the URL in the plugin

54
05:37.100 --> 05:42.890
we don't use get_template_directory_uri(), we use a function called plugins_url(). And this will get

55
05:42.890 --> 05:45.590
you the URL for the plugins folder,

56
05:45.620 --> 05:50.300
this default folder. And it takes as an argument the path the plugins folder.

57
05:50.390 --> 05:55.330
So in our case it's our plugins name and then"/dist/assets/" and so on.

58
05:55.730 --> 05:57.950
And same for the stylesheets.

59
05:58.010 --> 06:03.350
Let's now include the enqueue-assets in the index.php.

60
06:13.020 --> 06:18.960
And we now have a JavaScript. And let's make sure that the CSS is loaded.

61
06:22.140 --> 06:26.100
And we have it now but it's overridden by this style.

62
06:26.110 --> 06:28.360
One more thing we can do here.

63
06:28.360 --> 06:35.890
If you go to any admin page let's say the Dashboard, you will have these files loaded.

64
06:35.890 --> 06:44.680
However in the metaboxes we will only use these files only if we are in the Edit Post page, right?

65
06:44.690 --> 06:50.780
So it's kind of wasting resources to load these files in all the Admin pages when we only need them

66
06:51.170 --> 06:57.540
in the Edit Post page. So to tackle that we can add a if condition here.

67
06:59.680 --> 07:01.900
So let's access a global variable called

68
07:04.940 --> 07:05.620
$pagenow.

69
07:05.630 --> 07:06.030
$pagenow.

70
07:09.010 --> 07:21.780
And this global variable holds the current page name which will be this name, post.php. So we can just check "if 

71
07:21.780 --> 07:31.440
( $pagenow !== 'post.php')" we can return.

72
07:31.450 --> 07:36.150
We don't need to do load this files.

73
07:36.230 --> 07:37.400
So let's check now.

74
07:40.390 --> 07:43.510
So as you can see we get no alert here.

75
07:43.840 --> 07:52.900
But if you go to the Edit Post page we get it. So let's just remove these.

76
07:58.600 --> 08:05.800
Right now we have like a foundation for any plugin that we need to create in this course. So when you

77
08:05.800 --> 08:12.530
create a new plugin we can just copy this folder and change the stuff that we include in the index.php

78
08:12.590 --> 08:13.450
index.php.

79
08:13.970 --> 08:16.620
But the gulp tasks and the enqueue-assets,

80
08:16.700 --> 08:20.120
it will probably be the same for all the plugins that we will create.

81
08:21.040 --> 08:23.220
This is one final step for this lecture.

82
08:23.290 --> 08:27.040
We need to build our plugin to make sure that everything is fine.

83
08:28.050 --> 08:30.630
So let's run "npm run build".

84
08:36.160 --> 08:39.320
And now we should find our build plugin.

85
08:39.350 --> 08:43.390
Oh, actually sorry "npm run bundle".

86
08:47.800 --> 08:51.720
So now we should have the package folder here and inside of it.

87
08:51.840 --> 09:01.050
And now it's called firsttheme-metaboxes.zip. Let's unzip it. And let's make sure that, let's open

88
09:01.140 --> 09:02.790
index.php.

89
09:02.980 --> 09:09.820
And as you can see it's now called "firsttheme metaboxes" and the Text Domain is "firsttheme-metaboxes".

90
09:09.830 --> 09:18.530
Let's also make sure that our functions are replaced correctly. So we now have firsttheme_meta

91
09:18.530 --> 09:19.250
boxes.

92
09:19.310 --> 09:20.470
And here as well.

93
09:23.400 --> 09:26.970
And the text domains here are now "firsttheme-metaboxes".

94
09:26.990 --> 09:28.790
So looks fine.

95
09:28.790 --> 09:30.710
What we need to do now is we need to,

96
09:31.010 --> 09:37.580
let's delete this, we need to put this file, zip file somewhere inside our theme.

97
09:37.580 --> 09:48.330
So let's say, inside theme and firsttheme and. So let's save in the lib folder. Let's create a new folder called 

98
09:48.330 --> 09:51.640
plugins.

99
09:52.550 --> 09:55.590
And then inside of it paste our plugin.

100
09:55.640 --> 10:01.760
Now if you are developing for Theme Forest, it's a requirement that all the plugins that you create that will

101
10:01.760 --> 10:05.920
be associated with your theme. It should be bundled inside your theme like so.

102
10:06.050 --> 10:12.950
And you should also do something that will display a message in the wp-admin that will say "These

103
10:12.950 --> 10:15.550
plugins are required to be installed with this theme.

104
10:15.680 --> 10:20.780
Do you want to start installing them now?". And to do that we'll have to do some integration with a third

105
10:20.780 --> 10:22.950
party library.

106
10:22.980 --> 10:24.260
So let's do that in the next lecture.
