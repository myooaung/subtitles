00:03.150 --> 00:06.580
So in the last lecture we added some CSS styling

1
00:06.660 --> 00:07.650
to our theme.

2
00:07.710 --> 00:13.230
And then we called the get_sidebar() in order to create an area where users can add some widgets.

3
00:13.290 --> 00:17.140
So get_sidebar() will load a file sidebar.php.

4
00:17.220 --> 00:22.490
So now we need to create a sidebar and then inside sidebar.php we'll call a function that will

5
00:22.490 --> 00:29.520
load the widgets in the sidebar. A sidebar in WordPress despite its name, it could be not just a sidebar.

6
00:29.790 --> 00:35.310
Sidebar refers to an area where users can put widgets. It doesn't have to be an actual sidebar.

7
00:35.430 --> 00:41.360
So the first thing we need to define a sidebar to place in our theme.

8
00:41.490 --> 00:47.170
So let's go to lib and create a new file and call it sidebars.

9
00:47.320 --> 00:53.320
And this file will define any sidebars we will place in our themes. So sidebars.php.

10
00:54.080 --> 01:05.350
So open a PHP tag and let's create a new function. So "function" and than our prefix "_themename" and let's

11
01:05.350 --> 01:11.860
call it  "sidebar_widgets" and then we'll hook this function to an action called

12
01:14.260 --> 01:17.090
"widgets_init".

13
01:17.560 --> 01:20.830
So when widgets initialize we need to run this function.

14
01:24.190 --> 01:29.930
So inside this function we'll put our code to register a sidebar.

15
01:31.990 --> 01:34.960
So simply call a WordPress function called "register_sidebar".

16
01:35.270 --> 01:36.380
Sorry.

17
01:44.350 --> 01:47.090
And it takes an array of arguments.

18
01:47.200 --> 01:53.630
So the first argument is an "id" and this should be unique id for the specific sidebar.

19
01:54.190 --> 01:57.680
So this is our main sidebar, right, in the blog posts page.

20
01:57.730 --> 02:03.180
So let's call it "primary_sidebar".

21
02:04.750 --> 02:07.150
And the second argument is a "name".

22
02:10.490 --> 02:12.610
Let's also call it  "primary sidebar".

23
02:12.610 --> 02:16.690
But make sure you escape any strings

24
02:17.140 --> 02:19.530
as we mentioned before.

25
02:20.260 --> 02:29.110
So "Primary Sidebar" and this name will appear in the admin area as we'll see in a moment.

26
02:29.770 --> 02:33.480
And of course our text domain is "_themename" placeholder.

27
02:34.120 --> 02:43.660
And then we have a description which will also appear in the admin area. And it should also be escaped.

28
02:43.660 --> 02:50.050
So, you know, let's type any description "This sidebar

29
02:53.500 --> 02:55.540
appears in the

30
02:58.180 --> 02:59.110
blog posts page".

31
03:02.080 --> 03:10.480
And the text domain "_themename". And then we have "before_widget" argument.

32
03:11.930 --> 03:18.160
And this will be any HTML you would like to print before the widget.

33
03:18.200 --> 03:21.140
So in our case we would like to wrap our widget in a SECTION tag.

34
03:21.290 --> 03:24.330
And that's also an HTML5 tag.

35
03:24.680 --> 03:27.600
And I think it's appropriate use for a widget.

36
03:29.000 --> 03:31.420
And this takes an ID.

37
03:33.260 --> 03:37.590
And it also takes the ID as a placeholder.

38
03:37.820 --> 03:45.350
And WordPress will replace this placeholder by a unique ID that it will generate and we'll see this

39
03:45.350 --> 03:46.700
also in a moment.

40
03:47.030 --> 03:52.790
You can also give it a class, so I have a CSS class called "c-sidebar- 

41
03:56.410 --> 03:56.890
widget".

42
04:00.240 --> 04:01.600
And also let's give it a margin

43
04:04.260 --> 04:07.350
"u-margin-bottom-20".

44
04:07.760 --> 04:11.170
And also it takes a placeholder.

45
04:11.510 --> 04:21.740
So the second placeholder. Sorry. This is now second one. And also WordPress will replace this by unique class that it will

46
04:21.780 --> 04:24.320
generate for each widget.

47
04:24.920 --> 04:31.210
So it's important to put these placeholders here if you will define a custom before widget HTML.

48
04:32.300 --> 04:33.770
So next we have

49
04:37.260 --> 04:46.880
"after_widget" and here we just close the SECTION. We also have "before_title".

50
04:51.360 --> 04:53.110
So each widget will have a title.

51
04:53.300 --> 04:58.970
And "before_title" will just add some HTML before the title. So we would like maybe to add

52
04:58.970 --> 05:06.130
an H5 tag to wrap the widget in. And "after_

53
05:06.140 --> 05:06.490
title"

54
05:09.660 --> 05:15.260
we will just close the H5 tag.

55
05:15.380 --> 05:16.290
So I think that's it.

56
05:16.310 --> 05:19.900
Let's now include this file and functions.php.

57
05:22.690 --> 05:23.530
So

58
05:26.190 --> 05:33.380
let's duplicate this line and then change it to sidebars.

59
05:33.460 --> 05:36.440
Let's now go to the wp-admin page.

60
05:37.030 --> 05:44.070
So I have mine opened and then in Appearance you will now have the Widgets option.

61
05:44.080 --> 05:51.200
You don't have this option if you don't have any sidebars defined. So if we comment out of this line and

62
05:51.260 --> 05:54.480
then we don't have it.

63
05:55.160 --> 06:00.670
So now that we have sidebars defined we can now add widgets.

64
06:01.100 --> 06:03.230
So go to the widget page 

65
06:03.310 --> 06:10.590
And now we have our sidebar where we can, you know, drag and drop widgets. So let's add some.

66
06:10.710 --> 06:11.140
So

67
06:16.410 --> 06:18.970
let's add a couple of them.

68
06:20.740 --> 06:22.470
And add some titles.

69
06:22.890 --> 06:27.270
And now we have to of course here we still have nothing.

70
06:27.430 --> 06:31.560
We now need to load the sidebar in the sidebar.php file.

71
06:31.910 --> 06:33.670
So how to do that?

72
06:34.410 --> 06:36.150
It's very simple.

73
06:36.630 --> 06:44.520
In sidebar.php let's now remove this and create a ASIDE tag with a "role" of

74
06:47.290 --> 06:52.330
"complementary".

75
06:53.170 --> 06:59.580
And this also is an HTML5 tag where you can use when you have some site content in your web site 

76
06:59.590 --> 07:05.880
like in our case sidebar, as opposed to the MAIN tag that we used in the last lecture. Let's open a PHP

77
07:05.950 --> 07:06.310
tag

78
07:09.160 --> 07:12.270
and all we have to do is call a function called dynamic_sidebar().

79
07:12.700 --> 07:17.910
And as an argument the ID of the sidebar that we need to load.

80
07:17.920 --> 07:20.290
So in our case we call this "primary-sidebar".

81
07:24.860 --> 07:27.490
And that's really it.

82
07:27.620 --> 07:35.060
We now have some widgets here. We just have a problem now imagine we have a sidebar but we don't have any

83
07:35.770 --> 07:41.160
widgets in it. So let's remove these and then refresh.

84
07:42.050 --> 07:43.650
So we have an empty space here.

85
07:43.670 --> 07:53.350
So one solution to this is you can call a function called is_active_sidebar() and this will check if

86
07:53.390 --> 07:56.760
a sidebar has any widgets or not.

87
07:57.350 --> 08:04.770
So it takes also the ID of the sidebar to check.

88
08:05.050 --> 08:11.550
And let's put this in an if condition and then open { and then

89
08:15.300 --> 08:15.870
"else"

90
08:19.610 --> 08:24.330
and then close the if condition.

91
08:26.270 --> 08:33.150
And inside the else we can have some text like "you can add widgets here".

92
08:38.300 --> 08:41.910
So this is fine. However is not a best practice.

93
08:41.960 --> 08:47.470
And actually according to the latest Theme Forest requirements for a theme, you shouldn't display text like that in 

94
08:47.470 --> 08:52.520
your theme. If the user did not add any widgets, we should try to adapt the design in order to fill that

95
08:52.520 --> 08:53.320
space.

96
08:53.510 --> 08:59.220
So let's do that instead of displaying the text here, let's delete this.

97
08:59.240 --> 09:03.960
And let's copy this if condition and remove from here.

98
09:05.030 --> 09:06.130
And inside sidebar

99
09:09.440 --> 09:11.110
let's add this if condition here.

100
09:18.880 --> 09:21.380
So if the sidebar is active at this row,

101
09:22.040 --> 09:26.010
else don't add anything.

102
09:26.300 --> 09:31.810
So let's close the if condition.

103
09:32.690 --> 09:36.630
And then we will need to, let's copy this also

104
09:38.250 --> 09:44.940
to if the sidebar is not active instead of the 8 span here make it 12. Let the content take over

105
09:44.940 --> 09:46.340
all the available space.

106
09:46.470 --> 09:52.310
So we can open a PHP tag inside, instead of the 8 here open a PHP tag

107
09:55.140 --> 09:59.060
and then do a ternary expression here.

108
09:59.640 --> 10:02.510
So "is_sidebar_active"

109
10:06.710 --> 10:16.210
make it 8 otherwise 12.

110
10:16.350 --> 10:21.620
So as you can see now it's filling all the content. It's filling all the space available.

111
10:21.640 --> 10:24.450
If we add some widgets here.

112
10:27.500 --> 10:29.280
Looks we've got something wrong here.

113
10:29.900 --> 10:31.540
Oh, I think we need to echo this

114
10:35.530 --> 10:37.930
and that's it. Remove.

115
10:42.310 --> 10:46.660
And refresh. And it's filling all the content.

116
10:46.750 --> 10:54.250
So I think that's it for our sidebar. And in the next lecture let's add some other sidebars in the footer.

117
10:54.260 --> 10:59.650
Let's create a footer and then we let the user add the sidebars. But this time we'll try to do it

118
10:59.800 --> 11:04.120
dynamically so the user can choose how many sidebars they need in the footer.

119
11:04.300 --> 11:08.280
And according to his input we will generate different numbers of sidebars.

120
11:08.440 --> 11:11.220
I just forgot to mention something. Let's have some widgets here.

121
11:14.970 --> 11:18.000
And refresh the page.

122
11:18.070 --> 11:22.730
Remember when I told you about the unique ID that WordPress will give.

123
11:22.750 --> 11:23.980
I just want to show you that.

124
11:24.230 --> 11:26.010
So we have here recent posts.

125
11:26.290 --> 11:28.060
And number 3.

126
11:28.060 --> 11:31.050
And then a class "widget_recent_entries".

127
11:31.180 --> 11:35.060
So these are what got replaced with in sidebars.

128
11:35.080 --> 11:37.170
They replaced these placeholders.

129
11:37.390 --> 11:39.370
So it's important to put these placeholders.
