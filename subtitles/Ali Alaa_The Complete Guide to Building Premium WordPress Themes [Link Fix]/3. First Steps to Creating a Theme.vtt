So now that we've installed WordPress we can now start developing our own theme.

1
00:08.280 --> 00:14.130
But before that let's take a look at WordPress's folder structure. And the first file I would like to talk

2
00:14.130 --> 00:17.560
about is the .htaccess file.

3
00:17.730 --> 00:21.090
It's a hidden file so make sure you have hidden files displayed

4
00:21.120 --> 00:22.510
if you want to view it.

5
00:23.190 --> 00:30.480
So the .htaccess is a server configuration file and WordPress uses it to manage permalinks and redirects.

6
00:31.320 --> 00:34.540
You're most likely not gonna have to change anything in it,

7
00:34.590 --> 00:42.000
but if you do just make sure you know what you're doing. Next is the wp-includes folder and this folder

8
00:42.000 --> 00:45.270
contains most of WordPress's core files.

9
00:45.390 --> 00:48.310
If you're a theme developer you will never have to change anything in this folder.

10
00:48.320 --> 00:54.510
The wp-admin folder contains files that run the admin panel that we saw in the

11
00:54.510 --> 01:02.700
last lecture. And the wp-content folder. And this folder is where you as a theme developer will mostly work.

12
01:02.700 --> 01:10.020
This folder contains plugins, which are pieces  of code that add more functionality to WordPress. And themes,

13
01:10.230 --> 01:17.310
which are responsible for how your website appears. And also uploads which contains any media that you

14
01:17.310 --> 01:25.060
upload to your website like images, audio and videos. Whenever you update WordPress

15
01:25.060 --> 01:31.900
all the files and folders  here will be replaced with the new version except the wp-content folder and the

16
01:31.930 --> 01:33.740
wp-config file.

17
01:34.120 --> 01:39.150
And that's because they contain information and files specific to your website.

18
01:39.520 --> 01:44.700
So as a developer you're not allowed to change anything except inside wp-content folder.

19
01:45.100 --> 01:48.620
Otherwise it will be replaced whenever you update WordPress.

20
01:48.630 --> 01:50.350
Let's finally take a look at the 

21
01:50.440 --> 01:51.770
wp-config file.

22
01:52.680 --> 01:56.940
This file contains information about your database.

23
01:56.960 --> 02:01.210
It's the same information we typed during the installation wizard.

24
02:01.220 --> 02:09.770
In fact we could have typed this information here and skip the wizard part. It also contains some other information

25
02:10.010 --> 02:13.060
that we may take a look at during this course.

26
02:13.130 --> 02:20.740
So let's now start creating our theme. So in the wp-content folder and inside the themes folder let's create

27
02:20.770 --> 02:28.860
a new folder. And let's call it maybe also firsttheme.

28
02:28.880 --> 02:34.760
All right. So now I'm gonna open this folder in Visual Studio Code.

29
02:34.970 --> 02:43.760
So the only two files required to create a WordPress theme are style.css and index.php.

30
02:43.910 --> 02:49.450
So let's create these files now. I'm gonna create a new file and call it index.php.

31
02:49.690 --> 02:58.480
And also I'm going to create another file and call it style.css.

32
02:58.680 --> 03:05.760
So we'll talk about index.php later but for now let's just put a basic HTML5 document.

33
03:09.610 --> 03:16.300
The style.css will contain some information about the theme that will appear in the Appearance tab

34
03:17.320 --> 03:19.940
that displays all the available themes.

35
03:20.050 --> 03:28.370
So let's type these information and it's written in a PHP comment. So the first one is the Theme Name.

36
03:28.550 --> 03:38.460
So let's type firsttheme. And then the Author. So I'm gonna just type my name. And then we have theAauthor

37
03:38.490 --> 03:40.810
URL. You can type 

38
03:40.830 --> 03:41.830
your URL here.

39
03:42.820 --> 03:49.890
And then we have the Description for your theme. So I'm just gonna type some dummy text here.

40
03:52.090 --> 03:58.230
And then we have the Version of the theme. And this is our first version so I'm gonna put 1.0.

41
03:58.810 --> 04:05.200
And then we have the License and this field might differ depending on where are you gonna put your

42
04:05.200 --> 04:06.910
theme, where are you gonna publish it.

43
04:06.970 --> 04:12.890
So I'm gonna just copy and paste the license required for a Theme Forest since maybe that's what you

44
04:12.890 --> 04:13.980
are looking for.

45
04:14.100 --> 04:15.890
But if that's not what you looking for

46
04:15.910 --> 04:19.320
make sure to do some research on this.

47
04:19.360 --> 04:24.730
Next we have the Text Domain and we'll talk more about this later.

48
04:24.960 --> 04:28.790
But typically it's the same as your theme name.

49
04:28.930 --> 04:31.570
And finally you can add some Tags for your theme.

50
04:31.710 --> 04:38.850
So I'm just gonna put a couple of tags here and then you can add your own.

51
04:38.910 --> 04:41.350
So I think now we're done with this file.

52
04:41.610 --> 04:44.150
We may come here later and modify some stuff,

53
04:44.160 --> 04:52.760
but let's go back now to the wp-admin and in the Appearance tab you'll find your theme listed amongst

54
04:52.770 --> 04:55.530
the other themes. But as you can see

55
04:55.530 --> 04:59.950
our theme has no image. And to create an image for the theme,

56
05:00.030 --> 05:08.520
it's pretty easy, let's create png of 1200x900 pixels. And all you have to do is just name it

57
05:08.640 --> 05:15.050
screenshot.png and then put it in the root folder of your theme.

58
05:15.080 --> 05:21.400
So I already did a dummy image. So I'm gonna go ahead and put it in the same folder.

59
05:21.950 --> 05:27.930
And if you go ahead now and refresh, you'll find the image attached to your theme.
