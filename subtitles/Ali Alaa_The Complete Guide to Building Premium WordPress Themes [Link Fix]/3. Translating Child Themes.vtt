00:02.370 --> 00:04.740
So in the last lecture we translated

1
00:04.800 --> 00:09.090
our theme. Let's now see how to translate a child theme.

2
00:09.540 --> 00:16.140
So we're actually also not responsible for creating child themes but it would be nice if you include a

3
00:16.140 --> 00:22.470
sample child theme with your theme and mention also how to translate it and so on. So let's see how to

4
00:22.470 --> 00:23.240
do it.

5
00:23.280 --> 00:26.890
So let's add our child theme here.

6
00:33.940 --> 00:43.220
So we had in functions.php. We used some filters like this one and it had a string and it had a text domain.

7
00:43.270 --> 00:45.210
So let's say our text domain is called 

8
00:46.060 --> 00:48.890
let's say, "mytheme-child".

9
00:49.360 --> 00:54.130
So what this text should appear when we have a page with no posts.

10
00:54.140 --> 00:55.280
Right?

11
00:55.480 --> 01:02.100
So that's maybe, let's quickly create a new category. And let's make this category empty with no posts.

12
01:02.110 --> 01:08.600
So I think this is Category in German.

13
01:08.780 --> 01:18.590
So let's view this category. And we also in the child theme we had this content-none file.

14
01:18.780 --> 01:26.830
So let's remove this in order to see the text.

15
01:27.020 --> 01:28.210
So now we have "No Posts".

16
01:31.530 --> 01:33.900
And it has this text domain.

17
01:34.140 --> 01:41.640
So what we have to do is, we have to go to functions.php in the child theme. And we're actually now inside

18
01:41.640 --> 01:42.340
of it.

19
01:42.720 --> 01:45.970
And let's go to functions.php in our parent theme. Let's copy this.

20
01:48.900 --> 01:50.730
And let's paste it somewhere here.

21
01:51.770 --> 01:59.820
And all we have to do is instead of calling load_theme_textdomain(), we call a function called load_child_theme

22
01:59.950 --> 02:00.400
load_child_theme_textdomain().

23
02:03.460 --> 02:10.050
And also we will change this text domain to our child themes text domain, right?

24
02:12.430 --> 02:19.300
But now we don't have any in our child theme, we don't have any POT files. And we also don't have gulp

25
02:19.450 --> 02:22.150
tasks to generate one.

26
02:22.180 --> 02:26.240
So what we can do is, we can actually, let's just create first a languages folder.

27
02:29.420 --> 02:34.940
And let's try to generate a POT file for the child theme in an other way, other than the gulp

28
02:34.950 --> 02:35.670
task. 

29
02:35.710 --> 02:38.970
So let's do it using the Poedit.

30
02:39.510 --> 02:41.890
So let's go to File in the Poedit menu.

31
02:42.230 --> 02:47.810
And they actually have a nice feature called WordPress Translation where you will just add your theme folder

32
02:48.020 --> 02:53.070
and they will scan all the strings in it and generate a POT file.

33
02:53.100 --> 02:56.520
But this is actually a premium feature you have to pay for it.

34
02:56.600 --> 03:01.790
You have to have the full version of the Poedit. So you can do that if you like or you can just create a gulp

35
03:01.850 --> 03:03.500
task like we did for the parent team.

36
03:03.530 --> 03:10.670
So let's try this out and let's add our theme folder.

37
03:10.880 --> 03:12.170
So the child theme.

38
03:15.220 --> 03:16.700
And let's Create a POT file.

39
03:20.120 --> 03:22.580
And now this file will have all our strings.

40
03:22.630 --> 03:31.870
So let's create a new translation from this POT file. But let's save our POT file first in the languages folder

41
03:31.880 --> 03:39.470
of the child theme. So let's save. And let's create a new German translation.

42
03:41.080 --> 03:44.080
And for "No Post" let's use one of these.

43
03:45.010 --> 03:49.560
And save. And now we're saving a PO and MO files.

44
03:52.520 --> 04:00.290
So let's go back now and inside the languages we should have POT and PO and MO files. So let's take

45
04:00.300 --> 04:10.590
a look now what the website. And also we have used this function name before. So I'll just call it 

46
04:10.610 --> 04:11.800
anything, it is not important

47
04:11.810 --> 04:11.990
now.

48
04:22.120 --> 04:25.030
And looks like we still have some mistake.

49
04:25.300 --> 04:26.000
All right. So

50
04:26.300 --> 04:26.910
my bad.

51
04:26.930 --> 04:32.000
Remember when we were discussing child themes and we mentioned that if you want to reference the child

52
04:32.000 --> 04:38.930
themes folder, you should use get_stylesheet_directory() instead of get_template_directly(). get_template_directly()

53
04:38.930 --> 04:41.110
will always reference the parent theme.

54
04:41.710 --> 04:51.330
So let's use get_stylesheet_directory().

55
04:51.500 --> 04:54.290
And now we have our translation.

56
04:54.410 --> 05:00.190
And if you go back to the home page we will also still have the translation for the parent theme.

57
05:00.830 --> 05:03.290
So I think that's it for translations.

58
05:03.290 --> 05:06.440
There is also one thing you can do but I'll leave this to you.

59
05:06.870 --> 05:10.100
It will be quite similar which is translating plugins.

60
05:10.640 --> 05:14.680
So if you'd like give it a shot and let me know if you have any problems.

61
05:14.750 --> 05:15.610
It will be quite similar.

62
05:15.620 --> 05:19.960
We'll just use different functions to load the text domain.

63
05:20.390 --> 05:25.430
And also I think you will have to call your translation files a bit differently.

64
05:25.580 --> 05:29.000
So take a look at it if you like and let me know if you have any questions.
