00:03.010 --> 00:09.150
So throughout the course I've been mentioning you know, you won't use the source folder and node_modules folder

1
00:09.150 --> 00:13.940
for doing production. We only use them in development.

2
00:14.010 --> 00:17.120
So what exactly is production.

3
00:17.190 --> 00:24.120
You probably know that when you are making a theme the end product is gonna be a zip file. zip file

4
00:24.120 --> 00:26.030
with all the theme contents.

5
00:26.820 --> 00:30.910
And then the user will take this zip file and install it on WordPress.

6
00:30.960 --> 00:35.070
So every time now we want to bundle our theme for users to use.

7
00:35.340 --> 00:42.380
we'll have to delete the node_modules file and the source file and any other files or folders. And then

8
00:42.390 --> 00:45.070
zip the rest of the files.

9
00:45.270 --> 00:49.120
And this sounds like a process that should be automated, right?

10
00:49.200 --> 00:50.740
So let's do that.

11
00:50.800 --> 00:58.560
Let's create a new task that will only select the files that we need to put in the zip file and compress

12
00:58.560 --> 01:11.660
them and produce a zip file for users. So let's install a new gulp plugin. And it's called "gulp-zip".

13
01:11.960 --> 01:13.140
So it is install it.

14
01:16.210 --> 01:24.840
And I'm not on my theme folder on the command line. So let's "cd" and then paste to the theme folder and then

15
01:25.500 --> 01:29.540
paste the install. Great.

16
01:29.570 --> 01:31.070
So now let's use it.

17
01:32.690 --> 01:37.070
So in the gulpfile "import

18
01:40.890 --> 01:43.520
zip from

19
01:46.150 --> 01:55.100
'gulp-zip'". And then in the paths let's create a new key for the zip file.

20
01:55.460 --> 01:58.140
So I'm gonna call it "package"

21
02:01.610 --> 02:02.830
and then the source

22
02:05.410 --> 02:10.380
will be an array and the destination.

23
02:11.230 --> 02:16.980
We'll put our zip file in a new folder called "packaged".

24
02:17.200 --> 02:22.660
So this will create a new folder called "packaged" inside of it will be the zip file for the theme

25
02:22.840 --> 02:23.860
when we create the task.

26
02:23.950 --> 02:26.170
So what should be the source.

27
02:26.200 --> 02:36.910
So we have a folder here. We need to zip all the folder, all the files and folders in the theme

28
02:37.240 --> 02:40.950
folder except some stuff, right?

29
02:41.170 --> 02:47.330
So I'm gonna use the ! here to exclude some folders and files.

30
02:48.640 --> 02:52.880
So first we have a folder that belongs to VS Code here.

31
02:53.130 --> 02:55.130
You need that. So 

32
02:55.280 --> 02:56.340
"!.vscode"

33
02:56.440 --> 02:58.490
"!.vscode"

34
02:58.760 --> 03:03.060
And then we have the node_modules.

35
03:03.940 --> 03:10.770
So "!node_modules". Make sure you don't have any spelling mistakes here.

36
03:11.140 --> 03:20.410
And then if this folder have subfolders like the node_modules cause we need to also tell the task we don't need to the

37
03:20.410 --> 03:21.680
subfolders of the.

38
03:22.070 --> 03:33.510
So you can do something like, you know, copy this and then do another one with the subfolders or there's

39
03:33.510 --> 03:41.550
shortcut for this. We can we can open { } here and inside of it type subdirectories as separated

40
03:41.550 --> 03:43.420
with commas.

41
03:43.460 --> 03:46.230
So the first one will be the node_modules folder itself.

42
03:46.460 --> 03:55.960
So the first subdirectory will be nothing. It's just space and comma. And the second one will be the subfolders.

43
03:56.020 --> 03:59.920
So that is an empty space here for the node_modules folder itself.

44
04:00.130 --> 04:05.730
And then the subfolders of the node_modules folder. Next we have.

45
04:06.080 --> 04:12.010
So I told you this package, this task will create a new packaged folder that will contain a zip file

46
04:12.010 --> 04:13.150
of the theme. So

47
04:13.210 --> 04:24.820
we actually don't need that in the actual theme. So we don't need "packaged" and also any of its subfolders.

48
04:24.870 --> 04:28.050
Next we have the source

49
04:31.070 --> 04:31.790
folder which we

50
04:31.860 --> 04:41.920
as I mentioned a lot only used during development. And also subfolders. Next some files that

51
04:42.010 --> 04:45.470
are also for development only, like .babelrc file here.

52
04:45.490 --> 04:59.240
So "!.babelrc". If you're using GIT make sure to include the "!.gitignore" file.

53
04:59.320 --> 05:10.910
We have also the gulpfile. So "!gulpfile.babel.js". And finally, we have the package-lock and package.json 

54
05:10.920 --> 05:13.570
which are created by NPM.

55
05:13.570 --> 05:15.260
So let's add these

56
05:17.970 --> 05:19.530
"!package.json"

57
05:23.410 --> 05:27.620
and "!package-lock.json".

58
05:28.390 --> 05:31.930
So I think that's it. we can write out task now and try it out.

59
05:31.930 --> 05:47.520
So let's create a new task. So "export const compress" and  "return

60
05:49.990 --> 05:55.800
gulp.src" andthen our paths that we've just created.

61
05:55.950 --> 06:06.520
So "paths.package.src". And then we'll pipe the zip plugin  that we installed.

62
06:06.520 --> 06:10.680
So "zip" and it takes as an argument the name for the zip file.

63
06:10.690 --> 06:14.160
So in our case we need it to be the name of the our theme. So.

64
06:14.440 --> 06:20.970
So "firsttheme.zip" and then we pipe it to the destination.

65
06:20.970 --> 06:33.160
So "gulp.dest" and "paths.package.dest".

66
06:34.010 --> 06:38.640
So let's try out this task now.

67
06:39.350 --> 06:41.880
So "gulp compress".

68
06:47.660 --> 06:55.660
And let's see now we have the packaged folder inside of it firsttheme.zip. Let's unzip it and make sure everything

69
06:55.660 --> 06:56.910
is fine.

70
06:57.460 --> 07:02.710
And as expected we only have the files and folders that we need.

71
07:05.280 --> 07:08.000
All right, so let's now do one more thing.

72
07:08.780 --> 07:13.560
Probably when you want to bundle your theme for production for users you will have to build first,

73
07:13.710 --> 07:16.470
compile your files before zipping the file, right?

74
07:17.390 --> 07:29.020
So let's create a new task here that will do that. So "export const bundle" and this will run

75
07:31.990 --> 07:32.980
serial tasks.

76
07:32.980 --> 07:36.990
The first one will be "build" which is this one.

77
07:36.990 --> 07:42.390
So we will "clean" and run the "styles","copy", "images" etc.

78
07:42.850 --> 07:49.320
And then when it's done "compress". Great. So let's run it.

79
07:49.450 --> 07:51.410
Make sure it's working. "gulp"

80
07:54.160 --> 07:55.720
Let's do something.

81
07:55.850 --> 08:04.460
Remember the  NPM scripts here when you bundle the theme we also want to put the production

82
08:04.460 --> 08:05.020
flag.

83
08:05.080 --> 08:11.260
So instead of typing this in the command line maybe you can, you may forget it. Let's create a new NPM

84
08:11.270 --> 08:17.930
task and call it "bundle". And it will run "gulp bundle" with the production flag.

85
08:17.930 --> 08:29.430
Now let's run instead of "gulp bundle", lets run "npm bundle". Sorry, "npm run bundle".

86
08:29.860 --> 08:33.380
So it run all of our tasks and the compress task.

87
08:33.690 --> 08:37.000
Let's do the final thing for this section in the next lecture.
