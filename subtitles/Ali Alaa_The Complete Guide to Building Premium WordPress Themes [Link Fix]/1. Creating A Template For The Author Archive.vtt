00:02.140 --> 00:09.310
So in this section we'll add some templates in our theme that are still missing and they are also required.

1
00:09.750 --> 00:13.200
So right now we have the archive.php.

2
00:13.470 --> 00:20.260
We also have the index.php which will be the fallback for any missing template. We also have the single.php

3
00:20.270 --> 00:23.310
which will be used for single blog posts.

4
00:23.310 --> 00:24.540
So let's take a look at,

5
00:24.870 --> 00:27.020
remember this chart here.

6
00:27.150 --> 00:32.370
We now have the archieve.php and the archieve.php will be used for the Author Archive,

7
00:32.550 --> 00:38.600
Category Archieve, Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies and we'll see this in a saperate section.

8
00:38.670 --> 00:41.550
Also the Date Archives and Tag Archives.

9
00:41.970 --> 00:46.770
So I've added some widgets here to display the categories and tags.

10
00:47.040 --> 00:55.230
So if we go to a category we'll find this template being used. And this template is archive.php.

11
00:55.340 --> 00:59.540
So you are displaying the archive title and that's what's being displayed here.

12
00:59.660 --> 01:02.160
And for a tag it will be different.

13
01:02.160 --> 01:09.240
And also for a time archive or a month archive. So if you want to create a separate template for the category

14
01:09.240 --> 01:20.320
archive or the tag archive or the monthly archives, you can use category.php and date.php and tag.php.

15
01:20.550 --> 01:22.820
But I think you can do this by yourself if you would like.

16
01:22.970 --> 01:26.270
Let's now see the Author Archive.

17
01:26.820 --> 01:34.490
So here we can click on author and we'll have an author archive. And currently this also uses the archive.php

18
01:34.780 --> 01:40.550
We have the archive title and the archive description. And the archive description will display the author info

19
01:40.620 --> 01:47.250
if it's an author archive or it'll display the category description. So in the backend we can go to Post

20
01:47.250 --> 01:54.530
Categories and add a description for each category. So that what will be displayed by the archive description.

21
01:54.710 --> 01:59.180
But let's say we need the archive for the author to be a little bit different.

22
01:59.220 --> 02:01.900
We need to display more information about the author.

23
02:02.020 --> 02:04.590
We would like to make it kind a like a profile for the author.

24
02:04.590 --> 02:08.680
So let's create a separate template for the author.

25
02:08.680 --> 02:18.130
So I'm gonna create a file called author.php. And let's save. And now we'll have a blank page here.

26
02:18.190 --> 02:20.600
So let's start coding the author.php.

27
02:20.700 --> 02:24.530
So what we need to do now is we need, let's copy of the archive.php.

28
02:24.650 --> 02:33.120
It will be a kind of the same but we'll have to modify it a little. So let's copy the archive and paste

29
02:33.120 --> 02:36.520
it in the author.php.

30
02:36.520 --> 02:45.920
So what I would like to do is remove the sidebar. So let's remove this and I'm gonna copy this row or column.

31
02:46.820 --> 02:55.670
And I'm gonna put it before the posts. And inside this column we'll have the author info. So let's take a look.

32
03:00.070 --> 03:02.920
And we'll also have to remove this.

33
03:07.730 --> 03:14.230
So we'll have the author info in this sidebar on the right or in the left. And on right we have the

34
03:14.230 --> 03:22.630
posts for this author, right? And we won't have to change anything in the loop. We'll just have

35
03:22.630 --> 03:27.540
to change this to "author". Remember why we do that.

36
03:27.540 --> 03:30.870
If loop-author is found in your theme file it will be used.

37
03:30.870 --> 03:37.770
If not then loop.php will be used. And this is to give the child theme developers the chance to write

38
03:37.770 --> 03:40.690
a custom loop just for the author page, right?

39
03:40.770 --> 03:42.810
We also have to remove this condition here.

40
03:42.820 --> 03:47.700
You don't have a sidebar anymore. So this will always be 8.

41
03:48.210 --> 03:54.750
And now let's display the information about the author. And I did something like that in the single page when we

42
03:54.750 --> 03:56.030
display the author info.

43
03:56.310 --> 03:57.600
But now you are in a

44
03:57.960 --> 03:59.000
author archive.

45
03:59.130 --> 04:03.830
How to get the current author is by using the query var in the URL.

46
04:04.320 --> 04:11.840
So I'm not sure if we mentioned this before but in the WordPress settings you can choose, go to Permalinks and

47
04:11.840 --> 04:18.700
you can choose a Pretty permalink or you can choose the Plain permalink the default one. So let's save now.

48
04:19.030 --> 04:26.510
And let's now go to the home page and let's click on the author again.

49
04:26.520 --> 04:32.340
Now what we have in the URL is a query parameter here and the ID of the author.

50
04:32.750 --> 04:36.590
So how to get this is by using a function called get_query_var().

51
04:36.780 --> 04:44.260
So let's open a PHP tag here and get all the information we need and then we will use in below.

52
04:44.300 --> 04:49.310
So we'll get the author ID and get_query_var().

53
04:52.160 --> 04:54.640
And ours is called "author", this one.

54
04:54.650 --> 04:59.220
So let's copy this. And now we have the ID of the author.

55
04:59.570 --> 05:05.060
So why don't we go to template-parts/single/author.php

56
05:05.210 --> 05:13.500
I just copy some of the information here. And let's paste but have to change some of it because here when

57
05:13.540 --> 05:18.900
we used this function we were inside the loop. But now we are not inside the loop so some of this function

58
05:18.900 --> 05:22.110
will require to supply the ID.

59
05:22.170 --> 05:32.700
So for example the website, we have to supply the ID, also the description and get_the_author() will not work in this case.

60
05:32.820 --> 05:42.460
So we'll have to get it another way using get_the_author_meta(). And the field is called "display_name".

61
05:44.630 --> 05:50.080
And we don't need the URL in this case because we are actually inside this URL.

62
05:50.330 --> 05:56.890
And finally the number of posts and this function also will work inside the loop, so we can use another function

63
05:56.900 --> 06:05.070
called count_user_posts(). And it takes the user ID.

64
06:06.170 --> 06:12.850
So let's now use the information that we got in this sidebar. So let's create a HEADER tag and the first we need

65
06:12.860 --> 06:13.630
the avatar.

66
06:13.770 --> 06:17.560
So let's open PHP and "echo get".

67
06:17.980 --> 06:22.320
Sorry "get_avatar()".

68
06:22.470 --> 06:24.950
And it needs the author ID.

69
06:27.030 --> 06:30.560
And the "size" and we can ignore all the others.

70
06:30.650 --> 06:36.210
So let's say 128. And now let's add an H1 tag.

71
06:36.580 --> 06:40.290
So this will be the main title for the page which will be the author name.

72
06:40.290 --> 06:41.070
Right?

73
06:41.270 --> 06:44.990
And I'm also gonna give it a "margin-bottom" is in the one of my classes.

74
06:45.060 --> 06:48.740
So "u-margin", "margin-top" sorry. 

75
06:48.780 --> 06:56.370
Let's also had BOLD tags so that the name will be more significant in the page. And let's now open PHP tags

76
06:56.430 --> 06:58.500
and display the name.

77
06:58.590 --> 07:01.390
So let's "echo esc_html()".

78
07:01.680 --> 07:05.010
And then the $author_display.

79
07:09.130 --> 07:15.250
So let's see now. And we now have the avatar and the author name.

80
07:15.900 --> 07:18.760
And now we need to display the number of posts.

81
07:19.190 --> 07:24.710
So why don't we copy this from here because it will be a lot of typing the _n() and that kind

82
07:24.710 --> 07:25.360
of stuff.

83
07:25.430 --> 07:32.970
So let's copy this. And let's paste it here. And I don't think we will have to change anything here.

84
07:33.350 --> 07:38.700
Yes, of course you can always type the translator comment.

85
07:38.750 --> 07:48.300
So maybe "%s is the number of posts" and let's make sure it's fine.

86
07:48.900 --> 07:53.160
And "3 posts". And then we need to display the website.

87
07:53.520 --> 08:04.960
So let's open PHP and check that we have a website first. And if so let's output an A tag and why don't we

88
08:05.850 --> 08:10.190
copy this. And it will be the same.

89
08:10.380 --> 08:18.080
We don't have to type it again. And close the A tag and then inside of it we'll have to echo the 

90
08:18.100 --> 08:19.830
website.

91
08:20.270 --> 08:26.550
So let's "echo esc_html()" and then $author_website.

92
08:26.680 --> 08:28.780
So let's take a look.

93
08:29.230 --> 08:31.060
And now we have the website.

94
08:31.310 --> 08:32.100
But let's echo

95
08:32.120 --> 08:35.870
let's output a line break here.

96
08:37.940 --> 08:40.970
All right. Let's finally output the author description.

97
08:41.060 --> 08:43.250
So I wanna P tag with a class

98
08:43.250 --> 08:44.630
"c-post

99
08:44.750 --> 08:52.100
"c-post-author__description" and let's echo and escape the description.

100
08:55.630 --> 08:56.670
Let's take a look.

101
08:58.270 --> 09:03.730
And fine. I also have a class that wraps after the H1 that wraps

102
09:03.730 --> 09:05.110
the website and the number of posts.

103
09:05.200 --> 09:08.730
I think that will just improve the styling a bit.

104
09:09.610 --> 09:16.140
And it's called "c-post-author__info". And let's add some spacing and stuff like that.

105
09:16.200 --> 09:17.870
So I think that will be it for the author.

106
09:18.210 --> 09:22.980
Let's see now what other templates are required to create before publishing the theme.

107
09:23.000 --> 09:23.870
So see you in the next lecture.
