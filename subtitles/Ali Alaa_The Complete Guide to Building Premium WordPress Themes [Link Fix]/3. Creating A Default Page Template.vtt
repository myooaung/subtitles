00:03.360 --> 00:07.860
Let's now create a template that will be responsible for displaying pages. So right now

1
00:07.860 --> 00:11.120
pages are falling back to index.php.

2
00:11.520 --> 00:22.830
So let's now go and create a file called page.php. So page.php will be responsible for displaying single pages.

3
00:22.830 --> 00:29.010
It's kind a like single.php for posts. So in single.php we get some options from the

4
00:29.340 --> 00:35.930
custom fields remember. And that would be responsible for the layout of the page. But in pages

5
00:36.150 --> 00:37.770
this will be a little bit different.

6
00:37.770 --> 00:40.070
So let's copy this to be kind of similar.

7
00:40.770 --> 00:42.490
But let's now remove these options.

8
00:45.620 --> 00:52.030
And let's also remove this. And we don't have to use the option here.

9
00:52.070 --> 00:54.080
So let's make it 8.

10
00:54.550 --> 00:56.470
And also for the sidebar.

11
00:56.980 --> 00:58.810
Let's always display it.

12
00:59.330 --> 01:05.920
So of course here you can check is_active_sidebar() and change the layout depending on whether the sidebar is active

13
01:05.930 --> 01:06.670
or not.

14
01:06.750 --> 01:08.720
But let's just keep it simple for now.

15
01:08.810 --> 01:11.460
We'll assume that the sidebar is always active.

16
01:11.900 --> 01:22.040
So what we need to change here is the get_template_part(), "loop" and "single". This will go to loop-single which is here and it will

17
01:22.040 --> 01:26.260
display a lot of information that only concerns the post.

18
01:26.270 --> 01:33.220
We don't need all that. So let's create a separate template part for the page. So let's say "loop" "page".

19
01:33.560 --> 01:35.210
And let's create 

20
01:35.510 --> 01:36.290
loop-page here.

21
01:40.740 --> 01:44.120
And let's actually also copy this and we'll see what we need.

22
01:44.160 --> 01:46.760
And we and what we don't need here.

23
01:47.160 --> 01:52.540
So we don't need the "author_info". We don't need the "post_navigation".

24
01:53.130 --> 01:56.150
We do need the "comments", pages can also have comments.

25
01:56.450 --> 01:59.720
We also need the content but we need to create another template part for the

26
01:59.970 --> 02:01.960
page content. So right now

27
02:02.010 --> 02:08.880
it's post and content so it will go template-parts/post and content. And here we have a lot of information.

28
02:09.330 --> 02:12.410
We don't need all of that information in the page.

29
02:12.420 --> 02:20.160
So let's create a new folder in the template-parts and call it page. And inside of it let's create a new file,

30
02:20.560 --> 02:26.230
content. And that will be the content for a page.

31
02:26.280 --> 02:35.890
So here in the loop-page we'll change this to "page" and let's start filling this content.php.

32
02:36.370 --> 02:42.520
So we will also need an ARTICLE tag. Let's copy it from here instead of typing.

33
02:42.580 --> 02:51.710
We will however have to change the "c-post" class here and make it "page".

34
02:51.820 --> 02:55.950
So what we want to display in a page is just the title and the content.

35
02:56.190 --> 03:05.870
So let's open a HEADER tag with a class of "c-page__header" and this will contain

36
03:05.870 --> 03:07.030
the title of the page.

37
03:07.040 --> 03:19.480
So in an H1 tag with a class of, sorry, "c-page__title". And we'll just

38
03:19.860 --> 03:20.710
display the title.

39
03:24.810 --> 03:33.860
We don't need any arguments here. And then we'll have another DIV with a class "c-page__

40
03:33.860 --> 03:42.440
"c-page__content". And inside of this one we will just display the content.

41
03:45.770 --> 03:48.700
We also don't need any arguments here.

42
03:50.250 --> 03:54.700
So let's save now and see our page.

43
03:55.010 --> 03:57.920
And as you can see we have the page title and the content.

44
03:58.160 --> 03:59.860
And we also have the sidebar.

45
04:00.140 --> 04:08.530
So let's say we need to do something like what we did for the single.php. In the single.php

46
04:08.650 --> 04:14.740
we had some custom fields that will decide the layout of the single blog post, right?

47
04:15.440 --> 04:24.020
So here in the backend when we create a post or edit a post we'll have these fields. In pages

48
04:24.020 --> 04:29.900
we can also add custom fields the same way like we did for the posts.

49
04:29.900 --> 04:34.340
However there is a default functionality in WordPress called page templates.

50
04:34.340 --> 04:39.070
So using page templates we can have multiple templates for pages without having to create custom fields

51
04:39.080 --> 04:41.470
and then getting the field value here.

52
04:41.780 --> 04:43.760
It will be much easier than that.

53
04:43.760 --> 04:45.380
So to see how to do that in the next section.
