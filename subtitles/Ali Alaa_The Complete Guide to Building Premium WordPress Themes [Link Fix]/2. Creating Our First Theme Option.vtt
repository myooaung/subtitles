0
00:02.240 --> 00:05.120
So let's add our first option.

1
00:05.230 --> 00:07.460
Let's have simple one. So

2
00:08.250 --> 00:13.290
let's add the footer text, this one. And let's actually remove this long widget.

3
00:20.550 --> 00:26.510
So to add a setting we will use a method in the wp_customize class called add_setting().

4
00:26.680 --> 00:31.870
So let's do that let's go to the customize.php.

5
00:32.500 --> 00:39.090
And then let's use $wp_customize class and the add_setting() method.

6
00:42.070 --> 00:45.360
And then the first argument is an ID for this setting.

7
00:45.640 --> 00:47.680
So this also should be prefixed

8
00:50.680 --> 00:58.580
and let's call it "site_info". And the second argument is an array of options for this setting.

9
00:59.040 --> 01:03.580
So if you took a look here you can read about all the different options that you can put here.

10
01:03.570 --> 01:08.060
So we have the type. It could be "theme_mod" or "option". And you can read about the difference here.

11
01:08.070 --> 01:14.560
But to summarize the difference is option can be used regardless what the currently active theme is.

12
01:14.720 --> 01:20.850
However theme_mod is only used by the current active theme. So usually we will use see theme_mod and the

13
01:20.850 --> 01:27.060
option is meant to be used by plugins more than themes. And theme_mod is the default option so we won't have

14
01:27.060 --> 01:28.800
to add it every time.

15
01:29.100 --> 01:34.580
And we have some others as well but let's just start by the important ones first which is the "default"

16
01:34.620 --> 01:36.390
value.

17
01:37.710 --> 01:43.230
So this is the default value for this field and in our case let's set it to an empty string.

18
01:43.380 --> 01:48.280
And the other important one is "sanitize_callback".

19
01:51.450 --> 01:56.980
And this should be a function name and this function will run before the value is saved to the database

20
01:56.980 --> 01:59.060
in order to make sure it's sanitized.

21
01:59.250 --> 02:05.330
So this will take function and this function could be one of the built in WordPress sanitization functions. So

22
02:05.350 --> 02:12.200
let's.

23
02:12.410 --> 02:18.070
So it could be one of these or you can define your own function and put the name there. And we'll do

24
02:18.400 --> 02:21.340
both cases throughout this section.

25
02:21.580 --> 02:25.220
But for now let's assume thesite info text will just be a text field.

26
02:25.300 --> 02:32.890
So we can use "sanitize_text_field". So "sanitize_text_"field".

27
02:33.180 --> 02:40.130
So now we have our setting. But the setting is useless it has the control to control it.

28
02:40.130 --> 02:42.620
So let's add a control now for this setting.

29
02:43.220 --> 02:46.730
So using the same class and a method called add_control().

30
02:49.530 --> 02:53.220
And the first argument is, should match the idea of the setting.

31
02:53.840 --> 02:54.850
So let's copy that.

32
02:54.880 --> 03:01.900
And the second argument is also an array of some options that we can provide to the control.

33
03:01.890 --> 03:12.520
So the most important one is the "type". And this should be an HTML input type like a text or a number

34
03:12.530 --> 03:19.940
or select or checkbox. And you can find all the different ones in the link I put in the lecture links.

35
03:20.050 --> 03:29.380
So in this case we'll need a text field and can also add a "label". Make sure all your labels and any

36
03:29.380 --> 03:31.440
text is escaped and translated.

37
03:31.510 --> 03:32.020
So

38
03:35.450 --> 03:40.640
let's call it "Site Info" and our domain.

39
03:44.310 --> 03:47.590
And finally takes the "section".

40
03:47.650 --> 03:55.050
So remember in the last lecture we mentioned that controls exist in sections.

41
03:55.330 --> 03:56.640
These ones.

42
03:56.700 --> 03:59.300
So these are the controls and these are sections.

43
03:59.300 --> 04:03.910
So we need to choose either one of these sections to add our control in or create a new section and

44
04:03.910 --> 04:10.210
add it in it. So let's start by choosing one of these sections. So if you know the ID for these sections,

45
04:10.210 --> 04:11.600
we have a table here,

46
04:12.280 --> 04:18.430
this one. And these are all the core sections that exists in WordPress core and their priority and we'll talk

47
04:18.430 --> 04:20.210
about the priority in a moment.

48
04:20.290 --> 04:26.500
And you'll notice that there are some sections that do not appear here. And that's because they exist

49
04:26.620 --> 04:29.920
in the WordPress core but they don't have any controls.

50
04:30.010 --> 04:35.470
So if a section does not have any controls it won't appear. The first section which is the Site Identity

51
04:35.950 --> 04:36.870
is this one.

52
04:36.880 --> 04:38.280
"Site Title & Tagline".

53
04:38.550 --> 04:39.290
So let's copy

54
04:39.290 --> 04:48.200
its ID. And let's put our control in this section. And we have some extra brackets here.

55
04:48.720 --> 04:55.500
So let's now save and see if our field is added. Let's refresh.

56
04:58.350 --> 05:04.640
So let's see the Site Identity and we now have a Site Info text field. Great, so let's just remove the

57
05:04.750 --> 05:06.260
widget again.

58
05:06.280 --> 05:07.750
I forgot to save it.

59
05:11.410 --> 05:13.420
Any time you do something you should publish.

60
05:13.580 --> 05:16.490
So let's now create a new section.

61
05:16.490 --> 05:17.620
And add our field in.

62
05:17.750 --> 05:25.110
So we will create a new section called "Footer Settings" or something and then we'll add our section in our control in.

63
05:25.760 --> 05:27.240
So let's do that.

64
05:27.740 --> 05:37.310
And similarly we will use a method in the wp_customize class and it's called add_section().

65
05:40.430 --> 05:45.470
And it takes an ID. So let's call it "footer_options"

66
05:48.510 --> 05:52.080
"footer_options" and an array.

67
05:52.680 --> 05:55.360
And here we can define a title for this section.

68
05:55.470 --> 06:08.750
So escape and translate. And let's call it "Footer Options" and text domain. And we can also have a description.

69
06:13.410 --> 06:22.270
So could be some text like "You can change footer options from here".

70
06:25.350 --> 06:26.700
And text domain.

71
06:26.710 --> 06:36.220
So let's save now and before saving let's just copy the ID that we chose here and put it in the site info 

72
06:36.220 --> 06:40.280
control. And let's now

73
06:40.600 --> 06:43.620
see.

74
06:43.750 --> 06:48.210
So we have Footer Options and inside of it we have the Site Info.

75
06:48.230 --> 06:52.010
So you might be asking how to change the order of these sections.

76
06:52.730 --> 06:57.520
And the answer is this priority here will determine which section will appear first.

77
06:57.530 --> 06:59.790
So we have all the default priorities.

78
06:59.840 --> 07:06.150
So the "Site Title & Tagline" is 20 and the second one which is the "Menus" is 100.

79
07:06.170 --> 07:10.960
So let's say we want to the Footer Section to be between the 20 and the 100.

80
07:11.030 --> 07:13.820
So what we can do is add a priority here.

81
07:17.510 --> 07:25.940
And choose the number like 30.

82
07:26.250 --> 07:28.290
And now we have it as the second section.

83
07:33.390 --> 07:36.620
So great we have our option now and we can control it.

84
07:36.630 --> 07:42.510
So let's now use it in our actual theme. So let's go to the "template-parts/footer/" and the site info

85
07:42.550 --> 07:48.960
or info.php. And instead of these hard coded texts, let's now fetch the setting from the database

86
07:50.010 --> 07:52.420
and display it in the footer.

87
07:52.420 --> 08:02.510
So let's create a variable called $site_info. And to get an option you can use either get_option() or get_theme_mod().

88
08:02.580 --> 08:10.820
So in our case our setting type is theme_mod so we will use get_theme_mode() and then simply just give it the ID

89
08:14.190 --> 08:15.920
of the setting.

90
08:17.400 --> 08:22.830
And the second argument, which is important, which is a default value. And it should match the default

91
08:22.830 --> 08:26.380
value that we assigned here.

92
08:27.330 --> 08:29.030
So it's an empty string.

93
08:29.340 --> 08:33.860
And then take this variable and display it here.

94
08:34.770 --> 08:43.590
But remember that any value that comes from the database should be escaped. So let's "echo esc_html" and 

95
08:43.920 --> 08:45.540
our value.

96
08:45.570 --> 08:46.590
So let's see now.

97
08:51.390 --> 08:52.970
So the default value is an empty string.

98
08:53.190 --> 09:00.400
And as you can see it displays an empty space here. So let's do like we did with the footer widget. Let's only display

99
09:00.400 --> 09:04.180
this DIV only if we have a value.

100
09:04.200 --> 09:07.710
So "if ($site_info)".

101
09:14.870 --> 09:21.340
So let's refresh. And now we don't have anything here. And let's now add a value.

102
09:27.410 --> 09:34.160
And now we have it. As you can see it's refreshing the whole iframe just for this part.

103
09:34.200 --> 09:36.750
So we will tackle this later.

104
09:36.960 --> 09:42.120
But let's now tackle another problem first which is adding HTML here.

105
09:42.270 --> 09:44.310
So you're coding sanitize_

106
09:46.950 --> 09:51.420
tex_field() before saving to the database and that will strip any HTML.

107
09:51.540 --> 09:55.950
And you're also escaping the value in the actual HTML file.

108
09:56.310 --> 10:01.810
So if you type any HTML here. So you know it's very common to put a link here.

109
10:02.790 --> 10:04.350
And if we did so

110
10:07.180 --> 10:10.210
it won't be a link. It will just be text.

111
10:10.250 --> 10:17.850
And if we save and refresh. It's actually saved in the database as text.

112
10:17.860 --> 10:19.500
So let's tackle that in the next lecture.

113
10:19.640 --> 10:25.670
So we will try to create a custom sanitization function instead sanitize_text_field().

114
10:25.670 --> 10:30.540
We will create a function that will allow some HTML to pass while removing any other HTML.

115
10:30.770 --> 10:32.090
So see you in the next lecture.
