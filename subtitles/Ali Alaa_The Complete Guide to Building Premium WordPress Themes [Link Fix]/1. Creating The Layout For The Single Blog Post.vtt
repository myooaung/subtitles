00:02.570 --> 00:07.300
This section we'll deal with what to be displayed in the single blog page.

1
00:07.400 --> 00:15.220
So when you click on a blog post we will create a template for this page. And this template will display information

2
00:15.220 --> 00:22.810
about this post. So that the post thumbnail and the content of course and will also display the categories

3
00:22.810 --> 00:24.130
and tags.

4
00:24.130 --> 00:31.620
And finally we will display information about the author of this post. And we'll also add posts navigation.

5
00:32.020 --> 00:39.040
And by post navigation I mean we'll add a couple of links after the post to go to the next or previous posts.

6
00:39.040 --> 00:46.530
So first let's remember in the child theme we added a filter to limit the number of posts here to 2.

7
00:46.910 --> 00:50.880
Let's remove that before we start.

8
00:50.970 --> 00:58.300
So let's add our child theme to the workspace. And

9
01:01.130 --> 01:03.400
let's remove this filter.

10
01:06.460 --> 01:12.110
And now we have our posts normally. So let's go now to one of the posts.

11
01:12.110 --> 01:20.180
Let's say this one. And right now we don't have a single.php file and to display this post WordPress

12
01:20.180 --> 01:23.700
is falling back to index.php.

13
01:24.050 --> 01:24.740
So

14
01:28.590 --> 01:33.730
what you're seeing here now is outputted by index.php.

15
01:33.950 --> 01:44.120
So let's copy what's in index.php and let's create a new file called single.php. Let's now paste.

16
01:45.460 --> 01:49.750
And we need to use the same layout the rows and columns.

17
01:49.870 --> 01:56.520
So in the index we decided that we will have a sidebar or not by checking is_active_sidebar(). But 

18
01:56.550 --> 02:02.170
now in the single we'll have another factor to decide that which is the custom field that we created in the last

19
02:02.170 --> 02:09.340
section. So here we will not only need to check if is_active_sidebar( 'primary-sidebar' ), we also need to get

20
02:09.610 --> 02:14.660
the option whether the layout is a full layout or layout with a sidebar.

21
02:15.190 --> 02:20.480
So let's remove this for now and let's hardcode it to 8.

22
02:20.690 --> 02:22.580
And also let's remove this condition.

23
02:28.560 --> 02:34.430
And we'll deal with this condition in a moment but let's now deal with the get_template_part() loop index.

24
02:34.430 --> 02:39.170
So this will go and get loop.php.

25
02:39.350 --> 02:44.830
So the loop.php will display the pagination for example and we don't need that in a single blog

26
02:44.830 --> 02:45.570
page.

27
02:45.590 --> 02:49.140
So you can do and if condition here if not single don't display it.

28
02:49.160 --> 02:56.810
But let's just copy this and instead of calling this template let's paste and let's remove what we

29
02:56.930 --> 02:58.560
don't need.

30
02:59.470 --> 03:05.350
And that's because the single.php will contain a lot of information other than the normal loop.

31
03:05.360 --> 03:11.340
So instead of modifying this loop.php let's create everything here from scratch.

32
03:11.450 --> 03:16.140
So we don't need the pagination. We don't need the pagination action.

33
03:16.460 --> 03:23.390
However everything else we still of course need to call the posts. And we need to get the content as well.

34
03:23.450 --> 03:29.540
I know the content right now is, it's in template-parts and then post and content.

35
03:29.560 --> 03:35.180
So I know it's currently displaying the excerpt and and we don't need that we need to display the contents and maybe

36
03:35.180 --> 03:42.270
other stuff. But we'll deal with this in a moment. Let's just in this section focus on the layout.

37
03:42.320 --> 03:46.570
And right now nothing will be different yet. We're still displaying the same content.

38
03:46.880 --> 03:52.650
But let's now get the option, the layout option for a single blog post.

39
03:52.790 --> 03:59.030
And we also get the is_active_sidebar( 'primary-sidebar' ) and appending on these two we will decide whether

40
03:59.030 --> 04:01.240
to display a sidebar or not.

41
04:01.290 --> 04:02.680
So let's open a PHP tag here.

42
04:05.180 --> 04:11.300
And let's define a variable $layout and this will be get_post_meta().

43
04:18.140 --> 04:30.640
And the "id", get_the_ID() and the "key" will be I think we call it "_themename_post_layout". And we'll make sure

44
04:30.670 --> 04:31.160
now.

45
04:31.330 --> 04:39.170
And the "single", we'll set it to "true". So let's var_dump() this to make sure we have the right key.

46
04:43.910 --> 04:51.870
So right now we have an empty string. And that's because, let's go to wp-admin, and that's because we've

47
04:51.870 --> 04:56.140
never saved the metaboxes for this post.

48
04:56.460 --> 04:57.080
So

49
05:00.160 --> 05:03.550
let's go to post and this one.

50
05:03.890 --> 05:07.790
So we defined these fields but we never updated this post,

51
05:07.790 --> 05:09.170
this particular post.

52
05:09.620 --> 05:11.570
So that's why it's returning an empty string.

53
05:11.750 --> 05:14.860
So actually we need to handle a default value for this field.

54
05:14.980 --> 05:16.390
But let's now try and save it.

55
05:19.750 --> 05:23.610
And let's refresh. And we probably have the wrong key.

56
05:23.620 --> 05:24.110
All right.

57
05:24.150 --> 05:32.130
So we have two "_" here remember? And now if we save and refresh, we'll have "full".

58
05:32.300 --> 05:42.330
But now let's go to the index again and let's go to a post that we haven't saved these metafields for yet. And we

59
05:42.410 --> 05:43.910
still have an empty string.

60
05:43.910 --> 05:47.950
So when we get this field we need to check if this is false or an empty string.

61
05:48.080 --> 05:50.340
We need to have a default value,

62
05:50.360 --> 05:51.190
right?

63
05:51.200 --> 05:55.470
So we can simply write in if condition or a ternary expression here.

64
05:55.550 --> 06:00.720
So if $layout then $layout otherwise a default value.

65
06:01.160 --> 06:06.480
But why don't we create a helper function instead of every time we get a field

66
06:06.740 --> 06:08.910
we write an if condition like that?

67
06:09.150 --> 06:14.270
Why don't we write a helper function that will take a default value and return it

68
06:14.300 --> 06:22.070
if the post have no value for this field? So let's go to lib/helpers.php.

69
06:23.040 --> 06:24.250
Let's create a new function.

70
06:24.290 --> 06:25.590
Let's call it

71
06:29.360 --> 06:29.720
"_theme_meta()"

72
06:32.720 --> 06:40.850
"_theme_meta()". And this function will take exactly like this function, the ID and the key. And maybe you can skip

73
06:40.850 --> 06:47.270
this "true" and always defaulted to "true" because we probably will set this is "true" every time.

74
06:47.270 --> 06:50.900
So let's make the third argument the default value.

75
06:51.110 --> 06:52.970
So we'll have the $id

76
06:55.640 --> 07:01.960
and the $key and $default.

77
07:02.050 --> 07:05.350
And now what we're gonna do is we're gonna call this function

78
07:08.450 --> 07:09.440
with the $id

79
07:14.400 --> 07:18.890
and the $key and "true" always.

80
07:19.020 --> 07:27.800
And let's put this in a variable. And then we have to check "if (!$value)", if $value is "false"

81
07:27.800 --> 07:30.710
or empty string or whatever any false value.

82
07:31.170 --> 07:43.390
And also if we have a default value, if we defined the default value, we need to return the $default value.

83
07:43.510 --> 07:49.000
Otherwise we will return the $value.

84
07:49.810 --> 07:51.790
So let's now use this function

85
07:51.820 --> 07:59.350
instead of get_post_meta() here. And it's this "true" will have a default value. Let's say the default value will

86
07:59.350 --> 08:09.700
be full. Let's save now and we'll have "full" in this post that returned an empty string before.

87
08:10.150 --> 08:13.770
And we have "full" here because it's full. But let's try and change it.

88
08:17.930 --> 08:20.380
And it's now "sidebar".

89
08:23.320 --> 08:23.620
Great.

90
08:23.620 --> 08:25.270
So what we need to do next

91
08:25.290 --> 08:33.910
is we need to create a new variable. Let's call it $sidebar. And this variable will be a boolean and it will check if the primary 

92
08:33.910 --> 08:36.270
sidebar is active.

93
08:36.530 --> 08:39.050
So "is_active_sidebar( 'primary-

94
08:42.000 --> 08:45.380
sidebar')".

95
08:45.490 --> 08:52.210
So before using the $sidebar variable let's now, I'm gonna add a class here that I'm gonna use

96
08:52.210 --> 09:01.650
for styling. Let's call "o-single-post-" and then open PHP and then echo

97
09:01.710 --> 09:07.150
the $layout. So I'm gonna style the layout differently according to "full" or "sidebar".

98
09:07.900 --> 09:10.180
So that's why I had this class.

99
09:10.510 --> 09:13.130
Also we need to change this 8.

100
09:13.180 --> 09:24.360
It will be either 8 or 12 depending on the layout. So let's remove the 8 and open PHP. And a condition will be, we'll echo

101
09:25.710 --> 09:38.220
and then a ternary expression. If "$layout=== 'sidebar'", it will be 8, otherwise12.

102
09:38.390 --> 09:44.500
And then we have to check if the $layout is sidebar,

103
09:51.870 --> 09:53.230
we will display the sidebar.

104
09:53.250 --> 09:57.020
Otherwise we will display nothing.

105
10:05.000 --> 10:06.740
So let's see now.

106
10:07.790 --> 10:10.970
So we have a "sidebar" option in this post.

107
10:10.990 --> 10:12.020
Let's change it to "full".

108
10:15.300 --> 10:18.720
And now it's "full". Let's chage this to "sidebar" again.

109
10:19.620 --> 10:24.480
And it now will have a sidebar, but what if the sidebar not active.

110
10:24.480 --> 10:27.480
So let's go to Appearance and Widgets.

111
10:30.520 --> 10:34.930
And in the Primary Sidebar let's remove all the widgets

112
10:40.130 --> 10:42.680
And let's refresh and we'll have this.

113
10:42.680 --> 10:50.110
So this may be fine with you but maybe it's much better to if the sidebar is not active to fall

114
10:50.150 --> 10:53.430
back the layout to "full" instead of "sidebar".

115
10:53.590 --> 10:54.130
Right?

116
10:54.140 --> 10:56.320
So that's why I added this variable here.

117
10:56.320 --> 10:58.070
So let's do a quick if condition.

118
10:58.250 --> 11:15.620
So "if ($layout ==='sidebar')" but we don't have a sidebar so, "&& !$sidebar" we will just change the

119
11:15.640 --> 11:23.370
$layout variable to "full" instead of "sidebar".

120
11:23.500 --> 11:28.690
So let's save now and now we have it. Let's now add some widgets.

121
11:34.910 --> 11:36.070
And refresh.

122
11:36.320 --> 11:38.730
And now we have the sidebar again.

123
11:39.210 --> 11:50.420
Let's just final make sure the "full" option is still fine. And it is. So great we're now creating this layout

124
11:50.480 --> 11:56.630
dynamically. Let's now of course as you can notice, we have the excerpt here and we have the "Read More" and

125
11:56.630 --> 11:59.120
we don't need the "Read More" in the single post.

126
11:59.450 --> 12:05.540
So let's in the next lecture we'll go to the content template part and we'll do some if conditions

127
12:05.990 --> 12:13.250
that will display things differently depending on if we are in a single post or we're just in the loop

128
12:13.580 --> 12:15.470
and not in a particular post.

129
12:15.470 --> 12:16.940
So see you in the next lecture.
