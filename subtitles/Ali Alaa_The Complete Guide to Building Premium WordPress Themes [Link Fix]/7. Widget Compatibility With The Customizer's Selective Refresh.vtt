00:03.090 --> 00:09.440
So now that we've finalized our widget. Let's take a look at how it will look like in Customizer.

1
00:09.540 --> 00:12.580
I just want to point out a couple of notes there.

2
00:13.420 --> 00:17.920
So remember we have to use the 8888 port here.

3
00:22.910 --> 00:36.020
So let's Add Widget and search for our widget, "recent" and this one.

4
00:36.130 --> 00:40.170
And as you can see the whole iframe refreshes, right?.

5
00:40.260 --> 00:47.960
But if you had any other widget it won't refresh the whole iframe, it will just add the widget.

6
00:47.960 --> 00:49.610
So what's wrong with our widget?

7
00:49.630 --> 00:52.030
Why is it refreshing the whole iframe.

8
00:52.250 --> 00:59.100
It's just simply because you have to add a, in this array we have to add another key.

9
00:59.540 --> 01:06.380
And this is called "customize_selective_fresh" and set it to "true".

10
01:10.110 --> 01:11.520
So let's refresh.

11
01:15.600 --> 01:27.080
And let's go to Widgets and the Primary. And let's add our widget. And now as you can see it's added without

12
01:27.080 --> 01:30.560
refreshing the whole iframe.

13
01:30.620 --> 01:32.440
So that's the first thing.

14
01:32.750 --> 01:35.720
Let's just delete some of these.

15
01:41.840 --> 01:47.230
And let's assume in our widget we want the posts to be in a slider.

16
01:47.540 --> 01:50.430
We want some JavaScript in our widget.

17
01:50.420 --> 01:58.830
So let's go to the frontend, the widget() function and let's give this container some class.

18
01:58.840 --> 02:07.910
Let's call it  "most_recent_widget" just to initialize a Slick Slider on it.

19
02:07.910 --> 02:10.610
So let's go to our JavaScript.

20
02:10.640 --> 02:15.580
Remember in the src and assets, let's go to bundle.

21
02:16.220 --> 02:23.010
And let's select the widget and put it in slider. Initialize

22
02:23.040 --> 02:33.730
Slick Slider on it. And make sure you have your NPM running. Let's now refresh the normal website not the

23
02:33.730 --> 02:34.750
Customizer.

24
02:34.940 --> 02:38.630
As you can see we have a slider here.

25
02:39.050 --> 02:44.850
That's refresh the Customizer and we have our slider.

26
02:44.890 --> 02:49.590
But let's now try to edit this widget and let's update any value here.

27
02:51.160 --> 02:59.660
And as you can see the slider is gone. And the reason is we apply the Slick Slider once the document is

28
02:59.660 --> 03:00.580
ready.

29
03:00.590 --> 03:04.720
So we apply the Slick Slider to any DIV that has this class

30
03:04.790 --> 03:05.980
when the document is ready.

31
03:05.990 --> 03:06.800
Right?

32
03:06.860 --> 03:09.500
But when we change something here,

33
03:09.520 --> 03:13.320
WordPress will replace this whole widget with a new DIV,

34
03:13.370 --> 03:13.970
right?

35
03:13.970 --> 03:18.290
And this new DIV will not have the Slick Slider applied.

36
03:18.780 --> 03:22.790
So what can we do in order to run some JavaScript function

37
03:22.950 --> 03:29.160
when we update something in our widget? WordPress actually provides some callbacks to do that.

38
03:29.160 --> 03:40.930
So let's go back to the bundle and let's type "wp.customize.selectiveRefresh.bind()" and we'll

39
03:40.930 --> 03:44.300
bind to an event called "partial_content_rendered".

40
03:44.710 --> 03:50.850
So this event will run whenever some partial in your Customizer renders, right?

41
03:50.890 --> 03:53.970
Remember partials and selective refresh and that stuff.

42
03:54.040 --> 03:58.200
So any time when your partial is loaded in your Customizer this event will run.

43
03:58.300 --> 03:59.700
Right?

44
03:59.800 --> 04:00.910
So the second argument

45
04:00.940 --> 04:09.540
it takes is a function. And it receives an argument called "placement".

46
04:10.100 --> 04:16.870
So let's "console.log(placement)" and let's see what we will have,

47
04:17.030 --> 04:17.330
right?

48
04:22.990 --> 04:27.640
So let's open the console and we have an error here.

49
04:27.680 --> 04:33.210
Maybe we have some typo, yeah "selective".

50
04:33.570 --> 04:34.740
So let's refresh again.

51
04:39.600 --> 04:45.490
And let's change something.

52
04:45.630 --> 04:47.410
And as you can see we have something here.

53
04:47.790 --> 04:54.570
So this is the placement variable that we are logging. And it has a lot of information. And the information

54
04:54.570 --> 05:03.250
we need is the "partial" and also the "container". So this event will run for any partial,

55
05:03.280 --> 05:03.780
right?

56
05:03.790 --> 05:08.960
So let's say we change something here in the navigation menu.

57
05:15.330 --> 05:21.120
This partial will run. But we need to make sure that we run some code only for our widget.

58
05:21.150 --> 05:21.420
Right?

59
05:21.420 --> 05:32.390
So how do we check that? Let's open the "partial" and "widgetIdParts" and "idBase". And this will be the ID

60
05:32.480 --> 05:33.260
of our widget.

61
05:33.260 --> 05:42.960
So apparently we have a typo in the here, in the name of the widget here. But let's just keep it like so for now.

62
05:43.660 --> 05:47.680
So let's open the other one, for the navigation menu, and the "partial".

63
05:48.280 --> 05:56.350
And it won't even have a key called "widgetIdParts". So what we'll have to do in our $ script is we will have to

64
05:56.350 --> 06:04.870
check inside of the "partials", if we have a key called "widgetIdParts" and this "widgetIdParts" has an "idBase"

65
06:05.080 --> 06:06.550
of our widget name,

66
06:06.550 --> 06:11.920
we will run some code. So let's write some if conditions. So

67
06:16.870 --> 06:26.720
"if (placement.partial.widgetIdParts".

68
06:26.810 --> 06:29.410
So if we have this key

69
06:32.310 --> 06:37.280
and this key ".idBase"

70
06:40.430 --> 06:43.670
is equals to our widget ID which is this,

71
06:47.850 --> 06:49.740
we'll have to run some code, right?

72
06:49.780 --> 06:57.330
So let's make sure this if condition is working. So let's save and refresh. And lets

73
07:00.790 --> 07:02.300
change something here.

74
07:04.390 --> 07:11.900
And we have our text. Lets try to change something in the navigation menu or any thing that has partials

75
07:11.920 --> 07:12.160
here.

76
07:14.980 --> 07:17.130
And we don't see this text, right?

77
07:17.140 --> 07:20.330
We only see the other console log.

78
07:20.410 --> 07:23.140
So lets remove it.

79
07:23.140 --> 07:26.730
So now we are able to run code only when our widget is loaded.

80
07:27.040 --> 07:28.240
What do we need to run?

81
07:28.330 --> 07:34.390
We need to initialize "slick" for the content of the widget that has just loaded.

82
07:34.420 --> 07:35.740
Right?

83
07:35.800 --> 07:38.630
So how do we get that? Inside of the placement

84
07:38.630 --> 07:43.390
we will find "container" and the container as you can see is actually 

85
07:43.390 --> 07:48.050
highlighting our widget, right? So all we have to do is

86
07:50.640 --> 08:00.280
"placement.container", so the container will be this whole DIV, the SECTION tag remember?

87
08:00.750 --> 08:07.980
So this is the SECTION tag and we would like to find inside of SECTION tag this class, right?

88
08:07.980 --> 08:08.820
So let's copy this.

89
08:11.470 --> 08:12.390
And ".find"

90
08:16.200 --> 08:18.390
then ".slick()".

91
08:18.400 --> 08:26.440
Let's try this.

92
08:26.560 --> 08:28.240
And as you can see we still have the slider. Great.

93
08:37.740 --> 08:46.880
One final thing we can do is before using this object, we can make sure that it exists because for some older

94
08:46.880 --> 08:49.780
WordPress versions maybe this does not exist.

95
08:49.790 --> 08:55.070
So its always a good idea to check first that the things that you are trying to access exists,

96
08:55.100 --> 08:55.760
right?

97
08:55.760 --> 09:06.240
So first we'll check "wp.customize" and then the "wp.customize.selectiveRefresh". And if these exist

98
09:07.460 --> 09:13.920
then it's safe to use them in the code below.

99
09:13.940 --> 09:18.970
So there are also other callbacks for widgets and partials and stuff like that.

100
09:19.040 --> 09:21.960
I'll put a link to it, so you can read more about it.

101
09:21.980 --> 09:30.140
But I think for us that's all what we need to do to create widgets. So that it for now and see you

102
09:30.320 --> 09:31.200
in the next section.
