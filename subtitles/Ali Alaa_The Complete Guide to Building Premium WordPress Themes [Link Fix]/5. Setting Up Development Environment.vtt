00:02.780 --> 00:05.780
So now we have a basic theme installed.

1
00:06.120 --> 00:11.070
Let's now activate it. So I'm gonna hit Activate.

2
00:11.210 --> 00:20.290
So it may take a little while. And once it's activated, let's view the website now.

3
00:20.430 --> 00:28.320
And as you might expect it's a blank page because we have an empty index.php file.

4
00:28.340 --> 00:34.730
So if you type some text here and then refresh again, you will see the text.

5
00:37.480 --> 00:39.070
Before getting any further,

6
00:39.160 --> 00:44.290
let's set up some stuff that will help us during the development of the theme.

7
00:45.330 --> 00:52.560
So I'm gonna go now to the root of our website, not the root of the theme, the root of our whole website.

8
00:52.800 --> 00:55.050
And then I'm gonna open the wp-config file.

9
00:55.230 --> 01:00.970
And inside this file you will find a PHP constant called WP_DEBUG.

10
01:01.260 --> 01:07.580
And it's set to false. During development we need to set the WP_DEBUG constant to true.

11
01:07.610 --> 01:16.020
In order for PHP errors and warnings to appear on screen. Otherwise you might have some PHP warnings

12
01:16.110 --> 01:20.430
that may cause your theme to get rejected. During production

13
01:20.430 --> 01:24.890
however make sure to set it back to false.

14
01:24.960 --> 01:28.250
Let's move on now and install another thing.

15
01:28.460 --> 01:35.340
So in the Dashboard go to plugins. And then add new and then search for "themecheck".

16
01:39.530 --> 01:45.830
Or actually "theme check". And it will probably be the first result.

17
01:45.900 --> 01:52.990
So install it and activate it.

18
01:53.040 --> 01:59.920
So if you're submitting this theme to the WordPress repository there are some guidelines that you must

19
01:59.920 --> 02:05.580
follow. And this plugin ensures none of these guidelines are violated.

20
02:06.790 --> 02:09.360
So here are some of these guidelines.

21
02:09.400 --> 02:14.710
I put a link to these in the lecture links so you can take a look at them.

22
02:14.800 --> 02:20.580
If you're submitting this theme to a Theme Forest there is another set of guidelines.

23
02:20.620 --> 02:26.980
I'll also put a link to whom. Some of the guidelines for submitting on the WordPress repository are not

24
02:26.980 --> 02:34.820
actually required for Theme Forest, And that's why there is another plugin that supplements Theme Check.

25
02:35.110 --> 02:42.550
So you should still have Theme Check installed and add another plugin that will remove the errors and

26
02:42.550 --> 02:48.300
warnings that are not required by Theme Forest. And this one is called ThemeForest-

27
02:48.350 --> 02:49.850
Check.

28
02:50.010 --> 02:56.080
So if you're developing for Theme Forest make sure you have this one installed.

29
02:56.100 --> 03:01.660
So let's take a quick look on how Theme Check works. So in Appearance you will find a new item called Theme 

30
03:01.680 --> 03:08.160
Check. And you can choose a theme and click Check It and of course we'll have a lot of errors because we

31
03:08.160 --> 03:09.370
haven't done anything yet.

32
03:09.480 --> 03:10.970
So that's normal.

33
03:11.900 --> 03:17.240
So the final thing we're gonna do is we're gonna import some dummy content in order to be able

34
03:17.240 --> 03:24.050
to test our theme while developing. So WordPress actually provides an XML file that contains a lot of

35
03:24.050 --> 03:27.430
posts that you can import to your website.

36
03:27.590 --> 03:34.000
So I'm gonna download that. And I'm gonna put a link to this in the lecture links.

37
03:34.000 --> 03:38.200
Now let's go to Tools and then Import.

38
03:40.950 --> 03:47.730
And then under WordPress click Install Now and that will install a plugin that we will use to import

39
03:47.880 --> 03:50.710
the XML file that we downloaded.

40
03:51.210 --> 03:54.250
So let's click Run Importer.

41
03:54.450 --> 04:03.410
And here we can choose the XML file that you downloaded. And just click Upload File and Import. And

42
04:03.410 --> 04:11.670
make sure that you check the "Download and Import file attachments" and then Submit.

43
04:11.700 --> 04:16.080
So this might take a while because it will download some dummy images.

44
04:16.080 --> 04:21.660
So make sure you have a good internet connection. So this file will import all sorts of posts you can

45
04:21.660 --> 04:22.510
imagine.

46
04:22.710 --> 04:28.650
And inside the content of each of these posts you will get instructions on how this post should look

47
04:28.650 --> 04:29.550
like.

48
04:29.580 --> 04:35.130
Actually at some point in this course we'll go through all of these posts and make sure every one of them

49
04:35.640 --> 04:37.090
is functioning correctly.

50
04:37.560 --> 04:43.100
And as you can see we also have some images and we also have comments imported.

51
04:43.320 --> 04:49.370
If you submitting this theme to Theme Forest actually this is what they do when they review your theme.

52
04:49.380 --> 04:54.440
They import these posts and make sure every one of them is functioning correctly.
