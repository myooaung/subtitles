00:00.120 --> 00:06.700
So let's finalize our JavaScript task. I still have some stuff to do.

1
00:06.700 --> 00:15.680
So remember when we in the SASS task when we needed to add a style for the admin and a style for the

2
00:15.720 --> 00:21.320
bundle so we needed wto files to compile. And do that we just

3
00:21.340 --> 00:30.060
instead of a string, we added an array of paths in the source of the style task. So we need to do the same

4
00:30.060 --> 00:32.270
thing for the images, for the scripts.

5
00:33.880 --> 00:40.230
So we need to create admin file.

6
00:40.480 --> 00:42.860
However that's not gonna work in our case.

7
00:43.090 --> 00:51.710
And that's because the webpack plugin just works differently than the task plugin. It only by default

8
00:51.730 --> 00:54.150
expect one just one entry point.

9
00:55.200 --> 00:55.910
And by entry point

10
00:55.910 --> 01:01.180
I mean you know the file that you compile that you include all the other files in.

11
01:01.790 --> 01:06.670
But there is a way to do with in the. Let's open the

12
01:06.870 --> 01:10.710
webpack stream

13
01:14.590 --> 01:18.480
plugin again.

14
01:18.730 --> 01:28.850
There's a section here about multiple entry points. And there is a couple of solutions for it.

15
01:28.950 --> 01:35.730
I'm gonna use the second solution because it will let us add an array for the source just like the

16
01:36.220 --> 01:38.600
what we did for the styles task.

17
01:38.670 --> 01:43.770
So we need for this, we need to install another plugin called "vinyl-named".

18
01:43.890 --> 01:45.710
So let's do this now.

19
01:46.710 --> 01:57.420
"npm install --save-dev vinyl-named". And while it's installing let's see what we should do. We should

20
01:57.900 --> 02:01.000
include it. So

21
02:04.770 --> 02:07.180
"import named from 'vinyl-named'".

22
02:12.120 --> 02:20.490
And then before the webpack pipe we should add a ".pipe(named())" which is the library that we imported.

23
02:20.870 --> 02:22.040
Ok.

24
02:27.480 --> 02:30.250
And and that's it.

25
02:30.390 --> 02:34.300
We're just specifying the output to be bundle.js here.

26
02:34.860 --> 02:39.410
But in this case we needed to be dynamic, so the named, the vinyl-named plugin will allows

27
02:39.420 --> 02:45.890
to add here a placeholder  of name and that will be the name of the file in the array.

28
02:46.530 --> 02:56.480
And let's see what I mean in a moment. So let's create a new file in the js folder and call it admin.js.

29
02:59.810 --> 03:04.840
Ok and let's just type any "console.log('admin')".

30
03:07.550 --> 03:10.540
And we have admin here in the array of files.

31
03:10.580 --> 03:14.510
So that's run our task. "gulp scripts".

32
03:17.840 --> 03:21.330
and now we have two bundles created.

33
03:23.090 --> 03:29.100
So in the dist folder, in the js folder we have admin.js.

34
03:33.040 --> 03:36.880
"console.log('admin')" and our bundle, excellent.

35
03:36.870 --> 03:45.120
So let's now include the admin file and in WordPress. So we'll do the same.

36
03:45.140 --> 03:47.110
enqueue script. Let's copy it

37
03:47.240 --> 03:48.080
but now for the

38
03:51.020 --> 03:54.570
the admin, for the "admin _enqueue_scripts" function.

39
03:57.870 --> 03:59.430
Actually we have the mistake here.

40
03:59.440 --> 04:05.660
The function, it should be admin_assets. Right. So let's add the

41
04:05.880 --> 04:17.740
"wp_enqueue_script" and let's change the handle "admin_scripts" and file name to "admin.js". And we also

42
04:17.740 --> 04:21.220
like CSS, we should have a version here before the

43
04:24.450 --> 04:27.180
the infooter parameter.

44
04:27.190 --> 04:28.200
So let's add it.

45
04:32.710 --> 04:33.590
All right.

46
04:36.170 --> 04:39.110
Let's now go to the wp-admin.

47
04:42.570 --> 04:54.680
And we have our CSS and our admin in the console log. Just in case you're wondering what this version argument does.

48
04:55.080 --> 05:03.670
If we, sorry, if we inspect our. view the source of the page here and we go to the footer where we have

49
05:03.670 --> 05:05.020
the our SCRIPT tag.

50
05:08.070 --> 05:15.210
We have after the url, I'm gonna zoom in a little, so after the url for the bundle.js we have 

51
05:15.210 --> 05:16.150
the version here.

52
05:17.020 --> 05:24.760
And if we change the version when we are enqueueing the script  this will force the browser to refetch this

53
05:24.760 --> 05:27.530
file if it's caching or something.

54
05:28.120 --> 05:40.220
So finally for this task we need to watch for changes like we did for SASS tasks. So in the "watch"

55
05:40.330 --> 05:45.530
task let's add another "gulp.watch()" function

56
05:48.250 --> 05:52.570
and we will need to watch for "src/assets/

57
05:55.200 --> 06:07.760
js/" and any files with a .js extension in this folder or in any subfolder in this folder.

58
06:10.160 --> 06:19.760
And if a change is detected we will need to run the "scripts" task. So that it.

59
06:19.770 --> 06:22.790
So we also have to add the "scripts"

60
06:22.810 --> 06:30.290
task here when you are building or developing.

61
06:30.360 --> 06:32.740
So for the "dev" and the "build" tasks

62
06:32.990 --> 06:44.020
just add the "scripts" in the parallel scripts that we are running. So let's save this. And let's run let's

63
06:44.020 --> 06:52.010
run "gulp build" in order to get rid of these old Hashes. So "gulp build".

64
06:52.120 --> 06:54.210
Now it should,

65
06:54.310 --> 06:55.600
It should run the "scripts"

66
06:57.370 --> 07:08.160
task. And we're now having our admin and bundle files only. Let's also run "dev" in order to make sure

67
07:08.160 --> 07:10.230
the watch is working.

68
07:12.440 --> 07:15.810
So it's now watching so let's change a

69
07:15.810 --> 07:28.850
js file. And let's change the slider. And let's change the number and save. And the "scripts" task run here. And 

70
07:29.080 --> 07:33.500
also double check in the browser. We have the new number.

71
07:35.220 --> 07:39.730
Still have one more thing we need to talk about for the scripts.

72
07:39.760 --> 07:41.250
So let's do in the next lecture.
