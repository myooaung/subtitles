So one final accessibility tip is skip links. And skip links find a way for people who use the keyboard

1
00:09.870 --> 00:14.670
to navigate to skip some links that they probably don't need to navigate through and go to the main

2
00:14.670 --> 00:15.870
content directly.

3
00:15.940 --> 00:17.580
So let's see what this means.

4
00:17.590 --> 00:21.210
I'm gonna log out here because I don't need this admin bar. 

5
00:24.110 --> 00:26.840
Imagine now you're navigating using the keyboard.

6
00:27.290 --> 00:33.170
So the first thing you will focus on is the site title and then the search and then the search button and 

7
00:33.170 --> 00:35.660
then all these links.

8
00:35.780 --> 00:40.370
So this might be a lot of navigation to do before getting to the main content.

9
00:40.430 --> 00:45.470
So we need to figure out a way to skip to the main content directly without having to go through all

10
00:45.470 --> 00:47.170
of these links.

11
00:47.270 --> 00:59.150
So let's go to header.php. And right before the after the BODY tag we'll add a link with an "href=

12
00:59.450 --> 01:04.900
'#content', hash tag or hash content and then close it.

13
01:05.100 --> 01:10.520
So remember when I wrapped all of our content in a DIV with an ID content. There was actually a reason

14
01:10.520 --> 01:15.530
for that. We need to wrap our content in a DIV in order to be able to navigate to it using an ANCHOR

15
01:15.530 --> 01:16.590
tag.

16
01:17.240 --> 01:24.540
So the ID content here when we click on this link we'll focus on the content and skip the header. So let's

17
01:24.540 --> 01:30.000
see what I mean. Let's just add some text for this link. So I'm gonna open PHP

18
01:34.160 --> 01:36.110
and of course escaped and translated

19
01:38.990 --> 01:41.900
and "Skip to content".

20
01:44.170 --> 01:46.590
And "_themename".

21
01:51.510 --> 01:54.260
And let's now see.

22
01:54.500 --> 01:58.710
So now we've the first thing in the website is this link.

23
01:58.710 --> 02:02.210
So when we start navigating, let's refresh.

24
02:02.560 --> 02:03.910
Let's start navigating.

25
02:03.910 --> 02:05.450
And now we're focused on this link.

26
02:05.450 --> 02:09.560
And if you click on it, it will focus on the content.

27
02:09.560 --> 02:17.510
And now we can continue navigating through the content. And we don't have to navigate through these links.

28
02:17.750 --> 02:23.810
And if you don't click enter on this link we can normally navigate through our header. But of course

29
02:23.810 --> 02:26.870
we don't need this link to be obvious here.

30
02:27.000 --> 02:30.350
We need to hide it. So let's add a class.

31
02:34.380 --> 02:38.900
And I have a called "u-skip-link".

32
02:40.920 --> 02:42.750
And it's in, I think,

33
02:45.600 --> 02:49.800
utility and helpers. So what this class does?

34
02:50.000 --> 02:54.850
It hides the text exactly like the "screen-reader-text".

35
02:55.170 --> 02:59.930
But when we're focused on the link we will show it again.

36
03:00.150 --> 03:06.630
So these styles here will show the link in the top left of the page. And these styles here will hide it from the

37
03:06.630 --> 03:07.330
page.

38
03:09.320 --> 03:11.970
So let's go back now and let's refresh

39
03:12.010 --> 03:14.830
and  start navigating using tab.

40
03:15.010 --> 03:21.550
And now once you are focused on this link, it appears and if we remove the focus from it it disappears.

41
03:21.680 --> 03:27.130
By the way if we hit tab you will navigate forward and shift+tab navigate backwards,

42
03:27.140 --> 03:30.950
if you don't know. So now the very first thing you will have is this link.

43
03:30.950 --> 03:35.550
If you click on it you'll go to the content. And if you don't you'll just navigate through the header.

44
03:35.600 --> 03:38.440
So this was a great improvement to our accessibility.

45
03:38.510 --> 03:45.030
I think we now have a great menu and navigation. And we are ready now to go to the next section.
