So now we have the single portfolio item and right now it's using the single.php template. And we also

1
00:09.910 --> 00:18.370
have the taxonomy archive, the project type archive which is now using the archive.php template. And also

2
00:18.370 --> 00:25.570
the skills will use the same template. But what if we want to create a special template for the single page

3
00:25.570 --> 00:33.090
and the archives. So let's start by the portfolio archive. So let's remove this name.

4
00:33.330 --> 00:35.720
And here we should have a list of all the portfolio items.

5
00:35.820 --> 00:39.120
And right now we're also falling back to archive.php.

6
00:39.570 --> 00:42.950
So let's create a template especially for the portfolio archive.

7
00:43.380 --> 00:52.840
So all we have to do is create a new file in our theme and we'll call it "archive-" and then the

8
00:52.990 --> 00:54.510
custom post type name.

9
00:54.550 --> 01:04.190
So in our case it's called "_themename_portfolio.php".

10
01:05.080 --> 01:10.940
And here I'm gonna paste a basic loop which will just display the title and the pagination.

11
01:11.210 --> 01:17.690
So you can populate this loop as you wish and create template parts and all the stuff that we did for

12
01:17.690 --> 01:18.490
the blog.

13
01:18.830 --> 01:20.950
But that's not the point of this lecture.

14
01:20.960 --> 01:23.660
I think you can already do that by yourself.

15
01:23.690 --> 01:28.460
I just want to let you know the file names that you will have to create in order to create an archive

16
01:28.460 --> 01:30.260
for the custom post type.

17
01:30.380 --> 01:37.760
So now if we refresh the archive post type, now we will have the template that will just display the title

18
01:37.760 --> 01:41.240
of the portfolio item. And same for the single.

19
01:41.240 --> 01:51.370
So let's go to this item and now let's go and create a new file. And let's call it 

20
01:51.370 --> 02:01.160
single-_themename_portfolio. php. And I'm also gonna paste the basic template with

21
02:01.160 --> 02:04.650
the header and footer and the title and the content.

22
02:04.700 --> 02:08.170
So let's save and refresh.

23
02:08.310 --> 02:10.490
Now we have the title and the content.

24
02:10.500 --> 02:15.700
So here of course you can display the featured image and the custom taxonomies that we created, the skills and

25
02:15.840 --> 02:18.650
the project type and stuff like that.

26
02:18.880 --> 02:26.400
But I'm just gonna leave this to you. Let's now finally see what we have to do in order to create a template

27
02:26.400 --> 02:28.480
for the taxonomy archive.

28
02:28.520 --> 02:29.340
All right?

29
02:29.640 --> 02:38.580
So we have the project type taxonomy here and what we have to do is, let's also copy this loop and create a

30
02:38.580 --> 02:39.550
new file.

31
02:39.840 --> 02:46.530
And this one will be called "taxonomy-_themename_" and then the taxonomy name.

32
02:46.530 --> 02:51.060
So we called it projecttype. And let's paste

33
02:53.860 --> 02:59.000
and as you can see. Let's finally go to a skill.

34
02:59.210 --> 03:07.530
So here and let's view of these. And let's create a new file

35
03:10.190 --> 03:17.660
"taxonomy-" and then the taxonomy name. So "taxonomy-_themename_skills.php.

36
03:17.730 --> 03:24.940
And let's paste this loop.

37
03:25.090 --> 03:27.450
And now we have it.

38
03:27.570 --> 03:33.410
So you may have noticed that we will have a problem now when we build our theme.

39
03:33.960 --> 03:41.250
So when we build our theme and plugins our taxonomy name will be the actual theme name and then projecttype

40
03:42.110 --> 03:47.010
and same for the post type, it will be the actual theme name "_portfolio" and so on.

41
03:47.460 --> 03:53.400
But the templates that we created here are called "_themename" the placeholder, right?

42
03:53.820 --> 03:57.430
So we need to use these files only while developing.

43
03:57.600 --> 04:01.920
And when we build our theme we need to rename these to the actual theme name.

44
04:02.040 --> 04:05.680
So let's modify our gulpfile to do that in the next lecture.
