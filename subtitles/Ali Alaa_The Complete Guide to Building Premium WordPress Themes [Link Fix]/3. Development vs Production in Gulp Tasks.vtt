00:02.710 --> 00:09.900
So we now have the foundation for creating task. We have this dummy task here but now we're ready to 

1
00:09.930 --> 00:11.900
create actual tasks.

2
00:11.940 --> 00:16.390
But before that I want to point out an important thing before going any further.

3
00:16.500 --> 00:22.920
So sometimes you might need to run our task differently depending on whether we are in a production

4
00:22.920 --> 00:25.770
environment or a development environment.

5
00:25.770 --> 00:33.920
So for example let's say we are having a task that will compile SASS to CSS and minify the CSS.

6
00:33.930 --> 00:38.860
So that will be great for production, for the end user to have the CSS minified.

7
00:39.450 --> 00:44.560
But during development it's unnecessary to have the minified CSS.

8
00:44.720 --> 00:50.040
That process might actually take time and processing power and we don't need to have it during development.

9
00:50.180 --> 00:56.220
So we need to have a way to, you know, like a flag to tell whether we want to run a task for development or

10
00:56.250 --> 01:02.250
for production. And to do that we'll use a package called yargs.

11
01:07.800 --> 01:09.590
And it's an NPM package.

12
01:09.660 --> 01:13.370
It allows us to add some arguments in the command line when we run a task.

13
01:13.590 --> 01:16.630
And then you can use these arguments in the gulpfile.

14
01:17.010 --> 01:18.900
So let's see exactly what that means.

15
01:22.170 --> 01:30.140
So let's install it. I'm gonna change to my theme folder. Make sure you always do that.

16
01:32.360 --> 01:40.470
And then we want to --save-dev, I'll tell you later what's --save only. What the difference between --save and --save-dev but

17
01:40.480 --> 01:48.860
we want to --save-dev for this one. And i is also an alias for install.

18
01:48.860 --> 01:50.520
So it's now installed.

19
01:51.190 --> 01:53.000
So let's see how to use it.

20
01:54.450 --> 02:04.530
So let's go to the gulpfile now and let's remove the old code here. And let's "import yargs

21
02:07.500 --> 02:11.920
from 'yargs'". And then I'm gonna create a new constant.

22
02:12.030 --> 02:15.210
And the "const" is a keyword, is a new keyword in JavaScript.

23
02:16.290 --> 02:17.550
And let's call it PRODUCTION.

24
02:21.200 --> 02:24.330
And let's assign it to yargs

25
02:24.590 --> 02:27.830
.argv.prod.

26
02:34.790 --> 02:35.680
And in our

27
02:35.690 --> 02:36.920
hello task here

28
02:36.940 --> 02:41.080
we will "consol.log(PRODUCTION)" instead of the random text. 

29
02:44.590 --> 02:45.550
Let's now run "gulp

30
02:45.980 --> 02:46.340
hello".

31
02:49.660 --> 02:53.690
And we've "undefined" here. Now let's run "gulp hello"

32
02:53.700 --> 03:01.300
and then --prod equals some text. And then we have some text here.

33
03:02.650 --> 03:03.360
So that's great.

34
03:03.370 --> 03:08.360
So now we can set a variable in the command line and use it in the gulpfile.

35
03:10.230 --> 03:17.230
So what we can do is that when we run a task we can pass the the --prod flag.

36
03:18.520 --> 03:24.730
And that will be true or just not pass it and it will be undefined which is false.

37
03:24.790 --> 03:32.330
So that's how we will determine whether we are running the task for production or for development.

38
03:32.890 --> 03:35.180
So I think now we are ready to create our actual tasks.

39
03:35.180 --> 03:39.210
But before that let's create a new folder here.

40
03:41.220 --> 03:42.950
And let's call it source or src.

41
03:47.180 --> 03:51.990
And then let's create a folder called assets. That's a file, sorry.

42
04:01.900 --> 04:06.160
And inside assets we will create images

43
04:09.280 --> 04:12.160
and js

44
04:16.440 --> 04:27.310
and sass or scss. So in the src folder we'll have the SASS files and the JavaScript files written

45
04:27.310 --> 04:28.160
in the

46
04:28.270 --> 04:36.220
new syntax. And images and then we will create tasks that will take the SASS files and the JavaScript

47
04:36.220 --> 04:43.450
files and the images and you know compile them, minify them, whatever you want. And then put them inside

48
04:43.450 --> 04:44.300
another folder.

49
04:45.200 --> 04:48.240
And we'll see how to do that in the next lecture.
