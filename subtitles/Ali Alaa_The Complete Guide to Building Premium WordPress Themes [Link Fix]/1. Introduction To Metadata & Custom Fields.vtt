In this section we'll learn how to manage metadata for a post.

1
00:06.420 --> 00:09.760
So let's start by defining what is a metadata.

2
00:09.760 --> 00:17.580
So if you open any post here. And let's edit this one. So by default the post will have some information

3
00:17.700 --> 00:22.090
associated with it like the Title and the Content and Categories.

4
00:22.240 --> 00:29.140
And we also have if you press Screen Options here we can have the Excerpt and it can also have custom

5
00:29.140 --> 00:29.880
fields.

6
00:30.180 --> 00:37.000
So metadata refers to any data associated with a post. And WordPress allows us to add extra metadata

7
00:37.300 --> 00:42.120
to the post other than the Title and the Excerpt and the Content and all the other stuff.

8
00:42.250 --> 00:44.230
And that is done through custom fields.

9
00:44.310 --> 00:50.080
So if you take a look at this Custom Fields box here you can add a new custom field or you can choose

10
00:50.200 --> 00:53.530
from some existing custom fields.

11
00:53.680 --> 01:02.440
So let's for example, add a new custom field. I'm sorry I should enter new here. And let's call it maybe "price"

12
01:04.960 --> 01:07.180
and the value will be "20".

13
01:07.350 --> 01:08.500
And let's update.

14
01:11.370 --> 01:16.410
So now we're having this extra meta information available for this post.

15
01:16.400 --> 01:23.730
So let's view the post now. And let's go and remove this var_dump() here.

16
01:23.970 --> 01:26.520
This was in helpers.

17
01:32.670 --> 01:37.120
And now we want to display this custom field in our post.

18
01:37.360 --> 01:38.310
So how to do that.

19
01:38.320 --> 01:49.930
Let's go to where we display this post which was in the template-parts and content.

20
01:50.010 --> 01:56.220
And as I told you before the single blog page will have a special template called single.php but we haven't

21
01:56.220 --> 01:56.900
created this yet.

22
01:56.910 --> 02:01.080
So let's just do our testing in the content not

23
02:01.160 --> 02:04.850
PHP for now. And let's var_dump().

24
02:07.810 --> 02:17.490
And let's retrieve the Custom Field and this is using a function called get_post_meta().

25
02:17.530 --> 02:23.590
So this takes the post ID. So in our case we are in the loop so we can use get_the_ID().

26
02:24.970 --> 02:27.390
And it takes the key and the key is.

27
02:27.450 --> 02:31.950
So let's before doing that let's make the terminology clear here.

28
02:32.200 --> 02:37.630
So we said we have the metadata which are information associated with a post. And this metadata consists

29
02:37.630 --> 02:41.330
of two parts: the meta key and the meta value.

30
02:41.590 --> 02:45.490
So the key is the "prize" here in this example and its value is "20".

31
02:45.490 --> 02:53.470
So the key is how you will reference this value here. And to retrieve this value we will pass this key here.

32
02:53.470 --> 02:59.740
So we have our meta key and meta value and to manage these keys and values we use custom fields which

33
02:59.740 --> 03:02.820
are these HTML fields.

34
03:03.080 --> 03:03.430
Right?

35
03:03.430 --> 03:10.180
So we've metadata and meta key and meta value and custom field. And we have also a third argument and

36
03:10.180 --> 03:18.330
we'll see that in a moment so let's remove it now. And let's see what this will output. And as you can see it's an array

37
03:18.440 --> 03:25.970
of length 1 and the first value in this array is 20 which is the value here.

38
03:26.110 --> 03:27.620
So why is it an array?

39
03:27.750 --> 03:36.050
It's because we can add multiple meta values to one meta key. So we can add the the "price" here again

40
03:36.830 --> 03:47.220
And let's say "30" and save. And now let's go back and refresh and we now have the two values.

41
03:47.300 --> 03:50.510
And that actually why there is a third argument here.

42
03:50.680 --> 03:56.010
The third argument here, it's a boolean and if you set it to "true" it will return the last value in the

43
03:56.010 --> 03:56.560
array.

44
03:56.720 --> 04:01.170
And if it's "false", and it's "false" by default, it will return the whole array.

45
04:01.310 --> 04:07.370
So let's refresh now or we don't have to refresh. And we have a string instead of array with a value

46
04:07.370 --> 04:08.020
of 20.

47
04:08.030 --> 04:10.870
So it actually presents the first value in the array.

48
04:11.300 --> 04:17.250
So great, we now know how to add meta information to our post but this Custom Fields

49
04:17.300 --> 04:19.800
box here is kind of impractical, right?

50
04:19.820 --> 04:28.040
So as a theme developer you'll use in your theme some meta keys here and then to let your users use it.

51
04:28.040 --> 04:31.820
You'll have to ask them to put the meta key and the meta value.

52
04:31.970 --> 04:33.270
And this is kind of weird, right?

53
04:33.290 --> 04:36.670
We need to let the users just type the value.

54
04:36.830 --> 04:38.860
So that's what we will do in this section.

55
04:38.900 --> 04:41.600
We will learn how to create a box like this one.

56
04:41.780 --> 04:43.100
And this is called a meta box.

57
04:43.100 --> 04:45.890
So these white boxes are called meta boxes.

58
04:46.040 --> 04:52.170
And we'll learn how to add our own fields in it. And this won't just be a text field like it is here.

59
04:52.400 --> 04:56.730
We'll be able to add an input or a checkbox or a dropdown or any other field.

60
04:56.960 --> 05:03.890
And we'll also handle these meta keys internally without asking the users to type the meta key.

61
05:04.120 --> 05:07.320
But before doing that let's discuss some stuff first.

62
05:07.340 --> 05:18.810
So let's go to localhost and 8888 which is MAMP port and then phpmyadmin.

63
05:19.750 --> 05:20.780
And I've seen this before.

64
05:20.770 --> 05:25.960
This is where you can manage your databases. So let's go to our database and I just want to show you where

65
05:26.320 --> 05:28.160
the custom fields are stored.

66
05:28.510 --> 05:30.010
So we have the wp_posts.

67
05:30.160 --> 05:36.810
Remember when I told you that all the posts including the posts and pages and the attachments are stored here.

68
05:37.730 --> 05:42.090
And they are distinguished by the post_type column here.

69
05:42.230 --> 05:45.970
So we have page, post, attachment etc..

70
05:46.190 --> 05:48.570
You also have a separate table for meta data.

71
05:48.680 --> 05:51.180
So it's called wp_postmeta.

72
05:54.020 --> 06:00.870
And it contains meta keys and metal values and the post ID that this meta information is associated with.

73
06:01.040 --> 06:11.430
So let's display 500 per page just to. Let's just search for the "price" that we just created.

74
06:12.370 --> 06:13.770
So it's maybe in the third page.

75
06:17.560 --> 06:18.060
Yes.

76
06:18.070 --> 06:25.300
And as you can see we have two "price" and both of them are related to the same post ID but they have

77
06:25.300 --> 06:26.790
different meta value.

78
06:26.980 --> 06:35.500
So when we create our custom fields in our own meta boxes you'll probably need to have only one value

79
06:35.500 --> 06:39.840
for your key. And we'll learn how to do that when we discuss meta boxes.

80
06:39.970 --> 06:42.750
So I just wanted to show you the database here.

81
06:43.270 --> 06:50.470
Let's also point out something. If you have a prior experience with a before you probably know plugins

82
06:50.500 --> 06:58.060
like Advanced Custom Fields. And this plugin helps you add the meta boxes that we will learn how to add

83
06:58.270 --> 07:00.320
in the section without writing any code.

84
07:00.400 --> 07:06.790
So you may want to use this plugin and integrate it with your theme and they have in the documentation a guide

85
07:06.790 --> 07:08.760
to how to integrate it with your theme.

86
07:08.800 --> 07:14.740
But in this section I want to focus on how to create these fields on our own without any plugins.

87
07:14.850 --> 07:21.200
And maybe we could do a lecture on how to integrate advanced custom fields in your theme. Let me know if you like that.

88
07:21.400 --> 07:28.780
What this plugin will allow you to do is create meta box like this box like the Excerp box for example and

89
07:28.780 --> 07:35.950
add some fields in it. And you can choose from a wide variety of field like text field, textarea, range,

90
07:36.130 --> 07:38.820
checkboxes and everything you can imagine.

91
07:38.820 --> 07:40.430
So it's definitely a great plugin.

92
07:40.440 --> 07:45.950
But in this case I just want to focus on letting, you know, how to do everything by yourself.

93
07:46.080 --> 07:53.250
So anyways the final thing I want to mention in this lecture is that you might have heard about this.

94
07:53.550 --> 08:00.060
But amusing, as I'm recording this I'm using version 4.9.7 of

95
08:00.450 --> 08:01.090
WordPress.

96
08:01.170 --> 08:06.480
And if your version is like me less than 5 as you're watching this you will have this page as you

97
08:06.480 --> 08:13.110
see it now. But after version 5 WordPress will completely change how this page looks. And this will of

98
08:13.110 --> 08:17.400
course have some effect on how to do things in this section.

99
08:17.530 --> 08:25.360
So what WordPress allows to is, it allows us to use this new page before it's officially released.

100
08:26.100 --> 08:27.180
And that's using a plugin.

101
08:27.180 --> 08:37.980
So let's go to Plugins and Add New. And the plugin is called Gutenburg which is this one.

102
08:38.230 --> 08:43.600
And this will allow you to use the new editor, post editor before it's officially released so you can

103
08:43.600 --> 08:48.530
develop with it before it's released for the normal users.

104
08:48.670 --> 08:49.660
So let's activate it.

105
08:52.730 --> 08:57.350
And let's go back to the post page and refresh.

106
08:57.500 --> 09:00.170
And as you can see it's a completely different page.

107
09:00.350 --> 09:06.710
And they actually remove the Custom Fields box that we added the "price" in but that's not important

108
09:06.710 --> 09:09.810
we still can add our own meta boxes.

109
09:09.940 --> 09:16.090
So let's deactivate this plugin for now and during this section I will turn it on and off to see

110
09:16.090 --> 09:17.010
the differences

111
09:17.200 --> 09:24.530
when we are creating our meta boxes. So to start creating the meta boxes in the next lecture.
