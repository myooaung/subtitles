Let's now create the Audio Post Format which will be very similar to the video post format. So let's go back to the code editor. Or let's

1
00:13.020 --> 00:20.720
first search  for "post format audio".

2
00:20.960 --> 00:22.390
And we have one post here.

3
00:22.710 --> 00:28.680
So let's go and create content-audio.

4
00:30.790 --> 00:35.080
And this will be exactly like the video post format.

5
00:39.180 --> 00:41.130
But we've some small differences.

6
00:41.130 --> 00:46.520
So first when we get the media we will search for "audio" and "iframe" only.

7
00:49.980 --> 00:51.860
Also let's call this $audios and

8
00:55.610 --> 00:56.490
here.

9
00:56.870 --> 01:00.830
And then finally in this if condition we also change this to $audios.

10
01:01.220 --> 01:05.380
And we don't need to add the responsive class anymore.

11
01:11.330 --> 01:12.770
And that will be it.

12
01:12.790 --> 01:13.640
Let's take a look.

13
01:17.070 --> 01:23.230
We also have to change this class to "audio".

14
01:23.460 --> 01:27.820
So as you can see we have an HTML5 audio player.

15
01:28.060 --> 01:36.110
So let's go to this post and edit it. And let's also test the Gutenberg.

16
01:36.250 --> 01:44.160
So let's add a new block and Embeds and let's add maybe the SoundCloud.

17
01:50.000 --> 01:52.640
So let's go to SoundCloud and get any audio.

18
02:03.080 --> 02:05.380
And let's copy the URL and put it here.

19
02:09.910 --> 02:21.040
And let's also remove this one. And let's update. And let's view the post. We've to view it in the loop also.

20
02:21.200 --> 02:23.540
Let's click on the category.

21
02:24.250 --> 02:27.200
And here we have a post with a SoundCloud embedded in it.

22
02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
Right?

23
02:28.420 --> 02:35.800
So using the Gutenberg blocks we don't have the option to change the width, so maybe it's better to embed it from

24
02:35.800 --> 02:36.320
here.

25
02:42.830 --> 02:53.320
And you can also choose the height. And let's copy this. And let's remove this. And then we can paste our iframe

26
02:55.800 --> 02:59.300
and update.

27
02:59.590 --> 03:04.350
And now as you can see it will look much better because we have more control here we can use the width and

28
03:04.350 --> 03:05.110
the height.

29
03:05.430 --> 03:13.020
But anyways this was how to create the audio formats. We still have one post format missing which is the

30
03:13.020 --> 03:13.570
Gallery.

31
03:13.680 --> 03:15.210
So let's do that in the next lecture.
