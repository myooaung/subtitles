00:03.330 --> 00:09.450
In this lecture we'll take a look at the posts that we imported in the very first section in this course. And we'll make

1
00:09.450 --> 00:12.340
sure that everything is displayed correctly.

2
00:13.170 --> 00:20.010
So I think I mentioned this before but when you, if you are submitting this theme to Theme Forests what

3
00:20.010 --> 00:27.180
they do is they import the same unit tests that we imported. And they check each post one by one to make

4
00:27.180 --> 00:29.890
sure your blog is coded correctly.

5
00:30.210 --> 00:32.110
So let's do the same thing.

6
00:32.610 --> 00:35.190
So first we have a "Template: Sticky".

7
00:35.440 --> 00:42.300
So when you create a post, let's edit any post, you will have the option for this post to be a sticky post,

8
00:42.780 --> 00:49.860
"Stick to the Front Page". And this option makes these posts appear in the at the very top of the post list.

9
00:50.160 --> 00:52.440
And the author must be styled a bit differently.

10
00:52.440 --> 00:55.940
So in our case we added this border here.

11
00:56.040 --> 01:00.200
So if you open this post it mentions that we must use post_class().

12
01:00.480 --> 01:01.740
So we already did that.

13
01:01.740 --> 01:12.140
So the content. We used "post_class()" here. And what this will do it will add some classes like ".sticky"

14
01:12.550 --> 01:18.100
in this case. and BY using this class you can style sticky posts differently.

15
01:18.130 --> 01:24.820
So we did that in the post list where it adds border to posts that have the class ".sticky". And

16
01:24.820 --> 01:30.640
it also mentions some information about the order of the posts and how they should show up in the index

17
01:30.640 --> 01:32.120
page.

18
01:32.350 --> 01:37.450
But we don't have to do anything about that if we call  the loop correctly which we already did.

19
01:37.800 --> 01:42.430
Then this post will appear at the top without us having to do anything.

20
01:42.450 --> 01:51.610
So we have another post here, "Markup: HTML Tags and Formatting". So let's open this in a new tab and this will

21
01:51.610 --> 01:56.880
just list all the HTML elements that you can add when you create a post.

22
01:56.890 --> 02:03.390
So we just have to make sure that these elements are styled correctly. So you know like tables and lists

23
02:03.390 --> 02:05.270
and stuff like that.

24
02:05.310 --> 02:07.470
So this will be mainly a CSS stuff

25
02:10.190 --> 02:15.040
and a PHP code wise we don't have to do anything about it.

26
02:15.170 --> 02:24.440
That will be purely CSS. We also have image alignment.

27
02:24.460 --> 02:32.240
So when you're creating a post, let's edit this post. When you're creating a post you can choose to align images left

28
02:32.240 --> 02:40.330
or right or center. And then WordPress will add some classes, let's inspect here.

29
02:41.120 --> 02:43.380
Like "aligncenter" class as you can see here.

30
02:43.470 --> 02:50.420
Or maybe it's "alignleft". And so it's your job now to style these classes to appear correctly here.

31
02:50.720 --> 02:51.960
And we already did that.

32
02:52.010 --> 03:00.690
Remembering the in the when we were loading our CSS we loaded a file called _wp and this file actually

33
03:00.690 --> 03:03.330
contains all of these classes.

34
03:03.450 --> 03:07.160
So if you loaded this file you will be fine here.

35
03:10.240 --> 03:17.430
But also make sure to read, this text is not just dummy text. It's actually explains what should be appearing here.

36
03:17.440 --> 03:21.860
So make sure to read these posts and make sure everything is fine.

37
03:24.200 --> 03:31.250
We have also "Text Alignment". And same idea, it adds some classes and you should align it in your CSS

38
03:31.280 --> 03:33.140
left or right or 

39
03:33.380 --> 03:34.870
justify.

40
03:35.090 --> 03:36.020
We also have

41
03:39.610 --> 03:45.110
some special characters. So you should check this table and make sure characters appear correctly here.

42
03:47.230 --> 03:50.710
We have "Title With Markup". So this

43
03:51.660 --> 03:53.360
this post in the title.

44
03:53.360 --> 03:56.680
It has an I tag in it so the "With" here.

45
03:57.470 --> 03:59.130
Let's edit post.

46
03:59.360 --> 04:01.010
And as you can see I tag in the "With" and

47
04:01.060 --> 04:05.220
bold in the "Markup". And this "With" reflect correctly here.

48
04:09.290 --> 04:14.510
We have a long featured image. You should make sure that if you have long featured image it should

49
04:14.810 --> 04:23.000
somehow display correctly. And also a horizontal featured image. Let's go to the next page and we have

50
04:23.000 --> 04:24.100
the "More Tag".

51
04:24.410 --> 04:31.890
So when you are creating a post you can add a "more tag" which is this line here. And you can add it by

52
04:32.030 --> 04:38.330
clicking on this. And this means that any content after this line should not appear in

53
04:38.330 --> 04:41.660
the excerpts. And you won't have to do anything about this.

54
04:41.660 --> 04:44.180
The excerpt() function will take care of this.

55
04:44.180 --> 04:45.690
We also have "Defined Excerpt".

56
04:45.770 --> 04:54.940
So if we added this post you can see that you can define an excerpt here. And if this is defined it will

57
04:54.940 --> 04:56.290
appear here. Otherwise

58
04:56.290 --> 04:58.160
sorry here.

59
04:58.360 --> 05:01.990
Otherwise the excerpt should be generated from the content.

60
05:02.290 --> 05:03.140
The excerpt() function will

61
05:03.160 --> 05:04.760
also take care of this.

62
05:04.780 --> 05:06.280
You don't have to do anything about it.

63
05:08.480 --> 05:17.770
So this is a generated excerpt. And this is a "Paginated" post. So WordPress has a feature where you can

64
05:18.240 --> 05:20.590
when you are creating a post,

65
05:20.950 --> 05:23.680
you can create a paginated post.

66
05:23.740 --> 05:30.880
So here we have Page 1 and Page 2 and Page 3. But here we only have Page 1 and we don't have any pagination

67
05:30.930 --> 05:31.450
here.

68
05:31.510 --> 05:34.380
So this is something that we have to tackle.

69
05:34.810 --> 05:43.460
So in the content and after we display the content we should call a function called wp_link_pages().

70
05:43.460 --> 05:45.510
wp_link_pages().

71
05:46.060 --> 05:48.250
So let's see what this will do.

72
05:50.450 --> 05:53.650
And as you can see it added pagination to the post.

73
05:53.650 --> 05:58.650
So if we now click on to, it will be "Post Page 2" and so on.

74
05:58.880 --> 06:03.330
And this function also takes, it can take some arguments. You can check it's the documentation if you want to

75
06:03.330 --> 06:05.900
change the HTML markup for it.

76
06:08.160 --> 06:14.350
So let's close these and we have the "Sticky" post. It should appear also in the correct order.

77
06:14.460 --> 06:16.510
So sticky posts appear twice.

78
06:16.680 --> 06:17.770
At the very top.

79
06:17.820 --> 06:24.290
And then again in the correct order. We also have a "Password Protected" post.

80
06:24.490 --> 06:27.070
So when you create a post you can protect it with a password.

81
06:27.340 --> 06:30.760
And this will also be taken care of automatically.

82
06:30.760 --> 06:32.310
You don't have to do anything about it.

83
06:32.320 --> 06:42.280
Just make sure it's working fine and the password is "enter". So if you click the password the content should appear.

84
06:42.880 --> 06:46.970
And we have "Comments" but we haven't displayed any comments yet.

85
06:47.050 --> 06:52.310
And we'll take care of this in maybe a separate section. So let's ignore this for now.

86
06:55.320 --> 07:02.020
And also comments, this will be in the comments section. Also "Pingbacks and Trackbacks" will be in the comments

87
07:02.020 --> 07:03.700
section.

88
07:04.030 --> 07:11.930
We have "Embeds". I'll just make sure that when you  embed a twitter post it will be displayed correctly.

89
07:15.790 --> 07:20.810
We have post formats and we'll also have a separate section for this.

90
07:20.820 --> 07:23.820
So let's ignore all the posts with post formats for

91
07:23.870 --> 07:24.230
now.

92
07:28.290 --> 07:30.310
We have for example a post with a long title.

93
07:34.160 --> 07:38.630
So you should make sure that if this word,long word here.

94
07:38.860 --> 07:40.160
So let's have, let's try

95
07:43.660 --> 07:52.150
and decrease the viewport width.

96
07:52.300 --> 07:59.110
So yes, we should make sure that when this title's width is larger than the content's width it won't be cut off.

97
07:59.120 --> 08:07.550
So whatever it is added the "word-break:  break all" here. And also in the H1.

98
08:08.180 --> 08:12.430
So if you don't have these, as you can see the word will be cut off because it's a long word.

99
08:12.770 --> 08:21.740
So I think these CSS styles will solve this problem. And everything is explained here as well in the content

100
08:21.740 --> 08:25.750
of the post. We also have post without a title.

101
08:25.960 --> 08:29.610
And as it mentions here you should have a link somewhere that will go to the post.

102
08:29.630 --> 08:33.750
So we have the link in date and we have a "Read More" link as well.

103
08:34.270 --> 08:41.530
And we've post with no content should also see how that will look like.

104
08:41.640 --> 08:50.640
We've already seen the "Many Categories" and "Many Tags". And we have some "Nested Lists" so you should make 

105
08:50.640 --> 08:53.630
sure that these are styled correctly also.

106
08:54.390 --> 08:57.240
So as you can see this will be mainly CSS stuff.

107
08:57.240 --> 09:01.300
So we only had to add the post pagination thing.

108
09:01.410 --> 09:03.720
Other than that it will be mainly styling.

109
09:03.990 --> 09:05.430
So let's in the next lecture that

110
09:05.460 --> 09:11.220
also, if you go to Gutenberg here and Demo,

111
09:13.990 --> 09:25.870
you'll have this dummy post that showcases Gutenberg's features. So let's publish this post and let's see

112
09:25.870 --> 09:31.290
what we can do with our theme to be more compatible with the Gutenberg editor.
