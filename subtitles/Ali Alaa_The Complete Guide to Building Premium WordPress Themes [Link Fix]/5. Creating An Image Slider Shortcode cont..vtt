00:03.240 --> 00:09.750
So in the last lecture we started a slider shortcode. So let's carry on now. Let's create another shortcode that

1
00:09.750 --> 00:11.830
will display one single slide.

2
00:12.420 --> 00:18.610
So let's call add_shortcode() and then this one will be "_themename_slide".

3
00:21.440 --> 00:23.980
And let's create function with the same name.

4
00:29.460 --> 00:32.690
And it will also receive these arguments.

5
00:35.290 --> 00:40.580
And let's copy this and we have two attributes for the slide.

6
00:40.600 --> 00:48.440
We have the "image" and this will be, let's default it to null, this will be an ID of an image in your 

7
00:48.500 --> 00:54.350
WordPress media. And a "caption". And default it to

8
00:54.650 --> 01:02.930
an empty string. First let's give a class to our slider because we will have to use JavaScript to initialize

9
01:03.020 --> 01:04.070
the slider.

10
01:04.280 --> 01:11.960
So let's call it "_themename-slider". And let's start outputting these in the slides. So we will have a variable

11
01:11.980 --> 01:15.720
called $o and each slide will be a DIV.

12
01:15.890 --> 01:22.830
And let's give it a class "_thename-slide". And let's close dis DIV.

13
01:23.030 --> 01:27.370
And then inside of here we'll have to output the image and the caption.

14
01:27.410 --> 01:28.240
Right?

15
01:28.280 --> 01:32.000
So let's first do a check that we have an image.

16
01:32.450 --> 01:37.160
And if so we will concatenate this image to our $o variable.

17
01:37.170 --> 01:44.050
So we have an image ID and to get an image from an image ID we use a function called wp_get_attachment_image().

18
01:44.360 --> 01:48.740
And this will take the ID for the image and it'll take a size.

19
01:48.840 --> 01:50.210
Let's say "large".

20
01:53.000 --> 02:01.460
And let's do the same for the caption. "if ($caption)" we need to output a DIV and maybe add a class for styling.

21
02:01.680 --> 02:10.130
So  "themename-slide-caption". And we'll output the caption and also escape it.

22
02:10.130 --> 02:19.630
So let's go back now to our page. And there's you can see we still have the opening DIV without any content

23
02:19.720 --> 02:20.900
inside of it.

24
02:21.220 --> 02:28.420
And that's because we actually, we have the content inside our shortcode which will be passed here but we're

25
02:28.420 --> 02:30.190
not using it anywhere here.

26
02:31.180 --> 02:33.590
So let's inside these two DIVs

27
02:33.700 --> 02:38.900
do a quick check. So we'll check is not null for the content.

28
02:38.910 --> 02:46.440
So if we have slides inside our shortcode, we will display our slides. And how to do that is by calling

29
02:46.710 --> 02:47.430
do_shortcode(),

30
02:47.620 --> 02:50.780
as we learned in the first lecture.

31
02:50.850 --> 03:02.020
So "do_shortcode()" and then the content, right? So this will find all the "_themename_slide" and will run

32
03:02.020 --> 03:06.750
this function and will put the HTML for each slide.

33
03:06.800 --> 03:07.540
So let's see here.

34
03:14.550 --> 03:19.280
And we forgot to return our content here.

35
03:19.280 --> 03:19.480
Sorry.

36
03:27.460 --> 03:35.120
As you can see we have our images. And this image we have a caption. But also as you can see we have some

37
03:35.650 --> 03:37.110
empty P tags here.

38
03:38.370 --> 03:43.940
So let's ignore this for now and we'll deal with it probably in the next lecture or something.

39
03:44.020 --> 03:49.140
But now that last step we need to do is to initialize the Slick Slider for this DIV.

40
03:49.680 --> 03:51.190
So let's do that.

41
03:52.170 --> 03:55.240
Let's create a new file in our slider folder.

42
03:55.380 --> 04:09.830
And let's call it slider.js. And let's go to bundle.js and import this file. So "import" and we go up and up and

43
04:09.840 --> 04:15.860
up and then "includes/shortcodes/slider/

44
04:18.550 --> 04:21.080
slider.js".

45
04:21.180 --> 04:29.470
And inside of slider.js let's "import $ from 'jquery'". And on "$(document).ready()"

46
04:30.150 --> 04:38.840
let's get the "_themename-slider" and initialize Slick Slideron it, right?

47
04:40.670 --> 04:42.120
So let's take a look now.

48
04:45.000 --> 04:54.160
And also we've actually forgot to import Slick Slider. We have to do that also in the bundle. And to import Slick Slider

49
04:54.240 --> 04:56.490
we'll have to go to the node_modules folder

50
05:00.380 --> 05:03.390
and then "slick-carousel".

51
05:04.400 --> 05:13.180
So let's actually go to inside our plugin. Let's go to node_modules and see where the Slick Slider file

52
05:13.190 --> 05:14.080
is located.

53
05:14.270 --> 05:21.640
So here we have the folder and then slick  and then slick.min.js. So.

54
05:25.380 --> 05:33.990
And let's save this. And let's refresh. And now our plugin is initialized but we still have to load

55
05:34.000 --> 05:35.600
CSS for Slick Slider also.

56
05:35.810 --> 05:37.780
So this will be located in the in the node_modules as well.

57
05:37.780 --> 05:39.650
So let's go to bundle.scss

58
05:42.890 --> 05:44.110
and let's import.

59
05:51.110 --> 05:54.820
Right? So let's refresh now.

60
05:55.400 --> 05:57.070
And we still have our plugin initialized.

61
05:57.200 --> 06:03.100
But since we have some extra P tags as we saw, we have some extra empty slides.

62
06:03.230 --> 06:09.130
So let's see in the next lecture why these empty P tags appear and how to solve this problem.

63
06:09.220 --> 06:11.910
But before that let's do a quick test for our options.

64
06:11.930 --> 06:18.870
So we have the "autoplay". So let's set it to "true" and also the "arrows".

65
06:19.010 --> 06:20.050
Let's set it to "true".

66
06:33.700 --> 06:41.180
As you can see it's auto playing and we also have the arrows, next button and a previous button.

67
06:41.320 --> 06:43.650
So let's see the next lecture the P tags problem.
