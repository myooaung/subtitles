So in the last lecture we started writing a custom comment callback.

1
00:07.710 --> 00:10.900
So let's carry on now. We need to display the content of the comments.

2
00:10.920 --> 00:11.490
So let's

3
00:14.400 --> 00:24.350
after the date, let's call a function called comment_text(). And it doesn't need any arguments.

4
00:28.190 --> 00:32.170
And as you can see now we have the content of the comment.

5
00:32.260 --> 00:38.170
One more thing you can add to the comments. We have in the Discussion Settings in the wp-admin.

6
00:38.170 --> 00:40.450
You can choose to approve comments manually

7
00:40.490 --> 00:46.120
every time someone writes a comment. So when someone writes a comment his comment will appear, but only him will

8
00:46.120 --> 00:54.550
be able to see it until the admin approves it. So it will be nice to display a message to the user just

9
00:54.550 --> 01:03.450
to let him know that his comment is still being reviewed, right? So to do that we can open PHP and then with an if condition

10
01:04.160 --> 01:12.480
we will get the comment_approved property from the $comment object. And if that's equals to 0,

11
01:12.720 --> 01:15.160
that means the comment is not approved.

12
01:15.240 --> 01:22.350
So let's close PHP and in a P tag, I'm gonna give it a class

13
01:22.410 --> 01:33.610
"c-comment__awaiting-moderation" and then echo some escaped and translated text.

14
01:34.240 --> 01:41.880
So maybe "Your comment is awaiting moderation". And of course our text domain.

15
01:45.770 --> 01:49.140
So great, now we find indeed

16
01:49.460 --> 01:54.110
as you can see here there is no "Reply" link. And to output the "Reply" link

17
01:54.200 --> 01:59.000
we use a function called comment_reply_link(). So after the comment text

18
01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
let's use this function. And it can take some arguments in an array.

19
02:08.170 --> 02:13.890
Let's see without the arguments what will happen. And we can't see anything, right?

20
02:14.390 --> 02:16.970
So this function needs some arguments to appear.

21
02:16.970 --> 02:21.830
It needs a"depth", the depth of the current comment. And we already have that in the arguments here.

22
02:26.450 --> 02:35.570
And it also needs a "max_depth". And the maximum depth will be available in the arguments, in second argument

23
02:37.400 --> 02:38.250
So "$args

24
02:38.630 --> 02:43.540
"$args['max_depth']"

25
02:43.650 --> 02:46.090
And as you can see we now have the button.

26
02:46.270 --> 02:50.220
And now if you click on it the Reply form will appear.

27
02:50.340 --> 02:52.130
But let's go to, let's click cancel.

28
02:52.140 --> 02:59.630
Let's go to the first page where we had a nested comment. And let's now try to reply to this one and as you

29
02:59.630 --> 03:06.440
can see the form will appear after the comment and after it's replies as well. I think it's much better

30
03:06.440 --> 03:11.520
for the reply form to appear just below the comment that we are replying to.

31
03:11.540 --> 03:12.300
Right?

32
03:12.680 --> 03:21.050
So this comment_reply_link() function also takes an argument called "add_below" and this will be an ID for

33
03:21.050 --> 03:22.040
an HTML element.

34
03:22.130 --> 03:23.790
So let's call it "div-

35
03:23.940 --> 03:24.720
"div-comment"

36
03:26.260 --> 03:28.660
And what this argument to do it will ad

37
03:28.720 --> 03:37.220
the Reply form after a DIV that has this ID concatenated with dash and the ID of the comment.

38
03:37.240 --> 03:44.410
So in other words we need the comment, the Reply form to be added after this comment, after the ARTICLE

39
03:44.410 --> 03:45.000
tag,

40
03:45.130 --> 03:51.290
right? And before the children. So we needed to be added after the ARTICLE tag. So we'll just have to give

41
03:51.290 --> 03:59.660
the ARTICLE tag and ID of "div-comment" which we added here. And then "-" the comment ID. So let's do that.

42
03:59.660 --> 04:05.940
Let's go to the ARTICLE and give it an ID. And you can copy this.

43
04:10.730 --> 04:21.380
And let's see now. And as you can see the Reply link will be added just after the ARTICLE tag for the comment. This function

44
04:21.380 --> 04:23.510
also takes "before" and "after".

45
04:23.510 --> 04:27.940
If you would like to wrap your reply link in some HTML element.

46
04:28.100 --> 04:36.410
So in my case I added a class of "c-comment__reply-link". And

47
04:36.410 --> 04:39.080
then "after" just close the DIV.

48
04:44.770 --> 04:48.390
And I just styled this DIV to be aligned to the right here.

49
04:49.580 --> 04:52.430
So that's mainly it. What you need to do next is 

50
04:52.490 --> 04:58.220
you need to check all the test comments. And you need to check that everything is styled properly and

51
04:58.370 --> 05:00.030
also functions properly.

52
05:00.110 --> 05:07.970
Let's go to the other page. So these comments test your HTML elements. And this cells you

53
05:07.970 --> 05:09.850
this is an anonymous user.

54
05:10.010 --> 05:12.590
There should not be a Gravatar associated with it.

55
05:12.690 --> 05:16.360
If you activate the Gravatar service you can try it out.

56
05:16.370 --> 05:20.390
There should not be a gravatar appearing here. And this will happen automatically, you won't have to

57
05:20.390 --> 05:21.650
do anything about it.

58
05:21.650 --> 05:27.680
We also have an "Author Comments". And usually Author Comments like Sticky Posts should be styled a bit

59
05:27.680 --> 05:28.490
differently.

60
05:28.700 --> 05:32.140
So an Aythor Comment means a comment by the author of the post.

61
05:32.330 --> 05:34.820
But apparently this is not an author comment.

62
05:35.000 --> 05:37.510
So let's try to do this ourselves real quick here.

63
05:37.610 --> 05:45.290
Let's go to the post that we created as an admin. And let's type a comment.

64
05:48.660 --> 05:57.160
And let's inspect. And you'll find that since this is your post, the comment_class() function will generate a function

65
05:57.160 --> 05:58.140
called byuser().

66
05:58.270 --> 06:02.980
So you should go to your CSS and style this "byuser"class a bit differently.

67
06:02.980 --> 06:08.590
You should Author Comment stand out a little bit more than normal comments. So

68
06:09.780 --> 06:12.900
let's go back, we need to do one more thing

69
06:17.340 --> 06:26.440
So we created this callback function, but let's assume some child theme developer wants to override the comments.

70
06:26.470 --> 06:35.950
comments.php template. And maybe he needs to change this to 300 and change the reply text as we did.

71
06:36.150 --> 06:38.850
But he also wants to still use your callback.

72
06:39.200 --> 06:46.160
So if you take a look now you'll find that the reply text is still "Reply" and the avatar is still the size is not

73
06:46.340 --> 06:47.470
not changed.

74
06:47.650 --> 06:50.350
So when we're writing a callback function for the comments,

75
06:50.350 --> 06:56.720
we need take these arguments into consideration. So let's see what we should do in the next lecture.
