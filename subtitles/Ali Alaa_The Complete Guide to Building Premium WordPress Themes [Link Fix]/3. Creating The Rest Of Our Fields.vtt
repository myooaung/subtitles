00:01.850 --> 00:09.000
So in the last lecture we added the Title field to our widget. Let's now add the rest of our fields. We still

1
00:09.000 --> 00:16.950
need a checkbox to display the dates and number of posts and we will also add a dropdown for the post sorting.

2
00:17.460 --> 00:19.150
So let's do that.

3
00:19.170 --> 00:25.030
I know this lecture can be a bit boring, we'll type some HTML here for the fields.

4
00:25.480 --> 00:27.800
So let's start by the number of posts

5
00:27.810 --> 00:35.880
maybe. It will be similar to this one, but we will have to change some stuff in it. So let's copy the title

6
00:36.770 --> 00:39.150
and let's see what we'll have to change.

7
00:39.150 --> 00:42.730
So of course we will change the "title" to "post_count"

8
00:42.810 --> 00:56.320
maybe. And we'll also change this to "Number Of Posts:". And in the inputs, we will instead of title, I've  "post_count"

9
00:56.320 --> 00:59.290
in the ID and in the name.

10
00:59.800 --> 01:09.880
And the "type" will be a "number". And let's add a minimum number 1. And let's remove the value for now and then

11
01:09.880 --> 01:15.710
we'll see what we will have to do when we save and sanitize.

12
01:15.770 --> 01:16.550
So let's take a look.

13
01:20.020 --> 01:23.890
And we have number field here. And in case you are wondering,

14
01:25.240 --> 01:30.700
this is how the IDs and the names that WordPress generates look like

15
01:35.350 --> 01:40.660
as you can see. WordPress just make sure its a unique ID and name,

16
01:40.720 --> 01:46.430
in case you have multiple instances of the same widget, right?

17
01:46.690 --> 01:52.390
So anyways lets now create a checkbox for display the date.

18
01:56.290 --> 01:58.460
So we need another P tag.

19
02:01.620 --> 02:10.220
Let's create an INPUT of "type="checkbox"". And it will also have an ID and a name,

20
02:10.230 --> 02:12.600
but let's copy these from here.

21
02:15.830 --> 02:19.940
And modify this to "include_date".

22
02:24.240 --> 02:35.010
And then a LABEL, we'll also have a "for" attribute. So let's copy and change "post_count" to "include_date". And

23
02:35.010 --> 02:36.020
inside the LABEL

24
02:36.120 --> 02:47.200
we will have to output some escaped and translated string, right? So let's type "Include Date?"

25
02:51.230 --> 02:56.580
and text domain.

26
02:56.630 --> 02:58.260
So this should be LABEL.

27
02:58.630 --> 03:00.470
I think that's it for the LABEL. Let's take a look.

28
03:05.350 --> 03:06.860
And we have it

29
03:06.880 --> 03:16.930
here. Finally we'll all have our dropdown. So let's add a new P tag. And we'll need to add a LABEL.

30
03:17.010 --> 03:18.720
Let's copy one of these.

31
03:18.720 --> 03:20.600
I just don't want to waste your time, 

32
03:20.760 --> 03:26.610
you know, typing all of that. Let's just modify this to "sort_by".

33
03:26.620 --> 03:32.700
And here "sort_by".

34
03:34.060 --> 03:39.390
And then let's create a dropdown. So SELECT tag, let's give it a class

35
03:39.410 --> 03:44.150
also "widefat". And it will need an ID and a name, ok?

36
03:44.250 --> 03:45.910
So let's copy one of these

37
03:48.970 --> 03:56.880
and change the name of the field to "sort_by".

38
03:57.130 --> 03:59.670
Sorry let's close

39
04:00.110 --> 04:05.440
the SELECT tag. And let's add some options.

40
04:05.440 --> 04:07.460
So this one will be.

41
04:07.820 --> 04:10.770
So let's first take a look at the WP_Query class.

42
04:10.810 --> 04:18.850
Remember we took a look at this in one of the early lectures. So this will allow us to retrieve some

43
04:18.850 --> 04:20.780
posts from WordPress, right?

44
04:21.400 --> 04:23.190
So let's go to the sorting.

45
04:23.370 --> 04:32.860
Let's do a Ctrl+F and "sort_by". So you can sort by these things: "date", "type", "name". So let's choose some of these

46
04:33.160 --> 04:34.630
and put them in the options.

47
04:34.660 --> 04:39.960
So let's do the "date" and maybe "rand" and "comment_count", right?

48
04:41.100 --> 04:43.270
So the value for this one will be "date".

49
04:49.690 --> 05:00.770
And here we'll have to output an escaped and translated string. So let's say "Most Recent". And let's create

50
05:00.990 --> 05:01.750
two more.

51
05:01.920 --> 05:06.680
So this will be "rand" and here it'll be "Random".

52
05:09.410 --> 05:12.060
And "comment_count".

53
05:14.760 --> 05:19.020
And let's type here "Number Of Comments".

54
05:19.490 --> 05:20.520
So let's take a look.

55
05:23.830 --> 05:28.470
And now we have a dropdown with our options.

56
05:28.470 --> 05:29.780
All right.

57
05:30.310 --> 05:33.040
So now we have a list of fields.

58
05:33.360 --> 05:36.720
Let's them write to save and sanitize in the update() function.

59
05:37.070 --> 05:43.780
But before that I just want to point out something is actually a mistake I did. Remember in the update() function 

60
05:44.360 --> 05:51.870
we use the is_set() here to make sure we have the title in the $new_instance before sanitizing.

61
05:52.080 --> 05:52.670
Right?

62
05:53.040 --> 06:00.310
But that's actually unnecessary because the update() function will always run to the form() function.

63
06:00.450 --> 06:05.580
So the form() function will run and rendered fields and then when you click Save the update() function

64
06:05.580 --> 06:11.860
will run. And when the update() function runs the $new_instance will have all the fields here.

65
06:13.520 --> 06:20.150
So in this $new_instance we are sure that we have the "title" inside of it. So we can remove this. And just

66
06:20.300 --> 06:23.620
sanitize the value that we typed.

67
06:23.680 --> 06:24.210
Right?

68
06:27.150 --> 06:31.630
In the form() function we still should check for is_set().

69
06:31.860 --> 06:32.760
Why?

70
06:33.300 --> 06:35.720
Let's go back now to the admin.

71
06:35.720 --> 06:47.490
We are still var_dumping the $instance. And let's try and add our widget again from here to the sidebar. And as

72
06:47.490 --> 06:53.710
you can see at the very beginning the $instance array will be empty. The first time you drag it from here to

73
06:53.710 --> 06:54.540
here.

74
06:54.820 --> 06:56.160
It will be empty.

75
06:56.200 --> 07:02.710
So that's why you have to check first if is_set() "title" of instance to make sure that we have this variable

76
07:03.280 --> 07:05.410
before actually using it.

77
07:05.410 --> 07:10.490
And if you don't have this value we will display the default value that we want this field to have. So let's

78
07:10.500 --> 07:11.270
say

79
07:11.440 --> 07:15.670
it's not an empty string, let's say some other string.

80
07:17.210 --> 07:21.820
And let's try. Let's remove this and let's try to add another one.

81
07:23.740 --> 07:30.430
So now it says default but now let's refresh.

82
07:30.570 --> 07:36.090
And as you can see it's saved. And also some of you thought it would be an empty string because you haven't saved

83
07:36.090 --> 07:37.840
anything you just dragged it.

84
07:37.980 --> 07:46.550
But actually when you drag a widget from here to here, it will be saved automatically for the first time.

85
07:46.550 --> 07:52.370
So what happens is, we dragged our Recent Post widget, the form() function ran to display the form. We

86
07:52.370 --> 07:58.480
checked if we have the "title" field. And in our case it was at first time we drag it so we didn't have it.

87
07:58.490 --> 08:03.620
So the $title" was set to "default" and we use the "title" here in the value for the input.

88
08:04.010 --> 08:08.900
And after this WordPress will automatically save your widget when you drag it for the first time.

89
08:08.900 --> 08:15.950
So this function will run and the $new_instance will contain the "title" and the "title" will be the value

90
08:16.220 --> 08:21.670
in this field which is the default title that we added, right?

91
08:22.320 --> 08:28.290
So I just wanted you to know this because when we sanitize the rest of our fields that's what we will

92
08:28.290 --> 08:28.830
do.

93
08:28.880 --> 08:30.510
Here we will just sanitize.

94
08:31.080 --> 08:37.210
And here we will check that the key exists and if not we will add a default value,

95
08:37.410 --> 08:38.420
right?

96
08:38.460 --> 08:40.040
So let's in the next lecture

97
08:40.250 --> 08:43.710
sanitize and display the rest of our fields.

98
08:43.960 --> 08:44.850
See you in the next lecture.
