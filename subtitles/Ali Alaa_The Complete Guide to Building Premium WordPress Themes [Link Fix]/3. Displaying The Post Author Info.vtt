00:03.380 --> 00:10.650
So in the last lecture we've done the content for the single blog post. Let's now add some more information about the blog post which

1
00:10.650 --> 00:19.740
is the author's info. So in WordPress any user, So let's go to Users here. And then your profile. So any user

2
00:19.740 --> 00:22.620
can type some information about himself here.

3
00:22.950 --> 00:25.260
So let's type some.

4
00:34.310 --> 00:40.130
And let's save. So let's now go to the single.php.

5
00:41.090 --> 00:46.000
So after the contents we need to display here the author info.

6
00:46.350 --> 00:48.590
So let's create a template part for that.

7
00:48.850 --> 00:54.130
And you already know the benefits of adding this template part rather than just coding it here directly.

8
00:54.550 --> 01:01.340
So let's go to template-parts. Let's create a new folder "single". And inside of single

9
01:01.340 --> 01:05.600
let's create a new file author.php.

10
01:08.620 --> 01:10.850
And now to import this file,

11
01:10.970 --> 01:19.830
let's duplicate this "post" to "single" and then "author".

12
01:21.080 --> 01:22.860
So this won't be hard.

13
01:22.970 --> 01:25.820
You'll just use some functions to get the information about the author.

14
01:25.970 --> 01:27.360
So let's open a new DIV

15
01:27.590 --> 01:29.670
and I have a class called

16
01:29.960 --> 01:40.730
"c-post-author". And let's add margin and let's add an H2 tag.

17
01:41.330 --> 01:53.820
And inside of it let's add, let's open a PHP  tag and output and escaped and translated text. And let's type a

18
01:53.820 --> 02:02.740
title "About The Author" and "_themename". But in my design

19
02:02.760 --> 02:05.490
I don't really want to display this text.

20
02:05.560 --> 02:10.710
This title will just help screen readers to know what this section is about.

21
02:10.740 --> 02:15.670
So this is one more accessibility to appear. When screen readers browse your website

22
02:15.720 --> 02:19.720
they can browse by titles, by H1 tags and H2 tags.

23
02:20.010 --> 02:25.350
So when you create a new section in your website that you need screen readers to be able to navigate

24
02:25.350 --> 02:31.110
to using the title. But you don't want to display the title in your website you can of course add a class

25
02:31.350 --> 02:37.520
"u-screen-reader-text". And then we can carry on.

26
02:37.870 --> 02:40.290
So let's open a PHP tag and let's define

27
02:40.350 --> 02:44.730
some variables or actually a lot of variables.

28
02:44.730 --> 02:52.560
So we need the author ID of this post and to get that we will call get_the_author_meta(). And this function

29
02:52.560 --> 02:56.580
will retrieve any meta information that belongs to a user.

30
02:56.580 --> 02:58.030
So in our case we need the ID.

31
02:58.080 --> 03:06.180
So its called "ID". And we need the number of posts for this author. We'll display the number of posts.

32
03:06.550 --> 03:11.760
So $author_posts. And there is a function for that.

33
03:11.910 --> 03:16.960
Its called get_the_author_posts(). This will return

34
03:16.970 --> 03:22.190
the number of posts. We also need the display name for the author.

35
03:22.310 --> 03:30.340
So if you noticed when we were adding this information there is a "Display name as". So you can choose how

36
03:30.340 --> 03:35.120
to display your name whether you need a first name or last name or a nickname.

37
03:35.170 --> 03:38.770
So this what will be returned by the function that we will call now.

38
03:38.770 --> 03:49.550
So let's add a variable $author_display. And let's call get_the_author(). You also need a link that will take

39
03:49.550 --> 03:55.480
us to the archive for this author. So $author_posts_url.

40
03:59.680 --> 04:07.140
And get_author_posts_url().

41
04:07.430 --> 04:13.340
So this will return a link that will take you to the archive that will display the posts only for

42
04:13.340 --> 04:14.090
this author.

43
04:14.390 --> 04:19.520
But this function actually needs an ID. So lets give it the $author_id.

44
04:19.520 --> 04:23.950
And finally, not finally we'll need the $author_description.

45
04:26.430 --> 04:29.890
Which is the bio that we typed the dummy text.

46
04:29.910 --> 04:36.490
So get_the_author_meta(). And this field is called "user_underscore_description".

47
04:40.620 --> 04:45.770
And to know the names of the fields, let's go to this function.

48
04:50.380 --> 04:56.780
And you'll have all the available fields for the get_author_meta function.

49
04:58.150 --> 05:00.990
So let's carry on. We finally will need the website.

50
05:01.270 --> 05:06.270
So let's $author_website.

51
05:06.790 --> 05:09.120
And this will also be in the meta function

52
05:12.790 --> 05:16.120
And it's "user_url".

53
05:16.360 --> 05:18.950
So we now have all the information about the user.

54
05:19.040 --> 05:20.830
We just have to display it.

55
05:21.100 --> 05:25.080
So let's display the, we have an avatar here.

56
05:25.510 --> 05:34.540
So let's display it. So "class" and I'm aware that this section is a bit boring but I have to do it.

57
05:39.480 --> 05:45.520
And to get the avatar we will echo and then get_avatar(),

58
05:48.860 --> 05:49.410
right?

59
05:49.430 --> 05:52.690
And this needs the ID of the author.

60
05:52.970 --> 05:58.100
So we already have that. And it takes a "size" also.

61
05:58.180 --> 05:59.640
So the avatar will be square.

62
05:59.710 --> 06:02.970
So the size will be the width and the height of the photo.

63
06:03.550 --> 06:10.940
So just choose any number. And let's see now.

64
06:10.980 --> 06:13.320
Now we have the avatar for this user.

65
06:13.590 --> 06:22.290
So let's now add some more information. Lets add a new DIV and I'm gonna copy this. And instead of 

66
06:22.290 --> 06:22.780
"avatar"

67
06:25.340 --> 06:25.850
"content"

68
06:30.740 --> 06:36.680
So inside this content DIV we will display the title of the author or the name of the author and then the

69
06:36.680 --> 06:42.380
number of posts and then number of posts will be a URL that would take him to his archive

70
06:42.400 --> 06:46.140
the $author_posts_url. And then we will display his bio.

71
06:46.240 --> 06:47.350
Right?

72
06:47.480 --> 06:50.840
So let's start by the name. So let's copy

73
06:50.910 --> 06:55.740
instead of typing the longer classes names.

74
06:58.940 --> 07:02.180
And this will be the "title".

75
07:03.110 --> 07:15.640
So let's open PHP and echo and make sure to escape HTML here. And we need the author display name.

76
07:15.900 --> 07:17.950
We already have that.

77
07:17.960 --> 07:25.030
So let's see now. And we have the name. But we also need this name to be a link that will take us to the

78
07:25.060 --> 07:26.920
website of this user.

79
07:27.070 --> 07:33.360
So let's add an anchor tag. And let's make this open in a new tab.

80
07:33.370 --> 07:43.270
So "target="_blank"" and close it after the name. And in the "href"  this will be

81
07:46.720 --> 07:49.710
the $author_website. But we also need to esc_url().

82
08:00.620 --> 08:04.820
But what if the user don't have a website like this one.

83
08:04.820 --> 08:13.790
We don't need to add an empty A tag. So let's first  go to a user like me that has a website.

84
08:16.850 --> 08:21.910
And it's working fine but we now need to add a condition to only display this A

85
08:21.950 --> 08:25.120
tag if the author website is available.

86
08:27.420 --> 08:29.320
So let's open PHP.

87
08:29.520 --> 08:32.050
And "if($author_website)"

88
08:34.990 --> 08:37.020
display this opening tag.

89
08:41.280 --> 08:44.850
And also we need to do the same for the closing tag.

90
08:49.860 --> 08:51.950
So now this is not a URL.

91
08:52.880 --> 09:01.490
And this is a URL. Great, let's now display the number of posts and I have a DIV class for 

92
09:01.490 --> 09:03.300
that called

93
09:04.100 --> 09:12.000
instead of "title", "info". And we said that we need this to be in an A tag that will take him to the posts

94
09:12.120 --> 09:14.010
URL or posts archive.

95
09:14.910 --> 09:28.160
So "echo esc_url( $author_posts_url )". And then inside the A tag we'll have to display the number of posts.

96
09:29.000 --> 09:32.250
So we have the numbers so let's open PHP.

97
09:32.680 --> 09:37.170
And we need to display a string that will say, if the number of post is singular,

98
09:37.190 --> 09:45.610
it will say "one post". If it's plural it will say "X posts". And this will also have to be escaped and translated.

99
09:45.620 --> 09:47.300
So you already know how to do that.

100
09:47.570 --> 09:53.880
Remember the lecture about internationalization when we mentioned a function called _n(). So 

101
09:53.900 --> 09:54.820
"_n()".

102
09:55.370 --> 09:58.120
And this will take the singular string and the plural string.

103
09:58.220 --> 10:02.730
But we need also a placeholder for the number, right?.

104
10:02.870 --> 10:11.480
So "%s post" and "%s posts" and the "number" which is the $author_posts.

105
10:14.290 --> 10:15.820
And our text domain.

106
10:16.410 --> 10:21.050
So this function will output, _n() function will output the placeholder post

107
10:21.170 --> 10:25.840
if the number is 1. Or the placeholder posts if the number is more than 1.

108
10:26.150 --> 10:30.470
But this function is not escaped and we don't have like the other function, we don't have

109
10:30.520 --> 10:33.080
esc_html_n().

110
10:33.170 --> 10:33.820
We don't have that.

111
10:33.830 --> 10:38.640
So we can just use esc_html() and wrap the _n() function with it.

112
10:39.980 --> 10:45.530
So what we need to do now is we need to the output of this function will be the first argument in

113
10:45.530 --> 10:49.260
the printf() in order to replace the placeholder.

114
10:52.120 --> 10:56.350
So the second argument will be the number which we want to replace the placeholder with.

115
10:56.680 --> 11:03.070
But when outputting any numbers you need to call a function called number_format_i18n,

116
11:03.400 --> 11:04.690
internationalization.

117
11:08.000 --> 11:16.870
And give it the number which would be the $author_posts. And this function will just convert the number to

118
11:16.870 --> 11:18.430
the format of the language.

119
11:18.430 --> 11:24.220
So for example in some languages if you have 1000 you will have to format the 1000 to 

120
11:24.220 --> 11:26.190
1,000.

121
11:26.320 --> 11:32.780
So this function will check if the current language and format the number according to this language.

122
11:32.960 --> 11:40.450
So let's save and see this. And as you can see we have the number of posts and if you click on it it will

123
11:40.450 --> 11:46.410
take us to the archive page where we will have the posts just for this author.

124
11:47.500 --> 11:56.420
Let's finally do the bio. So let's copy one of these and this will be called "description" or "desc".

125
12:00.660 --> 12:02.700
And let's open PHP and just echo

126
12:06.040 --> 12:07.380
and esc_html().

127
12:11.160 --> 12:18.790
And the $author_description. So this one doesn't have a bio

128
12:18.800 --> 12:22.550
but as you can see we now have the bio

129
12:22.750 --> 12:29.320
if the user has one. So great, as I told you I know this section is a bit boring so let's in the next lecture

130
12:29.320 --> 12:31.990
do something a little bit more interesting.

131
12:31.990 --> 12:38.170
Let's go back to the Customizer and add an option and this option will decide whether to display the

132
12:38.170 --> 12:40.450
author info in the single blog page or not.

133
12:40.510 --> 12:45.970
So we will do some things we have not done in the Customizer before. We'll use a checkbox and we also

134
12:45.970 --> 12:49.120
use another feature that you will see in the next lecture.
