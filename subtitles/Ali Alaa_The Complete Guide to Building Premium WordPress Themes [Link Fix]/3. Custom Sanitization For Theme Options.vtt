00:03.280 --> 00:08.580
So in the last lecture we've added this footer text and it's escaped and sanitized everything.

1
00:08.760 --> 00:13.380
But we actually need to allow some HTML like A tags to pass the sanitization.

2
00:13.530 --> 00:19.650
So instead of adding a sanitized_text_field() function here let's create our own function that will allow

3
00:19.650 --> 00:19.860
that.

4
00:19.860 --> 00:25.120
So let's add a name here that we will create in a moment.

5
00:25.120 --> 00:32.390
So "_themename_sanitize_site_info".

6
00:35.190 --> 00:37.310
And let's create this function here.

7
00:41.920 --> 00:45.700
And this function receives the value of the setting.

8
00:45.920 --> 00:53.330
Let's call it $input. So remembering one of the early lectures about validation and sanitization we mention a function

9
00:53.330 --> 00:58.630
called wp_kses(). And this function takes a string input and an array of allowed HTML.

10
00:58.760 --> 01:04.090
And what it does is that it removes any HTML except for the allowed once.

11
01:04.100 --> 01:07.280
So let's create a variable called $allowed.

12
01:08.210 --> 01:09.760
And this should be an array.

13
01:10.130 --> 01:12.440
And the keys for this array should be the allowed tags.

14
01:12.550 --> 01:18.630
So in our case the "a" tag and the value is also an array of allowed attributes.

15
01:18.680 --> 01:24.110
So we want to allow the "href" attribute and we don't need a specific value so we can add an empty

16
01:24.120 --> 01:24.640
array.

17
01:27.640 --> 01:29.710
We also would like to allow "title".

18
01:36.070 --> 01:38.920
And then we'll return the input.

19
01:38.930 --> 01:43.340
However we'll pass it first through the wp_kses() function.

20
01:43.520 --> 01:47.000
So it takes the $input and then the $allowed tags.

21
01:49.840 --> 01:54.110
But we actually escaping all HTML in the info.php template.

22
01:54.130 --> 01:58.460
So even if you managed to successfully save the A tags in the database it will be escape here.

23
01:58.470 --> 02:01.390
So we need to do the same thing here.

24
02:02.220 --> 02:03.720
So let's actually copy this

25
02:06.660 --> 02:07.320
and

26
02:10.830 --> 02:15.050
paste it here. And instead of "echo esc_html" we'll do the same thing. We'll "echo.

27
02:15.090 --> 02:15.670
wp_kses"

28
02:18.500 --> 02:23.030
the site info and the allowed text.

29
02:26.230 --> 02:28.260
So let's see how that will look like now.

30
02:28.400 --> 02:30.300
So let's refresh.

31
02:33.180 --> 02:38.570
Footer Options and let's add an A tag and "href".

32
02:46.770 --> 02:49.240
And great, as you can see it's now a link.

33
02:49.270 --> 02:59.680
So let's now add another tag like a SCRIPT tag.

34
02:59.910 --> 03:07.100
So I know this refreshing the iframe is annoying but doing way we tackle this in probably in the next lecture.

35
03:07.100 --> 03:14.080
So as you can see the SCRIPT tag is stripped here and it's only represented as text.

36
03:14.590 --> 03:21.030
So let's publish. And make sure it's saved properly to the database.

37
03:21.470 --> 03:25.720
And as you can see the SCRIPT tag is removed and the A tag is still there.

38
03:26.020 --> 03:33.270
And just to make sure if you add any attribute here other than the "href" and the "title". And let's inspect.

39
03:33.600 --> 03:34.150
Sorry.

40
03:40.900 --> 03:47.310
And as you can see we only have the "href". So let's add the "title" and inspect.

41
03:48.090 --> 03:49.150
And here we have it.

42
03:49.290 --> 03:53.320
So the wp_kses() function is very beneficial in these kind of situations.

43
03:53.520 --> 03:59.480
So I think that's it for this field except for the annoying refreshing the whole iframe thing.

44
03:59.730 --> 04:01.340
So let's tackle this in the next lecture.
