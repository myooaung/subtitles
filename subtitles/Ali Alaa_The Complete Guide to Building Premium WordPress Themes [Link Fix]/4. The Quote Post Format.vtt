Let's now do the Quote Post Format.

1
00:05.280 --> 00:17.540
So let's go to this post in the backend. And let's search for it. And let's edit it using the classic editor. And

2
00:17.610 --> 00:24.130
as you can see a quote post format will only have a blockquote which can be done using this button here.

3
00:24.800 --> 00:31.550
And what we'll have to do is also like the link post format, we'll have to display the blockquote and style

4
00:31.550 --> 00:36.990
it in a certain way like the link. And just display the date and the author.

5
00:36.990 --> 00:42.190
So when you create a blockquote in the editor it will generate a BLOCKQUOTE tag.

6
00:42.240 --> 00:43.790
So that's what we're gonna style.

7
00:43.890 --> 00:44.580
Ok?

8
00:45.000 --> 00:47.400
So let's create a new file

9
00:50.090 --> 00:51.870
content-quote.

10
00:54.960 --> 01:01.570
And it will be exactly like the link.

11
01:01.690 --> 01:08.870
And as you can see we have our blockquote style like the link. And I also used the class "format-quote"

12
01:08.870 --> 01:12.000
which is generated by "post" class.

13
01:12.020 --> 01:13.110
Let's do one more thing.

14
01:13.190 --> 01:18.740
Let's make sure that when you create a post using Gutenberg everything will be working fine.

15
01:18.740 --> 01:20.000
So let's create a new post.

16
01:23.220 --> 01:25.270
Let's call it "quote".

17
01:25.810 --> 01:30.660
And to add a quote here we add an element which is "Quote".

18
01:31.390 --> 01:35.010
And let's just write some text and we can also write a citation.

19
01:35.920 --> 01:48.990
And here we can choose post format "Quote" and let's publish. And let's view this post. And that's fine.

20
01:49.110 --> 01:56.240
We still have a blockquote and everything is looking fine. So let's go to the next post format it in the

21
01:56.240 --> 01:56.940
next lecture.

22
01:57.150 --> 01:59.010
I think we can do, the Chat 

23
01:59.440 --> 02:02.470
Post Format is a bit like the aside and the status,

24
02:02.520 --> 02:04.940
so I'm not gonna do that.

25
02:05.850 --> 02:08.630
Let's do the Image Post Format in the next lecture.
