In this section we'll learn how to create a navigation menu like this one which can have menus and sub 

1
00:09.360 --> 00:18.000
menus and also mega menus. And we'll also take some time to learn how to make this menu more accessible.

2
00:19.020 --> 00:25.890
By accessible I mean that you can navigate through it using the keyboard. I'm just using my keyboard

3
00:25.890 --> 00:32.460
here to navigate through the links.

4
00:32.680 --> 00:41.090
So let's close this one and let's, always make sure you have your MAMP server is open and I'm gonna

5
00:41.090 --> 00:42.150
change to my theme.

6
00:43.710 --> 00:45.020
And start "npm start".

7
00:54.890 --> 01:07.280
And let's go to the admin page in new tab. admin, admin. In the appearance menu here go to menus. And you will find this page

8
01:07.280 --> 01:16.610
where you can drag and drop pages or posts or you can create custom links and create a menu. So you can

9
01:16.670 --> 01:17.770
add a page here.

10
01:19.830 --> 01:24.560
And position it and make a submenu and save.

11
01:24.840 --> 01:30.570
But the question is how to display this menu in your websites. And the process is similar to adding

12
01:30.810 --> 01:32.320
this sidebar here.

13
01:32.340 --> 01:39.700
We first registered a sidebar and then we drag and drop some widgets. And then we displayed the sidebar.

14
01:39.750 --> 01:40.640
So let's do this.

15
01:40.710 --> 01:50.880
But this time for menus. So let's go to our folder and create a new file in the lib folder. And call it "navigation"

16
01:56.890 --> 01:59.100
and make sure you include this file in

17
01:59.110 --> 02:03.530
functions.php. So let's do that.

18
02:10.960 --> 02:15.410
And inside navigation let's open PHP tags and register our first menu.

19
02:15.680 --> 02:30.600
So let's create a new function and prefix. Let's call it "register_menus". And to register a menu

20
02:30.700 --> 02:41.890
we need to hook into an action called "init". And let's give it the function that we will create now.

21
02:42.350 --> 02:52.010
So inside this function we'll call, like the register_sidebar(), we'll call a function called "register_nav _menus()". And

22
02:52.010 --> 03:00.410
it takes an array of locations. And we'll see what locations mean in a moment. So let's create an array and

23
03:02.980 --> 03:07.270
and inside the array we'll create a location called "main-menu".

24
03:10.050 --> 03:15.450
And this is the key and the value is a string that will appear in the admin area.

25
03:15.450 --> 03:19.570
So let's call it "Main Menu".

26
03:19.590 --> 03:27.720
And of course any string we type it needs to be escaped and translated. So let's use esc_html__

27
03:27.720 --> 03:28.830
esc_html__

28
03:29.280 --> 03:33.000
and then the string and then the theme domain.

29
03:35.850 --> 03:41.490
So let's save and let's see now our menus page in the admin area.

30
03:41.570 --> 03:49.810
So let's refresh and as you can see we now have the option to assign this menu to this location, main

31
03:49.810 --> 03:56.650
menu. And we can actually have many locations so let's define another one. Let's duplicate this and maybe

32
03:57.040 --> 03:57.940
"footer-menu"

33
04:04.390 --> 04:06.860
And now have "Main Menu" or "Footer Menu".

34
04:07.300 --> 04:10.070
So let's assign this to the main menu and save.

35
04:10.120 --> 04:17.800
So we now have a menu created and assigned to the main menu location. And the location is a place in

36
04:17.800 --> 04:20.250
the theme where you will display this menu.

37
04:20.320 --> 04:25.660
So we have the main menu which will be here and will not do that but you can have another menu, the footer

38
04:25.660 --> 04:28.400
menu which you can display somewhere in the footer.

39
04:28.450 --> 04:36.160
So we need now to display the main menu in this area in the header. So let's go to the header.php. And

40
04:36.170 --> 04:38.770
this would be similar to that dynamic_sidebar() function.

41
04:38.780 --> 04:40.080
So let's first create

42
04:40.430 --> 04:50.310
create a DIV with class of "c-navigation" and that's oc course for my styling.

43
04:54.210 --> 04:55.560
And inside of it another one

44
04:58.520 --> 05:00.670
"o-container".

45
05:06.140 --> 05:10.840
And then let's create a HTML5 NAV tag.

46
05:11.530 --> 05:15.350
And make sure you use this tag for any navigation menu.

47
05:15.440 --> 05:16.730
So I'm gonna give it a class "header-nav".

48
05:21.310 --> 05:23.590
And it takes a "role" of "navigation".

49
05:25.740 --> 05:28.760
And it takes an attribute called "aria-label".

50
05:28.890 --> 05:33.660
And this is for accessibility for people who use screen readers. And inside the attribute value you just

51
05:33.810 --> 05:36.370
describe what this navigation is.

52
05:36.540 --> 05:39.540
So in our case it's the main navigation.

53
05:39.560 --> 05:41.160
Let's open PHP and

54
05:44.550 --> 05:56.850
"esc_html_e" and type "Main Navigation" and the domain which is "_themename".

55
06:00.530 --> 06:03.160
And let's close the NAV tag.

56
06:06.820 --> 06:14.630
And finally let's display our menu. So to display our menu we use a function called wp_nav_menu().

57
06:17.820 --> 06:23.350
And it takes some arguments, an array of arguments. And the first, the most important argument

58
06:23.350 --> 06:25.020
is the "theme_location".

59
06:30.170 --> 06:35.030
So in our case theme location is the key that we gave here.

60
06:35.030 --> 06:35.960
So "main-menu"

61
06:39.440 --> 06:43.290
So let's save now and and see our website.

62
06:43.640 --> 06:46.390
So as you can see we have our menu items here.

63
06:47.180 --> 06:57.380
What else you know, we have "Filtered" before each title exactly like the posts. So remember in the child theme when we

64
06:57.380 --> 07:01.380
added a filter to filter the post title and then we added the string.

65
07:01.610 --> 07:03.610
This happened to the navigation items

66
07:03.620 --> 07:04.670
title too.

67
07:05.120 --> 07:08.330
And the reason is a navigation

68
07:08.360 --> 07:11.230
item is a special kind of post.

69
07:11.240 --> 07:17.510
So I'm having a guide here about post types and we'll learn more about post types later but I just need

70
07:17.510 --> 07:22.700
to mention an important information that WordPress  has many types of content.

71
07:22.850 --> 07:24.720
And these are described as post types.

72
07:24.860 --> 07:26.750
So let's go to the backend here.

73
07:27.290 --> 07:32.160
And we know that we can create posts and pages. And both of them are post types.

74
07:32.420 --> 07:39.710
So the post is a post type of type post and the pages are post types of type page and they are stored

75
07:39.710 --> 07:46.920
in the same table in the database. And they are differentiated by a column called "post_type".

76
07:47.150 --> 07:51.990
And the purpose of this is to categorize what type of content are we dealing with.

77
07:52.130 --> 07:57.320
So we can have posts and we can have pages. And later we'll learn how to add more like a portfolio items

78
07:57.320 --> 07:58.590
and stuff like that.

79
07:58.820 --> 08:05.600
But WordPress comes with default post types which are posts and pages as we mentioned and attachments and revisions

80
08:06.260 --> 08:07.630
and navigation menu.

81
08:07.640 --> 08:14.540
So actually each one of these items is considered as post. And its title is the navigation label. And

82
08:14.540 --> 08:20.090
this is the reason why we had the "Filtered" text before the navigation label fn the menu item.

83
08:20.180 --> 08:23.670
But also as you can notice we have a twice here sometimes.

84
08:24.140 --> 08:32.120
And the reason is it also got filtered when you added a page or a post in the navigation menu. So it's

85
08:32.130 --> 08:36.250
added here and then we saved. So the title was saved as "Filtered blog".

86
08:36.570 --> 08:39.000
And then it got filtered again when we displayed it here.

87
08:39.000 --> 08:40.540
So "Filtered Filtered Blog".

88
08:40.650 --> 08:44.750
So that was just a quick note. So let's add our child theme to our workspace.

89
08:50.730 --> 09:01.820
And then let's remove the filter. And refresh. And I will have it removed from some links but others

90
09:01.970 --> 09:04.950
is still there because it's already saved to the database.

91
09:05.060 --> 09:08.760
So the only way to remove them is to remove them from the title here.

92
09:09.440 --> 09:12.350
So let's create a new menu actually instead of modifying this.

93
09:16.770 --> 09:18.400
And let's give it a name.

94
09:22.850 --> 09:24.230
And let's just add some pages.

95
09:31.420 --> 09:32.240
And save.

96
09:32.330 --> 09:33.520
And before saving

97
09:33.830 --> 09:41.160
assign it to the main menu.

98
09:41.350 --> 09:43.480
And now we have our menu.

99
09:43.480 --> 09:50.620
So I already have my menu style here. But I just want to show you what would it look like without

100
09:50.620 --> 09:55.460
styling. So my styling is at the "source/assets/scss"

101
09:55.480 --> 10:03.020
and then "components" and then "_header.scss".

102
10:03.070 --> 10:07.420
So let's remove the styling for the header, for the navigation.

103
10:11.080 --> 10:11.790
And this is how

104
10:11.810 --> 10:16.230
it will look like. It's a very simple unordered list.

105
10:16.490 --> 10:20.670
So we have a UL here with an ID and the menu. And you can change these by the way

106
10:20.780 --> 10:26.310
in the wp-nav-menu() function. But I'm just gonna use these classes.

107
10:27.230 --> 10:31.730
And then we have for each item an LI  and the link.

108
10:32.350 --> 10:36.070
And if you have a sub menu we'll have some extra classes here.

109
10:36.070 --> 10:44.710
So we have a "menu-item-has-children". And if we open this LI in addition to the link we'll have

110
10:44.790 --> 10:45.400
another

111
10:45.490 --> 10:51.940
another UL with a class "sub-menu" and it will contain the other menu items.

112
10:51.970 --> 10:53.760
The children menu items.

113
10:54.110 --> 11:01.020
So in the next lecture I'll walk you through how I styled these menu items. But I won't type the whole the CSS

114
11:01.150 --> 11:05.670
on screen so just take a quick look and then we will do some other stuff.

115
11:05.770 --> 11:06.320
See you in next lecture.
