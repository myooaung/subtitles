00:03.090 --> 00:08.630
So before taking a look at how to modify the "sizes" attribute in your responsive images.

1
00:08.820 --> 00:15.450
Let's take a look at something in WordPress called $content_width. And $content_width is a global PHP variable that

2
00:15.450 --> 00:16.780
you define in your theme.

3
00:17.040 --> 00:21.170
And this variable should define the maximum width of your content.

4
00:21.180 --> 00:29.300
So here for example, our content width is this DIV here, highlighted here. And this one is 800 pixels,

5
00:29.480 --> 00:30.450
right?

6
00:30.570 --> 00:36.590
So WordPress will rely on this $content_width global variable when loading things like iframes.

7
00:36.860 --> 00:45.460
So I've added a YouTube video here and if you take a look at the width you'll find that it's 500.

8
00:45.800 --> 00:49.980
And that's because we did not define a $content_width in our theme.

9
00:50.080 --> 00:57.270
So since our website is responsive and we have these classes here that makes the iframe responsive. So

10
00:57.270 --> 01:05.160
without these classes, I remove the these stylings, the iframe will look like this. It will be a 500x281

11
01:05.170 --> 01:09.290
iframe. So to make WordPress load

12
01:09.440 --> 01:15.370
a iframe that matches the content width, we should define the $content_width global variable in our theme.

13
01:15.370 --> 01:16.990
So let's go to functions.php.

14
01:19.820 --> 01:26.810
And all we have to do is, let's check first if the global variable

15
01:26.840 --> 01:29.290
is not set and it's called 

16
01:29.330 --> 01:34.980
$content_width. We'll just have to define it, right?

17
01:36.830 --> 01:38.660
So let's say 800.

18
01:42.410 --> 01:47.410
And let's take a look now at the iframe again. And as you can see the iframe

19
01:47.410 --> 01:50.310
now, we have a width of 800.

20
01:50.370 --> 01:55.610
So I know this global variable won't really matter if your website is responsive.

21
01:55.710 --> 02:02.600
But it's actually required to define it in your theme and we'll actually use it also when we calculate

22
02:02.690 --> 02:06.770
our "sizes" attribute for responsive images.

23
02:06.780 --> 02:08.490
So another thing.

24
02:08.640 --> 02:16.550
Now we have this full width layout, what if we have the other one, the sidebar.

25
02:20.280 --> 02:29.520
And let's refresh. And now our content width will change, right? Now it will be this with which is 738 as you

26
02:29.520 --> 02:30.390
can see.

27
02:30.390 --> 02:33.810
So how do we change the $content_width global variable

28
02:33.810 --> 02:39.800
dynamically. We can use an action called "template_redirect".

29
02:39.800 --> 02:47.610
So let's add action. So "template_redirect" will run every time you change your template.

30
02:48.050 --> 02:53.150
So that's exactly what we need to do. Everytime we change our template we need to recalculate the 

31
02:53.150 --> 02:53.530
$content_width,

32
02:53.660 --> 02:55.060
right?

33
02:55.070 --> 03:03.490
So let's define a function called "_themename_content_width" and then inside of this function.

34
03:03.870 --> 03:14.460
Let's define it. Inside of this function we can access the global $content_width and then do some calculations

35
03:14.730 --> 03:18.690
and then change this $content_width depending on these calculations.

36
03:18.690 --> 03:19.620
Right?

37
03:19.650 --> 03:27.210
So in our case what do we need to do? We need to get the global $post, the post that we are visiting and

38
03:27.210 --> 03:34.260
we need to check that we are in a single post page. In the post type of post. And if so we need to also 

39
03:34.320 --> 03:36.220
check which layout do we have.

40
03:36.240 --> 03:42.170
So we need to access our custom fields and if we have the full layout our $content_width will be 800.

41
03:42.570 --> 03:48.330
And if we have the sidebar layout our $content_width will be 738, right?

42
03:48.330 --> 03:52.690
So let's write an if condition. "if ( is_single() )".

43
03:56.510 --> 04:04.850
And also we need to check that we are in the post, post type. So we can access the post type from the

44
04:04.850 --> 04:05.640
global $post

45
04:10.120 --> 04:11.620
like so.

46
04:12.880 --> 04:16.870
And if this condition is met, we need to get the custom field, right?

47
04:16.880 --> 04:22.940
Let's go to the single.php file. And let's actually copy these.

48
04:22.960 --> 04:24.550
We'll have to do the same thing.

49
04:26.900 --> 04:36.930
We'll have to get the lay out of the post so here we can get the ID of the post using post->ID.

50
04:37.180 --> 04:41.370
So we will get the layout and is_active_sidebar().

51
04:41.800 --> 04:44.910
And if the layout is "sidebar" but we don't have a sidebar active,

52
04:44.920 --> 04:50.290
the primary side bar, we will fall back to "full". Eexactly like we did in the single.php. And

53
04:50.490 --> 04:56.360
then using this $layout variable we can decide what the $content_width will be.

54
04:56.360 --> 05:00.570
So if layout is "full",

55
05:03.690 --> 05:05.700
it will be 800.

56
05:07.050 --> 05:08.850
Otherwise it will be 738.

57
05:11.870 --> 05:12.840
So let's save now and let's

58
05:12.950 --> 05:15.110
take a look.

59
05:15.350 --> 05:17.740
And as you can see our iframe  is 738

60
05:17.750 --> 05:21.060
now. Let's go back to the post editor

61
05:21.110 --> 05:23.530
and let's make it "full".

62
05:29.200 --> 05:33.640
As you can see the iframe is back to 800.

63
05:33.710 --> 05:36.860
So this is how to set the content width dynamically.

64
05:36.890 --> 05:39.100
Of course there will be a lot of more cases.

65
05:39.200 --> 05:44.330
Right now we're checking for the  single blog post only. But there will be a lot of more cases.

66
05:44.330 --> 05:50.300
Remember we have page templates, we have a page template with a sidebar and a page template with a full

67
05:50.390 --> 05:57.890
layout. So you can also use template tags like is page_template() and this will check which page template 

68
05:57.890 --> 05:58.650
you're in.

69
05:58.940 --> 06:03.760
And then you can decide the content width depending on which page template you are in.

70
06:03.800 --> 06:06.460
But I think you get the idea.

71
06:06.740 --> 06:09.400
So I'm not gonna do the rest of the cases.

72
06:09.720 --> 06:18.040
So let's in the next lecture go ahead and modify the "sizes" attribute in our responsive images to match our layout needs.

73
06:18.050 --> 06:19.130
So see you in the next lecture.
