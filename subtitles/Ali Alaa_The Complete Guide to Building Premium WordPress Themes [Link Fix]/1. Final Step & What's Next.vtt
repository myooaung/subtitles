So the one last thing you should do before publishing your theme is to run the theme checked plugin that we installed

1
00:09.660 --> 00:12.060
in the very early lectures of this course.

2
00:12.100 --> 00:16.990
So remember when we installed a plugin and it added an item here Theme Check.

3
00:17.030 --> 00:24.080
So all I have to do is to check our theme, our main theme and then see if we have any errors.

4
00:24.130 --> 00:30.900
But actually this plugin will scan all your files and your folders in the theme. And in our case we have some

5
00:30.900 --> 00:35.330
files and folders that won't be actually included in the final bundle theme,

6
00:35.480 --> 00:38.340
like the node_modules, the src and so on.

7
00:39.310 --> 00:46.060
So I think it might be a better idea to make this check in the blank installation that we did a while

8
00:46.060 --> 00:46.520
back,

9
00:46.550 --> 00:52.730
this one. So I'm here inside my htdocs folder and we have the firsttheme installation.

10
00:53.140 --> 00:55.720
And during this course I did another one for testing.

11
00:55.720 --> 00:56.800
All right?

12
00:56.860 --> 01:05.790
So let's open this folder and let's go to wp-content/themes. And let's delete this one. And let's build

13
01:05.790 --> 01:12.010
our theme to include all the latest stuff that we added.So let's run "npm

14
01:12.240 --> 01:19.770
run bundle". And this will build our theme in the package folder in our main theme.

15
01:20.080 --> 01:27.280
So let's go to, in the browser, let's go to the new installation, the "/WordPress" installation.

16
01:27.280 --> 01:45.040
So 8888 and WordPress/wp-admin. And let's login. And let's go to Themes and Add New and Upload and

17
01:45.040 --> 01:47.470
choose our theme which will be in the

18
01:50.750 --> 01:54.150
firsttheme and then packaged

19
01:54.320 --> 01:55.230
and this one.

20
02:00.030 --> 02:01.210
And let's activate it.

21
02:03.850 --> 02:09.920
And let's also add the Theme Check plugin in this installation.

22
02:11.000 --> 02:19.520
And let's search for "theme check". And let's install it and activate it.

23
02:23.230 --> 02:30.940
And also if you are publishing for Theme Forest, you can search for a plugin called "envato check". And you can

24
02:30.940 --> 02:38.620
go to this repository and add this plugin also. But let just run the normal one.

25
02:38.910 --> 02:45.420
So let's a go to Appearance and Theme Check. And let's check it.

26
02:45.670 --> 02:52.540
And here you should remove any "Warning" or "REQUIRED". "RECOMMENDED" and "INFO" are fine.

27
02:52.540 --> 02:54.840
So here we have "bypostauthor" CSS class.

28
02:54.940 --> 03:00.490
You should use this class to style Post Author Comments and I think we mentioned that during the section

29
03:00.490 --> 03:02.990
about Post Comments.

30
03:03.130 --> 03:09.490
Also we have multiple text domains so remember the TGMPE library that we added.

31
03:09.670 --> 03:14.100
So let's go to lib and this class.

32
03:14.250 --> 03:20.380
So this class has some strings and they are translated with the another text domain other than your theme.

33
03:20.380 --> 03:25.950
So you can just change these to your theme domain or if you are publishing for Theme Forest I think

34
03:25.950 --> 03:29.170
they will allow that.

35
03:29.530 --> 03:38.660
Next we have "Could not find automatic-feed-links support". So we can just copy this and add support for automatic

36
03:38.660 --> 03:44.870
feed links. So in theme-supports let's add this one.

37
03:44.870 --> 03:51.160
And this will add some RSS stuff in your HEAD tag.

38
03:51.280 --> 03:54.890
And finally zip files found and plugins are not allowed in themes.

39
03:54.910 --> 04:00.290
So this is also if you are submitting for WordPress.org you should not add zip files in your theme.

40
04:00.610 --> 04:06.940
But for Theme Forest you can actually add plugins which are zip files inside your theme like we did.

41
04:06.940 --> 04:11.350
So you can also ignore this one if you are publishing for Theme Forest.

42
04:11.790 --> 04:19.600
But anyways if you have any other error here that you cannot resolve, let me know and maybe I can help.

43
04:19.610 --> 04:21.500
So that's it for this course.

44
04:21.690 --> 04:25.150
I hope I was able to deliver my points clearly.

45
04:25.590 --> 04:32.320
If you have any questions, any feedback or any maybe you need me to create some lecture about some WordPress

46
04:32.330 --> 04:37.990
topic, please let me know you can contact me by e-mail or on Twitter.

47
04:38.040 --> 04:44.010
So if you're watching this that means you probably finished the entire course. And this means that you

48
04:44.010 --> 04:48.300
now know everything that you need to create Premium WordPress Themes.

49
04:48.330 --> 04:52.340
There is of course maybe another topic some other advanced stuff.

50
04:52.470 --> 04:58.350
And I know during this course I mentioned that we may add more lectures in this course. But actually

51
04:58.350 --> 05:04.080
I ended up with a lot of the topics and ideas. So I'm not sure if I'm gonna put these in this course

52
05:04.090 --> 05:05.170
or maybe another one.

53
05:05.250 --> 05:08.780
I don't want this one to be stuffed with a lot of information.

54
05:09.310 --> 05:10.870
But anyways we'll see.

55
05:10.950 --> 05:13.300
And we'll keep you updated.

56
05:13.380 --> 05:14.680
So thanks for watching

57
05:14.700 --> 05:16.030
and see you next time.
