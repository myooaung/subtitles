So in the last lecture we generated this POT file. Let's in this lecture see how to provide actual translations to your

1
00:10.430 --> 00:11.370
theme.

2
00:11.710 --> 00:14.620
So let's install a software.

3
00:14.910 --> 00:16.570
It's called Poedit.

4
00:17.100 --> 00:23.550
And this will help us generate translation files the PO and MO files. And it can also generate the

5
00:23.550 --> 00:28.220
POT files actually but to us it made more sense to generate it with gulp,

6
00:28.230 --> 00:29.520
right?

7
00:29.640 --> 00:35.170
So I have this program installed. So I'm gonna open it.

8
00:35.220 --> 00:39.870
So when you create a translation depending on the language, you should call your files, your PO and 

9
00:39.940 --> 00:44.370
MO files by one of these local codes.

10
00:44.880 --> 00:53.970
So if you're gonna have a German translation, you go here in German and then call your file this ".mo"

11
00:54.030 --> 01:03.080
and ".po". So I'll put a link to this list. But let's now create a new translation with Poedit. And then let's navigate to

12
01:03.200 --> 01:05.050
our POT file.

13
01:05.490 --> 01:09.690
So our theme and then languages and "pot".

14
01:12.640 --> 01:14.610
And let's do a German translation.

15
01:14.710 --> 01:19.880
So. And let's translate one of our strings.

16
01:20.000 --> 01:25.090
So we have, let's say "Read More".

17
01:25.800 --> 01:27.940
So let's find the "Read More" here.

18
01:28.450 --> 01:29.910
So here it is.

19
01:30.400 --> 01:35.830
And what's great about this program also that you get some suggestions here.

20
01:35.920 --> 01:38.900
So let's choose one of these.

21
01:39.130 --> 01:43.300
So here we've have the original and the translation. And let's save.

22
01:47.220 --> 01:51.280
And it also automatically call it the right locale here.

23
01:51.290 --> 01:58.660
So let's see it in languages. And let's click save.

24
01:58.840 --> 02:00.920
And let's go now to our folder.

25
02:00.940 --> 02:03.730
And as you can see we PO files.

26
02:04.050 --> 02:06.030
So search for "read more".

27
02:08.970 --> 02:17.020
And as you can see we have the original and the translation. And the MO file will not be a human readable file but

28
02:17.080 --> 02:19.210
it's actually important to have it, right?

29
02:20.620 --> 02:30.700
So now we need to switch our WordPress websites to German. So to do that we can go to the wp-config file.

30
02:37.110 --> 02:41.720
And we still don't have the translation and that's because you still have to do something our theme. So let's

31
02:41.930 --> 02:48.660
go back to our theme. And let's go to functions.php. And what we have to do is you have to load

32
02:48.680 --> 02:57.640
our translations. And to do that we can use an action which is "after_theme_setup" or "after_setup_theme" sorry.

33
02:58.490 --> 03:08.840
And let's give it a function. Let's call it "load_textdomain". And let's create this function. And to load our

34
03:08.840 --> 03:17.660
translations we can simply call a function called load_theme_textdomain(). So this takes our text domain which

35
03:17.660 --> 03:28.570
is of course "_themename" and it takes a path to the translations folder, which is the languages folder.

36
03:28.670 --> 03:29.750
Right?

37
03:29.750 --> 03:35.940
So let's use get_template_directory() and then the "/languages".

38
03:36.170 --> 03:41.730
So let's now save and let's refresh.

39
03:41.950 --> 03:43.190
So it's still not working.

40
03:43.210 --> 03:49.260
And I realized that this method of choosing the language is no more supported.

41
03:49.360 --> 03:52.750
So let's remove this. And to change the language

42
03:52.750 --> 03:59.680
now you should go to the Settings, the  General Settings and then you have a Site Language option.

43
03:59.680 --> 04:00.160
Right?

44
04:00.160 --> 04:08.980
So let's choose "Deutsche" and let's save. And this might take some time.

45
04:10.690 --> 04:12.450
And now our website is in German.

46
04:12.540 --> 04:17.070
Let's go to the actual website and refresh.

47
04:17.540 --> 04:20.570
And as you can see we have our translation.

48
04:20.670 --> 04:22.140
One more thing I want to point out.

49
04:22.140 --> 04:28.920
Remember when we wrote some comments for translators. So in the helpers file for instance, we had for example

50
04:28.920 --> 04:30.130
the "By".

51
04:30.450 --> 04:34.120
And then we said the "s" is "Post Author".

52
04:34.260 --> 04:41.920
So if you go to Poedit now and go to "By", you will find a note here. And "%s : Post Author".

53
04:42.000 --> 04:43.440
So this could be very useful.

54
04:45.030 --> 04:46.300
One final thing.

55
04:46.680 --> 04:48.880
Let's say you're not as theme developer,

56
04:48.960 --> 04:54.630
you're not gonna provide translations and normal users are gonna provide the translations.

57
04:54.900 --> 04:55.710
So what are they gonna do?

58
04:55.710 --> 04:58.970
Are they gonna just go to their translations files here?

59
04:59.340 --> 05:00.090
Of course not.

60
05:00.120 --> 05:05.400
Because once you update your theme anything they added here will be gone.

61
05:05.400 --> 05:08.580
So you should only put translation files in your theme

62
05:08.940 --> 05:17.540
if you as a theme developer are gonna provide the translation. Otherwise translations must be put in wp-content

63
05:18.330 --> 05:21.700
and in languages and then you can put them here.

64
05:22.050 --> 05:28.190
So we'll go to the themes directly and instead of calling the file de_DE directly

65
05:28.380 --> 05:33.160
you'll just add your theme name before it. So this way

66
05:33.180 --> 05:39.270
if you update your theme and your users have some translations in the languages folder, it will be safe

67
05:39.300 --> 05:42.460
and it will not be removed when you update your theme.

68
05:43.850 --> 05:50.330
So make sure to just mention this in your documentation for your theme that if you need to add translations, you 

69
05:50.480 --> 05:56.570
should put them in the wp-content/languages/themes and then name your file this way.

70
05:56.870 --> 05:59.530
So I think that's it for translations.

71
05:59.570 --> 06:03.140
Let's also see how to translate chield themes in the next lecture.
