00:03.070 --> 00:10.190
So let's add one more option here which is the logo. And to do that WordPress makes it very easy.

1
00:10.210 --> 00:16.360
You might think that we will have to add a setting of type image or something but we actually won't have to

2
00:16.780 --> 00:19.240
touch the customize.php at all.

3
00:19.380 --> 00:26.550
So WordPress has a feature. But it's one of these features that you have to declare that you will support

4
00:26.560 --> 00:30.700
in your theme. So let's go to theme-support and let's add another feature.

5
00:34.720 --> 00:39.520
And it's called "custom-logo". And it takes an array of options.

6
00:42.670 --> 00:49.580
And these options are the "width" and the "height" of the logo.

7
00:50.590 --> 00:57.280
So let's say 200 by 600.

8
01:01.310 --> 01:07.230
But you can also give the user the ability to change these heights and we'll see how in a moment.

9
01:07.270 --> 01:12.750
So we have an option "flex-height" and can set it to "true". And

10
01:15.780 --> 01:21.460
"flex-width" and let's set it "true" also.

11
01:21.730 --> 01:34.460
So declearing support for custom logo WordPress will add a new option in the Site Identity which is called

12
01:34.460 --> 01:34.980
Logo.

13
01:35.000 --> 01:40.460
And the reason why this is not available by default is because if it was available by default but you

14
01:40.460 --> 01:45.190
as a theme developer did not display it here anywhere, it would be a bit awkward.

15
01:45.440 --> 01:50.870
So by declearing that you will support the logo, it's your responsibility now to display it somewhere

16
01:50.870 --> 01:52.610
in your theme.

17
01:52.710 --> 01:58.810
So let's select any image.

18
01:58.930 --> 02:02.330
So here we have the 200 by 600 crop area.

19
02:02.800 --> 02:09.060
But since we have the flex-height and flex-width we can change these as much as we want.

20
02:09.160 --> 02:10.180
If these were "false".

21
02:16.030 --> 02:16.590
And let's refresh.

22
02:24.200 --> 02:29.720
Then you won't be able to, you'll be able to increase the height and width but you won't be able to decrease

23
02:29.840 --> 02:33.780
to make them less than 200 by 600.

24
02:33.890 --> 02:36.160
You won't be able to change the aspect ratio.

25
02:36.590 --> 02:40.870
So if you need to restrict the aspect ratio of the logo you can do that.

26
02:40.910 --> 02:43.220
But I don't think it's a good idea.

27
02:43.220 --> 02:50.490
I think we should let users change this to whatever they want. So let's do that and refresh again.

28
02:50.630 --> 02:52.460
And let's now choose a logo.

29
02:56.520 --> 03:03.480
And crop it to this with. So we now, we need to display it. And to do that WordPress also makes it very

30
03:03.480 --> 03:03.940
easy.

31
03:03.960 --> 03:06.020
So we go to the header.

32
03:06.360 --> 03:13.880
So we want to display this logo if there is one and if not we will display the A tag with the site title.

33
03:14.340 --> 03:22.290
So WordPress provide a function called, let's open PHP first, and a function is called has_custom_logo(). So let's check 

34
03:22.380 --> 03:32.140
"if (has_custom_logo())" is "true". And if so we'll call  function called th_ custom_logo().

35
03:32.400 --> 03:39.540
And this will display the logo inside the A tag that links to the homepage exactly like we did with the

36
03:39.540 --> 03:40.550
blog title.

37
03:40.620 --> 03:42.070
It takes you to the home URL.

38
03:42.730 --> 03:57.180
So else and close PHP. And then open PHP to close the else.

39
03:57.360 --> 03:59.010
So if has a logo display it.

40
03:59.060 --> 04:01.190
If not display the A tag. So let's see now.

41
04:11.860 --> 04:12.770
And this will be the logo.

42
04:16.500 --> 04:18.550
And now we have our logo in place.

43
04:18.590 --> 04:20.070
There is a weird behavior here.

44
04:20.070 --> 04:24.590
However if we remove the logo you should now expect the text to appear.

45
04:24.620 --> 04:31.550
But for some reason I think it's a bug within WordPress or something you need to type again to refresh

46
04:31.760 --> 04:34.850
and display it. So I sources for this problem.

47
04:34.880 --> 04:39.520
And apparently other people are having it too so it's probably about within WordPress.

48
04:39.620 --> 04:42.000
So I'll keep you updated about this.

49
04:42.250 --> 04:45.080
If I found any solution. But it's not a big deal for now.

50
04:45.080 --> 04:46.910
So I think that will be fine.

51
04:46.910 --> 04:53.980
So let's carry on now and will create a lot more options as we progress in the theme. But for this section

52
04:53.990 --> 04:57.580
let's create one more option. And this one will be quite challenging.

53
04:57.650 --> 05:00.920
So we need to create a field that will be a color picker.

54
05:01.010 --> 05:06.560
And when we pick a color we need to update the accent color of the theme. And by accent color

55
05:06.560 --> 05:13.370
I mean this, I don't know, green color. And we need to it in every place

56
05:13.400 --> 05:19.840
this color is used. So this will be a lot of work so see you in the next lectures.
