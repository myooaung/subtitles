In this section let's take a look at how images are managed in WordPress and we'll also see how to customize

1
00:09.420 --> 00:14.210
image sizes and also how to customize other things about images.

2
00:14.550 --> 00:17.090
So let's go to Media.

3
00:19.950 --> 00:22.320
And here we have some images. Let's upload a new one.

4
00:25.520 --> 00:28.190
So I have some images here.

5
00:28.270 --> 00:31.120
So let's upload this one.

6
00:31.230 --> 00:36.210
So whenever you upload an image in the media or in a post or anywhere in WorldPress your image will

7
00:36.210 --> 00:38.360
be resized into three sizes.

8
00:38.480 --> 00:45.270
So if we take a look at the Settings and Media. We have the three sizes here and we can change the width and

9
00:45.270 --> 00:46.490
height of each one.

10
00:46.510 --> 00:53.190
So we've the thumbnail, thumbnail will be cropped to 150x150. So no matter how large the image you uploaded

11
00:53.280 --> 00:58.570
it will always be 150x150. The Medium and Large will not be cropped.

12
00:58.650 --> 01:00.000
They will be scaled.

13
01:00.030 --> 01:05.940
So the Medium will have a maximum width of 300 or a maximum height of 300. But it won't be 300x

14
01:05.940 --> 01:06.760
300.

15
01:06.810 --> 01:11.680
It will maintain the aspect ratio. So it'll just be scaled and same for the Large.

16
01:12.120 --> 01:18.060
And we also have another size which is not listed here. And it's called MediumLarge and this one has

17
01:18.060 --> 01:23.400
a maximum width and a maximum height of I think 678 pixels.

18
01:23.400 --> 01:30.350
And then your original image and the resized versions will be saved in the wp-content folder.

19
01:30.430 --> 01:36.900
So let's go to the wp-content. And inside the uploads file they will be organized with the year

20
01:36.940 --> 01:39.100
and the month.

21
01:39.700 --> 01:49.990
So this is the one that we just uploaded. So we have the 150x150 version. And we have 300x173.

22
01:49.990 --> 01:52.980
So this is the medium size and it was scaled

23
01:53.260 --> 01:54.900
with a maximum width of 300.

24
01:55.130 --> 01:59.010
But as you can see it maintained the aspect ratio, it was not cropped.

25
01:59.500 --> 02:09.790
And then we have, this is the MediumLarge, it's 768. And then the large and this is the original image.

26
02:11.440 --> 02:11.770
Great.

27
02:11.770 --> 02:17.710
So take a look now at some of theWordPress functions that we can use in order to retrieve information about

28
02:17.740 --> 02:18.240
images.

29
02:19.780 --> 02:22.520
So let's go maybe in the header or something.

30
02:24.860 --> 02:34.690
Let's open PHP. And let's go to the Media again and see the ID of the image that we just uploaded.

31
02:34.690 --> 02:35.850
It's in the URL.

32
02:39.170 --> 02:51.930
And let's try to var_dump() some functions. So we've a function called wp_get_attachment_imagesrc().

33
02:52.400 --> 03:04.530
So this one takes the "id" of the image and the "size". So let's say we want the "large". And let's ignore

34
03:04.540 --> 03:05.560
this last argument.

35
03:08.880 --> 03:11.170
And let's take a look.

36
03:11.200 --> 03:12.540
In the header we'll find it here.

37
03:12.600 --> 03:13.750
So we have an array.

38
03:14.010 --> 03:17.400
And the first item in the array is the URL for the image.

39
03:17.400 --> 03:26.460
So we have the URL in the year and month and then the name of the image, the large one as you

40
03:26.460 --> 03:27.820
can see the size here.

41
03:28.350 --> 03:35.560
And then we have the second item in the array is the width of the image. And then the height of the image.

42
03:35.700 --> 03:39.790
And these are the width and the height after the image has been resized.

43
03:39.900 --> 03:41.540
So let's take a look at another function.

44
03:44.380 --> 03:52.180
Let's take a look at wp_get_attachment_image_url(). And it also takes the same arguments.

45
03:55.200 --> 04:01.450
And as you can see it just retuns the URL without any of the other extra information.

46
04:01.530 --> 04:09.900
We also have wp_get_attachment_url() without "image". And this one will get to the URL but now

47
04:09.900 --> 04:13.040
it gets the URL of the original image not the resized one.

48
04:15.280 --> 04:18.450
So it actually don't receive a second argument for the "size".

49
04:18.640 --> 04:23.740
You can just pass it the "id". And this is equivalent to calling the attachment_image_url().

50
04:24.010 --> 04:30.070
And a size of "full". So the size of "full" will always get the original image.

51
04:32.030 --> 04:39.730
Let's have another function which is wp_get_attachment_image() and it also takes an "id" and a "sidze". So let's

52
04:39.730 --> 04:43.360
save this. And this will actually get the actual image.

53
04:43.510 --> 04:46.600
So I've the "full" size here, let's get a maybe "medium" size.

54
04:49.310 --> 04:58.150
And let's inspect. And if you take a look at the image HTML element that it added here. It's not just an

55
04:58.150 --> 05:05.260
IMG tag with a "src".  It's actually a responsive image which uses the "srcset" attribute and 

56
05:05.260 --> 05:07.190
also the "sizes" attribute.

57
05:07.420 --> 05:12.030
And if you're not familiar with responsive images we'll have a separate lecture for that.

58
05:12.150 --> 05:17.500
But just keep in mind now that when you output an image in WordPress it will output a responsive image and

59
05:17.500 --> 05:22.140
not just an image with the "src" attribute and the "size" that you chose.

60
05:22.270 --> 05:25.990
And we take a look at this in detail in another lecture.

61
05:25.990 --> 05:29.450
So let's in the next lecture add custom image sizes.

62
05:29.470 --> 05:36.560
So we have seen that we have some default sizes here in the settings that we can change.

63
05:36.930 --> 05:42.020
But what if we want to keep these unchanged and add other custom sizes.

64
05:42.230 --> 05:46.850
WordPress has an API to do that. So let's take a look at how to add custom sizes in the next lecture.
