00:02.920 --> 00:10.140
So in last lecture we managed to compile our CSS and minified and loaded in our theme. Let's have some stuff to 

1
00:10.140 --> 00:20.040
deal with before finalizing the styles task. If we inspect element here in the theme and go to the body

2
00:20.040 --> 00:20.690
tag

3
00:20.980 --> 00:30.590
where we added some styles. Let's sure if you can see I'm gonna zoom in. So as you can see it has the background

4
00:30.590 --> 00:31.930
color,

5
00:32.080 --> 00:38.790
I don't know, pink. It comes from the bundle.css. That is true but it can be misleading.

6
00:39.050 --> 00:43.600
It would be much better if the file here is the actual SASS that we load the

7
00:43.690 --> 00:50.960
this bit of CSS in. It would be much better during the development. And to do that we'll use source maps.

8
00:51.140 --> 00:59.000
Source maps will map your original files with the compiled or minified SASS files.

9
00:59.120 --> 01:03.250
And this way the browser will understand which original file

10
01:03.830 --> 01:04.940
this comes from.

11
01:05.360 --> 01:10.780
So let's Google "gulp sourcemaps".

12
01:25.940 --> 01:30.520
And let's install it and use it.

13
01:30.550 --> 01:44.810
So I'm gonna copy its name to type "npm install" and then paste and then "--save-dev".

14
01:44.860 --> 01:47.470
Now it seems installed. So let's use it.

15
01:47.470 --> 01:56.810
So in the gulpfile I'm gonna import it. So "import sourcemaps from 'gulp-sourcemaps'".

16
02:01.240 --> 02:02.330
And then to use it.

17
02:04.250 --> 02:09.740
It has to be. Ok, So let's go to the documentation. First we type

18
02:09.870 --> 02:15.550
I'm gonna zoom in  ".pipe(sourcemaps.init())".  

19
02:15.550 --> 02:23.290
And then we add some plugins like the SASS the minification plugins. And then after that we add "sourcemaps.write()"

20
02:24.630 --> 02:30.920
As mentioned here all the plugins between the init and the write should be supported.

21
02:30.950 --> 02:33.990
Should have you know support it, for gulp-sourcemaps.

22
02:34.110 --> 02:39.260
So here is a list for all the supported plugins.

23
02:39.470 --> 02:49.400
And if we scroll, we'll find the clean-css and the sass plugins supported. So it's safe to use the source maps

24
02:50.110 --> 02:51.400
plugin. So let's do it.

25
02:51.500 --> 02:55.870
So that's ".pipe()", before the sass, ".pipe()"

26
02:59.180 --> 03:03.740
And we'll also have to use the "gulpif" because sourcemaps will only used in during development we don't have

27
03:03.740 --> 03:09.360
to do it in production. So "gulpif()",

28
03:10.310 --> 03:14.750
if !PRODUCTION this time

29
03:14.870 --> 03:19.130
and the second argument will be "sourcemaps.init()",

30
03:22.180 --> 03:23.350
all right?

31
03:23.750 --> 03:27.400
And after the cleanCSS we'll do the other pipe().

32
03:34.080 --> 03:38.570
And also "gulpif(!PRODUCTION,"

33
03:38.870 --> 03:39.690
we will do the

34
03:39.710 --> 03:44.960
"sourcemaps.write()".

35
03:45.110 --> 03:46.580
So this should work now.

36
03:49.560 --> 03:55.340
I know that you don't trust me now when I say this should work but let's try it out

37
03:58.080 --> 04:04.550
I forgot to run the "gulp styles" task again.

38
04:04.980 --> 04:16.930
So run it and then go back to the folder and open the bundle.css file. And then we've the source map here. So let's see

39
04:16.990 --> 04:18.000
in the browser.

40
04:20.190 --> 04:20.940
And if it's not working

41
04:20.970 --> 04:23.140
sometimes you just need to clear the cache.

42
04:25.010 --> 04:25.580
So

43
04:33.640 --> 04:40.850
as you can see here we have the file, the original file, SASS file that this style is included in.

44
04:41.130 --> 04:42.220
So that's great.

45
04:45.000 --> 04:49.040
So other improvement we can do.

46
04:50.540 --> 04:58.060
Let's say you want to compile multiple files, I've just bundle.scss, you can actually

47
04:58.080 --> 04:59.770
set passing a string here.

48
05:00.020 --> 05:08.980
You can pass an array. So let's say want to create a styles for the admin, the wp-admin part and create

49
05:09.060 --> 05:09.910
a new file

50
05:10.040 --> 05:18.350
call it admin.scss. And let's do the same thing.

51
05:19.350 --> 05:20.990
And it's my favorite color.

52
05:29.210 --> 05:31.780
And let's run the styles.

53
05:36.780 --> 05:42.560
And nothing happens of course because I haven't added the admin file.

54
05:43.090 --> 05:46.340
So in the array we add another file the admin.scss.

55
05:47.190 --> 05:52.140
It should work this time.

56
05:52.330 --> 06:02.510
So in the css we have admin and we have bundle. So it's actually see how to load an admin style sheet

57
06:02.510 --> 06:12.190
for the admin part and not for the actual theme frontend. So let's go back to the enqueue-assets. And we'll

58
06:12.190 --> 06:13.720
do pretty much the same thing.

59
06:13.780 --> 06:23.260
I can actually copy and paste this function. And then instead of "assets" I'm gonna call it "admin_assets". 

60
06:25.100 --> 06:33.280
And change the handle here to "admin-stylesheet" and then the file name admin

61
06:33.330 --> 06:34.940
.css.

62
06:36.440 --> 06:40.100
And the action here will be called "admin_enqueue_scripts".

63
06:46.030 --> 06:48.230
So let's see if this is working.

64
06:48.850 --> 07:07.580
So I'm gonna go to the wp-admin part of the website. And "admin", "admin". Says, you can see, the style is loaded

65
07:08.000 --> 07:14.670
and this is trust me that is the admin.css style not the other one. So

66
07:17.530 --> 07:26.640
I'll just try to refactor a little bit of our gulpfile.

67
07:26.810 --> 07:28.360
Where is it?

68
07:30.390 --> 07:35.180
So let's create a new object, call it "paths".

69
07:39.680 --> 07:47.560
And then the key of styles and then inside it inside the source

70
07:51.990 --> 07:53.960
which is this one.

71
07:55.040 --> 08:00.980
So I'm gonna cut it. And the destination which is this one.

72
08:06.890 --> 08:13.140
You're gonna have just an object to have all the paths in the future will have a lot of 

73
08:13.140 --> 08:19.670
them. Instead of just putting them in the task we'll gonna have them in separate object, much cleaner.

74
08:20.280 --> 08:23.050
But you know this is just optional.

75
08:25.340 --> 08:30.490
And so now we just have to add the paths here from the object.

76
08:30.890 --> 08:34.900
So "paths.styles.src".

77
08:36.500 --> 08:43.280
And "paths.styles.dest".

78
08:46.690 --> 08:49.610
Let's make sure we haven't done anything wrong.

79
08:51.460 --> 08:53.860
And it works.

80
08:57.710 --> 08:58.280
So not we've,

81
08:58.460 --> 09:01.220
we still have the wrong asset folder here.

82
09:01.400 --> 09:03.780
And don't worry, we'll gonna do with it later.

83
09:05.950 --> 09:11.340
Finally you probably noticed that whenever we change the SASS files you have to run the task

84
09:11.340 --> 09:15.030
in the command line or in the terminal.

85
09:15.320 --> 09:16.340
And that doesn't make any sense

86
09:16.340 --> 09:22.800
when need to, we need this task to run whenever we save the file. Whenever we change the SASS files.

87
09:24.260 --> 09:34.920
So I'll gonna pass this feature its called watch. So I'm gonna create a new task now. "export const" and I'm gonna call the

88
09:34.920 --> 09:39.450
task "watch" and then

89
09:43.790 --> 09:53.840
I'm gonna call a function called gulp.watch(). And the first argument is the the paths to the files that

90
09:53.840 --> 09:57.890
we want to you know detect that it has changed.

91
09:57.890 --> 10:05.130
So in our case we need to "src/assets/" and sorry "scss".

92
10:06.080 --> 10:11.120
And then we type "**/*.scss" and what that means is

93
10:12.380 --> 10:20.300
any.scss file or subfiles inside the scss directory detected, detect when it's

94
10:20.300 --> 10:21.470
changed.

95
10:21.560 --> 10:32.290
The second argument is the task to run when the file is changed. So in our case "styles".

96
10:32.390 --> 10:34.010
So let's run the watch task now.

97
10:34.050 --> 10:35.900
Let's run "gulp watch".

98
10:38.600 --> 10:47.220
And "Starting 'watch' "and it's watching actually. So let's try, so let's try this thing here.

99
10:51.360 --> 10:54.360
And let's change the bundle.scss file.

100
10:58.430 --> 11:07.380
And we get a notice when we changed it they started the style task and finished.

101
11:07.430 --> 11:09.810
So I think that's enough for the styles for now.

102
11:10.190 --> 11:11.890
Let's move on to the next task.
