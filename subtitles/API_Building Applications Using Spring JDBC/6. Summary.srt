00:00:01,988 --> 00:00:07,041
In this module we deleted one record using the update method of

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,988
the JdbcTemplate to issue our delete SQL.

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:14,352
This is quite similar to what we have done with other functions in our code now,

4
00:00:14,352 --> 00:00:15,988
so it should look pretty similar.

5
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:20,988
We also showed the functionality of using a NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.

6
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,758
This is a great alterative to using the numbering scheme that

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,500
we have seen so far in our application.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Next we're going to look at exception handling and transactions inside of our application.
