1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,040
As with our other demos, this demo will be broken into multiple parts.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,120
We're going to start off with the recall to retrieve a

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,130
single record from the database.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,460
We created the method in the previous module we were going to use for this call,

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,590
but we haven't exposed it through our repository

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,040
and service tiers to our UI yet.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,750
Then we're going to work on an update function to modify a single

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,250
record. And then the last part of the demo,

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:39,000
we will utilize the batch update functions to modify multiple roles with one call.
