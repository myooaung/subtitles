In our CreateRide test and controller,

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,480
we used a put method since in the rest definitions it is acceptable for both

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,420
creating and updating records. In the RestTemplate API though,

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,060
we must use a post if we want to return an object. Let's modify our

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:32,000
test and controller to use and accept a post, and then we will be able to return our newly created Ride object.
