00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.740
I debated on changing the CreateRide when we were in the create module

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.010
to be able to return the object that we had created the database out of

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.270
that function, but opted to do it in this read module because if you

4
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.540
don't care about it being returned,

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.310
this is a lot of extra work that you may or may not need.

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.050
So if you care about reading that as you return it,

7
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.280
I've opted to do it here. To be able to retrieve the record that we

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.880
just created from the database, specifically the ID, we need to modify

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.140
our create statement to utilize a keyholder.

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.070
This is not a shortcoming of Spring JDBC, but rather JDBC itself.

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.610
Spring has a decent workaround though,

12
00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:00.000
and let's implement this in our code now and return an object rather than null from our method.
