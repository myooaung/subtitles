In the previous module we created this getRide method in our repository tier,

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,279
but we didn't expose it through our service tier to our front end.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,734
For this next demo we're going to add a call to the service tier

4
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:26,000
and controller as well as add a unit test exposing it clear through all of the tiers to our front end.
