00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,200
So we've seen throughout this class that class loaders and reflection give

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,840
us masses of flexibility when writing Java applications.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,660
We've seen in this module in particular that we can write an

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,030
application using something like an inversion of control container

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,050
to give us a large amount of flexibility in the way we configure our

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,150
applications, in the way we allow our applications to build objects

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,990
and to build instances.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,570
Once you have an inversion of control container in place, and I'd recommend

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,810
finding a good openâ€‘source one to use or a commercial one to use, then that

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,290
gives many advantages inside the applications.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,930
For example,

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,930
it allows us to make our code far more testable because we can now inject

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,140
interfaces everywhere and at test time replace those interfaces with our own

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:58,000
mockable versions. So IoC containers, dependency injection, is a highly recommended practice in your Java code.
