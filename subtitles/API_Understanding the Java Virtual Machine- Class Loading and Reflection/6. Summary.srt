1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,300
So reflection is a very powerful aspect of Java.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,490
It might not be something you use every day. When

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,940
you need it, you really need it.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,760
As we've seen,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,090
we can use reflection to get details of classes at runtime. These are

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,440
classes that we don't have any compiled information about.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,240
We can also use them to dynamically get values of instances at

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,440
runtime to extract data from types. Again, without having any

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,050
compartment information about this,

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,840
we can reach into an object and pull out its data,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,240
including accessing private data within the type.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,540
We can also update these objects. We can set values on the objects.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,430
As you've seen,

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,020
we can create instances of these types, so there's a

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,740
constructor type in java.line.reflect, and we can use that

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:56,000
constructor to create objects, again, things that we haven't met during compilation.
