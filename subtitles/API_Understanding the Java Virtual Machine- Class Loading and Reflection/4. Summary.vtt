00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.940
So we've seen that, as well as doing side‑by‑side loading of classes using

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.620
class loaders, class loading also lets applications hot load code, so we

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.520
can load different versions of code over time.

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.940
And this, for example,

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.040
allows servers to operate in a 24/7 environment. So things

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.000
like web servers can reload web applications without having to bring down the entire server.
