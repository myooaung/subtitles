00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.847
<v ->Welcome to exercise number seven.</v>

2
00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:06.079
In this exercise we will create your balance sheet,

3
00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:08.497
so we can calculate your net worth.

4
00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:12.490
Then in the next exercise, meaning exercise number eight,

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.649
we're actually going to analyze your balance sheet.

6
00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.677
Then in exercise number nine, we're gonna analyze

7
00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:20.446
your balance sheet and your income statement together,

8
00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:24.029
by looking at formulas based on both of those statements.

9
00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.236
And if you ever have question as we go through this,

10
00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:27.523
just let me know please.

11
00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:29.948
So, let's make your balance sheet right now.

12
00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:33.370
So please open up your complete personal finance dashboard,

13
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.537
and go to the exercise called Exercise Seven, Balance Sheet.

14
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:42.329
At the top here we have the What You Own Category,

15
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.158
meaning assets.

16
00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:48.493
So please enter in the dollar or currency amounts

17
00:00:48.493 --> 00:00:51.741
for everything that you own in this section,

18
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:53.349
okay right here.

19
00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:55.031
And unlike the income statement,

20
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.308
where we did it on a monthly basis and kind of calculated

21
00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:01.384
what our revenue should be in 12 months

22
00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.631
by multiplying by 12 or taking the annual amount

23
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.758
and dividing by 12 months,

24
00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:08.387
on a balance sheet, we don't do this,

25
00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:11.575
because a balance sheet is actually a snapshot in time

26
00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:14.388
of what you own, minus what you owe.

27
00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:18.653
So, please pause me now, and enter in this information now.

28
00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:22.437
Meaning just the assets, or What You Own Section.

29
00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:24.207
And just do the best you can.

30
00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:26.437
And if you need to add more line items,

31
00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:29.529
then please click on the plus option here.

32
00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:33.571
Please don't insert or delete any rows.

33
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.171
And also please enter in optional comments

34
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:38.561
if you wanted to here.

35
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:43.042
And if you own a car or a house, enter in the value of it,

36
00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:45.203
if you wanted to sell it right now.

37
00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:48.505
Okay, but don't enter in the mortgage or debt amounts

38
00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:52.491
that you have on a car or a house in the asset section.

39
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:56.145
So, for example, if you live in a house that is worth

40
00:01:56.145 --> 00:02:00.150
a hundred thousand dollars and you only own half of it,

41
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.617
still enter in a hundred thousand dollars

42
00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:03.746
in the asset section.

43
00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:04.922
Same thing with a car.

44
00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.574
Just enter in the amounts that you can sell the car

45
00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:10.489
or house for today, and don't worry about the debt

46
00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.943
on your car or your house as we're gonna account for that,

47
00:02:13.943 --> 00:02:16.311
if applicable, in the liability section.

48
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:18.237
Okay, so please pause me right now

49
00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:20.382
and complete your asset section,

50
00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:21.879
and when you're done, then unpause me,

51
00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.009
and it's doesn't have to be perfect, okay.

52
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.026
Just take your time, pause me now to complete

53
00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:29.193
the asset section, thanks.

54
00:02:32.783 --> 00:02:34.987
Okay, welcome back.

55
00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:39.538
Please note that we have your total assets right here,

56
00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:42.744
and every asset you have is expressed as a percent

57
00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:44.847
of your total assets.

58
00:02:44.847 --> 00:02:47.890
And in the long run we want your investment assets,

59
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.212
like stocks or bonds to be a larger percent

60
00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:54.301
of your net worth, and we're gonna discuss investments

61
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.053
in part three of the course.

62
00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:59.954
Now, most people that own a house, have their house

63
00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:04.103
as their largest portion of their net worth.

64
00:03:04.103 --> 00:03:06.667
And I think that owning a house or an apartment

65
00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.332
can be the best investment you will ever make,

66
00:03:09.332 --> 00:03:13.105
because spending money on rent for too many years,

67
00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:14.605
is really a waste.

68
00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:17.254
Let's move on.

69
00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:18.902
We're going to go on now to the next section

70
00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:21.735
of the balance sheet here which is What You Owe,

71
00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.603
meaning the liabilities,

72
00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:25.691
what you're liable for to pay back.

73
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:30.157
So, please enter in all the items that you owe,

74
00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:33.494
including the size of the mortgage or loan on your house,

75
00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:35.508
or apartment if applicable.

76
00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:37.900
Also enter in the size of the loan on your car,

77
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.234
if applicable.

78
00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:41.364
Enter in student loans if applicable,

79
00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:44.677
money you owe to other people, credit card debt, etc.

80
00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:48.477
And in addition to entering the amounts,

81
00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:51.754
please enter in optional comments if you want to.

82
00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:53.653
Okay, it's optional.

83
00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:56.234
If you need to add more items, like I mentioned before,

84
00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:58.466
please just click on this plus symbol,

85
00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:01.541
and rename the titles of the other items here,

86
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.858
and please don't add or delete any rows.

87
00:04:03.858 --> 00:04:07.445
Okay, so please pause me now, and complete

88
00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:09.573
the What You Owe section here,

89
00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:13.323
and then unpause me when you're done, thanks.

90
00:04:15.492 --> 00:04:17.189
Okay, welcome back.

91
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.681
Now look at each liability item that you entered

92
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:24.640
and take note of what each item is as a percent

93
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.973
of what you owe.

94
00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:30.572
And for most people that own a house or an apartment,

95
00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:33.470
their mortgage is their largest liability,

96
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.109
or if you recently graduated, your student loans

97
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.444
could be your largest liability.

98
00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:41.779
And our goal actually, by the end of this course

99
00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.656
is to make sure that in the long run,

100
00:04:44.656 --> 00:04:48.795
your investments are by far the largest percent

101
00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:51.883
of your assets and net worth,

102
00:04:51.883 --> 00:04:55.187
and that your debt is very, very small.

103
00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:56.670
Now please scroll down,

104
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.120
and you will see that we now know what your net worth is,

105
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.877
which we will analyze in future exercises,

106
00:05:03.877 --> 00:05:05.367
and which is now updated,

107
00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:09.240
right here on your dashboard summary.

108
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.126
So, your net worth will be materially higher

109
00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:17.028
in the future as we're gonna use saving strategies

110
00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:19.082
that we learned in Part One,

111
00:05:19.082 --> 00:05:21.579
and we'll use the many make money strategies

112
00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:25.480
that we will cover later in Part Three of this course.

113
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.247
And so the next step is to please watch

114
00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:31.961
the next lesson, which is Exercise Eight,

115
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.180
so we can analyze your balance sheets

116
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.268
and your net worth ratios.

117
00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:37.558
And as always, please let me know

118
00:05:37.558 --> 00:05:38.689
if you have any questions.

119
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:39.522
Thanks.
