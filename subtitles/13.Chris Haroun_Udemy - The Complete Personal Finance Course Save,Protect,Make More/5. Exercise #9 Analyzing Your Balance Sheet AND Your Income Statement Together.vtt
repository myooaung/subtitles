1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.397
<v ->Now that we have completed our balance sheet and</v>

2
00:00:03.397 --> 00:00:06.179
our income statement, let's analyze a couple of ratios

3
00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.077
that use numbers from both financial statements.

4
00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:13.220
Okay, and so recall, that you calculated your current income

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.400
statement in exercise number two, and you completed your

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.264
current balance sheet in exercise number seven.

7
00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:24.200
Okay, and these are the two sources for the calculations

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.400
in this current exercise, which is exercise number nine.

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.157
And so question number one in exercise nine deals with

10
00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.579
your lost job coverage ratio.

11
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.037
And higher is better okay?

12
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.141
It's, your lost job coverage ratio is calculated by

13
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:44.141
dividing your net worth by your annual expenses.

14
00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:47.917
Okay not including income taxes as we wouldn't have to pay

15
00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.301
income taxes if we were out of work

16
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:52.797
which has happened to everybody including myself

17
00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.101
at least once, okay.

18
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:57.379
And sometimes, many years later actually,

19
00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.436
sorry it's a little side note here,

20
00:00:58.436 --> 00:01:00.941
but many years you'll look back and you'll actually realize

21
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.298
that it was a blessing in disguise that,

22
00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:05.720
that you didn't have that job anymore in the past

23
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.720
if you were let go like I was.

24
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.779
Because you're, you just weren't passionate about that right

25
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:13.480
and anyway if you're not passionate

26
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.120
you can't excel at anything in life.

27
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.779
Okay, so back on track.

28
00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.880
Of course a higher lost job coverage ratio is better.

29
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.701
And above one times is ideal, okay so that we have

30
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.757
our net worth covering our annual expenses, okay.

31
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.117
Meaning we can assume here in this scenario

32
00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:34.200
that we can sell some of our assets.

33
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.360
And that's why we really want our assets to be liquid,

34
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.981
something we can sell quickly.

35
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.438
Like investments which we'll cover in part three okay.

36
00:01:40.438 --> 00:01:44.699
Okay, and so please use the data from exercise number two,

37
00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:47.379
which is our current income statement.

38
00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:49.661
And also please use the data from exercise seven

39
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:53.640
which is our balance sheets, and calculate what your

40
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.057
lost job coverage ratio is.

41
00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:59.981
And put your calculation here in this white box

42
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:02.918
and pause me, complete question one,

43
00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:05.501
then click on the plus here to check your answers.

44
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.939
And then unpause me to so we can move on

45
00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.299
to question number two together.

46
00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.049
Thanks, pause me now.

47
00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:18.301
Okay, let's move on to question number two.

48
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.317
Where we're gonna discuss calculating our

49
00:02:20.317 --> 00:02:23.117
life insurance coverage ratio and higher is better.

50
00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:26.877
Okay, and if you're married, and or you have kids,

51
00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:29.859
or you have anybody dependent on you it's really important

52
00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.798
to consider getting life insurance.

53
00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.301
Which we're gonna cover later on in the course

54
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:35.859
in this section here.

55
00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.637
Now, if you want your family to, to be very well protected

56
00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:42.637
you need to have at least 10 years worth

57
00:02:42.637 --> 00:02:45.101
of annual expenses in order for them to be okay

58
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:48.077
if you're no longer around.

59
00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:50.478
And the best way to accomplish this is through getting

60
00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:52.056
a life insurance policy.

61
00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:54.397
Again, we'll cover this later in the course.

62
00:02:54.397 --> 00:02:57.299
But your life insurance coverage ratio

63
00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.256
is equal to this formula: your life insurance

64
00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:04.456
coverage payout plus your net worth,

65
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:07.436
divided by your annual expenses.

66
00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:09.219
Excluding income taxes.

67
00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.795
And this all equals how many years worth of expenses

68
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.128
are covered for your family.

69
00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:18.316
Okay and really try to understand that ratio.

70
00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:21.859
Okay and so if something happens to you, God forbid,

71
00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.397
what you get a bunch of money, right?

72
00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:28.256
And that's called your life insurance coverage payout.

73
00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:31.155
Plus your also gonna add your net worth

74
00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:35.235
which we know is assets minus liabilities.

75
00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:38.316
Okay and then you divide that by your annual expenses.

76
00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:39.678
Excluding income taxes again because

77
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.694
you're not gonna be paying income taxes.

78
00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:43.779
And again make sure this ratio is over 10 times

79
00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.976
so your family is fine.

80
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.379
And if it's not don't worry yet.

81
00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.038
We'll get there okay?

82
00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:52.195
So please use the data from your current income statement

83
00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:55.615
in exercise two and also again use the data

84
00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:58.179
from your balance sheet exercise number seven

85
00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:02.835
and calculate what your life insurance coverage ratio is.

86
00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:07.002
Also, if, if you have a life insurance policy right now,

87
00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:11.455
use this in the equation, okay.

88
00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:15.976
It's, if you don't then you kind of understand how

89
00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:19.176
much money you need for a life insurance policy,

90
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.256
payout wise, okay.

91
00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:22.797
And again, we're gonna cover life insurance

92
00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:24.056
in more detail later on.

93
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:25.496
I just wanna put on your radar screen how it looks

94
00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:27.816
you can kind of understand protecting your family

95
00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:30.351
and why life insurance policies offer support.

96
00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:33.299
Okay, so put your calculations in the white box here,

97
00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.455
and then check your answers by clicking on the plus symbol.

98
00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:36.288
Thanks.
