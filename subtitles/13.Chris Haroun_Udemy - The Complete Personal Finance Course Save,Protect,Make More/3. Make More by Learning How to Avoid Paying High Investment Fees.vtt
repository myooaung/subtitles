1
00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:02.210
<v ->Now that we understand how much high fees</v>

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.600
can actually destroy our future net worth,

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.856
let's talk about how to avoid paying these fees

4
00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:11.265
when investing in stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate,

5
00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:12.994
investment trusts, et cetera.

6
00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:15.726
Okay, so we will discuss all of the investment categories

7
00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:18.917
I just mentioned soon, but before we do so,

8
00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:22.471
I don't ever recommend investing in mutual funds.

9
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.717
Okay, so what are mutual funds?

10
00:00:23.717 --> 00:00:26.470
Well, many of us know that mutual funds are companies

11
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.914
that invest in stocks or bonds or commodities,

12
00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:32.059
and there are mutual funds for many different types

13
00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.607
of investments, like domestic mutual funds,

14
00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:36.251
or international mutual funds,

15
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.001
government-based mutual funds,

16
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.347
or corporate bond investment funds.

17
00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:42.641
Okay, there's many different types of mutual funds,

18
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.674
and these mutual funds spend a massive amount every year

19
00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:48.848
in marketing their funds and trying to convince us

20
00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.451
that we need to invest with them.

21
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.043
You know, they're a very powerful lobby, too,

22
00:00:54.043 --> 00:00:56.571
in certain government circles, okay?

23
00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:00.827
And the issue is that, and this will blow you away,

24
00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.910
the issue is that 95% of these mutual funds

25
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.070
cannot make you more money than cheaper index funds.

26
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.118
Let me explain what an index fund is, okay?

27
00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:13.937
An index fund is a group of stocks or other investments

28
00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:15.985
that represent a market.

29
00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:17.401
For example,

30
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:21.318
the S&amp;P 500 is basically 500 stocks in an index

31
00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:26.015
that represents the United States stocks markets, okay?

32
00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:29.065
Like Apple, whose ticker is of course AAPL,

33
00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:31.636
3M, whose ticker is MMM,

34
00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:35.077
which stands for Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing,

35
00:01:35.077 --> 00:01:36.762
Chipotle, ticker CMG,

36
00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:39.086
which stands for Chipotle Mexican Grill,

37
00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:40.867
and a few hundred other stocks, okay?

38
00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:44.794
And so these indexes are also referred as indices,

39
00:01:44.794 --> 00:01:48.581
and there's indexes for all markets, like the CAC Quarante,

40
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:50.789
or the CAC 40 stock market index in France,

41
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.901
which includes 40 French stocks,

42
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:56.421
like L'Oréal, and retailer Carrefour.

43
00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:00.837
And then you've got the TSX stock market index in Canada,

44
00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:03.877
you've got the Nikkei stock market index in Japan,

45
00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:07.130
the DAX stock market index in Germany, et cetera, okay?

46
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.824
And there's also commodity and bond indexes, as well.

47
00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:15.596
And we know now that 95% of mutual funds cannot beat

48
00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:19.248
the return you can get from investing in these indexes.

49
00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:22.074
So, why doesn't everybody know this?

50
00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:26.287
Because mutual funds pay a fortune in advertising, okay?

51
00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:29.264
And they also pay a fortune in government lobbying.

52
00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:32.570
And 95% of these funds, again, cannot beat the index.

53
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.034
And they pay a fortune, as well, for advertising

54
00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:38.373
on a lot of the finance media programs we watch.

55
00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:40.499
And so the journalists on these finance media programs

56
00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.558
are not gonna kinda articulate what I'm telling you

57
00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.307
right now, for obvious reasons.

58
00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:47.836
Okay, so what, Chris? What should you invest in, then,

59
00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:50.334
if you don't recommend buying mutual funds?

60
00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:53.480
Well, there are companies that sell what are called

61
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.195
index funds, and they charge little or next to nothing

62
00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:01.961
to invest in these index funds, okay?

63
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.235
And why do they charge us less than mutual funds do

64
00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.902
to invest in their index funds?

65
00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:11.038
Because mutual funds have massive budgets.

66
00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:14.569
They can hire expensive executives that speak

67
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.776
"gooder than me", better than me, I know,

68
00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:19.934
that speak better than me, to manage their funds.

69
00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:22.897
From expensive schools, like Harvard Business School,

70
00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:27.315
also known as HBS, but 2/3 of HBS is BS.

71
00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:31.260
Sorry, Harvard. I'm sorry. Sorry to, okay.

72
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.270
These mutual funds have literally armies

73
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.118
of hundreds of people picking investments

74
00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.241
at some of these larger funds.

75
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.172
But again, the issue is that 95% of the mutual funds

76
00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:46.596
cannot beat the indexes, and the problem is that

77
00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:49.713
so many of the mutual fund fees are hidden, right?

78
00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:51.706
And it's unethical.

79
00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:56.081
And some of them can end up charging us several percent more

80
00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:00.773
per year than we thought that they would charge us per year.

81
00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.388
And they can't beat the indexes partially because of this.

82
00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:06.342
Okay? And we need to have much smaller fees.

83
00:04:06.342 --> 00:04:08.284
It gets worse, though, okay?

84
00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:10.993
As a bunch of professional money management firms,

85
00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:14.214
like mutual funds, charge even more fees

86
00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:17.060
through what are called "soft dollar fees",

87
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.957
where some of these funds in some countries

88
00:04:19.957 --> 00:04:23.294
pay high commission fees to some trading floors.

89
00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:27.721
And they have those inflated commission fees by computers

90
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:30.516
or research products for their analysts, okay?

91
00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:32.154
And I think it's unethical.

92
00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:34.598
I think it should be against the law, but it's not.

93
00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:39.026
Okay, also, since taxes are usually lower if you and I

94
00:04:39.026 --> 00:04:42.216
hold investments for more than a year in many countries,

95
00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:45.138
one would think that mutual funds would try to be

96
00:04:45.138 --> 00:04:47.308
longer-term focused in order to ensure

97
00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:49.437
that we pay less in taxes.

98
00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:51.766
That's not true, that's not the case. They don't do that.

99
00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:55.941
Most mutual funds don't care, as they trade way too much,

100
00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:58.447
which basically means that we end up often paying

101
00:04:58.447 --> 00:05:02.426
much higher taxes because these mutual funds don't own

102
00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:06.266
as many positions as they should in the long run, okay?

103
00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:09.498
And many mutual fund managers rent stocks

104
00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:10.682
instead of owning them.

105
00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:13.402
You know, these mutual funds are merely tourists,

106
00:05:13.402 --> 00:05:15.237
and not long-term investors,

107
00:05:15.237 --> 00:05:18.383
no matter what their advertising tells us, okay?

108
00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:20.005
Why? Why do they do this?

109
00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:24.208
Because most of these mutual funds are compensated annually,

110
00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.808
okay? And the executives there are compensated annually.

111
00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:29.946
And if these executives that are managing funds,

112
00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.803
if they underperform their peers by a lot,

113
00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:36.111
then there's a risk that they may lose their jobs.

114
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.280
So, what they do is they chase performance,

115
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.410
which doesn't work.

116
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.699
They usually do this towards the end of the year, as well.

117
00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.241
And it gets a lot worse, as a lot of these mutual funds

118
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.398
charge us one to 2% for early redemption.

119
00:05:50.398 --> 00:05:52.950
How can they get away with this?

120
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.145
Well, one of the reasons is because these ridiculous

121
00:05:56.145 --> 00:05:59.974
additional fees are mentioned in the very, very, very, very,

122
00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:04.413
very, very small, long disclosures that they provide us with

123
00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:05.651
when we buy their funds.

124
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:09.214
But, for some reason, we never read these disclosures.

125
00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:12.848
And so I'm asking you, please, to read these disclosures.

126
00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:16.190
Read the disclosures for all financial products from now on.

127
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.364
And if you don't understand something,

128
00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:20.673
then please call the company selling you

129
00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:23.624
the investment products, and have them explain it to you.

130
00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:27.585
Because if you don't understand their explanation,

131
00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.900
then they're gonna rip you off somehow.

132
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.840
If you don't get it,

133
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.405
then ask them to explain it to you again, kinda like,

134
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:39.352
somebody explained offside to me in hockey versus icing.

135
00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:41.614
I had to ask them a million times to explain it to me

136
00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:43.555
before I got it, but I finally got it.

137
00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:46.211
Just be a pain in the neck, please, and ask, okay?

138
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:49.166
And then after you think you understand

139
00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:52.652
the mutual fund fees, and the disclosures,

140
00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:54.830
then explain it back to these people

141
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.899
over the phone or in person.

142
00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:59.182
Again, be a pain in the neck.

143
00:06:59.182 --> 00:07:02.062
And please, please please do so, because I hate to see you

144
00:07:02.062 --> 00:07:04.088
throw good money after bad.

145
00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:07.576
Mutual fund disclosures are long, and they even tell us

146
00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:09.688
that past performance is not indicative

147
00:07:09.688 --> 00:07:11.928
of future performance, okay?

148
00:07:11.928 --> 00:07:15.543
So, disclosures are not this long on ladders,

149
00:07:15.543 --> 00:07:17.667
or on weapons, right?

150
00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:20.700
We go to the grocery store,

151
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.867
and we look at the ingredients of products, right?

152
00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:28.691
We look at the ingredients before we buy something, right?

153
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:31.454
And we gotta do the same thing whenever we buy

154
00:07:31.454 --> 00:07:34.515
financial products from now on, okay?

155
00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:35.398
Alright, great.

156
00:07:35.398 --> 00:07:37.576
So, let's now talk about index funds

157
00:07:37.576 --> 00:07:38.979
in a little bit more detail.

158
00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.196
So, these index funds do not charge

159
00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.444
a few percent per year in fees.

160
00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:47.032
There's no need for them to do this, because

161
00:07:47.032 --> 00:07:50.025
they don't have to pay executives a lot of money

162
00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:52.865
to pick stocks, or to pick investments,

163
00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:56.630
as the money is simply invested in indexes, okay?

164
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.047
And, for example,

165
00:07:59.157 --> 00:08:00.490
For the S&amp;P 500,

166
00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:05.879
these index funds will just buy 500 or so of the stocks

167
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:09.546
in the S&amp;P 500 for their S&amp;P 500 index fund.

168
00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:12.300
And it gets better.

169
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.467
The best index funds charge only 0.09% in fees,

170
00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:19.680
versus some mutual funds,

171
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.418
which can literally charge you 5% or more, okay?

172
00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:28.215
And that's more than 50 times higher than the .09% fee

173
00:08:28.215 --> 00:08:30.577
that you'll get from index funds, okay?

174
00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:35.104
And we know from the previous exercise that a 3% fee

175
00:08:35.104 --> 00:08:39.893
can cause material damage to our net worth in the long run.

176
00:08:39.893 --> 00:08:44.257
But a 5% fee is, of course, much, much worse,

177
00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.508
and paying insane mutual fund fees can literally

178
00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:50.675
postpone retirement for you, by a decade if not more.

179
00:08:51.543 --> 00:08:53.452
Yes, this is true.

180
00:08:53.452 --> 00:08:56.076
So, please play around with the numbers

181
00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:59.116
in the previous exercise, which is Exercise 17,

182
00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:01.975
and you will see exactly what I mean.

183
00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:04.994
And mutual fund marketing is so darn misleading.

184
00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:08.887
And what makes it worse is that many of these funds,

185
00:09:08.887 --> 00:09:12.172
if an analyst or portfolio manager is losing a lot of money,

186
00:09:12.172 --> 00:09:13.751
these analysts or these executives

187
00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:16.619
will swing for the fences in order to make up

188
00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:19.884
for their bad performance, right?

189
00:09:19.884 --> 00:09:22.370
Because they know they'll get fired if they don't do this,

190
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.866
which creates unnecessary volatility in the stocks.

191
00:09:24.866 --> 00:09:27.724
It can hurt you, okay? Cost you a lot of money.

192
00:09:27.724 --> 00:09:30.978
And many of these people at mutual funds get very emotional,

193
00:09:30.978 --> 00:09:32.439
I've seen it.

194
00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:36.962
They get very emotional, despite all of their degrees,

195
00:09:36.962 --> 00:09:38.476
and they sell at the worst time,

196
00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:40.064
and they buy at the worst time.

197
00:09:40.064 --> 00:09:42.327
And Warren Buffett said it best,

198
00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:44.162
when he said that the New York Stock Exchange

199
00:09:44.162 --> 00:09:47.564
is the only store in the world where investors sell stuff

200
00:09:47.564 --> 00:09:50.817
when it goes on sale, think about that.

201
00:09:50.817 --> 00:09:55.286
So, we have to consider buying only index funds from now on,

202
00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:58.230
and in the next lecture, I'll give an example of a

203
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.548
great index fund company called Vanguard.

204
00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:04.386
And in the lecture after the next one,

205
00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:07.628
I'll discuss several other index fund companies,

206
00:10:07.628 --> 00:10:10.199
similar to Vanguard, that are also great,

207
00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:13.346
given their very, very low fee structure.

208
00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:16.799
And so, I humbly believe my job is to kinda give you

209
00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:20.396
a menu of investment options, so that you can decide

210
00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:22.916
what to invest in with the lowest fees.
