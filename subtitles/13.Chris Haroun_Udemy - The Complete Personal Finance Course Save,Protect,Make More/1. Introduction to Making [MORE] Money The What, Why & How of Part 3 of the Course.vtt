1
00:00:00.061 --> 00:00:02.644
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:06.589
<v ->Now that you understand</v>

3
00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.943
how to save and protect your money,

4
00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:12.006
let's discuss how to make your money, work for you.

5
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.233 line:15% 
In terms of the what, why, and how,

6
00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.183 line:15% 
of part three of this course,

7
00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.231 line:15% 
I'll kick it off with the what.

8
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:20.727
We'll cover what to invest your money in,

9
00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:24.062
including stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities,

10
00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:26.152
and, other investment classes.

11
00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:29.522
We will also focused on how to diversify your portfolio,

12
00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.478
and how to pay the lowest fees, when you invest.

13
00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:33.984
Why?

14
00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:36.390
Why should we discuss diversification, and low fees,

15
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.348
in this part of this course?

16
00:00:38.348 --> 00:00:42.080
Because, if we don't diversify our investments,

17
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.199
then, we could end up making less money,

18
00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.450
and, potentially, losing a lot of money,

19
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.284
if we don't spread our investments around.

20
00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:53.306
Also, if we are not aware of the rip-off fees,

21
00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:55.695
that many investment firms charge us,

22
00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.850
then, our net worth, will be way, way, way, way lower,

23
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.714
in the future.

24
00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:03.931
Small fees, can really hurt us, in the long run.

25
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.626
Just like, what we covered in exercise one, of this course.

26
00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:10.382
The time value of money, and compounding interest,

27
00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.339
are really powerful wealth-generation concepts.

28
00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.105
And, very small fees, can really stop our chances,

29
00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.267
of maximizing our very long-term net worth.

30
00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:20.923 line:15% 
Lastly, how?

31
00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:23.151 line:15% 
How are we gonna cover all of this,

32
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.008 line:15% 
make-money material, in this part of the course?

33
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:29.458 line:15% 
Well, similar to parts one and two, of the course,

34
00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.706 line:15% 
there will be many, many exercises for you to complete,

35
00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:33.434 line:15% 
during part three, of the course.

36
00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:35.219 line:15% 
So that you feel way more confident,

37
00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.843 line:15% 
on how to invest your money, for the long run,

38
00:01:37.843 --> 00:01:40.080 line:15% 
in stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate,

39
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.083 line:15% 
and other investment types,

40
00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:46.334 line:15% 
while ensuring, that you are not getting ripped off,

41
00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:48.205 line:15% 
on really high fees.

42
00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.907 line:15% 
And, also, so that you are very well-diversified,

43
00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:55.034 line:15% 
with a bulletproof, long-term investment portfolio.

44
00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:58.300 line:15% 
And so, I'm gonna teach you about investments,

45
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.482 line:15% 
in a radically different and new way,

46
00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:02.312 line:15% 
in this part of the course.

47
00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:04.990 line:15% 
I'm gonna use a lot of exhibits,

48
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.000 line:15% 
tangible exhibits, or props,

49
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.621 line:15% 
so, we can understand why things are the way they are,

50
00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:13.026 line:15% 
in the world of finance.

51
00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.657 line:15% 
And, I want to do this the fun way,

52
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:18.145 line:15% 
so, we can understand terminology,

53
00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:21.090 line:15% 
instead of memorizing buzz words.

54
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.556 line:15% 
For example, here is a ticker tape,

55
00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:27.205
from many, many years ago.

56
00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:29.103
And, there's probably only one ticker

57
00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:31.071
I recognize on here, maybe two.

58
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.975
There's RCA, which, of course, is the ticker for RCA.

59
00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:37.431
And, then there's DAL, which I think is Delta Airlines.

60
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:39.400
And, back then, they use one-eighths,

61
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.730
instead of the decimal system.

62
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.105
I'll explain more of this later.

63
00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:45.761
So, stocks all have a ticker, and, years ago,

64
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.097
if you wanted to see what a stock was trading at,

65
00:02:48.097 --> 00:02:50.722
you actually had to look at this ticker tape,

66
00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:53.290
which came out of a ticker machine,

67
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.512
that made a tick-tick-tick noise (laughing),

68
00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:59.376
as it printed the tickers, hence, the name, ticker.

69
00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.281
Also, when we study bonds,

70
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:05.722
I'm gonna use many different exhibits, like this one here,

71
00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:07.737
from a couple of decades ago,

72
00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:10.394
when Disney was expanding into Europe.

73
00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:13.136
You see the coupons, on these bonds?

74
00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:16.771
I'm gonna explain what each of these coupons means, later,

75
00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:20.050
and, it's absolutely fascinating.

76
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.723
And, I personally, really think

77
00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:25.215
that, if we understand why, why, why,

78
00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:26.702
with everything ya learn,

79
00:03:26.702 --> 00:03:28.927
then we're gonna retain information,

80
00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:31.077
and, it's more interesting and fun this way too.

81
00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.161
And, you know, the same thing goes

82
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.066
with, anything you learn about, like cars.

83
00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.355
I was explaining to my kids, why is it called,

84
00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:42.035
and, they ask great questions, why is it called a trunk?

85
00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.524
Because, people used to put an actual trunk,

86
00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:47.114
on the back of their cars, like this here.

87
00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:49.546
And then, why is it called a glove compartment?

88
00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.954
Because, people used to drive with gloves on,

89
00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:52.961
and then, they'd put the gloves back

90
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.688
in that little compartment there.

91
00:03:54.688 --> 00:03:57.626
Also, why does a car say the door is ajar,

92
00:03:57.626 --> 00:03:59.497
when, I always thought it was a door?

93
00:03:59.497 --> 00:04:02.290
Okay, I'm really sorry about that last one.

94
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.108
No more dad humor, this time I promise. (laughing)

95
00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:06.154
Okay, sorry.

96
00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:09.289
But, by explaining bonds and investments,

97
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.956
using actual exhibits, like these ones here.

98
00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:16.788
See this, coupons?

99
00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.208
And, I've got international ones, as well.

100
00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.400
So, Euro Disney was in France.

101
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.650
I got one, I just got from,

102
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.817
actually, this one just came from Latvia, of all places.

103
00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:29.264
It's a Russian bond, kinda neat, hey?

104
00:04:29.264 --> 00:04:31.001
So, we'll do international stuff, as well.

105
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:32.372
And so, if we do this,

106
00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.526
you can actually retain a lot more information,

107
00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:38.768
if you analyze, why things are the way they are.

108
00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:40.298
Don't worry, I'm not gonna make this a history lesson.

109
00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:41.864
I'm gonna make, interesting.

110
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:45.521
And, so, if we research why, finance and accounting,

111
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:48.161
and money management, works the way it works,

112
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:49.730
then, again, we're gonna retain more,

113
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.337
which, will enhance your ability

114
00:04:51.337 --> 00:04:53.892
to be more successful, with your finances.

115
00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.513
Okay, and so, as a quick side note,

116
00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:59.485
always question everything you see, okay?

117
00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:01.228
Just like, when you were a child.

118
00:05:01.228 --> 00:05:03.538
My son, Dylan asked, he's my youngest one,

119
00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:04.777
he asks so many questions,

120
00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:09.241
and, I learn because of their many, and curious, questions.

121
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:13.192
And, Dylan asked me, why the barber shop has this logo here.

122
00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:14.730
And, I had to look it up,

123
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.857
but, one of the reasons is, because, in ancient times,

124
00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:19.809
in the 1500s in Europe, that's ancient, I guess,

125
00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.452
people used to go to the barber to get surgery done.

126
00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:24.836
And, after the barbers, who were doctors then,

127
00:05:24.836 --> 00:05:27.009
would finish surgery, they would wrap their towels

128
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.731
on a pole, and they'd wrap around,

129
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:30.772
I guess they were blue and white towels,

130
00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:31.985
after they cleaned up.

131
00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:34.193
Okay, anyway, moving on.

132
00:05:34.193 --> 00:05:36.801
Small investments, if you start early,

133
00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:38.560
can be worth a fortune, later in life.

134
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.050
And, very small changes in how you invest,

135
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.754
like, paying lower fees,

136
00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:45.497
can lead to massive returns on your investments,

137
00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:47.305
in the long run.

138
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.921
And, we really need to act small,

139
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:52.025
so we can think big, in the long run.

140
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:52.942
Okay, so...

141
00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:58.344
In my hand here, I'm holding a mustard seed.

142
00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.185
This is a pack of mustard seeds, of course.

143
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:04.073
But, let me see, if I can get one out here, oops.

144
00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:05.600
That's a bunch of them.

145
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.178
I'm dropping some, 'cause I am a klutz.

146
00:06:08.178 --> 00:06:10.529
So, here are mustard seeds,

147
00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:11.573
I don't know if you can see that?

148
00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:12.872
Chris, maybe you want to zoom into that,

149
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.539
when you're editing.

150
00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:17.744
And so, one mustard seed,

151
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:20.850
lemme just get rid of the rest of these. (chuckling)

152
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.867
One mustard seed, is right here, in my hand.

153
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.643
It might be very hard to see.

154
00:06:25.643 --> 00:06:28.137
And, when I started filming this course,

155
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.333
I planted a few of these mustard seeds.

156
00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:33.232
I wanna show you how the progress,

157
00:06:33.232 --> 00:06:36.545
of the growth, of these investment seeds are.

158
00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:39.514
Okay, so, I planted a couple of seeds,

159
00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:40.919
and, let me just get some help here,

160
00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.684
from people that work for me.

161
00:06:42.684 --> 00:06:43.873
Hold on one second.

162
00:06:43.873 --> 00:06:47.042
Okay, so, come here, black-shirt Chris,

163
00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:51.364
and, show us all, you planting the few seeds,

164
00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:52.984
at the start of the course.

165
00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:55.769
Okay, see how small the seeds are, in black-shirt's hand?

166
00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.978
Black-shirt Chris' (laughing) hand here?

167
00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:02.176
Okay, Chris, plant them now, please, black-shirt Chris.

168
00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:03.427
Okay, go, go, thank you.

169
00:07:03.427 --> 00:07:04.903
We get it, we get it.

170
00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:08.866
Okay, go home, it's over, Chris. (laughing)

171
00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:12.036
Then, here is the progress, of the same plants,

172
00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:17.029
when I started recording part one, of three, of the course.

173
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.841
I mean, the save money, part of the course.

174
00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:23.313
And, so, blue-shirt Chris, come here, come here.

175
00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:27.961
Okay, I want you to hold the plant higher, okay?

176
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.124
No, idiot, lower. (laughing)

177
00:07:31.124 --> 00:07:32.281
You can't good help these days.

178
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:34.148
Okay, a bit higher.

179
00:07:34.148 --> 00:07:36.172
Okay, okay, good, get out.

180
00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:37.654
Okay, great.

181
00:07:37.654 --> 00:07:39.245
And then, in part two of the course,

182
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.340
during the protect money part, of the course,

183
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.724
here's what the plant looked like.

184
00:07:42.724 --> 00:07:45.228
Okay, pink-shirt Chris, come here, come here.

185
00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:47.244
Okay, turn around.

186
00:07:47.244 --> 00:07:50.204
Turn around, so the students can see you, please.

187
00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:51.602
Okay, he's not the smartest guy.

188
00:07:51.602 --> 00:07:54.283
Okay, look into the camera.

189
00:07:54.283 --> 00:07:55.533
Okay, out, out!

190
00:07:56.891 --> 00:08:00.056
See how the small investment, is growing very fast?

191
00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:02.699
And, lastly, Matthew, here's my middle child.

192
00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.449
Matthew, honey, please come here.

193
00:08:06.595 --> 00:08:10.262
And, show me what this plant looks like now.

194
00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.179
Okay, great, great.

195
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.090
Now the plant looks amazing, hey?

196
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.394
So, Matthew and I, are making a free course,

197
00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:21.052
which will be out in the next year,

198
00:08:21.052 --> 00:08:24.546
on, all about business for kids,

199
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.338
how, playing Clash of Clans, can teach you about business.

200
00:08:27.338 --> 00:08:28.812
It'll be fun.

201
00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:32.241
Okay, so look how big the mustard plant is, right now.

202
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:33.074
Okay, great.

203
00:08:33.074 --> 00:08:35.407
Thanks, Matthew, I love you.

204
00:08:36.577 --> 00:08:38.882
So, someone is sitting in the shade today,

205
00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:41.696
because they planted a tree, many years ago.

206
00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:45.466
And, of course, that's a Buffet quote.

207
00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:49.633
Great, so why do look at how much a mustard seed can grow?

208
00:08:50.793 --> 00:08:53.001
I wanted to do that, because I wanted to really reinforce

209
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:56.230
this fact, that, small changes can lead to massive,

210
00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.376
long-term growth investment breakthroughs, in life.

211
00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:03.481
And, I have to quote my hero.

212
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.943
The Kingdom of Heaven, is like a grain of mustard seed,

213
00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:09.857
which, a man took, and sowed in the field,

214
00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:13.688
which, indeed, is smaller than all seeds.

215
00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:17.784
But, when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs,

216
00:09:17.784 --> 00:09:21.617
and, becomes a tree, so that birds of the air,

217
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.040
can come and lodge in its branches.

218
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.152
So, we're gonna have a lot of fun,

219
00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:29.096
with this, in this section.

220
00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:32.543
And so, why am I talking about mustard seeds, this much?

221
00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:34.616
I just want you to remember, please,

222
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.866
how much, fees, small fees,

223
00:09:37.724 --> 00:09:40.546
can destroy us, in the long run.

224
00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.666
Okay?

225
00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:45.964
And, I want us to remember, how very small...

226
00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:48.754
amounts of money, that people take from us, can kill us,

227
00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.892
in the long run, investment-wise.

228
00:09:50.892 --> 00:09:53.738
And so, we're very long-term greedy, in this course.

229
00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:56.474
And, so in the next exercise, what we're going to do, is,

230
00:09:56.474 --> 00:10:00.003
we'll see exactly, what small fees,

231
00:10:00.003 --> 00:10:02.012
they seem small,

232
00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:03.849
can do to our net worth, in the long run,

233
00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:08.064
and, why it's absolutely crucial, that we avoid them.

234
00:10:08.064 --> 00:10:09.592
And, I'll show you how.

235
00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:10.425
Thanks.
