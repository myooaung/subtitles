00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:04.360
<v ->It doesn't matter how old or how young you are.</v>

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.743
We were not meant to work for

3
00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:08.060
other people for our entire lives,

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.097
and so the point of this final side note lecture

5
00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:14.025
is to try to inspire you or convince you

6
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.118
to always be looking to make money on the side

7
00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:21.201
until it becomes your full time self employed job

8
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.868
or self employed passion, I should say.

9
00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:29.551
And if you haven't found your professional passion yet,

10
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.588
then please keep looking, because I promise you

11
00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:35.119
that you will find it if you look hard enough,

12
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.911
and when you do, you'll never be the same.

13
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.705
And everybody that's ever started a company

14
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.653
and has been unbelievable successful

15
00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:48.358
has failed more times than you and I have put together, OK?

16
00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:51.503
But we don't know about their failures.

17
00:00:51.503 --> 00:00:55.500
So please experiment, and keep experimenting on the side.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.668
And everybody has something that they can teach,

19
00:00:58.668 --> 00:01:01.534
and please take my free course

20
00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:04.786
that I give every year here on Udemy.

21
00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:07.713
I provide a free course that shows you

22
00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.354
all the mistakes I've made in the past year,

23
00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:13.507
and it basically teaches you how to create an online course.

24
00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:17.674
So I called it 40 mistakes that I've made teaching online,

25
00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:22.004
and I made another one called another 40 mistakes

26
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:23.903
or 40 lessons for teaching online.

27
00:01:23.903 --> 00:01:28.079
Anyway, you can get the course here online for free, OK?

28
00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.795
And I think that it's incredibly liberating

29
00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:34.306
to be able to work for ourselves,

30
00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:37.871
and that's why I really want to inspire you to do so.

31
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:40.333
And this whole sharing economy thing

32
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.088
has opened up so many doors for us.

33
00:01:43.088 --> 00:01:45.890
If you aren't happy doing what you're doing,

34
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.239
then please find a way to make money on the side online.

35
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.989
Maybe you can use www.fiverr.com,

36
00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:58.931
that's five, F-I-V-E-R-R dot com,

37
00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:02.780
or other ways to leverage your passionate strengths

38
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.508
and share what you already know

39
00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:06.924
with over seven billion people in the world.

40
00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.961
And there's really no limits except for

41
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.972
the ones we set for ourselves.

42
00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:16.643
Now, if you work for somebody that treats you poorly,

43
00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:19.452
which has happened to me several times,

44
00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.835
and if this person makes you work long, pointless,

45
00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:26.425
face time hours, which happened to me much earlier

46
00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:30.508
in my career, then what I want you to do is this.

47
00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:37.657
I want you to buy one of these screens made by 3M,

48
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.988
ticker MMM, which is Minnesota

49
00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:41.758
Mining and Manufacturing Company.

50
00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:44.796
I want you to get one of these screen protector things

51
00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:48.313
and put it on your laptop if you have to work long hours

52
00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:51.875
during your lunch break or during your dinner break that is.

53
00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.678
And you put this on your laptop, and I'll show you.

54
00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:56.467
Now you see me, now you don't.

55
00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.969
So nobody can really see what you're doing

56
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.576
if they come up to the side of you.

57
00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:03.446
Sometimes executives use this on the airplane.

58
00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:05.593
Sounds like thunder, my kids would say.

59
00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:10.454
But I recommend doing that, and just always be looking

60
00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:12.499
to start a company on the side.

61
00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:14.403
And what I would do is when I would do that

62
00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:17.440
at companies that I had worked at in the past,

63
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.448
and not the most recent company, but a while back,

64
00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:23.344
I would actually put my cellphone on,

65
00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:26.366
or I would get a personal MiFi it was called at the time,

66
00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:31.094
hotspot, so they wouldn't go on my corporate network.

67
00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.459
So do this during your lunch break if you can

68
00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.809
if you have a lunch break or whatever,

69
00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.731
and don't worry if you're frustrated at work,

70
00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:40.048
because frustration leads to breakthrough.

71
00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:42.048
It leads to reinvention.

72
00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.615
Find the reason that you were put on this earth.

73
00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:47.584
And it doesn't matter how old or young you are,

74
00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:49.203
you can start a company.

75
00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:51.062
The average age of somebody starting a company

76
00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:53.545
in the United States now is over 50.

77
00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:54.995
So keep searching for your purpose,

78
00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:57.111
your passion, your raison d'etre.

79
00:03:57.111 --> 00:04:00.419
And when you find it, you'll look back

80
00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.464
at everything you've done in the past,

81
00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:05.641
and you'll kind of see everything you've done

82
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.896
as leading you down a certain path

83
00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:09.603
so you can start your own company.

84
00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.051
And I'm so excited for you in the next chapter of your life

85
00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.982
when you do find your passion,

86
00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:16.816
and you will if you look hard enough, OK?

87
00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:19.609
Starting your own business is not about money.

88
00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.850
It's about freedom.

89
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.326
Freedom to live life on your terms

90
00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:27.232
so that you never ever ever have to play corporate politics,

91
00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.230
which really sucks the life and creativity

92
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.822
and inner genius out of you.

93
00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:34.549
Working for yourself is not about money,

94
00:04:34.549 --> 00:04:35.942
it's about freedom to be you.

95
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.907
And if I can humbly help you make that transition,

96
00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:41.845
please let me know, as I am always

97
00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.142
here to offer my humble feedback.

98
00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:44.975
Thank you.
