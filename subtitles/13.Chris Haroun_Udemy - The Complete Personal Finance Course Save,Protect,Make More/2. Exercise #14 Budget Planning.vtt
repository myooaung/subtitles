00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:01.589
<v ->Please open up your complete</v>

2
00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.862
personal finance dashboard Excel file.

3
00:00:04.862 --> 00:00:06.836
And please click on exercise number 14

4
00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:08.792
called Budget Planning

5
00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.911
and you can also access this exercise

6
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:14.797
by clicking on the gray button called Budget.

7
00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:16.964
And similar to what we did

8
00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:20.033
with our income statement earlier,

9
00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.541
remember that exercise?

10
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.772
We're gonna create a monthly budget

11
00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:26.759
and I made each category here equal

12
00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.876
to your income statement categories

13
00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:30.326
in case you change them

14
00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:31.834
as I want to save you time

15
00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:33.296
in creating a budget.

16
00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:36.041
So, for this exercise number 14,

17
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:39.606
please enter in what you expect to spend

18
00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.155
on a monthly basis for all categories.

19
00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:44.506
Now, you'll notice here that I made

20
00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:48.812
all of these equal to what you already entered in

21
00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:51.728
on the tab called Exercise Two and Three, Income Statement,

22
00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:54.353
just in case you change the tab names there

23
00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:55.828
or the labels there.

24
00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:57.992
I wanna make sure that it's intuitive for you here

25
00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.254
and if you want to overwrite you can always just type

26
00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:01.936
over top these.

27
00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.211
And so, just enter in on a monthly basis,

28
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:07.562
so make sure divide by 12 if you have annual numbers

29
00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:09.479
for each monthly budget

30
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.072
and you can change these labels

31
00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:17.288
to be January, February, whatever it is right now for you

32
00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:18.961
and then at the end of that month

33
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.218
and just go all the way down

34
00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:22.077
through all of these categories here

35
00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:26.554
so that you've got X expenses as well as revenue

36
00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.904
and then after that month is over,

37
00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:32.340
calculate here what the actual number was

38
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.329
so you can figure out whether or not you are on track

39
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.867
with each one of your revenue and expense line items

40
00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.374
especially expense line items

41
00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:43.897
and taxes are kind of tough to play around with

42
00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:46.174
and revenue's kind of tough to change as well

43
00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:48.103
unless you want to add additional revenue streams

44
00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:51.614
like teach Udemy or do stuff on fiverr.com

45
00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:55.017
or drive a taxi or Uber or whatever it is.

46
00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:58.195
So, I would probably spend more time if I were you

47
00:01:58.195 --> 00:01:59.804
on these categories here

48
00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:02.441
from car monthly expenses and below

49
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.588
and if you want just a refresher

50
00:02:05.588 --> 00:02:09.169
on how to save money on some of these areas,

51
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.827
you can always go back to the course in section four

52
00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:15.290
and just watch those lectures again

53
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.014
for each one of those categories

54
00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:19.434
or you can go back to your income statement here

55
00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.934
and then scroll over and watch

56
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.599
these lessons here by just clicking on them

57
00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.702
and they're the same thing you see

58
00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:29.500
in section four in the course anyway.

59
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.833
Let me go back to your budget.

60
00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:35.109
Okay, and if you have any questions with this,

61
00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:35.942
again please let me know

62
00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:37.902
and at the end of each month

63
00:02:37.902 --> 00:02:39.708
when you're kind of grading yourself

64
00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:40.914
or checking to see how you did

65
00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:41.747
relative to your budget,

66
00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:44.467
you can always enter in notes here

67
00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:48.364
and what I used to do when I was an undergrad

68
00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.531
was for each course I took

69
00:02:51.513 --> 00:02:52.346
at the beginning of the semester

70
00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.617
I thought of myself as getting 100%

71
00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:56.195
which never obviously occurred

72
00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:57.703
towards the end of the semester

73
00:02:57.703 --> 00:03:00.484
and then after I took each test

74
00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:02.084
or handed in each assignment,

75
00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:03.635
if I didn't get perfect

76
00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:05.131
which was most of the time,

77
00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:06.766
I would deduct a certain amount,

78
00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:07.866
so let's say that my midterm

79
00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.417
which was worth half my grade, I got 90%

80
00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:13.162
and so, that's half my grade

81
00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:15.482
which is 50% which is 45,

82
00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:17.982
so I would deduct five percent

83
00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:21.948
all the way down until I knew my final grade

84
00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:23.849
and I know it sounds a little bit different

85
00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.169
but think of a budget the same way,

86
00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.228
think of yourself as okay, I'll only allow myself

87
00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.053
to spend this much on parking

88
00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:33.066
or this much on public transportation

89
00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:34.301
and what you can do throughout the month

90
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:36.139
if you want to is you can deduct,

91
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.806
so let's say you budget parking of 20 bucks.

92
00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:44.219
Then what you can do throughout the month

93
00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.275
is you can always do equals that,

94
00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:49.265
so you spent five bucks today

95
00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:51.543
and then you know you have 15 bucks left to spend.

96
00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.209
That sort of thing, if that works for you,

97
00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.717
otherwise just ignore that, please, thanks.

98
00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:58.516
Okay, and then what you do after you've finished month one,

99
00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:01.705
is you do the exact same thing for month two,

100
00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:03.506
month three, rinse, lather, repeat

101
00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:05.111
all the up until month 12 or whatever

102
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.697
might be for you and you can always add

103
00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:11.364
additional columns here, just copy and paste

104
00:04:12.264 --> 00:04:14.743
and if you make a mistake with this spreadsheet,

105
00:04:14.743 --> 00:04:17.063
you can always re-download it from the course

106
00:04:17.063 --> 00:04:19.422
or you can even just right click on this budget plan here

107
00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.993
and just make a duplicate one

108
00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:23.368
so you can just kind of create

109
00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:25.894
another budget for future years

110
00:04:25.894 --> 00:04:26.727
or future time periods

111
00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:29.486
and as always, if you have any questions at all,

112
00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:30.319
please let me know.

113
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.152
Thanks.
