1
00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:03.476
<v ->Just like how we added stocks, bonds,</v>

2
00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:06.304
and commodity ETFs to our portfolio,

3
00:00:06.304 --> 00:00:10.643
you can also add real estate investment trusts,

4
00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.098
or real estate investments

5
00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:16.265
to your portfolio through what is called a REIT, R-E-I-T,

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.313
which stands for real estate investment trust.

7
00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.098
It's REIT and not RE-IT.

8
00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:25.077
So the benefit of doing this, right,

9
00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:27.994
adding a REIT ETF to your portfolio

10
00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:31.288
rather than buying real estate itself

11
00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:35.455
for investment properties is that these REITs, R-E-I-Ts,

12
00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:40.842
are much more liquid than investment properties,

13
00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.601
meaning that they are easier to sell.

14
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.498
And in many countries REITs, by law,

15
00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:49.858
have to pay out at least 90% of the money

16
00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:53.224
that these REITs makes in the form of dividends.

17
00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:54.744
Okay, they'll pay you dividends.

18
00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:57.380
And as a result, REITs can have a very, very

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.536
attractive dividend yield, which we will see

20
00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:04.574
in the exercise here when add six REITs

21
00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:06.149
to our investment portfolio system,

22
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.698
investment portfolio management system.

23
00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:10.308
Okay so please open up

24
00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:13.056
your Complete Personal Finance Dashboard

25
00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.431
and then go to exercise number 23.

26
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:17.909
And what we're gonna do here is were gonna add six REITs,

27
00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.572
that's R-E-I-T, real estate investment trust.

28
00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:22.477
We're gonna add six REITs to our

29
00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:25.417
investment portfolio management system in this exercise.

30
00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.272
Okay, and please notice the dividend yield

31
00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:31.356
as you add these investments.

32
00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:32.844
All right we're in the home stretch,

33
00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:34.862
we're almost done the entire course.

34
00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.408
So now we're gonna do real estate investment trust exercise,

35
00:01:38.408 --> 00:01:39.991
which is number 23.

36
00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:43.642
And so similar to what we did before

37
00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:47.001
with the commodity exercise and the stock exercise

38
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.222
using our portfolio here,

39
00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:52.765
we're gonna add the tickers to Yahoo Finance.

40
00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:54.193
And this way it's so cool then,

41
00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:56.938
because we manage all these different types of assets

42
00:01:56.938 --> 00:01:59.168
in that one portfolio.

43
00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:01.457
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna add

44
00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:03.907
the usual six tickers.

45
00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:06.334
One of them is in my Toronto, my homeland.

46
00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.936
And then we're gonna answer these questions.

47
00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:10.750
And you'll notice down here that these are

48
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.560
the copper ones leftover.

49
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.220
And the reason is because if you click on the portfolio

50
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.005
those tickers are still there,

51
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.605
legacy ones from the last exercise.

52
00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:23.188
So what we'll do is we will get

53
00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:26.721
these tickers here in Yahoo.

54
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:28.191
So VNQs the first one.

55
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.478
Okay, let's go Chris.

56
00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:33.228
All right so we will go to finance.yahoo.com.

57
00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:38.695
Then we're going to create new portfolio.

58
00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:41.503
We'll call it REITs.

59
00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:46.040
We'll add the symbols, first one is VNQ.

60
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.714
What's next?

61
00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:49.464
Then we've got SRETs.

62
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:54.054
Then we've got XRE.TO, which is Canadian.

63
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:56.500
SRE.TO or XRE.

64
00:02:59.727 --> 00:03:01.042
Okay, sorry about that.

65
00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:02.459
Then we got SCHH.

66
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.424
REET.

67
00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:13.911
Then RWR.

68
00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.519
Great, we hit enter.

69
00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.568
And here we have them.

70
00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.820
And then we are going to change the headings

71
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.590
because we want all the data points.

72
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.886
And if you...

73
00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:28.517
Good, it knows, great.

74
00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:32.994
Save, we're gonna copy these like we usually do.

75
00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:33.827
Copy.

76
00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:36.055
Go to settings.

77
00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:40.133
Go down here and we'll just paste

78
00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:42.680
on top of what we had last time.

79
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.597
Right here.

80
00:03:45.568 --> 00:03:47.818
Great, then we will go back

81
00:03:51.338 --> 00:03:52.860
and well answer the questions.

82
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.908
Great, first one.

83
00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:57.481
Using Yahoo Finance, find out what the expense ratio is

84
00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:00.898
on the Vanguard REIT, okay, which is VNQ.

85
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:05.876
Okay and then oh, another question.

86
00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:08.338
What are the second through fifth largest holdings?

87
00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:10.588
Okay, expense ratio on VNQ.

88
00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:15.021
All right, that's Vanguard.

89
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:21.592
All right, expense ratio is 0.12, nice and low.

90
00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:23.009
And the holdings,

91
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.567
there they are there.

92
00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.324
Okay, that's fine.

93
00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:30.469
Great.

94
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.095
Next question, second through fifth.

95
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.562
Oh come on Chris.

96
00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:35.808
Two, three, four, five.

97
00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.162
There, fine.

98
00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:38.412
Okay, next one.

99
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:43.292
What was the inception date of this REIT?

100
00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:47.019
I guess I'm referring to that one, okay.

101
00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.852
R-E-E-T.

102
00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:59.420
Go to summary, that's where we get inception date.

103
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.087
It was 2014, July 8.

104
00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:05.075
Next.

105
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.705
What country this REIT has investments in.

106
00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:10.622
SCHH, okay.

107
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.283
SCHH.

108
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:17.144
Holdings.

109
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:23.864
These are all U.S. based.

110
00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.659
U.S. okay and remember the rule is,

111
00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.370
REITs have to pay out 90% of the earnings as a dividend,

112
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.709
that's why the yields are nice.

113
00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.933
Next up is, what was the dividend yield,

114
00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:40.595
what's the dividend yield on the largest holding

115
00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:42.012
of the SCHH REIT?

116
00:05:43.783 --> 00:05:46.354
Okay, and I typed it there.

117
00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:49.689
Holdings, Simon Property Group.

118
00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.841
Click on it and we'll get the dividend yield in a second.

119
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:54.841
There we go, 4.36%.

120
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.644
Okay.

121
00:05:57.644 --> 00:05:59.012
Next up.

122
00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:01.822
What was the average daily volume for this REIT?

123
00:06:01.822 --> 00:06:02.655
SRET.

124
00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:04.702
Okay.

125
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.820
The average daily volume was 27,650.

126
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:14.749
Number six, what's the market cap

127
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.413
of the third largest holding of this REIT?

128
00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:18.246
VNQ.

129
00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:20.240
V, oops.

130
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.008
Third largest holding.

131
00:06:27.008 --> 00:06:27.841
Holdings.

132
00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:32.392
Third, one, two, three, Equinix.

133
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:36.901
The market cap is $34.94 billion.

134
00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:42.313
All right, we are done.

135
00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:44.268
And if you have any questions about this process

136
00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:46.150
please let me know.

137
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.299
Couple more exercises, couple more lessons

138
00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.001
and I'm sad to say we will be done.

139
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:52.251
But congratulation to you.

140
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:53.536
Please click this box

141
00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:55.557
and I will see you next,

142
00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:57.931
in the next lesson and then we'll talk about

143
00:06:57.931 --> 00:06:58.764
diversification and do this exercise soon.

144
00:06:58.764 --> 00:06:59.597
Thanks.
