00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.874
<v ->Without a will, some countries</v>

2
00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:06.360
can take part or all of what you own

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.872
and keep it from being distributed for ages.

4
00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:13.289
We need to protect and enable your estate

5
00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:16.731
to be transferred to your loved ones.

6
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.148
And all regions are different

7
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:24.051
but you need to hire a wills and trust lawyer

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:25.760
to make your will.

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.351
It takes a few hours and you only need to do this

10
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:30.184
one time in your life.

11
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:35.649
Most Americans actually die without a will or a trust.

12
00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.400
A will and a trust basically means that the entity

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.067
that holds these items protects your assets.

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.480
I'll get back to trusts in a minute.

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.980
Let's focus on the will first.

16
00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.480
Gosh, this is depressing.

17
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.211
We need some help from another "will," Will Ferrell.

18
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:56.501
Okay, so I'm going to have to actually put up

19
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.291
a couple of Will Ferrell images here

20
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.251
cause he's the happy "will."

21
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:02.457
Sorry a little out there I know

22
00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:04.291
but it's depressing otherwise.

23
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:08.591
Okay, so when you hire a lawyer to create your will

24
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:12.681
they will help you create the actual will document.

25
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:16.132
They'll explain to you the entire process as well.

26
00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:16.965
This is all they do.

27
00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:19.801
A lot of lawyers just specialize in this area.

28
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.862
When the will has been created,

29
00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:25.151
we need to give a sealed copy of the will

30
00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.791
to whomever the executor of the will, will be,

31
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:31.903
meaning the person that will say who gets what

32
00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:34.823
and what happens to you if God forbid

33
00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:38.323
you pass away or you become incapacitated.

34
00:01:39.623 --> 00:01:43.143
The executor of the will, such an awful name.

35
00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:47.793
The executor of the will ensures that all your stuff

36
00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.293
gets distributed and part of it to be sold

37
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:56.684
in order to cover taxes and other topics

38
00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:57.517
like who the legal guardian

39
00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:00.033
is for your children if applicable.

40
00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:04.200
If you want, you can do this online at legalzoom.com

41
00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.307
or other online resources, but I actually recommend

42
00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:12.318
just hire a lawyer yourself and do it in person.

43
00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:15.347
This document is important.

44
00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:16.597
As a side note,

45
00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:22.296
if this lecture makes you even slightly unhappy,

46
00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:25.208 line:15% 
then we have to watch this Will Ferrell video here.

47
00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:26.635 line:15% 
Watch that.

48
00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:30.172 line:15% 
Sorry, moving on, I have to try to make you happy sometime.

49
00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:32.262
Let's talk about trusts,

50
00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:34.172
The circle of trust.

51
00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:37.201
Sometimes, you'll actually see or hear of terms

52
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.850
like, and I'm going to make this one up

53
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.273
The Chris and Christine Haroon Revocable Trust

54
00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:45.543
dated January 14, 2017.

55
00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:48.022
That's just an example.

56
00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:50.161
Whenever you see a title like that

57
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:53.833
it's kind of like a will, prepared by the same lawyer

58
00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.833
that created your will,

59
00:02:55.833 --> 00:03:00.473
but what it does, is it creates rules for who gets what

60
00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:02.881
while protecting your assets so the government

61
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.591
and others can't take them.

62
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:07.233
And it gets a little bit complicated

63
00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:11.351
which is why I recommend hiring a lawyer to do this

64
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.860
as you will have a lot of questions

65
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.729
kind of like what happens to your retirement accounts?

66
00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.991
How does your life insurance proceeds get paid out?

67
00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:24.871
How are your children taken care of, et cetera?

68
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.729
Do they only receive proceeds

69
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.311
if they get a university degree

70
00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:31.420
or if they reach a certain age,

71
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.801
or if they finish Call of Duty?

72
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:36.289
I'm kidding about the Call of Duty part, et cetera.

73
00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.961
Also, ask the lawyer about setting up

74
00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:41.011
a charitable trust, too,

75
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:43.240
which is a really nice thing to do.

76
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.102
If taxes where you live are ridiculously high

77
00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:49.051
for estate taxes when you pass away

78
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:51.760
then ask your lawyer to also set up a way

79
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.211
to transfer some of your assets

80
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:57.378
while you are still alive if you want.

81
00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.781
When you see the word revocable

82
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:05.062
in the title of a trust, this basically means

83
00:04:05.062 --> 00:04:07.871
that whoever made the trust, not the lawyer,

84
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.788
meaning you, whoever made the trust

85
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.969
you have the legal right to make changes to this trust.

86
00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.074
If you make it irrevocable, "ir" at the beginning

87
00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:21.737
irrevocable, which I don't recommend

88
00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:25.914
then you cannot change it no matter what.

89
00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:29.673
A trust can decrease the amount of taxes

90
00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:32.137
when transferring assets to others.

91
00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:34.096
It can also get very complicated

92
00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:36.915
which again is why I recommend to hire a lawyer

93
00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:38.675
to draft this document.

94
00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:42.817
A trust can also help to get your assets

95
00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.255
to immediately be transferred to your kids

96
00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:48.172
or whomever is listed in your will.

97
00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:52.865
Ask your friends and relatives and co workers, et cetera

98
00:04:52.865 --> 00:04:56.777
if you like them, to recommend a local lawyer

99
00:04:56.777 --> 00:05:00.235
to help you create your will and trust.

100
00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:02.874
I really hate dealing with lawyers

101
00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:06.417
but you have to do this when you set up your will and trust.

102
00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:10.256 line:15% 
The only lawyer I don't mind is this fellow Canadian

103
00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:13.435 line:15% 
who is the most honest lawyer you'll ever see

104
00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:15.102 line:15% 
per this link here.
