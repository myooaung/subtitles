1
00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:04.138
<v ->For this exercise, please create a portfolio</v>

2
00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.638
that adheres to all 10 or most

3
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:12.045
of our diversified model portfolio rules.

4
00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.755
This might take you a little while,

5
00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.867
but please take your time with this.

6
00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.578
And once you select the right combination of

7
00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:23.666
ETFs and/or stocks, bonds, commodities

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.664
to invest in for this exercise,

9
00:00:26.664 --> 00:00:29.072
then I recommend coming up with a

10
00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:31.943
percent of your portfolio for each

11
00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:34.362
instead of thinking about it in dollar terms.

12
00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:36.882
Think about it in percent terms.

13
00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:38.088
For example,

14
00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:42.255
if I hypothetically assume that I had $100,000 to invest,

15
00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:47.802
it would be easier for me and for most of us to think of

16
00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:51.969
single stock investments as being $5,000 or 5% of.

17
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.049
Think of it in percent terms.

18
00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.549
If you have $72,000 to invest,

19
00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.537
don't think of it in terms of,

20
00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.270
well, 10% of 72,000, 7,200.

21
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.103
Don't do it that way.

22
00:01:05.103 --> 00:01:07.459
I want you to think of it in percent terms.

23
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:11.603
So you have 100% to invest, just break it down that way.

24
00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:15.904
And before you get started, please take a look here at

25
00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:18.215
the diversification and model portfolio

26
00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:19.824
part of your investment

27
00:01:19.824 --> 00:01:21.474
portfolio management dashboard.

28
00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:24.207
Just look at column Bv.

29
00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:25.943
This will make more sense once you go there.

30
00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:28.575
Look at column Bv on your portfolio.

31
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:29.492
Okay, good.

32
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.571
In this last table on the right here, meaning Bv,

33
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:39.316
you can see that it will really help you to understand

34
00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:43.878
if you're adhering to your portfolio diversification rules,

35
00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:46.484
which, again, I've placed here in an orange box

36
00:01:46.484 --> 00:01:47.984
on the right side.

37
00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:51.789
Now, if we unhide row seven,

38
00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.291
we see the definition of the data titles.

39
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.751
If you entered your age in the settings

40
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.388
gray button place in the spreadsheet,

41
00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:05.349
this cell here that I'm currently pointing at will tell you

42
00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.989
what your risk management limits are in terms of

43
00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.723
what is the most you can deploy in more risky assets.

44
00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:15.806
So, for me, since I'm 45,

45
00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:20.959
I can put 65% in the more risky assets.

46
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:27.315
And I have no more than 5% of my investments in

47
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:31.534
any more risky categorized investment class.

48
00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.001
Now, I think it makes a lot more sense for me

49
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.137
just to jump right into this and explain exactly

50
00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:37.387
how to do this.

51
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:43.048
If you want, you can go and look at exercise number 24 here

52
00:02:44.257 --> 00:02:45.907
for the rules.

53
00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:46.889
Read this if you'd like to.

54
00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.297
I'm gonna explain exactly how to do this

55
00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:51.201
in this example right here.

56
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.631
But again, you can read this if you want to.

57
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.957
I think it might be easier to understand if

58
00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:58.115
you kind of follow me going through this.

59
00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:59.702
Because there's a lot of steps here.

60
00:02:59.702 --> 00:03:04.488
So what you do is you have to come up with a list of

61
00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:06.870
investments to go into your portfolio,

62
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.502
and I'll show you how I did it in a second.

63
00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:11.547
And then what you have to do is

64
00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:15.411
go here and classify them as less risky or more risky,

65
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:16.894
meaning each investment,

66
00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:20.354
as we explained in the previous lesson.

67
00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:23.864
And if you entered in your age on the settings page,

68
00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:26.175
this will update here,

69
00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:28.023
and then this will just basically tell you

70
00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:30.920
if you're within your risk parameter limits.

71
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.597
Change your age and then come back and read this

72
00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:35.061
and it'll make more sense.

73
00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:38.447
So let me show you how I went about and did this.

74
00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:42.282
We got a lot of rules to adhere to for this exercise.

75
00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:46.449
What I did, actually, was I created another tab here,

76
00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:50.376
and I recommend you create your own tab

77
00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:52.502
or spreadsheet as well and do this.

78
00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:54.529
And it took me a while to do it,

79
00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.792
but I went through all 10 of our rules,

80
00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.920
and you don't have to use all of these,

81
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.753
just use some of them if you want to,

82
00:04:01.753 --> 00:04:03.892
or all, completely up to you.

83
00:04:03.892 --> 00:04:05.098
I feel comfortable using them all,

84
00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:08.693
but they're my rules, so I can stick to them,

85
00:04:08.693 --> 00:04:11.355
but you might have different rules.

86
00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.517
And what I did was I came up with

87
00:04:14.517 --> 00:04:16.934
65%, see there, the sum?

88
00:04:18.452 --> 00:04:21.202
65% higher risk investments,

89
00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:25.565
and then 35% lower risk investments.

90
00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:30.044
And the way I know that they're higher or lower

91
00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:32.045
is based on the methodology that we

92
00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:33.960
talked about in the previous lesson,

93
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.377
which is also mentioned here.

94
00:04:38.287 --> 00:04:39.937
We're all different when it comes to risk management,

95
00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:42.472
but for me I'm quite conservative.

96
00:04:42.472 --> 00:04:44.813
I like to have no more than 5%

97
00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:48.677
of my net worth or invested net worth

98
00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:51.149
invested in any one particular security.

99
00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:53.038
And so, remember before I mentioned that

100
00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:54.635
I want you to think of this in percent terms

101
00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:56.062
instead of dollar terms?

102
00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.149
It's just easier this way.

103
00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:59.957
So in the hypothetical example here

104
00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:02.421
that I'm gonna go through with you,

105
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:06.229
I have $100,000, hypothetically, US to invest.

106
00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.879
So it's five grand in each one,

107
00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.399
so 65 grand in higher risk level,

108
00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:13.954
35 grand in lower risk level because my age is 45,

109
00:05:13.954 --> 00:05:17.287
and we know that 110 minus 45 equals 65.

110
00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:22.369
Just watch the last lecture if that doesn't make sense.

111
00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:24.079
So for the higher risk,

112
00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:27.002
remember, I said no more than 10% in commodities.

113
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.059
So I added two ETFs here.

114
00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.726
The Silver ETF and the Gold ETF,

115
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:34.308
and I'll show you how I did this

116
00:05:34.308 --> 00:05:36.731
in Yahoo Finance in a second.

117
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:39.419
And then I did a couple of stock funds,

118
00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.169
I did a 5% fund from Canada,

119
00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:46.210
I did 5% fund from Italy.

120
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.476
And then what I do is I have a growth fund ETF.

121
00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.522
These are ETFs, you know why I like ETFs,

122
00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:52.635
'cause the low fees.

123
00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:54.734
That's the ticker for the growth,

124
00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:57.168
and then for individual stocks, I got four of them here

125
00:05:57.168 --> 00:05:59.352
adding up to 20%,

126
00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:00.864
and that's the max risk I want to take on

127
00:06:00.864 --> 00:06:02.335
in individual stocks.

128
00:06:02.335 --> 00:06:04.560
So I've got Apple, which is a tech stock, obviously,

129
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.397
Caterpillar, which is an industrial,

130
00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:09.753
Goldman Sachs, which is financial, and Lululemon,

131
00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:11.086
which is retail.

132
00:06:11.952 --> 00:06:15.197
And then I've got 10% in REITs,

133
00:06:15.197 --> 00:06:16.903
real estate investment trusts.

134
00:06:16.903 --> 00:06:18.557
And I've got Vanguard and Schwab,

135
00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:22.057
two fantastic ETF companies with low fees.

136
00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:26.998
And then I threw in a sector funds, a healthcare ETF

137
00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:30.582
because I don't have any healthcare exposure here.

138
00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:34.641
And then I had here a smaller cap fund ETF.

139
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:36.123
And smaller caps are more risky,

140
00:06:36.123 --> 00:06:38.675
but it's my more risky bucket so I'm okay.

141
00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:41.505
I'm within 5% for all of them, that's cool, good.

142
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:45.327
Let's move on to the lower risk levels.

143
00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:48.160
So I have several bond funds here.

144
00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:50.802
I've got a five to 10 year

145
00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:52.900
investment grade corporate bond fund,

146
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.234
that's investment grade, which means it's highly rated.

147
00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:58.401
So it's A or above for us.

148
00:07:00.557 --> 00:07:02.125
Rated by Moody's and S&amp;P.

149
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.082
And then I've got a US government treasury bond fund,

150
00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:07.180
which is lower risk, of course.

151
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.753
And then I've got a muni fund, municipal bond risk.

152
00:07:10.753 --> 00:07:12.951
Municipal bonds, as we mentioned, are tax-free,

153
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.730
at least in the United States, in many areas they can be.

154
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.027
And that's to get people to incentivize to invest in them.

155
00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.901
This one here is very highly rated, A and above,

156
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:27.556
and so I'm not worried about default with this one,

157
00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:30.819
that's why I put it in the lower risk category.

158
00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:34.862
And then we have the treasury inflation protected securities

159
00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:37.601
ETF which we talked about earlier in the course.

160
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:41.170
And then I've got a couple of value stock fund ETFs here.

161
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.920
I've got core S&amp;P 500

162
00:07:44.937 --> 00:07:48.062
US value, it's just value stocks from there.

163
00:07:48.062 --> 00:07:50.007
And then I've got international.

164
00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:51.870
Remember, we like to have international exposure here,

165
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.954
at least 20% if we can.

166
00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:56.321
International value.

167
00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:59.192
And then I've got large cap value here as well.

168
00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:00.126
These are the larger companies.

169
00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:01.918
And larger companies are lower risk usually

170
00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:03.654
because they're more mature

171
00:08:03.654 --> 00:08:05.618
and you don't get as high of a return.

172
00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:09.101
Let's take a look for fun at my international exposure.

173
00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:10.908
So I'll just highlight them here.

174
00:08:10.908 --> 00:08:12.658
That's international.

175
00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:18.091
Let's see what else do I have that's international.

176
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:19.592
Italy is international.

177
00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:22.592
Canada, represent, is international.

178
00:08:24.293 --> 00:08:27.210
Let's see, do I have anything else?

179
00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:29.975
Well, you might say,

180
00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:32.678
"Chris, I thought you said we need 20% international."

181
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.478
And there actually is 20% international because

182
00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:38.476
when you look at larger cap US stocks,

183
00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.996
they have a very large percent

184
00:08:40.996 --> 00:08:44.367
of their exposure to international.

185
00:08:44.367 --> 00:08:45.573
I think I'm okay here.

186
00:08:45.573 --> 00:08:49.243
If you look at Apple, Caterpillar, Goldman, et cetera

187
00:08:49.243 --> 00:08:51.804
for their international exposure, it's quite high.

188
00:08:51.804 --> 00:08:56.344
So I think I'm easily at my 20% here, which is fine.

189
00:08:56.344 --> 00:08:58.248
I went through all these.

190
00:08:58.248 --> 00:09:01.059
I'm adhering to every single one of them,

191
00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:02.317
but let me show you now

192
00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:05.035
one thing I want to talk about, which is fees.

193
00:09:05.035 --> 00:09:09.235
We want our fees, remember, to be less than .5%.

194
00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:12.356
And, obviously, fees are not going to apply

195
00:09:12.356 --> 00:09:14.469
to the stocks, the individual stocks.

196
00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:17.187
Hopefully, when you trade or you purchase these stocks

197
00:09:17.187 --> 00:09:18.307
or whatever stocks you pick,

198
00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:20.711
and please, do your own research and don't rely on me.

199
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.727
When you pick your own stocks,

200
00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:25.273
hopefully, you're paying low commission fees,

201
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.849
whichever brokerage it is you're using.

202
00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:29.096
And again, if you don't know

203
00:09:29.096 --> 00:09:31.851
where to find a brokerage to invest in

204
00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:33.192
wherever you're based in the world,

205
00:09:33.192 --> 00:09:36.429
just talk to your bank and ask them to recommend one.

206
00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:37.493
Okay, great.

207
00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:39.031
Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go

208
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:40.066
over to Yahoo Finance.

209
00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:41.914
I'm gonna show you the portfolio I made.

210
00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.333
And we're gonna check to see that the fees

211
00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.103
are less than .5% for all of these.

212
00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:49.638
So let me go over here.

213
00:09:49.638 --> 00:09:50.878
Okay, great.

214
00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:53.517
So I created this portfolio here,

215
00:09:53.517 --> 00:09:56.608
and I actually edited the view,

216
00:09:56.608 --> 00:10:00.416
and then I sorted as well, I reordered.

217
00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:04.416
And I reordered so that it looks just like this.

218
00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:06.845
See?

219
00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:08.845
These are SLV, GLD, EWC.

220
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.990
SLV, GLD, EWC, good.

221
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.151
And I did that because I want to be able

222
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:15.749
to manage it within the portfolio.

223
00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:19.639
It's just more intuitive that way, for me at least.

224
00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.379
And now the markets are live, it's the day after Christmas,

225
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:23.546
it's the 26th.

226
00:10:24.703 --> 00:10:28.234
And by the way, I did not work yesterday.

227
00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:32.069
You can see that the stock prices are changing here.

228
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:33.469
Okay, great.

229
00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:35.802
So what I also did was I put

230
00:10:36.985 --> 00:10:39.658
all 20 of these stocks,

231
00:10:39.658 --> 00:10:40.917
or investments, I should say,

232
00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:43.731
there's all 20 of these.

233
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:47.259
I opened up all 20 at 5% each to equal 100%

234
00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:48.592
in 20 tabs here.

235
00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:51.239
And the way you do that

236
00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:54.355
is right click and go, Open Link in New Tab, of course.

237
00:10:54.355 --> 00:10:55.434
And we'll go there in a second,

238
00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:58.361
but you can also, when you make your portfolio,

239
00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:02.378
and for me, the top 13 are higher risk,

240
00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:04.704
and then the bottom seven are lower risk,

241
00:11:04.704 --> 00:11:06.287
just like over here

242
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:09.518
in this portfolio here.

243
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:11.715
Watch this.

244
00:11:11.715 --> 00:11:13.481
These ones here,

245
00:11:13.481 --> 00:11:14.814
13 is the count,

246
00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:16.811
seven is the count.

247
00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:18.689
Okay, good, let's go back.

248
00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:20.675
And you can also scroll down,

249
00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:22.482
this is actually pretty useful.

250
00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:25.482
I can scroll down and read news just

251
00:11:26.514 --> 00:11:29.202
on these items, it's awesome.

252
00:11:29.202 --> 00:11:32.409
So if you want to keep up to date on news on your portfolio,

253
00:11:32.409 --> 00:11:34.060
well, here's all the news items.

254
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.669
Right here.

255
00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:36.502
It's great.

256
00:11:36.502 --> 00:11:37.629
And as I mentioned before,

257
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:39.462
if you see a sponsored story like this,

258
00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:42.501
don't click on that, please, it's a biased story.

259
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:44.782
Don't click on that.

260
00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:46.477
And if anybody has

261
00:11:46.477 --> 00:11:49.065
strong editorial opinions in these articles, ignore them

262
00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:51.458
because I want you to do your own research, please.

263
00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:52.507
Okay, great.

264
00:11:52.507 --> 00:11:55.647
So now what we're gonna do is, I'm gonna look to see that

265
00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:59.034
these are all less than .5% expense ratio-wise.

266
00:11:59.034 --> 00:12:01.245
First one here is SLV.

267
00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:03.512
I'm gonna go in order.

268
00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:05.390
Here we go, we're at .5 or below.

269
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.819
That's fine.

270
00:12:06.819 --> 00:12:10.385
And I'm going to go into very fast forward mode here,

271
00:12:10.385 --> 00:12:12.449
and I'll join you in a second when we go through this

272
00:12:12.449 --> 00:12:14.699
so I don't waste your time.

273
00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:29.225
Okay, back to normal speed Chris.

274
00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.435
I want to mention that I got a bunch of the

275
00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:35.654
investment ETFs from this awesome document

276
00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.077
called ishares-product-list,

277
00:12:37.077 --> 00:12:38.450
which I included earlier in the course.

278
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.974
Please go to the resources section if you want to find it.

279
00:12:40.974 --> 00:12:44.163
And then all I did was I just searched on

280
00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.269
certain items here.

281
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:47.718
So I searched on the word value,

282
00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:50.659
and there's a bunch of incidences of the word value,

283
00:12:50.659 --> 00:12:52.647
you see all these matches in yellow.

284
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.730
And then I searched on the word bond.

285
00:12:56.724 --> 00:12:57.629
A bunch of them came up.

286
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:59.201
Tons, obviously.

287
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:03.707
Then I searched on the word growth for growth stocks.

288
00:13:03.707 --> 00:13:07.874
I did the same thing for small cap, large cap, sectors,

289
00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:11.364
et cetera, I think you get the idea.

290
00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:14.474
And this is just from iShares.

291
00:13:14.474 --> 00:13:15.986
Let me go to the first page here.

292
00:13:15.986 --> 00:13:18.013
There we go, it's from iShares,

293
00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:19.331
and you can go and get

294
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.019
commensurate or similar menus from other places,

295
00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:25.028
like Schwab's website, Vanguard, et cetera.

296
00:13:25.028 --> 00:13:26.028
Okay, great.

297
00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:31.394
So, I also went down and checked to see that the holdings

298
00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:35.279
were all relatively lower risk.

299
00:13:36.213 --> 00:13:37.833
Like, check this out, this is awesome.

300
00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:41.000
So this is the last entry I have, JKF.

301
00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:44.866
One of the holdings, large holding here,

302
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.875
is Berkshire Hathaway, and that's Warren Buffett's

303
00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:50.212
investment, it's pretty cool, pretty cool.

304
00:13:50.212 --> 00:13:53.629
And then for all of the bond-based funds,

305
00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:58.176
you could click on holdings

306
00:13:58.176 --> 00:14:00.651
and then just double check that,

307
00:14:00.651 --> 00:14:03.817
for the most part, almost all of the investments are

308
00:14:03.817 --> 00:14:07.457
above A, which they are, it's pretty good,

309
00:14:07.457 --> 00:14:11.003
and you can look through the rest of those if you want.

310
00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:15.808
Okay, great, now one more thing I want to show you

311
00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:18.058
is just like we did before.

312
00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:23.592
We're gonna take this, highlight them all,

313
00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:26.175
copy, and then we will go back,

314
00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:31.496
and then let me go over to our settings page here.

315
00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.070
Settings.

316
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.387
And then we're gonna paste that data

317
00:14:35.387 --> 00:14:38.721
like we have a number of times before in this course,

318
00:14:38.721 --> 00:14:41.721
we're gonna paste that data directly

319
00:14:43.005 --> 00:14:45.172
into this cell right here,

320
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.102
which I already did, but I'll do it again, watch this.

321
00:14:50.102 --> 00:14:53.102
And see how it changed a little bit.

322
00:14:54.037 --> 00:14:57.479
Every week or two, or month, or three, or whatever it is,

323
00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:59.159
you can update this data if you want to.

324
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:00.462
I don't want you to get in the habit of

325
00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:03.053
checking it daily though because I don't want you

326
00:15:03.053 --> 00:15:04.915
to be a trader because traders

327
00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:07.498
usually underperform massively.

328
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.825
I want you to be a longterm investor.

329
00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:14.465
So if we go to your portfolio now,

330
00:15:14.465 --> 00:15:17.067
and let me just close this field for a second,

331
00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:21.827
and you can always open it to explain what each item is.

332
00:15:21.827 --> 00:15:23.171
It's taking a second, sorry.

333
00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:24.657
There's a lot of data here.

334
00:15:24.657 --> 00:15:27.498
And so, we can see my portfolio is here,

335
00:15:27.498 --> 00:15:28.587
that we just created there.

336
00:15:28.587 --> 00:15:30.099
It's pretty cool, huh?

337
00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:31.499
Pretty cool.

338
00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:34.747
And we could see the daily change in the price today.

339
00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:37.164
Today is December 26th, 2017.

340
00:15:39.488 --> 00:15:41.321
And let's scroll over.

341
00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:47.774
And we don't have data for everything here.

342
00:15:47.774 --> 00:15:49.946
I actually made this bigger here, see this?

343
00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:53.011
Because I had more data I entered in.

344
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:56.610
So let me just explode this, or open it up again.

345
00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.288
And there's not gonna be data for every single item because

346
00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:02.151
they're not all stocks.

347
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:06.306
Some of these are obviously funds, bond funds,

348
00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:09.346
you know, some of them will issue dividends.

349
00:16:09.346 --> 00:16:12.064
Lululemon does not issue dividends yet either

350
00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:14.569
because it's more of a growth stock at this point.

351
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:15.569
Okay, great.

352
00:16:16.765 --> 00:16:18.598
And so what I did was,

353
00:16:20.461 --> 00:16:22.267
about five minutes ago

354
00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:24.802
before I started recording this lecture,

355
00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:28.054
I put in the purchase price of all the companies.

356
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:31.221
And they all moved a little bit since.

357
00:16:32.646 --> 00:16:35.396
The last price on SLV was $15.60,

358
00:16:36.902 --> 00:16:39.882
whereas I purchased it at 15.59,

359
00:16:39.882 --> 00:16:42.161
and you just hard code those in because it's white.

360
00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:46.148
And here's the purchase date, and they're all today.

361
00:16:46.148 --> 00:16:47.817
And no, we have not owned

362
00:16:47.817 --> 00:16:48.851
any of them for more than a year.

363
00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:50.725
Obviously, we just bought them today.

364
00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:53.581
If I changed it to two days ago,

365
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:55.068
it'll say two days, see there?

366
00:16:55.068 --> 00:16:56.662
Ctrl Z, undo that.

367
00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:58.032
And again, the reason I have this

368
00:16:58.032 --> 00:16:59.477
is because I want you to get

369
00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.079
into the habit of owning things for more than a year

370
00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:03.830
for many reasons, one of which

371
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.462
is if it's not in a tax-deferred accounts

372
00:17:06.462 --> 00:17:09.370
or tax-free accounts, then you'll pay higher taxes,

373
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:12.282
usually, if you own stuff for less than a year.

374
00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:16.635
And then here, I own about $5,000 of each of these

375
00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:19.867
because my portfolio size is $100,000.

376
00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:22.152
This looks like I lost $4 today.

377
00:17:22.152 --> 00:17:25.064
Don't listen to me, you'll lose $4.

378
00:17:25.064 --> 00:17:26.161
Sorry, bad joke.

379
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:27.411
But anyway, so.

380
00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:33.258
If I put my currency as non-US dollars,

381
00:17:33.258 --> 00:17:35.946
it will get converted automatically right here,

382
00:17:35.946 --> 00:17:38.873
and I'll show you how in a second.

383
00:17:38.873 --> 00:17:42.095
And so today, since I put on this position,

384
00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.473
I lost $12 in the past five minutes,

385
00:17:44.473 --> 00:17:47.553
and please don't look at stuff short term

386
00:17:47.553 --> 00:17:51.402
like I'm just mentioning here, but $12 Lululemon.

387
00:17:51.402 --> 00:17:55.925
This one I lost $4, and I made $6 on this fund.

388
00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:59.258
And then I made a whole dollar on Apple,

389
00:18:00.338 --> 00:18:02.714
which doesn't even cover a song now.

390
00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.629
It used to be 99 cents, it's higher now.

391
00:18:04.629 --> 00:18:05.462
Okay, great.

392
00:18:05.462 --> 00:18:07.795
So I think you get the idea.

393
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.028
What else do we have here?

394
00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:14.250
If we scroll over to risk management,

395
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.218
every stock is 5%, that's fine, I'm within the limit.

396
00:18:17.218 --> 00:18:19.723
If it's over 5%, it's bad.

397
00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:22.900
I'm violating that risk management covenant.

398
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.643
And then here for the sector,

399
00:18:24.643 --> 00:18:27.206
it only picked up three stocks for sectors here,

400
00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.884
and the reason is,

401
00:18:28.884 --> 00:18:30.273
and I've got logic set up here,

402
00:18:30.273 --> 00:18:31.393
and if you're a nerd like me,

403
00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:33.857
you can check out the logic on that.

404
00:18:33.857 --> 00:18:36.754
Basically, only three of the companies are in the S&amp;P 500.

405
00:18:36.754 --> 00:18:39.271
So those are the three sectors these are in.

406
00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:41.499
Tech stock, industrial, finance stock.

407
00:18:41.499 --> 00:18:45.039
And so I only have 5% of individual exposure there,

408
00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:47.671
the rest is not categorized.

409
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:49.548
The sector driver for tech,

410
00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:52.165
and this is automatically generated, is product cycle

411
00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.760
for Apple.

412
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760
Caterpillar.

413
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.058
When Apple releases a new iPhone,

414
00:18:57.058 --> 00:18:58.940
usually a stock boost because of that.

415
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.258
For Caterpillar, if GDP does well, then

416
00:19:01.258 --> 00:19:04.439
big companies buy more machines from Caterpillar,

417
00:19:04.439 --> 00:19:07.123
and then low unemployment I put there for Gold.

418
00:19:07.123 --> 00:19:09.227
And it's debatable, though, with financial services.

419
00:19:09.227 --> 00:19:10.227
Okay, great.

420
00:19:12.867 --> 00:19:14.461
And we've talked about this before,

421
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:16.600
and you can look in the course for sector D

422
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.937
to see the lecture on this section.

423
00:19:18.937 --> 00:19:21.104
And I'll scroll over here.

424
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:25.324
Now, diversification, this is section G.

425
00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:30.365
So I have the name of all those companies right here.

426
00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:32.030
And then I've got the position exposure,

427
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.415
the size of the position,

428
00:19:33.415 --> 00:19:34.800
and this is where I actually had to go

429
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.503
and categorize everything.

430
00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:41.453
Remember here earlier in this particular lesson,

431
00:19:41.453 --> 00:19:43.271
when I mentioned, if you enter in your age

432
00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:46.702
in the settings tab, this will tell you,

433
00:19:46.702 --> 00:19:50.036
what percent of your assets can be higher risk.

434
00:19:50.036 --> 00:19:51.884
And so I actually had to go through,

435
00:19:51.884 --> 00:19:54.094
and that's automatically generated, and so is this,

436
00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:56.823
and this is white so it's not yet entered in.

437
00:19:56.823 --> 00:19:59.001
And so for all of these,

438
00:19:59.001 --> 00:20:01.857
and I sorted it from more risky to less risky.

439
00:20:01.857 --> 00:20:03.524
Remember, over here.

440
00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:07.961
And it's also the same sort I have in Yahoo Finance,

441
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:09.167
and you can pause that if you're interested.

442
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:13.483
This is not my real portfolio, it's just an example.

443
00:20:13.483 --> 00:20:15.816
See, it's all here as well.
