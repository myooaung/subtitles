00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.629
<v ->I have been buying index Funds for many years.</v>

2
00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.346
There are so many cheap ETF meaning Exchange-Traded Funds

3
00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:10.464
products that you can buy,

4
00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.124
everything from small stock ETFs,

5
00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:15.298
again that means Exchange-Traded Funds

6
00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:19.465
to foreign country ETFs to Sector ETFs to Silver ETFs

7
00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.899
and many Bond Fund ETFs, etc.

8
00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:27.107
My favorite ETF company is Vanguard,

9
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.228
which charges fees that are very, very small

10
00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:32.834
on many of it's products, okay,

11
00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.317
and some of these fees are only .09%

12
00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:36.968
versus Mutual Funds and other firms

13
00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:39.861
that can charge a lot higher, okay

14
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:44.028
and many Index Funds usually charge less than .5%

15
00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.903
and I think that the blended average is .28%

16
00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:52.758
for all great Index Funds, or ETF Funds, same thing.

17
00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:55.984
So if you open a Vanguard account

18
00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:59.164
you will never pay any hidden fees,

19
00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:03.730
or other fees besides the roughly .09% fee

20
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.142
you will pay on most of their products.

21
00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.695
Okay, and I'm not sponsored by Vanguard at all,

22
00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.898
please, I'm just trying to be intellectually honest

23
00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:13.082
and tell you about great investments

24
00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:15.226
and in the next exercise, or the next lecture,

25
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:16.590
after this one we'll talk about

26
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.887
other firms similar to Vanguard.

27
00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:21.949
So Vanguard's fees are incredibly low.

28
00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:25.541
And so let's talk about an example of one of their products

29
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:29.817 line:15% 
called the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF,

30
00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:34.567 line:15% 
which has an expense ratio as you can see here of .04%,

31
00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:38.041 line:15% 
which is literally 96% cheaper than the average

32
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.663
expense ratio of funds with similar holding, okay,

33
00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:46.468
and use whatever Index Fund company that you want to,

34
00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:49.366
you know I love buying from larger retail firms

35
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.029
like Walmart as they buy in bulk

36
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.103
and their prices are obviously low.

37
00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:56.286
And the same can be said of Vanguard

38
00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:59.669
given their enormous scale and Vanguard has

39
00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:02.928
so many different types of Index Funds to invest in,

40
00:02:02.928 --> 00:02:06.047
it's kind of like Walmart for all liquid

41
00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:07.357
and low cost investments,

42
00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:10.844
liquid means you can buy and sell stuff quickly, okay.

43
00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:13.847
Also, since Vanguard doesn't trade nearly as much

44
00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:18.644
as Mutual Funds do, then you end up paying less tax,

45
00:02:18.644 --> 00:02:21.834
because if you hold investments for more than one year,

46
00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.333
again in many countries you pay less tax,

47
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.817
it's also a better way to invest.

48
00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:31.142
And buy and hold over decades works exceptionally well.

49
00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:34.476
And so 83% of Vanguard's Index Funds

50
00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:39.038
have had no capital gains taxable distributions

51
00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.390
in the past five years.

52
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.780
That basically means that they've not

53
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.216
really sold very much,

54
00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:45.184
so they don't really have any taxable gains,

55
00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:46.175
okay which is good for you

56
00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:48.503
because you won't pay taxes on that, okay,

57
00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:50.998
unless you sell the products, okay.

58
00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:54.432
So Vanguard's Index investments are called ETFs,

59
00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:57.280
which again means Exchange-Traded Funds,

60
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.046
so call Vanguard and ask them to send you a prospectus,

61
00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:02.353
which basically means a document telling you

62
00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:04.936
everything about the company and their funds.

63
00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:07.046
Call them, ask them to send you a prospectus

64
00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:08.580
and you can start doing research

65
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.908
on what ETFs are best for you

66
00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:13.889
and so here's is their number right here, okay,

67
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.389
it's 800-662-2739.

68
00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.321
If this number doesn't work for you,

69
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.452
than you can also access them, access them online

70
00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:26.823
here at vanguard.com, okay.

71
00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:31.572
Now if you don't want to open a Vanguard account,

72
00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.655
then you can still buy their ETFs

73
00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:37.906
through your local broker or through your bank, okay

74
00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:40.275
and this will make much more sense to you very soon.

75
00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:44.905
And even you can ask your bank to recommend brokers

76
00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:48.553
that you can use for investment accounts

77
00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:52.379
and make sure that the fees are very, very low,

78
00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.015
okay when you talk to a broker, okay,

79
00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:57.519
if you are buying ETF products from a company like Vanguard

80
00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.666
they shouldn't really charge you very much fees,

81
00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.877
just understand the fees structure please.

82
00:04:01.877 --> 00:04:05.082
It's, if you work for a company, a big company,

83
00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:06.890
and you have a retirement investment account

84
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.022
set up at your company,

85
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:12.095
ask your company about Vanguard's Index Funds,

86
00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.686
or Index Funds in general from other companies,

87
00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:17.537
just please make sure that the fees are very low,

88
00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:19.992
most people never ask about the fees, okay

89
00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:22.114
and don't worry, I'm gonna be objective

90
00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:25.294
and intellectually honest in our discussion of Index Funds

91
00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:28.094
as we will talk about Vanguard

92
00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:29.870
alternatives in the next lecture, thanks.
