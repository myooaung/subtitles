00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:01.919
<v ->Welcome to exercise number 17</v>

2
00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:05.196
which is called Avoid Damaging Fees.

3
00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:06.786
So, in this exercise

4
00:00:06.786 --> 00:00:08.965
we're gonna calculate how much money fees

5
00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:11.909
can really cost us in the long run.

6
00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:13.259
Then after this exercise

7
00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.421
we'll discuss how to avoid paying

8
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:16.693
these ridiculous fees

9
00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:20.769
and just how to get much better performance too.

10
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.961
Please go to exercise number 17

11
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.569
where we're going to calculate

12
00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.063
how damaging fees can be to our portfolio

13
00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:28.496
and the bottom line message here

14
00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:30.775
is that I want to impress upon you the fact

15
00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.356
that if you invest in lower fee-based products

16
00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:37.301
like ETFs instead of mutual funds,

17
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:40.043
you can save a fortune in the long run.

18
00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:42.204
Okay, so, in this example as always

19
00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:44.524
we only enter in information in the white cells

20
00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:45.715
and we're gonna calculate

21
00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:49.132
how damaging an investment vehicle can be

22
00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:53.600
to our net worth that has high fees.

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.351
Okay, so the annual fee

24
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:58.591
is three percent in this case.

25
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.841
Monthly savings, 300 bucks.

26
00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:04.651
Number of years, 50.

27
00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:09.000
And the return rate before fees

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is eight percent, so the fees are three percent.

29
00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:15.423
Okay.

30
00:01:15.423 --> 00:01:16.830
Here's the bottom line message,

31
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.135
Excel in English right here,

32
00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:22.835
so it looks like it's gonna cost us a fortune

33
00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:24.243
in fees to invest in this fund,

34
00:01:24.243 --> 00:01:26.910
so that small three percent fee,

35
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:30.027
I know it seems very small

36
00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:32.141
but it's actually gonna cost us

37
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:35.610
almost $1.6 million or 1.6 million,

38
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.536
whatever currency it is you're using

39
00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:40.204
and if you want to see the math here,

40
00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.234
without the fee of three percent,

41
00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.933
I just calculate the return based on the future value

42
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.396
of the rate of eight percent,

43
00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:49.890
the number of payments or periods I should say

44
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.140
being 50 years,

45
00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:55.764
times 12 'cause there's a payment every month

46
00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:59.708
and then here I've got the actual payment amount

47
00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:01.158
which is 300

48
00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.260
and here for the interest rate we divide by 12

49
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.233
'cause it's on a monthly basis.

50
00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.288
Now, the only difference is this,

51
00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:11.277
watch this, I'm gonna deduct from here the fees.

52
00:02:11.277 --> 00:02:12.294
Okay, see here?

53
00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:13.438
I'm deducting the fees

54
00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:16.949
and that's why it's a very, very damaging impact

55
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.040
to your portfolio.

56
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.170
It's almost criminal.

57
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.245
Okay.

58
00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.391
Next up, using the white cells here

59
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:24.563
calculate what a three percent fee

60
00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:26.730
can cost us after 50 years

61
00:02:27.652 --> 00:02:32.059
and then what we'll do is we'll make it just 50 basis points

62
00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.912
or .5 of a percent,

63
00:02:33.912 --> 00:02:35.392
so it's a little bit different,

64
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:37.277
so we'll do, let's see here,

65
00:02:37.277 --> 00:02:41.006
it's gonna be return before fees of 3.5%,

66
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.525
three percent fee, okay, watch this

67
00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:47.223
and the monthly savings is gonna stay at 300 bucks,

68
00:02:47.223 --> 00:02:50.055
50 years times 12 months, right?

69
00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:51.138
And then 3.5.

70
00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:55.851
Amazing, just amazing.

71
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.117
Look at that impact.

72
00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:02.034
That additional fee is gonna cost us 283 bucks,

73
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.339
crazy, crazy, I hope you understand that.

74
00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:08.410
If that doesn't make sense to you,

75
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.307
please let me know.

76
00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:13.935
All right, number three, the last question.

77
00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:15.992
We're gonna do the same thing.

78
00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:19.283
We're going to say a three percent fee

79
00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:22.256
that has returns of 15% before fees,

80
00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:24.006
so three percent, 15,

81
00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:27.745
300, 50.

82
00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:32.886
Staggering.

83
00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:35.786
Staggering.

84
00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:38.191
The cost here in fees,

85
00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:40.774
that fee is 29.7 million bucks.

86
00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:44.729
Incredible, incredible.

87
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.933
Okay, good, now that you understand the impact

88
00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:48.903
that fees can have on your portfolio

89
00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:50.139
and this is not an exact science

90
00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.327
but I just wanted you to get the general idea,

91
00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:53.160
now that you understand,

92
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.677
what we'll do is very soon

93
00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:56.271
we're going to go through and create

94
00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:58.348
a very diversified portfolio

95
00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:00.795
and what we'll do is we'll add stocks,

96
00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:04.492
bonds, commodities, real estate investment trusts

97
00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:06.421
and all through ETFs

98
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:08.208
so that you can understand

99
00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:10.439
how low the fees are that we're gonna pay

100
00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.004
and how much money we'll save in the long run

101
00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:13.157
and by the end of this course you'll see

102
00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:14.773
that I don't ever recommend paying

103
00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:17.569
more than half a percent in fees

104
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:18.833
and I'll show you exactly where

105
00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:19.966
you get this information from.

106
00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:20.799
Thanks.
