00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:03.275
<v Instructor>Let's discuss what the columns mean here</v>

2
00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:04.868
in section B.

3
00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:07.577
And so the purchase price of course

4
00:00:07.577 --> 00:00:10.847
is what you bought the stock at, so for Apple,

5
00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:14.965
let's say that we bought it recently at, I don't know, $165,

6
00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:18.452
okay, and the last price on Apple is 175,

7
00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.838
so let's just enter it here, and remember,

8
00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:21.234
this is a white column,

9
00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.523
so you're allowed to enter data into it.

10
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.356
165.

11
00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:26.985
Great.

12
00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.505
Okay, good.

13
00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:31.670
Then, this is the last price it traded at,

14
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.855
this is how much you are up or down on the stock, right?

15
00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:39.084
And so that's actually, we're up 6% since we bought it.

16
00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:42.663
That's $10 divided by 165 is 6%.

17
00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:45.378
You can always double-click and see how

18
00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.480
I calculated that logic.

19
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.500
Okay, X out of there.

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.012
This is where you enter in the date, okay,

21
00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:52.898
where you bought it.

22
00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:55.521
So let's pretend I bought it two days ago.

23
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.775
Let's say that's, or three days ago,

24
00:00:57.775 --> 00:01:00.275
let's go the 21st of December.

25
00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:04.354
So it's gonna be one, two, 21, 2017.

26
00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.812
And I apologize for Europeans and Canadians

27
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.984
that do the day first.

28
00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:16.324
Just do month first please here, okay.

29
00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:17.574
Okay, now here,

30
00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:21.886
have we owned the stock for more than a year?

31
00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:23.895
No, we just owned it for three days,

32
00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:27.570
and the reason that I have that calculation there

33
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.480
because if you own for less than a year and you sell it,

34
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.854
then if it's not in a tax-free or tax-sheltered account,

35
00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:37.222
you pay taxes.

36
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.452
You pay higher taxes I should say on stuff that you sell

37
00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:43.338
in less than year, and this is not valid in all countries

38
00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:46.582
but most it is because what happens is the governments

39
00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:50.064
tries to incentivize you to be a longer-term shareholder,

40
00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:52.349
right, because they know that longer-term investors

41
00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.014
do better, okay?

42
00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:56.135
So anyway, that's calculated there,

43
00:01:56.135 --> 00:02:00.599
and even if your government does not have that tax benefit

44
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.525
of holding something longer term and paying less tax,

45
00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:05.507
I still want you to own it for than a year

46
00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:08.679
and look at this closely unless something changes

47
00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.946
with the stock.

48
00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:11.954
Okay, moving on.

49
00:02:11.954 --> 00:02:13.378
This is the number of shares you own.

50
00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:16.169
So let's say that we bought 10 shares of Apple

51
00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.169
at 165 bucks each, okay?

52
00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:23.571
And so that means we own $1,750 worth of Apple, right,

53
00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:28.161
and since Apple's gone up 10 bucks since we bought it,

54
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:31.427
we've made 100 bucks so far on it, okay?

55
00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:33.941
And that would be negative if the stock was down

56
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.984
when we bought it, okay?

57
00:02:35.984 --> 00:02:38.339
And this is just on a daily basis how much money

58
00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.530
you've made or not.

59
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.097
Don't pay too much attention to that

60
00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:42.337
because that's just one day

61
00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:44.058
and I want you to be long-term focused.

62
00:02:44.058 --> 00:02:46.641
And so that's it for section B.

63
00:02:48.412 --> 00:02:50.258
If you have any questions, please let me know,

64
00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:53.772
and in the next lesson, we're gonna talk about section C,

65
00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:57.010
which is managing risk, which is called risk management.

66
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.843
Thanks.
