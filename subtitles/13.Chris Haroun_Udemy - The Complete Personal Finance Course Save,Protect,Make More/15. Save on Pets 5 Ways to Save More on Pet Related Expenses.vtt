<v ->Obviously skip this section if you don't have a pet</v>

2
00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:13.107
or you're not planning to get one,

3
00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:16.554
but let's talk about pet expense tip number one.

4
00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:18.041
Be ready first.

5
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:20.435
Be ready when you get a pet,

6
00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:23.275
as the cost can actually be anywhere from $500 per year

7
00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:26.571
to several thousands of dollars per year,

8
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:28.799
including vet visits, you know, spraying them,

9
00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.800
dog walking, if applicable,

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.304
where to leave your pet if you go on vacation, et cetera,

11
00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:37.184
and you know smaller pets are easier, usually,

12
00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:39.720
on your budget as well.

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.826
Pet expense tip number two,

14
00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.662
buy the bigger food items tip.

15
00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:44.957
Obvious, but I have to reinforce it.

16
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.914
Buy food in bulk, even if it seems expensive

17
00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.678
for your dog or your cat or whatever,

18
00:00:49.678 --> 00:00:53.052
as the cost is obviously much, much lower.

19
00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.260
Number three, groom your pet yourself tip.

20
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.322
Use YouTube and learn how to groom your pets,

21
00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:01.425
as this will save you a lot of money,

22
00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.420
and get your kids to help out too if you can.

23
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.158
As they, remember they begged you to buy that pet,

24
00:01:07.158 --> 00:01:09.847
and you shouldn't have to do this much work,

25
00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:11.662
even though they promised you

26
00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:12.695
that they would do all the work.

27
00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:14.811
You know what I mean.

28
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:16.792
Okay, tip number four.

29
00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:20.438
Make your own toys and pet item tips.

30
00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:22.221
Make your own toys for your pets.

31
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:24.719
You can use websites like Pinterest here

32
00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.028
for fun and affordable ideas as well.

33
00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:32.703
Tip number five, never buy stuff from your vet tip.

34
00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:36.013
Don't buy anything from your vet, as it's expensive,

35
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.861
like buying shampoo is from a hair salon.

36
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.917
Just buy it online on Amazon or other websites,

37
00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.063
you'll save a lot of money.
