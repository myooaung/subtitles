00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:03.973
<v ->According to the United States Department of Agriculture,</v>

2
00:00:03.973 --> 00:00:07.767
the amount of money that parents spend on one kid

3
00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:11.267
until they reach 18 years old is $240,000.

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:15.952
And (chuckles) that is why you don't see

5
00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:18.771
more Lamborghinis or Ferraris on the highways.

6
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.092
Wow.

7
00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.861
Actually, that's kind of a good birth-control message, man.

8
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:24.694
Huh.

9
00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:25.527
Just kidding.

10
00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:27.449
Alright, so (laughs) many countries

11
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.441
have education tax savings plans,

12
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:31.845
which are similar to the retirement

13
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.547
savings plans that we spoke about.

14
00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:36.249
And so what I want you to do is

15
00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:38.436
you could search for education tax savings

16
00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:40.803
in your country name if you wanted to,

17
00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:43.246
or just look here at this link

18
00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:45.350
if it exists for your country.

19
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.348
In the United States, the education savings program

20
00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:49.475
is called the 529, right?

21
00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.812
And the reason you have all these numbers for tax codes

22
00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:53.953
is because that's the number in the tax code

23
00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.688
when they create that new law, right?

24
00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.069
It's a little up there, but it is what it is.

25
00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.368
In Canada, it's not called a 529,

26
00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:02.471
it's called the RSVP.

27
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:06.638
I'm sorry, the RESP, or Registered Education Savings Plan.

28
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.569
And the concept is similar in many countries, okay?

29
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.397
So it's similar in many countries,

30
00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:13.467
the educational savings programs,

31
00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.696
because you save money in a tax-free account

32
00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:20.779
to pay for your kid's school in the future, okay?

33
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.851
And then you pay taxes on it when you take that money out

34
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.374
of the educational savings plan

35
00:01:28.374 --> 00:01:29.858
in order to pay for your kid's school,

36
00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:31.584
which is expensive, right?

37
00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:33.135
However,

38
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:37.657
unlike a retirement plan, like a 401(k),

39
00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:39.740
education plans like 529s

40
00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:45.111
might not reduce your current taxable income, okay?

41
00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:50.291
And many companies actually match your contributions

42
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:51.918
for education savings programs as well.

43
00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:53.454
If you work at a big company,

44
00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:57.010
make sure to call human resources, okay?

45
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.170
See if they match the education

46
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.613
savings contribution you're making.

47
00:01:59.613 --> 00:02:00.446
Okay.

48
00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:04.154
Separately, in the retirement savings lecture earlier,

49
00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:08.642
we spoke about how there might be retirement accounts

50
00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:13.346
where you can put the money in after you pay taxes,

51
00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:15.932
then you let the money grow tax-free,

52
00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:17.172
and then you take the money out

53
00:02:17.172 --> 00:02:19.038
and you don't pay taxes when you take it out.

54
00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:19.871
Okay?

55
00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:22.740
Again, in the US, it's called a Roth IRA.

56
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.573
Okay.

57
00:02:23.573 --> 00:02:26.788
And there are similar educational savings accounts,

58
00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:31.158
or ESA, educational saving account programs like that

59
00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:32.877
for education savings account,

60
00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:35.210
meaning you pay taxes first,

61
00:02:36.524 --> 00:02:39.489
and then you put the money in that account,

62
00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.286
meaning in the ESA, educational savings account,

63
00:02:42.286 --> 00:02:45.837
and never pay taxes on it ever again when you take it out.

64
00:02:45.837 --> 00:02:47.481
Okay?

65
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:49.864
And when you have grandchildren,

66
00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:53.278
the best gift you can give them when they're born

67
00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:58.088
is a $2,000 donation into their educational savings account.

68
00:02:58.088 --> 00:02:58.921
Right?

69
00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:01.032
Because that $2,000 can grow tax-free

70
00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:03.102
and be worth a heck of a lot more

71
00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:05.783
by the time they go to college or university.

72
00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:09.608
Okay, and you wanna start saving if you can

73
00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:13.373
when your kids are very, very young, right?

74
00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:16.488
And the cost of a four-year university education

75
00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.396
is gonna be well over $100,000

76
00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:22.146
by the time they're in school if they're born today, okay?

77
00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:24.676
In some countries, and more in other countries.

78
00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:27.449
So let your money grow for you starting today.

79
00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.792
And you know, they should've

80
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.819
taught us this stuff in school.

81
00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.080
And lastly, many places,

82
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.772
you cannot deduct the interest on your student loans.

83
00:03:37.772 --> 00:03:40.907
And if you have any additional questions about this,

84
00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:41.848
please let me know.

85
00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:42.681
Thank you.
