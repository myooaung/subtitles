00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:03.202
<v ->I debated whether or not to include this side note here,</v>

2
00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:05.636
it's, I don't wanna be too repetitive,

3
00:00:05.636 --> 00:00:08.329
but I'm gonna get on my knees here for now, okay,

4
00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.965
all right, hold on, bear with me, okay,

5
00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:12.434
I really want to prove, prove a point.

6
00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:15.976
Please, here's my hands, please, please, please,

7
00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.671
I'll move closer so you can hear me,

8
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.012
please, please, please, please

9
00:00:20.012 --> 00:00:22.723
have your company that you work for,

10
00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:26.707
or your bank where you have your investments, automatically,

11
00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:29.552
have them automatically deduct money

12
00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:32.045
from every paycheck you have

13
00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:35.193
and have them place it into investments automatically,

14
00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:37.697
so it's out of sight and out of mind, okay,

15
00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:39.465
kind of like I am right down,

16
00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:42.984
right now down on my knees out of my mind.

17
00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:46.133
All right, here, I had to prove a point there.

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.716
All right I'm gonna get up now, here I am,

19
00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:50.108
I don't mind making a fool of myself

20
00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:54.989
as long as I humbly help you manage your investment better,

21
00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.322
okay, god my knees hurt now, okay, okay,

22
00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:03.644
separately if you have, if you can't save any money yet,

23
00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:06.763
don't worry about it okay, just promise yourself

24
00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:10.576
that the second you get your next raise

25
00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:14.063
the first thing you'll do is set up your bank account

26
00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:18.081
to automatically withdraw so you can invest

27
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.942
every single penny counts, okay.

28
00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:22.989
In addition I recommend having

29
00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:25.703
the company you work at if applicable

30
00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:28.479
deduct the tax you'll be paying

31
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.448
on your earnings from every single paycheck, okay,

32
00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:34.416
and I wanna do this so that you

33
00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:35.894
don't overspend during the year,

34
00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:37.816
when it comes time to taxes you don't where

35
00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:40.687
to get the money from to pay for taxes, etc, okay.

36
00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:43.928
So if this is not all possible for you to do,

37
00:01:43.928 --> 00:01:45.030
or if you are self employed,

38
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.449
then just put the amount of tax you think

39
00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:50.693
you will be paying into another bank account,

40
00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:52.537
so that you don't spend, thanks.
