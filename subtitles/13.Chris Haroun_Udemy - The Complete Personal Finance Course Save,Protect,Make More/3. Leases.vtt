00:00:00.842 --> 00:00:03.480
<v ->If you lease a car versus just buying it</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.240
you usually put less money down when you get the car.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.640
I want you to think of leasing a car like renting it

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.299
and the rental time lasts for three to five years.

5
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.267
So why do it?

6
00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:18.011
Why lease a car?

7
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:21.107
Because you might not have enough money on hand

8
00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:22.481
to buy the car.

9
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.177
Or because there might be tax benefits

10
00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:27.146
depending on where you live

11
00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:29.893
to getting a lease instead of buying a car.

12
00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:32.813
And you might also not want to

13
00:00:32.813 --> 00:00:37.563
have your balance sheets debt divided by equity

14
00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:40.438
get worse as the amount of outstanding debt

15
00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:45.144
that you have increase when you get a loan, of course.

16
00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.413
You can also

17
00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.663
a lot of companies,

18
00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:49.379
like if you start your own company like I have,

19
00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.546
you can actually get tax benefits to leasing.

20
00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.479
Every regions different, look into it.

21
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.963
And just remember in exercise eight

22
00:00:56.963 --> 00:00:59.963
calle analyzing your bs times seven,

23
00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.976
when we created and calculated our debt to equity ratio.

24
00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:04.809
Remember that?

25
00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.642
We did debt divided by equity.

26
00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:09.406
This debt to equity ratio is basically the same thing

27
00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:12.323
as liabilities over your net worth.

28
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:15.765
If you get that big car loan

29
00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.169
and the ratio of your liabilities divided by your net worth

30
00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:22.183
will go up which means that you might not be able to

31
00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:25.330
get a mortgage or other loans if needed.

32
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.274
And so a few years ago Kristy and I bought a house.

33
00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:30.957
And the mortgage company would not approve the mortgage

34
00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.957
until I paid off the loan on my car.

35
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.075
So that my debt to equity ratio improved.

36
00:01:37.075 --> 00:01:38.441
And it wasn't a big loan either.

37
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:39.859
It was pretty small.

38
00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:40.942
And you might

39
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.103
you might not plan to drive the car much

40
00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:46.934
if you live close to where you work.

41
00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.935
And so leases actually limits

42
00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:51.399
the amount of kilometers or miles

43
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.489
you can drive your car annually.

44
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.802
And then you get charged if you go above

45
00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:58.044
that kilometer or mile limit

46
00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:01.877
by 25 cents per mile or kilometer for example.

47
00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:06.345
If you choose to buy the car after you lease it

48
00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:08.967
usually cost you a lot more though.

49
00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:11.635
And so I recommend buying used cars only.

50
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:16.501
As you can often save 30% right away on the cost of the car.

51
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.066
Never buy cars brand new.

52
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:21.617
You can check out the history of a used vehicle here

53
00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:23.367
at this website here.

54
00:02:25.184 --> 00:02:28.220
Hire mechanics, look at the car before you buy a used car.

55
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.369
Yes, this is expensive for one hour, right.

56
00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.991
But it really is worth it

57
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:35.776
because if you buy a lemon of a car,

58
00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:39.122
meaning a car there's been a bunch of issues with it,

59
00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:41.961
it's really gonna hurt you in the long run.

60
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:46.053
And you can also go to carfax.com to check that the car

61
00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.205
that you're buying is not a lemon.

62
00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:50.852
And cars also have vin numbers.

63
00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:53.495
VIN, which mean vehicle identification numbers

64
00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:57.507
that you can check out to see if a car has been

65
00:02:57.507 --> 00:02:58.902
in an accident or not.

66
00:02:58.902 --> 00:03:01.846
So I want you to think of a cars VIN

67
00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:04.204
as being like a cars credit rating

68
00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.456
or a cars social security number,

69
00:03:06.456 --> 00:03:07.767
or government ID number.

70
00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:10.276
And every car manufacturer since 1981

71
00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.443
has a 17 digit VIN number.

72
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.176
So I actually recommend looking up yours today

73
00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:20.508
because you can tell if there's been a safety recall as well

74
00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:22.868
on your car by entering you VIN

75
00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.118
at this website right here.

76
00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:29.261
So for much more information on your VIN

77
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.344
you can also go to this website here.

78
00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:34.268
Great.

79
00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:38.474
Another way to explain a lease versus a loan

80
00:03:38.474 --> 00:03:42.391
is if you wanted to get a loan to buy an Iphone

81
00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:46.374
and then you decided, wait a second here,

82
00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:48.790
no I don't want to get a loan because

83
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.777
if I buy my Iphone than my

84
00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:53.838
debt divided by equity will go up.

85
00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:57.254
And I want to get a new Iphone every year anyway

86
00:03:57.254 --> 00:04:01.060
so I will just sign up for the new Iphone upgrade program.

87
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.531
Where I can get a new Iphone, the newest model, every year.

88
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:06.335
That's kinda like a lease.

89
00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:08.763
That's probably a good way to think about it.

90
00:04:08.763 --> 00:04:10.526
And a lot of people think of cars like this.

91
00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:13.259
They want to get a new car every three years or so.

92
00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.147
And so what they do is they lease the car for three years

93
00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:18.782
and then the car dealer gives them a good deal

94
00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:21.232
if they get a new car to lease

95
00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:24.038
at the end of that three year period.

96
00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:26.173
Again new cars are a bad investment

97
00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:28.258
as they depreciate by about 30%

98
00:04:28.258 --> 00:04:30.858
the second you drive them off the lot.

99
00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:34.940
And companies actually lease photocopy machines,

100
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.631
so that their debt to equity ratio,

101
00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:38.805
the companies debt to equity ratio

102
00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:40.608
does not get worse.

103
00:04:40.608 --> 00:04:44.681
And so that they don't tie up that much of their money

104
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:47.303
by buying these machines.

105
00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:48.762
And so when you lease anything

106
00:04:48.762 --> 00:04:51.811
just always ask about additional fees.

107
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:54.693
Like other annual maintenance fees, etc.

108
00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:58.849
And if you get a loan for a car that you're buying

109
00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.768
you could pay off the loan any time.

110
00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:03.009
And you can sell it if you wanted to.

111
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.748
Unlike with a lease, you must return it.

112
00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:10.407
And if you buy your car, I recommend paying it off

113
00:05:10.407 --> 00:05:13.213
entirely if you can, instead of taking a loan.

114
00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:14.130
If you can.

115
00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:18.485
We want that debt that you take on to be

116
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.889
for the purchase of a house.

117
00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.569
I want you to save debt for your house

118
00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.743
which is probably the best investment

119
00:05:24.743 --> 00:05:25.934
most people will ever make.

120
00:05:25.934 --> 00:05:26.767
Thanks.
