1
00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:03.856
<v ->You need to have about 75 percent of your annual salary</v>

2
00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:05.600
in order to retire.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.275
And this is roughly 25 percent less,

4
00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.893
and not a hundred percent of your annual salary,

5
00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:13.942
as you don't need to pay for taxes, income taxes,

6
00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:15.401
I should say.

7
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:18.132
You don't need to pay for kids, hopefully at that age,

8
00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:20.991
and you don't have to pay for transportation to work.

9
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:25.722
And vacations, entertainment, travel related fees

10
00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.621
should increase when you retire,

11
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.598
and hopefully, by the time you reach retirement age,

12
00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:32.455
you're going to love what you're doing,

13
00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:36.953
so you can actually still work remotely using your laptop.

14
00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.865
Virtual reality goggles, or whatever it's going to be

15
00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.094
in the future, who knows.

16
00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.848
So, in this exercise, I'm not including any

17
00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:47.814
social security revenue here for you when you retire,

18
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.789
just to be conservative.

19
00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.773
I'm also not going to include any allocation

20
00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:55.261
for pension related stuff here, because most people

21
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:56.807
won't get a pension.

22
00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.008
And again, I want to be conservative.

23
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:00.843
So this begs the question,

24
00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:03.426
how much do you need per month,

25
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.659
and the general rule of thumb is to use a monthly multiplier

26
00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.612
like 300 times.

27
00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.123
Let me explain this.

28
00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:15.651
So if you need a thousand dollars per month,

29
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.291
then use a three hundred multiplier.

30
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:21.963
This means if you need a thousand dollars per month,

31
00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:24.600
then you need to have at least three hundred dollars

32
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.517
in savings.

33
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.431
If you need five thousand dollars per month

34
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:31.872
to survive when you retire,

35
00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:35.166
then you're gonna need 5000 dollars times 300 dollars

36
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.132
which is 1.5 million dollars in savings.

37
00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:40.206
This includes the value of your house

38
00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:42.398
when I talk about savings, okay?

39
00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:46.185
Many people actually downsize at retirement.

40
00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:47.918
They sell their house and move to a smaller one,

41
00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:50.634
as they don't need the extra rooms for kids.

42
00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:53.504
They might want to have a one level house

43
00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.741
or an apartment with an elevator,

44
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.702
as it can be cheaper as well to maintain that

45
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.869
than a larger house, okay?

46
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.355
Or some people actually by a cottage,

47
00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.188
which is cheaper given the more

48
00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:07.949
remote location if applicable,

49
00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.939
so if you think you're gonna need a million dollars

50
00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.293
when you retire, which means a million dollars

51
00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:16.730
divided by three hundred

52
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.602
and this equals 3,333 dollars per month.

53
00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:22.887
See, I just kind of changed that formula a bit.

54
00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:25.598
And of course, please don't forget about taxes.

55
00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:28.453
Will you take the money out of your retirement accounts.

56
00:02:28.453 --> 00:02:30.444
And don't forget about inflation as well,

57
00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:32.393
and the time value of money.

58
00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:36.393
And this is why I want to be really conservative

59
00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.824
and not have to rely on a penny from social security

60
00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:44.668
or pension fund or inheritance, et cetera.

61
00:02:44.668 --> 00:02:46.835
Let's also be conservative and assume that

62
00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.751
taxes are going to be at least 50 percent

63
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:53.100
by the time you take money out of your savings account.

64
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.193
So that one million dollars that you might need to retire

65
00:02:56.193 --> 00:02:57.980
is now two million dollars.

66
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.653
And I'm being very conservative here.

67
00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:04.653
I don't know how much you want to have per month

68
00:03:06.173 --> 00:03:08.047
when you retire, expenses wise.

69
00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:10.569
I don't know where you live and the standard of living

70
00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.903
that you want to have.

71
00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:14.669
As such, what I'm going to do is this.

72
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.539
I'm gonna provide you with a retirement calculator

73
00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.800
in this exercise and you can enter in

74
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.842
your own interest rates, how many years until you retire,

75
00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:27.795
and the amount you need per month.

76
00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:32.054
So please open up your complete personal finance dashboard

77
00:03:32.054 --> 00:03:33.843
and go to exercise number ten,

78
00:03:33.843 --> 00:03:36.716
which is called retirement needs.

79
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.740
And then, the default example here,

80
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.056
you can see that I calculated that if the interest rate

81
00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:44.761
is nine and a half percent

82
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.559
and the difference between your age now

83
00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.577
and the year you want to retire is 35 years,

84
00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:54.547
then in order to get a million dollars in 35 years,

85
00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:58.678
then the monthly contribution for the next 35 years

86
00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:00.732
should be close to 300 dollars.

87
00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:03.142
The math all makes sense here.

88
00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.035
In the settings tab, you can change your current age

89
00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:07.808
and the year you want to retire,

90
00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:09.313
if you want to change these perimeters around.

91
00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:11.533
And please play around with this,

92
00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:14.775
so that you have a general conservative target,

93
00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:18.023
so you can focus more time on saving for retirement.

94
00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.267
Use the goal seek function

95
00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:22.847
if you want to get an exact number,

96
00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:24.500
which we talked about earlier in the course,

97
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.242
the goal seek function.

98
00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:28.909
And as a side note, if you want,

99
00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:33.291
look at your income statement in exercise number two

100
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:36.156
to see how much money you need to have monthly

101
00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:39.501
then multiply it by 75 percent.

102
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:42.183
And also see your balance sheet in exercise seven

103
00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:45.347
to see how much money you currently have already saved

104
00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.048
in your retirement account and investment account,

105
00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:49.737
if applicable.

106
00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:51.657
Just remember that the rule of thumb is

107
00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:54.561
that you need 75 percent of your current expenses

108
00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:58.228
in order to live each month when you retire.

109
00:04:59.662 --> 00:05:01.418
And that figure is 75 percent again

110
00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:04.085
because you should not have to pay for kids then

111
00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:06.046
and you won't have to pay for a mortgage

112
00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:08.516
or as much for a mortgage or income taxes,

113
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.987
because you're not working.

114
00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:11.940
Now, I also want to stress,

115
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.286
this figure is higher than you might think you need

116
00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:20.011
because you'll still have to pay taxes on the money

117
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:22.345
that you're going to take out of your retirement account,

118
00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.178
so just be conservative.

119
00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:26.662
And 75 percent is a good benchmark to use.

120
00:05:26.662 --> 00:05:30.564
And play around with the 300 time monthly factor multiplier

121
00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:32.751
if you want as well.

122
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.526
I feel like I'm a waiter, hopefully a good waiter

123
00:05:36.526 --> 00:05:37.723
with good food.

124
00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:39.262
I want to kind of give you a menu of ways

125
00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:42.382
to do things and you enter in your own perimeters, okay?

126
00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:44.584
I know this is not an exact science,

127
00:05:44.584 --> 00:05:48.239
as there's plenty of unknown variables

128
00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:50.156
by the time you retire.

129
00:05:51.547 --> 00:05:53.930
Please enjoy this exercise and as always

130
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.162
if you have any questions, please let me know.

131
00:05:56.162 --> 00:05:56.995
Thank you.
