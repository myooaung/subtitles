00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:02.708
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:07.601
<v ->Welcome to part one of the course,</v>

3
00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:11.406
where we will talk about how to save way more money today

4
00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.073
and in the long run.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.969
In my hand I'm holding a football.

6
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.005
Lemme see if you can get a better look at that.

7
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.401
Sorry about the glare.

8
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.626
See if you can read that, okay?

9
00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.790
Now, why am I holding this football?

10
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.733
Well, I wanna start the saving part of this course

11
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:34.443
by talking about some of the best athletes in the world,

12
00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:35.468
okay?

13
00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.313
And this might shock you.

14
00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:40.881
And what do football players have in common?

15
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.815
Well, the average national football league

16
00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:49.207
or NFL player, makes $5.5 billion dollars per year,

17
00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:50.765
and shockingly,

18
00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:53.765
78% of all NFL football players

19
00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:58.499
are about to or actually declare bankruptcy

20
00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.316
within a few years of retiring

21
00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.040
from playing professional football.

22
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.541
Isn't that unbelievable?

23
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:05.380
And a lot of people that win the lottery,

24
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.501
couple years later, they spend all of it, and much more.

25
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.968
And it's because they obviously didn't have

26
00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:15.053
the best savings best practices,

27
00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:18.210
which we'll discuss in this section of the course.

28
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.729
And I wanna humbly make sure that this type of

29
00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.079
bankruptcy phenomemon never happens to you.

30
00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:27.912
Now,

31
00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:31.662
why are most players broke after they retire?

32
00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:36.111
Because they didn't live below their means,

33
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:37.624
which I have written up here,

34
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:40.505
"Please live below your means".

35
00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:43.224
And they obviously didn't save enough,

36
00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:45.169
and they likely didn't understand

37
00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:47.786
the concept of compound interest,

38
00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:50.977
and the unbelievable future value of savings,

39
00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.152
which is the first exercise

40
00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:54.469
that we're gonna do together in this course.

41
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.003
And I'm not picking on the Dallas Cowboys,

42
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.568
I just think they have a pretty cool logo, okay?

43
00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:02.401
So,

44
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:06.203
very small changes in your spending patterns

45
00:02:06.203 --> 00:02:09.237
can lead to enormous fortunes later in life.

46
00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:10.302
I'm gonna put this down.

47
00:02:10.302 --> 00:02:13.339
I have no idea how to throw these things.

48
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.576
I'm not much of an athlete.

49
00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:16.602
Okay, I'm gonna put that back there.

50
00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:17.435
All right.

51
00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:18.665
(laughs)

52
00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.014
So, yeah, small changes in your spending patterns

53
00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:24.015
can lead to enormous fortunes later in life.

54
00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:28.901
And we're gonna look at six examples of what I mean by this.

55
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:31.343
And then what we'll do is we'll do an exercise together

56
00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:33.214
in the next lecture.

57
00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:36.596
And the six examples are also located

58
00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:39.510
in your complete personal finance dashboard file

59
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.611
on the third tab, right here, see?

60
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:43.819
You can also

61
00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.319
get here by clicking this gray

62
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.170
money calculator button.

63
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.584
Okay, now I try to make it easy for you,

64
00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:52.466
so there's a couple ways to get to all exercises

65
00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.941
and options within the spreadsheet.

66
00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:59.087
So please open this money calculator tab here,

67
00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:01.017
as we go through this lesson,

68
00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:03.102
in case you wanted to change the numbers

69
00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:05.800
and assumptions as you watch this lecture.

70
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.124
And some of the numbers that we're gonna look at here

71
00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:08.957
are gonna blow you away.

72
00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:10.335
You'll be impressed.

73
00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:11.472
I was, at least.

74
00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:15.708
So, with all exercises and examples in the Excel file,

75
00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:16.593
please

76
00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:17.510
only change

77
00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.478
the white shaded boxes.

78
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:26.155
Now, before I start to explain how you can save a fortune,

79
00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:29.572
I wanna talk about the what, why, and how

80
00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:32.044
of part one of the course.

81
00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:33.671
So let me kick it off with the what.

82
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.454
By the end of part one of this course,

83
00:03:35.454 --> 00:03:37.787
you'll understand what you can do

84
00:03:37.787 --> 00:03:40.223
to save way, way, way, more money.

85
00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:41.267
Why?

86
00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:43.934
Because once we understand how you can save

87
00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:46.791
a lot more money, then in part two of the course

88
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.204
I can show you how to protect money,

89
00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:52.137
and then in part three I'll explain how to make more money,

90
00:03:52.137 --> 00:03:53.858
get your money to work for you.

91
00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:58.440
In terms of the how, how are we going to understand together

92
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.042
how we can save more money here in part one of the course?

93
00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:05.437
Well, we're gonna do a number of exercises

94
00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:08.660
to help you understand where your money is going

95
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.787
by creating your personal income statement,

96
00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:14.181
and we will discuss how to save more,

97
00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:17.853
and the incredible power of compound interest.

98
00:04:17.853 --> 00:04:19.294
So let's jump right in.

99
00:04:19.294 --> 00:04:21.802
By looking here at Example #1

100
00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:24.686
on this tab in your Excel spreadsheet here,

101
00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:27.853
called Exercise 1 Time Value of Money.

102
00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:31.569
In Example #1 here,

103
00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:36.080
let's talk about how much money we can save

104
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.997
in your currency

105
00:04:37.997 --> 00:04:41.247
by making your own coffee or tea daily.

106
00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:46.979
So, you can see that this exercise shows you the outcome

107
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.044
in euros because we changed the currency option

108
00:04:50.044 --> 00:04:52.280
to euros in the Settings tab.

109
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.564
Lemme just change it to US dollars here, okay?

110
00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:57.845
Just for this example.

111
00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.660
And don't worry, as we will use many different currencies

112
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.622
in this course, you can always change the white shaded

113
00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:07.211
cells to customize what it costs

114
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.044
to buy a coffee or tea or other items,

115
00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:13.983
et cetera, in your country in this exercise here.

116
00:05:13.983 --> 00:05:17.875
So, let's just say that a coffee or a cup of tea

117
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:19.458
costs you $2 daily.

118
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.608
Then if you saved that $2 daily by making your own coffee

119
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.716
and invested that $2 instead,

120
00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:30.049
then in 40 years

121
00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.127
you would have

122
00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:32.960
$326,000,

123
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.432
$177

124
00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:37.559
more in savings.

125
00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:41.374
Now, if you and your spouse did this,

126
00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.864
meaning $4 per day instead of two savings,

127
00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:47.781
then the savings for a couple would be $652,355

128
00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:50.119
over 40 years.

129
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.566
Change it to 45, watch what happens, right,

130
00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:56.351
those last five years make it skyrocket.

131
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.649
Right, and play around with these numbers too,

132
00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.724
it's a lotta fun.

133
00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:02.931
And so I assume that the money you save is invested

134
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.992
at a return of 9.5% annually, which is actually

135
00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:11.004
the average historical stock market return.

136
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.404
And we'll get to stock market stuff

137
00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:13.967
in part three of the course.

138
00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:15.475
Separately,

139
00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.642
rates are historically very, very low today,

140
00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:20.861
and they're gonna

141
00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:23.635
rise a lot over the next couple of decades,

142
00:06:23.635 --> 00:06:26.039
I promise you, and I digress a bit there,

143
00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.642
as we're gonna cover interest rates in more detail later.

144
00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:33.121
Now, please double click on the green cells

145
00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:35.733
in order to see how I calculated the values,

146
00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:39.357
if you want, or just watch the second last section

147
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.355
of this course for how I made this spreadsheet from scratch

148
00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:45.905
in case you wanted to customize it yourself.

149
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:50.358
Now, you don't need to have any Excel or finance background

150
00:06:50.358 --> 00:06:53.901
to watch how I make the spreadsheet

151
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.135
in the second to last section of the course,

152
00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:58.469
but if you're interested, the formula I used

153
00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.832
to calculate the value in 40 years here,

154
00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:04.209
or 45 years, whatever number you set it to,

155
00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:09.197
is called FV, FV stands for future value of your money.

156
00:07:09.197 --> 00:07:10.532
And

157
00:07:10.532 --> 00:07:14.192
in this formula, you can see the color coded inputs

158
00:07:14.192 --> 00:07:18.952
for the interest rates, which I used as 9.5%,

159
00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:21.915
and I divided it by 12, you see there,

160
00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:25.285
as I wanted to show you the monthly calculations.

161
00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:28.626
Then you have what's called nper,

162
00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.859
which means number of periods,

163
00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:34.937
which is multiplied by the number of months times 40 years,

164
00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:37.375
or 45 years, however many years you're using here

165
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:38.801
in your example.

166
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:42.851
Then the payment amount which I used is $60,

167
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:44.976
meaning $2 saved

168
00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:46.060
per day

169
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.227
times 30 days.

170
00:07:49.617 --> 00:07:52.721
And you can then read the bottom line sentence here

171
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:56.705
on the right, that you will see that by saving

172
00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:57.948
$60

173
00:07:57.948 --> 00:07:58.781
per month

174
00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:02.601
at an interest rate of 9.5% per year,

175
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:04.806
which is 9.5% divided by 12 to calculate

176
00:08:04.806 --> 00:08:07.820
the monthly return, then in 40 years,

177
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.653
or 40 times 12 months,

178
00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:12.060
you'd have

179
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.893
$326,177

180
00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:16.891
dollars in savings, for one person.

181
00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:18.644
Or for two people, meaning a couple,

182
00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:19.594
you would have

183
00:08:19.594 --> 00:08:20.427
$652,355

184
00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:22.861
for a couple.

185
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:23.890
It's amazing, it's amazing.

186
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.898
And so there's a lot of assumptions here,

187
00:08:25.898 --> 00:08:28.766
and I could've made this in daily percents

188
00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:29.902
instead of monthly if I wanted to,

189
00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:31.318
but let's just keep it simple.

190
00:08:31.318 --> 00:08:33.937
We'll stick to monthly in exercise number one,

191
00:08:33.937 --> 00:08:38.538
and then we'll do annual calculations in the next example.

192
00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:42.005
And so the whole point of this lesson is to show you

193
00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:44.521
that small changes can lead to

194
00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:47.305
significant wealth generation later in life.

195
00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:51.687
And didja ever notice how really wealthy people

196
00:08:51.687 --> 00:08:53.735
are often cheap?

197
00:08:53.735 --> 00:08:56.860
Now we know how they became wealthy.

198
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.832
So for now, please pause me if you want,

199
00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:02.671
and play around with Example #1 of 6 here,

200
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.219
before moving on to Example #2,

201
00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:07.352
as I don't know what the cost of coffee

202
00:09:07.352 --> 00:09:09.855
or a tea is where you live in your country,

203
00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:12.285
and I want you to play around with the number of years

204
00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.433
and the interest rate as well, et cetera.

205
00:09:14.433 --> 00:09:16.244
And so the bottom line here

206
00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:17.911
is I just want us to

207
00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:21.564
feel more comfortable with the future value

208
00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:24.323
of money that we save today.

209
00:09:24.323 --> 00:09:27.500
And so if you spend $4 daily,

210
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.039
and so does your spouse on a coffee,

211
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.257
which is why we call Starbucks four bucks,

212
00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:33.590
sorry, bad joke,

213
00:09:34.424 --> 00:09:37.211
then per the change calculation here,

214
00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:40.959
this results in over $1 million in 40 years,

215
00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.039
incredible, eh?

216
00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.095
Just amazing, amazing.

217
00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:46.355
So plug in other numbers if you want to,

218
00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.016
like the cost of a pack of cigarettes, et cetera,

219
00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:51.959
and you'll be amazed how changing your spending habits

220
00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:55.249
can make you an absolute fortune later in life.

221
00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:58.168
So please pause me, play around with this,

222
00:09:58.168 --> 00:10:00.578
and then unpause me when you're ready,

223
00:10:00.578 --> 00:10:04.411
and we'll move on to Example #2 of 6 together.

224
00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:10.140
In Example #2, we're gonna look at how much money

225
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.010
we can save by not buying an expensive item.

226
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.927
And, since I'm Canadian,

227
00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:17.955
let me change this to Canadian dollars.

228
00:10:17.955 --> 00:10:20.341
That's what we call it dollars, not dollars, dollars.

229
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:22.163
Sorry, Canada.

230
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.193
(laughs)

231
00:10:23.193 --> 00:10:27.257
You can go to Settings, or even just click on the flag here,

232
00:10:27.257 --> 00:10:29.495
see the Canadian flag represents,

233
00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:31.925
and let's just ignore the exchange rate for now,

234
00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:35.210
as it's applicable later in the course, 'kay?

235
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.451
You'll see what I mean by this later on in the course

236
00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:39.432
when we calculate our portfolio value,

237
00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:40.991
we'll be able to convert US dollars

238
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:43.266
to whatever foreign currency we want to.

239
00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:44.099
So,

240
00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:48.121
in this example, I entered in Luxury Car,

241
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:50.866
but you can change the title here from Luxury Car

242
00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:53.743
to something else if you wanted to.

243
00:10:53.743 --> 00:10:58.149
And so in this example, if you did not buy that luxury car

244
00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:01.233
with a onetime payment of $27,

245
00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:05.400
then over 40 years at an average annual return of 9.5%,

246
00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:09.897
we would have this much more money in savings,

247
00:11:09.897 --> 00:11:12.686
it's a huge amount, huge.

248
00:11:12.686 --> 00:11:15.440
So, if you want, double click on the green cell here

249
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.645
to see the math behind this calculation.

250
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:22.901
And so, the way to figure out what $1 today is worth

251
00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:23.818
in one year

252
00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:27.599
is to use the formula you see here in Excel,

253
00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:29.832
which is as follows.

254
00:11:29.832 --> 00:11:31.868
Your money today

255
00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:32.882
times,

256
00:11:32.882 --> 00:11:33.759
open brackets,

257
00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.824
one plus the interest rate to the power of time, that's t.

258
00:11:36.824 --> 00:11:40.312
Okay, so if we assume that the interest rate is 10%,

259
00:11:40.312 --> 00:11:43.064
then what is $1 worth in one year?

260
00:11:43.064 --> 00:11:44.472
Well, we know it's

261
00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:46.096
$1.10,

262
00:11:46.096 --> 00:11:48.251
but here's the math behind it.

263
00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:50.712
It's $1 times one plus the interest rate,

264
00:11:50.712 --> 00:11:54.195
which is 10%, to the power of one year,

265
00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:56.577
which of course is $1.10.

266
00:11:56.577 --> 00:11:58.731
And if we change this to two years,

267
00:11:58.731 --> 00:12:01.766
then the $1 in two years at an annual interest rate

268
00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:06.682
of 10% is calculated by taking a buck or a dollar

269
00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:07.515
times

270
00:12:07.515 --> 00:12:08.473
1.1,

271
00:12:08.473 --> 00:12:10.585
which is 1%

272
00:12:10.585 --> 00:12:13.356
plus 10%, so 1.1, to the power of two,

273
00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:14.961
which equals $1.21.

274
00:12:14.961 --> 00:12:16.587
Okay, see how compound interest earns you

275
00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:18.264
that little bit extra more?

276
00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:20.224
So try plugging out other items

277
00:12:20.224 --> 00:12:24.470
into example two here to see what saving your money

278
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.756
by not spending would lead to in the future, okay?

279
00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:28.589
And so,

280
00:12:29.793 --> 00:12:32.879
I debated whether to include this,

281
00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:33.712
so my son

282
00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:37.389
wants to get those Beats by Dre

283
00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:41.495
big earphones for Christmas, which is not gonna happen,

284
00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:44.645
because these headphones cost literally

285
00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:45.478
$349.99

286
00:12:46.738 --> 00:12:49.996
US, right, for the highest end one.

287
00:12:49.996 --> 00:12:51.546
It's a lotta money, right?

288
00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:53.920
And I showed my son Andrew

289
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.753
(laughs)

290
00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:59.518
that if we entered Beats by Dre here in our Example #2,

291
00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:00.851
that the $349.99

292
00:13:02.827 --> 00:13:05.846
earphones will be worth over a million dollars

293
00:13:05.846 --> 00:13:07.686
by the time Andrew's in his 70s,

294
00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:10.114
right, at an annual interest rate of 15%, right,

295
00:13:10.114 --> 00:13:12.111
you can play around with the numbers for fun.

296
00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:12.944
In fact,

297
00:13:13.795 --> 00:13:15.300
the money

298
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.013
saved would be worth over $1.5 million as you can see here.

299
00:13:20.013 --> 00:13:21.096
And you know,

300
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:25.324
this more than covers his retirement,

301
00:13:25.324 --> 00:13:27.729
the cost to raise his kids, et cetera,

302
00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:31.759
assuming inflation doesn't get outta control then.

303
00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:34.525
And that money could go up by 15%

304
00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:36.453
after that date as well.

305
00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:37.654
And so, of course,

306
00:13:37.654 --> 00:13:39.401
assume your own interest rate here as well,

307
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.428
your own assumptions.

308
00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:41.261
And

309
00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:45.716
the only Beats by Dre gift that my son is gonna get

310
00:13:45.716 --> 00:13:48.442
for Christmas will be these ones here.

311
00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:50.836
Lemme show you here.

312
00:13:50.836 --> 00:13:51.676
Huh?

313
00:13:51.676 --> 00:13:52.594
Beets

314
00:13:52.594 --> 00:13:53.477
by DRE?

315
00:13:53.477 --> 00:13:54.310
Funny?
No?

316
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.376
Sorry, I'm trying.

317
00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:57.110
That's called dad humor.

318
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.025
When you get older like me, it's dad humor.

319
00:14:00.025 --> 00:14:00.858
Anyway.

320
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:04.370
So if you want, please pause me,

321
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.250
and enter in your own assumptions for Exercise #2,

322
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.203
including the name of a product,

323
00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:13.130
and watch the numbers change and how this is translated

324
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.026
into something we can better understand in the sentence

325
00:14:16.026 --> 00:14:18.404
that is automatically created here on the right-hand side.

326
00:14:18.404 --> 00:14:19.537
I had a lotta fun puttin' this together.

327
00:14:19.537 --> 00:14:22.187
I tried to turn Excel math, or finance math,

328
00:14:22.187 --> 00:14:24.203
into English to make it fun.

329
00:14:24.203 --> 00:14:25.036
It's fun, eh?

330
00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:27.036
Moving on to Example #3.

331
00:14:28.008 --> 00:14:32.279
How many years does it take for your money to double?

332
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:36.407
And there's this awesome rule called the Rule of 72.

333
00:14:36.407 --> 00:14:39.607
And all you hafta do is take 72

334
00:14:39.607 --> 00:14:42.476
divided by the interest rate you wanna use,

335
00:14:42.476 --> 00:14:44.109
and this will tell you how many years it takes

336
00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:46.315
for your money to double.

337
00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:48.631
And so, per Example #3 here,

338
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:53.205
we can see that it takes 7.6 years for your money to double

339
00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:57.276
if you invest that money at an interest rate of 9.5%.

340
00:14:57.276 --> 00:14:58.705
And so if you want to, please pause me

341
00:14:58.705 --> 00:15:01.788
and play around with Example #3 here.

342
00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:04.686
Moving on to Example #4.

343
00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:06.150
I love this one.

344
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.764
How much money

345
00:15:07.764 --> 00:15:10.175
do we need to save daily

346
00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:12.989
at an annualized interest rate of 9.5%

347
00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:16.989
in order to have exactly $1 million in 35 years?

348
00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:20.483
So, let's change this one just for fun

349
00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:22.483
to British pounds, 'kay?

350
00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:27.847
As you can see here, you can either play around

351
00:15:27.847 --> 00:15:31.476
with the numbers until you get exactly 1 million pounds,

352
00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:34.611
or you can use my favorite simple Excel function,

353
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:36.488
which is called Goal Seek.

354
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:37.834
This is awesome.

355
00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:38.904
Here's how you do it.

356
00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:41.152
So, per this video here,

357
00:15:41.152 --> 00:15:42.911
let's say I wanted to find out

358
00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:44.919
how much I needed to save daily

359
00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:48.849
in order to have 1 million pounds in 35 years

360
00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:51.825
at an annual interest rate of 9.5%.

361
00:15:51.825 --> 00:15:52.999
So here's how you do it.

362
00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:55.896
You click on the Data tab in Excel,

363
00:15:55.896 --> 00:15:58.646
then you select What-if Analysis,

364
00:15:59.745 --> 00:16:01.912
then you select Goal Seek.

365
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.881
Then set the cell equal to 1 million by changing

366
00:16:06.881 --> 00:16:10.260
the amount to save daily, and voila,

367
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.851
Excel calculates

368
00:16:11.851 --> 00:16:13.109
that you need to save

369
00:16:13.109 --> 00:16:14.592
9.98 pounds

370
00:16:14.592 --> 00:16:18.144
daily at an annualized interest rate of 9.5%

371
00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:21.382
in order to have 1 million pounds in 35 years.

372
00:16:21.382 --> 00:16:23.288
And so if you want, pause me again here,

373
00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:24.242
play around with this one.

374
00:16:24.242 --> 00:16:25.741
This is awesome.

375
00:16:25.741 --> 00:16:27.432
And please note

376
00:16:27.432 --> 00:16:29.019
if you can't see

377
00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:31.929
the What-if button, and if you're running an old version

378
00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:35.807
of Microsoft Excel, then please go to this website here

379
00:16:35.807 --> 00:16:37.879
in order to see instructions from Microsoft

380
00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:42.102
on how to install what is called the free Solver Add-in.

381
00:16:42.102 --> 00:16:43.379
If you have the latest version

382
00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:45.264
you won't have to worry about that.

383
00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:47.848
Let's move on to Example #5.

384
00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:50.849
This one is similar to Example #4,

385
00:16:50.849 --> 00:16:54.059
where we calculated how much to save daily,

386
00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:56.973
except in Example #5, we're calculating

387
00:16:56.973 --> 00:17:00.148
how much we need to save monthly

388
00:17:00.148 --> 00:17:04.265
at an interest rate of 15% over 60 years

389
00:17:04.265 --> 00:17:07.182
in order to have exactly $1 billion

390
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:09.983
to donate to your favorite charity,

391
00:17:09.983 --> 00:17:13.315
so I changed this back to US dollars here, okay?

392
00:17:13.315 --> 00:17:14.148
All right.

393
00:17:14.148 --> 00:17:16.761
$1 billion for your charity.

394
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:20.065
And so, if you entered your favorite charity name

395
00:17:20.065 --> 00:17:22.586
in the Settings tab, then the name of your charity

396
00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:24.501
would appear right here.

397
00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:28.300
For example, if you entered in my favorite charity,

398
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.987
which is called Doctors without Diplomas,

399
00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:33.291
then it would appear here,

400
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:36.030
course I'm kidding about my favorite charity.

401
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.753
Okay, no more dad humor, I promise, yeah?

402
00:17:37.753 --> 00:17:38.819
(laughs)

403
00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:40.603
Okay, moving on.

404
00:17:40.603 --> 00:17:44.061
I changed the currency again here for this one,

405
00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:45.011
and actually, you know what,

406
00:17:45.011 --> 00:17:46.103
let's just make it Australian dollars

407
00:17:46.103 --> 00:17:47.311
instead of US dollars.

408
00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:48.894
So, per this video,

409
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.173
we're gonna use Goal Seek

410
00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:57.337
and the What-if scenario analysis option,

411
00:17:57.337 --> 00:18:01.254
and we see that we would need to save $1,631.34

412
00:18:02.485 --> 00:18:05.542
Australian dollars monthly.

413
00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:07.976
And the earlier you get started in life,

414
00:18:07.976 --> 00:18:09.873
the better, saving.

415
00:18:09.873 --> 00:18:11.104
It's never too late, either.

416
00:18:11.104 --> 00:18:12.473
But just please pause me if you want,

417
00:18:12.473 --> 00:18:15.127
and play around with this one.

418
00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:17.556
Okay, our last example, number six.

419
00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:19.539
We're gonna discuss renting

420
00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:22.622
versus buying a house or an apartment.

421
00:18:22.622 --> 00:18:26.265
And I saved up enough money finally in my 30s

422
00:18:26.265 --> 00:18:30.203
for a down payment on a house after wasting so much money

423
00:18:30.203 --> 00:18:31.947
renting when I lived in New York City.

424
00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:34.046
It was hard, though, because you know,

425
00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.526
we had to pay off school loans,

426
00:18:35.526 --> 00:18:37.482
and you know, Christine and I had to,

427
00:18:37.482 --> 00:18:39.423
it's expensive, it's tough, it's tough.

428
00:18:39.423 --> 00:18:40.717
It takes a while to be able to save up enough

429
00:18:40.717 --> 00:18:42.117
to get that down payment.

430
00:18:42.117 --> 00:18:44.824
The earlier you do it in life, the better,

431
00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:48.022
a lot of people hafta wait until their later 30s.

432
00:18:48.022 --> 00:18:51.169
So, we're gonna discuss mortgages later in the course,

433
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:54.227
but the best rule for mortgages

434
00:18:54.227 --> 00:18:55.227
is to assume

435
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.648
that the size of your mortgage is never, ever, ever

436
00:18:59.648 --> 00:19:03.818
more than two times your annual pre-tax income.

437
00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:07.040
So if you make $50,000 per year,

438
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.935
then I don't recommend having a mortgage size

439
00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:14.838
of over $100,000, and that doesn't include the down payment.

440
00:19:14.838 --> 00:19:16.272
Again, we'll discuss this

441
00:19:16.272 --> 00:19:18.439
in a heck of a lot more detail later in the course

442
00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:20.775
when we talk about mortgages.

443
00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:22.809
And the best investment you might ever make

444
00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:24.476
might be your house.

445
00:19:25.407 --> 00:19:27.339
So for this example,

446
00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:29.797
I want you to enter in your current rent payment,

447
00:19:29.797 --> 00:19:31.488
or make one up.

448
00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:33.108
And I want you to find out

449
00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:36.031
what the value of all those rental payments

450
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:39.375
would actually be worth in the future.

451
00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:43.517
And you could see from the example here that $600 per month

452
00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:48.400
in rent over 50 years at an assumed interest rate of 8%

453
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.733
equals $4.7 million dollars.

454
00:19:51.986 --> 00:19:54.036
You know, play around with this one a lot,

455
00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:58.803
as I want you to buy your place of residence when you can.

456
00:19:58.803 --> 00:20:00.494
So please start saving today,

457
00:20:00.494 --> 00:20:02.007
and if you're not saving today,

458
00:20:02.007 --> 00:20:04.140
don't worry, because you will be

459
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.443
by the end of this course, I promise you,

460
00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:08.809
'cause I have over 100

461
00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:11.502
simple tips and strategies on how to save

462
00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:13.137
and make more money.

463
00:20:13.137 --> 00:20:13.970
Thanks.
