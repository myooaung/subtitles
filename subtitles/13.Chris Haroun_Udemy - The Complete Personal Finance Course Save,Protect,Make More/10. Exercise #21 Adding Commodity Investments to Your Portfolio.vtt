1
00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.371
<v Instructor>All right, congratulations.</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:04.811
You're about 75% done the course.

3
00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:05.678
Great job.

4
00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:08.110
Okay, so this exercise is similar

5
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.231
to the bond exercise we just in did in exercise 20,

6
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:12.680
except we're adding commodities.

7
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.112
And we're gonna add six commodity ETFs,

8
00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:17.931
and then what we'll do is

9
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:20.821
we will then answer these questions here.

10
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.611
Okay, so let's first of all go

11
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:25.271
and create a new portfolio,

12
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:27.271
and the first thing we'll add is GLD,

13
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.312
which is gold,

14
00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:30.043
and then we'll add silver,

15
00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:31.411
and then we're add oil.

16
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:34.512
Okay, these are three ETFs for commodities.

17
00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:36.011
Okay, so let's do it.

18
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:37.928
Let's use Safari again.

19
00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:39.875
My Portfolio.

20
00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.880
And we're gonna create a new portfolio,

21
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.297
and I'll call it Exercise 21.

22
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.669
Okay.

23
00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.179
And we're gonna add the first three,

24
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.739
which I remember were GLD is gold,

25
00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.771
SLV, that's silver,

26
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.240
and then USO, which is an oil index.

27
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.560
And we got three more.

28
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.227
We're gonna add RJI.

29
00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:13.624
Okay, RJI.

30
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.674
Okay, and, yeah,

31
00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:19.152
there's a guy named Jim Rogers,

32
00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:19.985
and that's his ETF.

33
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:21.211
Read his books if you want.

34
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:25.141
I read a book of his in '08 called "A Bull in China,"

35
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.360
and it was awesome.

36
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.071
And he's very bullish and a little out there,

37
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:31.110
but brilliant on...

38
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.272
He's bullish when it comes to,

39
00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:33.390
and brilliant when it comes to commodities.

40
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.223
Read the book.

41
00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:35.056
You'll enjoy it.

42
00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:35.889
All right, next one is JJC,

43
00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.222
which is a copper commodity investments.

44
00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:40.956
JJC.

45
00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.232
And then we got GSG,

46
00:01:44.232 --> 00:01:47.901
which is a GSCI, that's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index.

47
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:48.843
Okay, good.

48
00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:49.676
GSG.

49
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.463
Enter.

50
00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:56.185
And there we go.

51
00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:57.304
We've got them all added.

52
00:01:57.304 --> 00:01:58.344
Okay, great.

53
00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:02.511
And I wanna have every single heading shown there.

54
00:02:04.213 --> 00:02:05.884
So I'll go to Edit View

55
00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.845
and make sure they're all selected,

56
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:08.845
and they are, good.

57
00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:09.678
That's fine.

58
00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:10.511
Okay, good.

59
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:12.611
Now I'm gonna copy all this stuff,

60
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:13.795
including the header,

61
00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.024
like always.

62
00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:15.857
Copy.

63
00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:21.168
Then we're gonna go to the Settings tab,

64
00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:26.307
and I'm gonna overwrite what I entered last time,

65
00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:30.632
and I'm gonna overwrite what I did last time, okay?

66
00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:32.067
So right here,

67
00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.147
just paste right on top of it.

68
00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:35.147
There we go.

69
00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:37.485
Paste.

70
00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:38.376
Cool.

71
00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:39.557
And as you know,

72
00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:40.787
whenever you do this,

73
00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:42.466
the data is actually overwritten

74
00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:44.376
directly in your portfolio.

75
00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:45.685
So you can click on your portfolio

76
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:47.776
to see the stocks in there,

77
00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.867
or whatever history you add there.

78
00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:53.467
Now we're gonna go back to exercise 21, commodities,

79
00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.637
and we see that the information is populated here,

80
00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:57.856
and now we'll answer these six questions.

81
00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:58.756
All right, the first one is,

82
00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.522
using Yahoo Finance as always,

83
00:03:00.522 --> 00:03:02.816
find out what the inception date was

84
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.995
for the SPDR Gold Shares investment.

85
00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.475
Okay.

86
00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:10.694
So we know that it's GLD down here.

87
00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:12.485
And the reason these questions are out of order,

88
00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:14.222
just, like, I don't know if you need to know this,

89
00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:17.435
but sometimes it gets re-ordered

90
00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.024
when you put them into Yahoo.

91
00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:20.685
That's why my questions seem out of order.

92
00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:21.854
But it doesn't matter, okay?

93
00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:22.987
Anyway, too much information.

94
00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:27.277
So what I'll do is I'm just gonna copy this.

95
00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:29.547
And what was the inception date?

96
00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:30.827
So we'll go here,

97
00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:31.660
paste it.

98
00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:34.518
GLD.

99
00:03:37.077 --> 00:03:38.627
And if you click on Summary,

100
00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:43.085
you see the inception date is November 18th, 2004.

101
00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:44.186
Wow, I thought it was older than that.

102
00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:45.536
Okay, next question.

103
00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:47.307
And you can just paste that there if you want.

104
00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:49.205
Okay, using Yahoo Finance,

105
00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:50.845
what was the volume of shares

106
00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:54.517
that traded on the silver trust investment, okay?

107
00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.525
And silver I know is SLV, okay?

108
00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:01.557
So what was the volume on November 9th, 2017 for SLV?

109
00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:02.390
Okay, SLV.

110
00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.253
And that was November 9, okay, check.

111
00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:10.586
Historical Data.

112
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:18.435
November 9th, where's the volume?

113
00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:21.609
Here we go.

114
00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.442
It's on the last one.

115
00:04:22.442 --> 00:04:23.275
Last column.

116
00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:26.096
Okay, November 9th volume was four point,

117
00:04:26.096 --> 00:04:28.175
roughly 4.3 million shares.

118
00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.008
Okay, good.

119
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:29.945
You can enter that there if you want.

120
00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:30.778
Question three.

121
00:04:30.778 --> 00:04:33.695
What was the expense ratio for USO?

122
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:39.838
Okay.

123
00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:44.947
Go back here.

124
00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:52.434
We see the expense ratio is 0.32% for USO.

125
00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:53.267
All right.

126
00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:58.245
How many commodity future contracts

127
00:04:58.245 --> 00:05:01.084
are in the ELEMENTS Rogers International Commodity?

128
00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:03.715
Okay, so let me just copy this here.

129
00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:07.835
It's asking me how many commodity futures contracts.

130
00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:08.668
Okay.

131
00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.283
So if you click on Options,

132
00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.235
you can see the information here.

133
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.068
Okay.

134
00:05:20.068 --> 00:05:21.163
A little bit outside the scope of this course,

135
00:05:21.163 --> 00:05:22.813
but that's where you'll find it, anyway.

136
00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:23.943
And I don't want you to buy options

137
00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:26.155
because I think it's too risky.

138
00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:27.738
All right, next up.

139
00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:31.364
What is the year to date return,

140
00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:32.354
and right now I'm close,

141
00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:34.645
just before Christmas 2017,

142
00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:37.504
for the iPath Bloomberg Copper,

143
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.131
and I can just actually get it from there.

144
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.084
It's JJC is the ticker.

145
00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:44.001
Okay, JJC year to date.

146
00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:46.464
For me I'm in 2017.

147
00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:48.544
You're probably in '18 or later.

148
00:05:48.544 --> 00:05:49.711
Okay, go here.

149
00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:53.566
21%.

150
00:05:56.853 --> 00:05:58.285
Okay, last question.

151
00:05:58.285 --> 00:05:59.118
Using Yahoo Finance,

152
00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:02.044
find out the net asset value

153
00:06:02.044 --> 00:06:04.435
of the iShares GSCI Commodity.

154
00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:07.274
Okay, net asset value, that's NAV.

155
00:06:07.274 --> 00:06:08.774
GSG is the ticker.

156
00:06:15.384 --> 00:06:16.217
15.67.

157
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:18.177
Okay, great.

158
00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.285
So we are done with this exercise.

159
00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:23.150
If you have any questions, please let me know.

160
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.983
Thanks.
