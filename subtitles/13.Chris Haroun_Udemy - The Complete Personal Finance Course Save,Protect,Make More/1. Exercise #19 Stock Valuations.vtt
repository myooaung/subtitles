00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:04.043
<v ->Lets drill down a bit more in valuation now.</v>

2
00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:07.224
There's two main types of stock market investors.

3
00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:09.588
Those that like stocks that are very cheap

4
00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:11.872
and are not growing fast, and these types,

5
00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:15.021
this is type one, they're called value investors,

6
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:17.826
and just think of Warren Buffett

7
00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:20.993
when you hear the term value investor.

8
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.366
And value investors love companies

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:28.072
that issues dividends of at least a few percent per year,

10
00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:31.448
and dividends are like getting interest.

11
00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.681
When you lend money to other people,

12
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.492
and you could see dividends here in column Z or zed,

13
00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:41.200
on your investment portfolio management system.

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.040
The second main type of stock market investors

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.638
is a growth investor, and these are investors

16
00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:51.744
that love buying stocks that are currently expensive

17
00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:55.224
but growing very, very fast, like Amazon,

18
00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:58.752
and these growth investors, as opposed to value investors,

19
00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:01.272
these growth investors think that the company

20
00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:04.300
that they're investing in seem expensive

21
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.499
based on this year's earnings, or next year's earnings,

22
00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.072
but not on earnings in five or 10 years.

23
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.531
In fact, they think these stocks are dirt cheap

24
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.120
if you think about how much money

25
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.223
those stocks can make in five or 10 years.

26
00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:23.899
Now value investors criticize growth investors

27
00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.287
for overpaying, but growth investors argue

28
00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.327
that companies that seem expensive,

29
00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:33.123
like Amazon today, can easily cut their spending

30
00:01:33.123 --> 00:01:36.155
so that earnings rise dramatically,

31
00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:37.775
but growth investors do not want

32
00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:42.507
those companies that they invest in to cut expenses today.

33
00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:44.879
They don't want them to because they want them

34
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.939
to focus on profits in the future and not today.

35
00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.119
If these growth companies fired a ton

36
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.519
of sales people today, then their earnings

37
00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:56.173
would be a lot higher, but then again,

38
00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:58.467
what would happen is, growth investors wouldn't want

39
00:01:58.467 --> 00:01:59.360
to invest in those companies

40
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.603
'cause they're growing very fast today.

41
00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:05.862
So growth investors don't mind if the company's value

42
00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:08.486
currently trades at many, many times higher

43
00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.687
than the company's current earnings,

44
00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:14.470
and this is referred to as priced earnings mothball,

45
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.426
which means how many times earnings

46
00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:20.738
is the value of the company today.

47
00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.730
So this will make sense soon.

48
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.258
People are usually either a growth investor

49
00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:30.005
or a value investor, and a lot of younger people

50
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.798
that are in university are value investors

51
00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:34.882
'cause they're taught to buy stuff that's cheap,

52
00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:36.622
and then sometimes they change to growth investors

53
00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.895
when they get a bit older.

54
00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:41.716
So value investors love buying companies

55
00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:44.356
that have a price-to-book ratio

56
00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:47.439
that is closer to or under one times,

57
00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:51.592
and they also like to buy stocks

58
00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.466
that usually have lower price earnings multiple,

59
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:58.562
like under 10 times, for example, if possible.

60
00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:00.540
Growth investors, on the other hand,

61
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.274
often invest in companies that are not profitable today,

62
00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.886
and because the price-to-earnings ratio

63
00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.406
can be meaningless for growth investors

64
00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:12.301
if the company they're investing in is not yet profitable,

65
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:13.346
these growth investors like to look

66
00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:16.929
at what's called price-to-revenue multiple.

67
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.974
If a company a growth investor is investing in

68
00:03:21.974 --> 00:03:24.988
is growing faster than the competition,

69
00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:28.004
then these growth investors expect that underlying company

70
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:32.652
to trade at a premium multiple to the competition.

71
00:03:32.652 --> 00:03:37.080
And so, growth investors never look at price-to-book,

72
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.045
as that valuation metric is meaningless for them.

73
00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:45.157
But they like to look at price-to-earnings in the long run,

74
00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:46.722
and they look at price-to-earnings a little bit differently

75
00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:48.764
than value investors do.

76
00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:52.289
Growth investors factor in the growth of earnings

77
00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.732
when they look at the price-to-earnings ratio.

78
00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:59.315
And growth investors call this a PEG ratio,

79
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:02.011
which stands for the price-to-earnings

80
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:05.326
divided by the growth rate, and the lower the number,

81
00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:09.493
the better, so if a company has a price/earnings ratio

82
00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:14.493
of 30 times, meaning for every one dollar in earnings,

83
00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:16.865
the market is paying 30 dollars,

84
00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.513
if a company, again, has a price-to-earnings

85
00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:23.680
or PE ratio of 30 times, but is growing earnings at 60%,

86
00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:29.288
then the PEG ratio is 30 divided by 60,

87
00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:32.866
which means 0.5 times.

88
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:37.973
It's a bargain, it's growing at half its growth rate.

89
00:04:37.973 --> 00:04:41.118
And growth investors try to often buy companies

90
00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:44.753
that are at a PEG ratio well under two times,

91
00:04:44.753 --> 00:04:46.881
and if it gets closer to one or less than one,

92
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:48.467
it's a screaming buy for them,

93
00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:51.697
unless something is wrong with the company.

94
00:04:51.697 --> 00:04:55.013
So valuation deals with quantitative research,

95
00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:57.589
and of course, both value and growth investors

96
00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.917
need to look at quantitative research

97
00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:01.535
and qualitative research,

98
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.313
as they also want the underlying fundamentals

99
00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:07.205
of a company to be solid as well.

100
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:10.122
And so, in our portfolio dashboard,

101
00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:13.941
when you see valuation data, this, of course,

102
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:16.579
is quantitative research.

103
00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:18.337
In terms of qualitative research,

104
00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:20.961
please look at column BB, and beside that,

105
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:23.628
called Your Research right here.

106
00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:27.397
And please keep in mind that you can always click

107
00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:32.121
on this plus symbol here between rows six and eight,

108
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:34.444
in order to read more information

109
00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:36.545
on what every single column means

110
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:39.965
in your investment portfolio management system.

111
00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:40.798
Moving on.

112
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:45.217
For this exercise, we are going to make one portfolio

113
00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:49.701
with six stocks, including the top three stocks

114
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:53.015
owned by the great value investor, Warren Buffett,

115
00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:55.954
and the top three stocks recommended

116
00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:59.840
by growth stock newspaper and legendary growth investor,

117
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.090
William O'Neil.

118
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.861
So please go to your Excel file

119
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:07.217
and select exercise 19, Stock Valuations,

120
00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:09.141
and please follow the instructions,

121
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:13.263
and then answer the questions listed on the tab.

122
00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:17.797
Now, question one asks you to go to the Settings tab,

123
00:06:17.797 --> 00:06:21.037
and create a six-stock portfolio

124
00:06:21.037 --> 00:06:24.656
based on the top three positions of famous growth investor,

125
00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:26.796
William O'Neil's Investor's Business Daily,

126
00:06:26.796 --> 00:06:29.108
that's his newspaper.

127
00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:30.592
And the other three of the six stocks,

128
00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:32.796
the other three stocks in your portfolio,

129
00:06:32.796 --> 00:06:35.420
are gonna be stocks owned by Warren Buffett

130
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.096
using the website listed here in question number one,

131
00:06:39.096 --> 00:06:42.876
in exercise 19, and just please pause me

132
00:06:42.876 --> 00:06:44.496
and then un-pause me

133
00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:47.632
when you've completed question number one,

134
00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:51.349
and I will show you how to get the answer, and if you want,

135
00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.771
you can just watch me answer question number one right now,

136
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:55.165
or pause me, whatever.

137
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.477
My answer's actually, please be aware

138
00:06:57.477 --> 00:06:59.604
that my answers are gonna be different,

139
00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:01.090
a little bit different from yours,

140
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.699
if Warren Buffett and William O'Neil's portfolio changes.

141
00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.209
Again, please pause me, and complete question one

142
00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:13.716
or just watch me do it right now for you, thanks.

143
00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:16.637
Now I always make many backups of my portfolios

144
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.645
and my exercises and I humbly suggest

145
00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:21.541
you please do the same, so what's gonna happen is this.

146
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.286
We're gonna enter in some stock information together,

147
00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.469
for exercise 19, and that is gonna overwrite

148
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:30.040
what we did in exercise 18, and the reason it will

149
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.045
is because it's all based on this portfolio tab here,

150
00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:35.270
and let me just open this up here.

151
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.581
It sometimes takes a second to refresh,

152
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:42.113
but this portfolio tab here is where all the information

153
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:45.157
is gonna be reflected, for number 19.

154
00:07:45.157 --> 00:07:47.125
Kinda like it was for number 18.

155
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:48.297
Okay, good.

156
00:07:48.297 --> 00:07:52.464
So let's go back to exercise 19, Stock Valuations,

157
00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.577
and let's do it, let's do it.

158
00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.353
So we're gonna enter in three stocks

159
00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:01.637
that William O'Neil has, and then three stocks

160
00:08:01.637 --> 00:08:03.592
that Warren Buffett has, and we're gonna get

161
00:08:03.592 --> 00:08:07.098
those three stocks each from these two websites here,

162
00:08:07.098 --> 00:08:08.825
so let me go to the first one here

163
00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.449
which is the Investor Business Daily website,

164
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.400
which is William O'Neil's, William O'Neil,

165
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.680
remember, is a growth investor,

166
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.680
and Warren Buffett is a value investor.

167
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.744
So, let's go here and let's get the three stocks

168
00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:23.920
that this guy owns now.

169
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.087
So he's got Coherent, SIVB, and Arista, Arista Networks.

170
00:08:30.984 --> 00:08:33.114
CEO is the great Jayshree.

171
00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:35.456
Okay, so, COHR is the first one.

172
00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.376
So let's do that.

173
00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:40.626
So I'm gonna go to here, our portfolio,

174
00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:44.194
and it doesn't matter what currency you have,

175
00:08:44.194 --> 00:08:46.550
but you know what you can do for fun?

176
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.300
I'm gonna select a new country here, Algeria.

177
00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:53.910
And then, Algeria's in a, okay, good.

178
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.470
And we're gonna scroll down.

179
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.582
Again, it doesn't matter what currency you have.

180
00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:59.042
It's gonna get converted anyway.

181
00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:03.209
So we're gonna go down here, and we're gonna add the stocks.

182
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.090
We're gonna add the stocks here.

183
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.186
So let's do it.

184
00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:10.210
So we're gonna create a new portfolio,

185
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.353
and what I'll do is we'll call this new portfolio

186
00:09:12.353 --> 00:09:15.926
in Yahoo Finance, exercise 19, just to make it easy for us.

187
00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:17.994
So all this stuff is gonna be deleted,

188
00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:20.214
so I can hit Delete right now if I wanted to,

189
00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:23.214
and that would delete everything directly from here.

190
00:09:23.214 --> 00:09:24.264
See it's all gone.

191
00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:26.931
Okay great, let's go back to 19.

192
00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:30.310
Okay, great.

193
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.414
So we're gonna get it from this site.

194
00:09:32.414 --> 00:09:36.150
All right, so the first one here is gonna be COHR.

195
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.138
So let's now open up a new tab, and we'll go

196
00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:41.888
to finance.yahoo.com.

197
00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:44.654
And we're gonna create a new portfolio

198
00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:47.026
and we'll call that new portfolio,

199
00:09:47.026 --> 00:09:49.193
we'll call it exercise 19.

200
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.686
God, it's so distracting all this stuff.

201
00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:55.574
Okay, we'll go here.

202
00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:57.491
My Portfolio, click it.

203
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.593
And then what we'll do is we'll create a portfolio here,

204
00:10:02.593 --> 00:10:03.593
EXERCISE 19!

205
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.286
And just keep it in US dollars.

206
00:10:07.286 --> 00:10:08.226
If you wanna play around with it

207
00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:10.427
and other currencies, you can do that, too, but whatever.

208
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:12.304
Okay, and we're gonna add the symbols here,

209
00:10:12.304 --> 00:10:14.471
so the first one was COHR.

210
00:10:16.288 --> 00:10:17.289
Okay.

211
00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:18.709
Let's see what the next one was.

212
00:10:18.709 --> 00:10:19.542
Whoops.

213
00:10:22.697 --> 00:10:24.813
Next one is over here.

214
00:10:24.813 --> 00:10:25.646
SIVB.

215
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:35.769
And the next one is Arista Networks, ANET.

216
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:40.877
Okay, good, so we're done adding those three tickers.

217
00:10:40.877 --> 00:10:43.053
Let's go back to the exercise now.

218
00:10:43.053 --> 00:10:45.257
Next, we're gonna add a couple tickers

219
00:10:45.257 --> 00:10:47.101
from Warren Buffett's portfolio.

220
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:50.013
All right, so we're gonna add growth and value stocks here.

221
00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:55.005
So the first one is gonna be Wells Fargo ticker WFC.

222
00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:57.181
So let's go here.

223
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:58.014
WFC comma.

224
00:11:00.677 --> 00:11:04.594
Next one is Kraft, KHC, very defensive company.

225
00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:07.478
KHC.

226
00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:14.805
And then we've got Apple, ticker AAPL, okay.

227
00:11:14.805 --> 00:11:18.629
AAPL, so interesting how Buffett's buying tech now.

228
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:19.462
Okay, great.

229
00:11:19.462 --> 00:11:20.295
Hit Enter.

230
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.092
And now we've got all six tickers here, see?

231
00:11:26.092 --> 00:11:27.788
So we've got Buffett's here.

232
00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:29.347
These are value.

233
00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:32.664
And then we've got the growth ones here, okay.

234
00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:33.497
Okay, great.

235
00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:35.088
Now, remember what we did before.

236
00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:38.412
We're gonna add, we're gonna actually change

237
00:11:38.412 --> 00:11:40.162
what headings we see.

238
00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:44.306
In order to do that, we'll just go here, portfolio.

239
00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:47.592
Click on it again, and then we can go Edit View,

240
00:11:47.592 --> 00:11:51.509
and just make sure these are all selected here.

241
00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:54.861
Good.

242
00:11:56.352 --> 00:11:57.812
And if you miss one or two, it doesn't matter,

243
00:11:57.812 --> 00:11:59.424
but I've set up the portfolios

244
00:11:59.424 --> 00:12:02.692
so that it will correct any issues,

245
00:12:02.692 --> 00:12:06.096
if Yahoo decides to change their API or whatever.

246
00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:07.156
Okay, so now what we're gonna do

247
00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:09.584
is we're gonna highlight all this stuff here.

248
00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:12.148
Make sure the bottom one, all this data's selected,

249
00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.668
down a little more, but not there.

250
00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:18.835
And then I'm gonna go Copy, and we're gonna go back.

251
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.272
Yeah, so many ways to do stuff here.

252
00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:23.232
Paste.

253
00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:24.776
Here we go, great.

254
00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:27.312
So I've got all this data now here.

255
00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:30.338
And all that data is gonna be populated

256
00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:32.588
and shown on our portfolio.

257
00:12:33.844 --> 00:12:36.301
So let's go to our portfolio and I'll show you.

258
00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:38.072
See it's all here.

259
00:12:38.072 --> 00:12:40.204
Great, okay, cool.

260
00:12:40.204 --> 00:12:44.371
And then what we're gonna do is we are gonna go back to 19,

261
00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:50.284
and so, and so if we scroll down now,

262
00:12:50.284 --> 00:12:53.512
we can now complete questions two through six,

263
00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:56.253
and you'll notice that if you scroll down

264
00:12:56.253 --> 00:12:57.513
to this table here,

265
00:12:57.513 --> 00:12:59.341
which is where we're gonna get the information

266
00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:01.280
for questions two through six,

267
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.424
all this stuff was pulled directly

268
00:13:03.424 --> 00:13:06.492
off Your Portfolio dashboard, right here,

269
00:13:06.492 --> 00:13:08.608
Your Portfolio, see?

270
00:13:08.608 --> 00:13:10.288
All this information.

271
00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:12.162
Pretty cool, pretty cool.

272
00:13:12.162 --> 00:13:15.972
All right, great, so let's answer the questions.

273
00:13:15.972 --> 00:13:17.697
And you'll see that it's color-coded,

274
00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:21.088
value is orange or pink, whatever color that is,

275
00:13:21.088 --> 00:13:23.088
and then blue is growth.

276
00:13:25.127 --> 00:13:27.635
All right, let's do this here,

277
00:13:27.635 --> 00:13:30.512
so question number two, in the two white boxes below,

278
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:32.280
remember, we only write in white boxes.

279
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.701
What is the average dividend yield for the growth investor

280
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:36.910
and what's the average dividend yield

281
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.664
for the value investor?

282
00:13:38.664 --> 00:13:42.939
So, for the value investor, I'll just go Average,

283
00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:45.882
and we'll go and get that dividend yield here.

284
00:13:45.882 --> 00:13:48.238
Where's dividend yield?

285
00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:49.750
Right here for the value.

286
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.051
See here? Enter.

287
00:13:51.051 --> 00:13:51.884
Good.

288
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.017
And then the average dividend yield

289
00:13:57.584 --> 00:14:00.388
for the growth investor, look at that,

290
00:14:00.388 --> 00:14:02.684
there's no dividend yield.

291
00:14:02.684 --> 00:14:04.813
No dividend yield, so it doesn't work.

292
00:14:04.813 --> 00:14:06.360
I mean that's, it's an error here,

293
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.416
but there's no dividend yield, zero,

294
00:14:08.416 --> 00:14:10.153
and that makes sense because value investors

295
00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:13.301
love dividends, and growth investor don't.

296
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:14.998
Growth investors want the companies to grow

297
00:14:14.998 --> 00:14:17.068
and use the money to reinvest in growth.

298
00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:18.780
Okay, question three.

299
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.802
In the two white boxes below,

300
00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:23.156
document what is the average price-to-book for growth,

301
00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:25.528
and the average price-to-book for value.

302
00:14:25.528 --> 00:14:28.861
So the average price-to-book for growth,

303
00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:33.076
or pardon me, we'll do value first.

304
00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:35.980
Price-to-book value here.

305
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.813
Okay.

306
00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:43.015
It's 3.3 times, and the average price-to-book ratio

307
00:14:44.772 --> 00:14:48.056
for growth investors, look at that,

308
00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:50.832
I have Arista, wow, okay.

309
00:14:50.832 --> 00:14:52.392
It's higher, and that makes sense

310
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.792
because value investors buy cheaper stuff

311
00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.832
than growth people, growth investors.

312
00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:56.684
All right, question four.

313
00:14:56.684 --> 00:14:59.548
In these boxes here, what is the trailing PE

314
00:14:59.548 --> 00:15:01.935
for the growth and value investors?

315
00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.588
So we'll do value investor first.

316
00:15:03.588 --> 00:15:04.421
Average.

317
00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:07.932
Trailing PE, right here, okay.

318
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.663
For value investor.

319
00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:16.883
19 or 20 times (mumbles) get average.

320
00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:19.966
For the growth investor, trailing PE.

321
00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:23.670
Okay, cool, so you could see

322
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.171
that the price earnings multiple

323
00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:29.179
for the growth investor's way higher

324
00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.042
than the value investor.

325
00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:31.617
That makes sense because growth investors

326
00:15:31.617 --> 00:15:32.935
buy expensive stuff.

327
00:15:32.935 --> 00:15:35.654
All right, what is the forward price-to-earnings ratio?

328
00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:37.113
All right, looking forward.

329
00:15:37.113 --> 00:15:39.256
Okay, and I'll interpret this for you in a second,

330
00:15:39.256 --> 00:15:42.756
so average, we'll do value investor first.

331
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.493
Forward here.

332
00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:52.252
And then we'll do average forward for the growth.

333
00:15:56.335 --> 00:15:59.062
Okay, and you could see that the growth investors,

334
00:15:59.062 --> 00:16:01.828
they buy more expensive stuff than the value investors.

335
00:16:01.828 --> 00:16:04.233
So, in both cases, you can see

336
00:16:04.233 --> 00:16:06.600
that the P is going down, which means that earnings

337
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.504
are growing on average for both these groups.

338
00:16:08.504 --> 00:16:12.011
But again, growth investors always buy more expensive stuff

339
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:14.601
than value investors do.

340
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:16.744
Okay, what is the average earnings growth rate

341
00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:19.011
for the growth investor and value investor?

342
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:19.844
So let's do value first.

343
00:16:19.844 --> 00:16:21.094
Equals average.

344
00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:27.305
Here.

345
00:16:29.492 --> 00:16:33.659
Average earnings growth rate is 22% for value.

346
00:16:35.137 --> 00:16:39.054
And the average earnings growth rate for growth

347
00:16:41.345 --> 00:16:43.299
is 58, makes sense, makes sense,

348
00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:45.364
so the growth investors buy stuff

349
00:16:45.364 --> 00:16:47.440
that's growing fast but is more expensive,

350
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.396
so if you have any questions about this exercise,

351
00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:50.767
please let me know.

352
00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:53.428
And again, if you go to Your Portfolio,

353
00:16:53.428 --> 00:16:56.291
you're gonna see all the data that was taken directly

354
00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:58.649
off of that tab we just did there.
