1
00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.499
<v ->I want to discuss how a mortgage works</v>

2
00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:05.887
so we can discuss financing the purchase

3
00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:07.849
of your house or your apartment

4
00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.689
or your investment properties in the future.

5
00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.307
Now, a mortgage is a loan usually

6
00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:16.008
from a bank for a very large amount.

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.133
It's kind of like issuing a coupon bond

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.133
to the mortgage company.

9
00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.491
A mortgage is often for about 30 years.

10
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.811
You have 30 years to pay the mortgage back.

11
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.075
You pay every month usually for the life of the loan.

12
00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:34.824
So in this case, 30 years times 12 months

13
00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:37.241
equals 360 mortgage payments.

14
00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:42.061
In the United States, you can deduct the interest

15
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.781
on your mortgage so that your taxable income is lower.

16
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.272
Most other countries don't let you do this

17
00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:50.760
and there are pros and cons to this.

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.740
The pro is that it can be relatively cheap to finance

19
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.432
buying a house or an apartment in the United States.

20
00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:01.193
The con is that this can sometimes lead

21
00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:04.435
to people taking on far too much debt,

22
00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:07.102
meaning the mortgage is too big.

23
00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:12.390
There's four main types of mortgages that I want to discuss.

24
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.696
Number one.

25
00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:16.166
An interest-only mortgage.

26
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.857
I do not advise doing this one

27
00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.245
because you're not paying off the house

28
00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.197
at all with these payments.

29
00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:26.520
You're only paying off the interest on the loan.

30
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.486
That's it.

31
00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:30.072
This has been quite popular in the United States

32
00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:33.636
because you can deduct the interest you pay on your house

33
00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:36.555
in the United States, unlike other countries.

34
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.867
The problem is that you are not increasing the amount

35
00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.262
of equity, your ownership, that you have in your house

36
00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:45.119
with each mortgage payment.

37
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.563
So it feels a lot like a rent agreement in some ways.

38
00:01:49.563 --> 00:01:51.074
Number two.

39
00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:54.855
The second type of mortgage is the 30-year fixed mortgage,

40
00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:57.398
which I love, and in some countries,

41
00:01:57.398 --> 00:02:01.144
you can get longer periods of time than 30 years.

42
00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:03.029
And if you can get a 30-year mortgage

43
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.306
at a fixed interest rate over 30 years, of course,

44
00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:09.822
then this is the one that I personally prefer.

45
00:02:09.822 --> 00:02:13.314
Now, what I mean by fixed is that the interest rate

46
00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:16.568
remains fixed or the same amount over the entire life

47
00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:19.733
of the 30-year mortgage or however many years it is

48
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:23.326
so that there are no surprises or no surprise increases

49
00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:27.512
in the monthly payments, which occurs to many people

50
00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:31.426
that have variable instead of fixed mortgages.

51
00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:33.535
So just be careful please, with the variable,

52
00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:36.452
meaning the non-fixed mortgages.

53
00:02:36.452 --> 00:02:39.776
Meaning a variable one is deadly because the teaser rate

54
00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:41.614
they tell you at first, kind of like a credit card,

55
00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:43.858
seems really really attractive,

56
00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:46.376
and then once that teaser rate expires,

57
00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:49.890
then rates can go up a lot, kind of like with credit cards.

58
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.403
We talked about APR with credit cards earlier.

59
00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:56.990
Sometimes credit card companies will say only 1.9% interest.

60
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.675
You'll sign up and you didn't read the fine prints

61
00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:03.545
or I didn't and six months go by, and it's actually 20% now.

62
00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:06.414
If you decide to go with a variable rate mortgage

63
00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:08.900
instead of a fixed rate mortgage, please understand

64
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.072
and calculate what the worst case scenario will be

65
00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:16.859
for your budget if interest rates spike

66
00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.497
and make sure to ask the mortgage broker

67
00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:23.685
a gazillion questions so that you understand

68
00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:26.436
what your absolute maximum monthly payments

69
00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:29.103
will be if interest rates spike.

70
00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:33.610
Some mortgages that are variable in nature

71
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.276
have interest rate caps of 3% which means

72
00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:40.973
that's they can't go up more than 3%.

73
00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:45.140
So if you get a 5% mortgage, the most it can float

74
00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:50.562
or go up variable wise is 3% to 8, but read the fine print.

75
00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:53.343
Just make sure to calculate what your maximum payment

76
00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:57.021
will be in the worst case scenario.

77
00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:01.037
Separately, if rates drop, you can usually refinance

78
00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:05.545
very quickly in many countries as governments take our side,

79
00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.196
meaning us homeowners or people that want to buy homes,

80
00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:12.148
government takes our sides more often and less so the banks

81
00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:14.798
as governments often try to protect the consumer,

82
00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:16.811
especially after '08.

83
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:17.654
Number three.

84
00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:19.764
The third type of mortgage I want to discuss is

85
00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:22.531
a 15-year fixed mortgage, which of course similar

86
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:26.480
to a 30-year mortgage, but obviously for much less time.

87
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.031
Given the shorter duration, the monthly payments are higher.

88
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.997
And in the next lesson, we're going to discuss

89
00:04:32.997 --> 00:04:36.426
a mortgage exercise and you can play around

90
00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:39.677
with the durations, meaning the time periods of a mortgage

91
00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:42.329
to see what happens to your payments

92
00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:44.964
if the time period changes

93
00:04:44.964 --> 00:04:48.642
and or if you change the interest rates.

94
00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:49.824
Number four.

95
00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:53.464
The fourth type of mortgage I would like to discuss is

96
00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:56.869
a mortgage that does not have a fixed interest rate,

97
00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:59.846
meaning that the rate on this mortgage floats,

98
00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:01.108
meaning it's variable.

99
00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:03.185
It can go up or down all the time

100
00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:05.063
if interest rates increase.

101
00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:07.892
I already talked a little bit about this one,

102
00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:11.452
but just drill down to make sure you understand

103
00:05:11.452 --> 00:05:13.779
in detail what this means.

104
00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.756
These floating mortgages are called ARMs,

105
00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:19.173
which stands adjustable rate mortgage,

106
00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:22.345
and they can be so dangerous, man.

107
00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:23.658
They can be really dangerous

108
00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:27.825
if there is no cap on the amount that the loan can go up.

109
00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:31.226
Many people get accommodation

110
00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.112
of different types of mortgages.

111
00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:36.048
They'll try to get a big part of it for 30-year fixed

112
00:05:36.048 --> 00:05:38.818
and a smaller part for different amounts,

113
00:05:38.818 --> 00:05:41.040
because they can get better rates.

114
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.873
So some people get 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 year ARMs

115
00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.529
and combine them.

116
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.296
Anyway, just make sure you understand

117
00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:51.376
what you're getting yourself into.

118
00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:53.768
Just understand what the maximum amount

119
00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:55.183
the mortgage can increase.

120
00:05:55.183 --> 00:05:58.162
If the rate floats and if you can

121
00:05:58.162 --> 00:05:59.785
or cannot afford that payment,

122
00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:03.738
in the most conservative scenario possible for you, please.

123
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:08.366
And some mortgages are not allowed to increase more than 3%,

124
00:06:08.366 --> 00:06:10.718
but that 3%, it sounds like a small amount.

125
00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:13.101
It can actually be enormous.

126
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.660
So just, we're gonna talk about an example

127
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.989
of this in the next lecture.

128
00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.995
And you can get an additional mortgage

129
00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:23.883
on your house if you need the cash.

130
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:25.803
People say, "I have a second mortgage on my house"

131
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.802
or "a home equity loan."

132
00:06:27.802 --> 00:06:28.809
That's what they call it now.

133
00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.175
They don't call it "second mortgages" much anymore.

134
00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:32.807
They call it the home equity loan.

135
00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:34.633
Please don't do that.

136
00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:36.034
I'm really against this.

137
00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:37.781
If you can, right.

138
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:41.864
As it kind of treats your most prized possession,

139
00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.127
your house, as an ATM or bank machine.

140
00:06:46.127 --> 00:06:49.418
It's just too risky unless you absolutely cannot live

141
00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.096
without doing this second mortgage

142
00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:54.982
or God forbid you have a big medical bill.

143
00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.708
Please make sure that you watch the insurance lectures

144
00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:01.545
earlier in the course if you haven't done so already.

145
00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:05.053
I'd love for you to, if possible, have insurance,

146
00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:06.779
especially homeowner's insurance as well.

147
00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:07.843
Just prepare for the worst.

148
00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:08.676
And I'm always.

149
00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:10.936
My job, I feel like, is to give you a menu

150
00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:15.290
of what to pick but also to be conservative as well.

151
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.382
Now, the last thing that I want to reiterate

152
00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:22.712
about mortgages is that you can refinance,

153
00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:24.934
meaning pay less money for your mortgage loan

154
00:07:24.934 --> 00:07:27.274
if interest rates decrease.

155
00:07:27.274 --> 00:07:29.417
So that's why we talked about interest rates

156
00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:30.250
and that's why I want you

157
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.199
to watch interest rates closely in your country

158
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.045
and always watch what the U.S. Federal Reserve is doing,

159
00:07:37.045 --> 00:07:40.695
because quite often, when the United States or the E.U.,

160
00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:43.675
big blocks, when they change interest rates,

161
00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:47.443
the rest of the world feels that sneeze.

162
00:07:47.443 --> 00:07:51.610
So if those big countries, or big economic trading blocks

163
00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:56.323
like the E.U. or the United States change interest rates,

164
00:07:56.323 --> 00:07:58.698
just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.

165
00:07:58.698 --> 00:08:01.064
If they cut interest rates, which I don't think they'll do

166
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:05.446
anytime soon, then you wanna refinance pretty quickly.

167
00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:07.597
Now we understand why we spent so much time talking

168
00:08:07.597 --> 00:08:09.860
about interest rates in part three of the course.
