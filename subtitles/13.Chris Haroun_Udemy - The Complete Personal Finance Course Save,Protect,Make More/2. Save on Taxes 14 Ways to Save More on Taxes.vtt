1
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.780
- We will discuss tax savings in much more detail

2
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.406
later in the course, when we discuss

3
00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.178
retirement savings programs,

4
00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:21.142
education savings programs, et cetera.

5
00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:24.297
But I wanna give you simple tips

6
00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:26.498
to put on your radar screen right now,

7
00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:29.865
because our biggest expense is going to be taxes,

8
00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.414
for the rest of our lives.

9
00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:33.356
It's unfortunate, but it is what it is.

10
00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:36.946
If you can save just a few percent every year

11
00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:40.796
on lower taxes, then the long-run savings,

12
00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:43.906
in addition to your wealth, can be significant.

13
00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.064
And I realize that all countries, provinces,

14
00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:49.605
states, and towns have different tax codes,

15
00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:52.630
and I know that each new political leader

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.833
that gets elected often changes taxes,

17
00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.316
or changes the tax codes.

18
00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:01.173
As a result, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna keep

19
00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:04.402
this lesson and all tax-related lessons

20
00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:07.618
generic enough that they can help to save you money

21
00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:09.778
regardless of where you live.

22
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.426
And so in the United States, the governing body here

23
00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:17.001
in charge of taxes is the Internal Revenue Service,

24
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.802
also called the IRS.

25
00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:21.465
And their website can be helpful

26
00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:25.737
if you have tax questions, at www.irs.gov.

27
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:30.258
In Barbados, it's called the Barbados Revenue Authority,

28
00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:31.327
and their website

29
00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:35.862
is www.bra.gov.bb.

30
00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:39.052
And these websites are amazing,

31
00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:42.767
and browsing them, for your country,

32
00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:45.161
every now and then, will help you to realize

33
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:48.377
that there's more tax benefits

34
00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:50.946
that you're not aware of, and that you should

35
00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.863
be taking advantage of.

36
00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.034
And so for my students in all other countries,

37
00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.189
the governing body and website address,

38
00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.127
if you need, can be accessed right here in the course.

39
00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:07.232
Okay, let's get started.

40
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:11.260
The following 14 tax-savings tips

41
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.962
are sorted alphabetically.

42
00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.810
It might apply where you live.

43
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.402
And you can also access this video, if you need to,

44
00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:21.476
in the future, by clicking on this button,

45
00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:23.227
in Excel exercise number three.

46
00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:26.132
And the same thing goes for all 17 videos,

47
00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:28.874
per these buttons here, in the course.

48
00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:32.060
And so in order to save you time, I will provide

49
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.365
a menu, as I mentioned, just like this one,

50
00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:37.756
at the start of all 17 expense-savings videos,

51
00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.006
in case some are not applicable to you.

52
00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:43.992
Okay, let's get started.

53
00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:46.336
Tax-savings tip number one:

54
00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:49.754
buy from another state or province tip.

55
00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:52.041
And often, taxes are only collected

56
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:55.488
on stuff you buy if that product was made

57
00:02:55.488 --> 00:02:58.348
in the province or state that you live in.

58
00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:00.795
So if this is applicable,

59
00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:04.106
order products from another state or province

60
00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.179
so that you pay less in tax.

61
00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.841
For example, when I used to buy software

62
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:12.052
when I lived in the Province of Ontario, Canada,

63
00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:14.495
I had to pay 8% more in tax

64
00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.964
than if I ordered the software from the province

65
00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:19.518
I do not live in, which was Quebec.

66
00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:21.737
Okay, tax-savings tip number two:

67
00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:23.478
charitable tax tips.

68
00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:26.130
Please keep all mileage and receipts

69
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.836
for your commutes to and from charitable events.

70
00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.370
And of course, always ask for tax receipts

71
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.269
when you donate money,

72
00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.138
as this will hopefully convince you

73
00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:37.882
to donate more in the long run.

74
00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:40.586
And take a picture of your car's odometer

75
00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:44.753
before and after you finish driving to a charitable event.

76
00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.659
Then during tax season, look through the photos

77
00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.352
on your mobile device, to get the mileage results.

78
00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:55.884
And you can also track your mileage

79
00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:59.032
by attaching an internet-of-things device

80
00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:01.697
to your car, in what is called

81
00:04:01.697 --> 00:04:05.945
your car's ODB port, to track mileage.

82
00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:10.243
Or just look at your calendar at the end of the year

83
00:04:10.243 --> 00:04:13.332
and track mileage by looking at the address you drove to

84
00:04:13.332 --> 00:04:14.424
in your calendar.

85
00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.910
And we're gonna talk a lot more about your car's ODB port

86
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.017
and how to save a lot of money on auto-related expenses,

87
00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:27.618
in the car and transportation expense savings lesson.

88
00:04:27.618 --> 00:04:30.807
There are several helpful apps and website services

89
00:04:30.807 --> 00:04:33.040
that can really help you with deductions,

90
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.822
such as these offerings from software company Intuit.

91
00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:38.746
And we're gonna talk a lot more about some

92
00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:41.256
of Intuit's amazing expense software products,

93
00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:42.777
later in the course.

94
00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:45.704
Separately, quite often you can get a charitable

95
00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:48.668
tax deduction benefit if you donate stuff

96
00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:51.057
that you currently own.

97
00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.684
Okay, tax-saving tip number three:

98
00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:56.104
company tax benefits tip.

99
00:04:56.104 --> 00:04:58.156
If you work at a company, your company

100
00:04:58.156 --> 00:05:01.224
might have many tax-savings benefits

101
00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:03.432
that you're just not aware of, like

102
00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:05.928
savings matching plans, et cetera.

103
00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:09.330
So if applicable, call human resources

104
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.780
or speak with your supervisor for a list

105
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.173
of employee benefits, or just look at your employee manual

106
00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:18.592
if applicable, as companies have so many perks

107
00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:20.582
that you might not be aware of.

108
00:05:20.582 --> 00:05:22.725
And I'm sure they get a tax benefit as well

109
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:25.886
for providing you with these perks anyway.

110
00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:27.848
Tax-saving tip number four:

111
00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:29.606
education tax tip.

112
00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:32.982
If your country offers tax-free savings plans

113
00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:35.426
for your children's education, then please

114
00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:39.160
max out your contribution every year, if you can,

115
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.992
because it's similar to a retirement savings program

116
00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:44.658
and your money can grow tax-free.

117
00:05:44.658 --> 00:05:48.360
And you only pay taxes when you take the money out,

118
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.404
many years from now, when this amount

119
00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:54.302
is worth a heck of a lot more than it is today.

120
00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:55.862
And so in the United States,

121
00:05:55.862 --> 00:05:59.960
an education savings program is called a 529 plan.

122
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.117
In Canada, it's called an R-E-S-P.

123
00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:05.992
And a lot of countries have this in place as well.

124
00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:09.798
To get more information on educational tax-savings programs

125
00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:11.618
in your country, if applicable,

126
00:06:11.618 --> 00:06:13.975
please go to this location

127
00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:18.142
in the Complete Personal Finance Dashboard Excel file.

128
00:06:19.172 --> 00:06:21.602
Okay, tax-savings tip number five:

129
00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:24.385
environmental tax break tip.

130
00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:26.854
Get solar on your roof,

131
00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:29.948
if the tax subsidies are great where you live.

132
00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:33.081
And so in California, Christine, my wife, and I,

133
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:35.580
we had solar installed on our roof

134
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.360
because, of course we care about the environment,

135
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.752
but the tax benefits are amazing.

136
00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:43.775
And you can choose to buy or lease,

137
00:06:43.775 --> 00:06:46.867
meaning rent, the panels on your roof.

138
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:48.538
And don't buy them, please.

139
00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:51.374
I want you to rent or lease them instead.

140
00:06:51.374 --> 00:06:52.480
And I wanna explain why.

141
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.688
There's actually three reasons.

142
00:06:54.688 --> 00:06:58.158
Number one: it's cheaper to lease or rent them.

143
00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:01.513
Number two: these panels usually depreciate

144
00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:04.880
by about 5% per year, and by year 20

145
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.676
they wear out and they're not worth basically anything.

146
00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:10.638
And number three, and this one's big:

147
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:14.459
if the solar company goes out of business,

148
00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:17.789
it will cost the bankruptcy courts a lot of money

149
00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.308
to remove the panels,

150
00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:21.480
and they're not gonna bother doing so anyway,

151
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.042
which is actually what happened to us.

152
00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.318
The solar company we used was called Sungevity,

153
00:07:26.318 --> 00:07:27.915
which went bankrupt.

154
00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:30.124
Our panels are still on our roof,

155
00:07:30.124 --> 00:07:33.778
and our electricity meter actually rolls backwards

156
00:07:33.778 --> 00:07:36.641
as we generate electricity during the day.

157
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:39.199
And just make sure that there's tax incentives

158
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.851
in place though, and these laws change

159
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:45.101
quite often so please do your research.

160
00:07:46.244 --> 00:07:48.494
Tax-savings tip number six:

161
00:07:48.494 --> 00:07:50.210
hire an accountant, okay.

162
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.552
This might sound obvious but please hear me out on this one.

163
00:07:54.552 --> 00:07:57.089
I want you to keep every single receipt

164
00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:00.543
and please try your best to have an accountant

165
00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:04.197
file your taxes, as I promise you, I promise you

166
00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.362
that there are tax benefits and deductions

167
00:08:06.362 --> 00:08:08.899
that you're not taking advantage of, regardless

168
00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:11.942
of your age, occupation, or where you life.

169
00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:15.060
And hire an accountant that is not expensive.

170
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.985
And I promise you, you will find ones

171
00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:20.117
that are not expensive by talking to your friends

172
00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:23.802
or parents, or mentors at work.

173
00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:25.459
And they will recommend who to hire.

174
00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:27.726
And a lot of them, again, are not expensive,

175
00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:30.694
and they can find you a ton of breaks.

176
00:08:30.694 --> 00:08:32.894
This will keep you out of trouble as well,

177
00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:35.301
as ignorance of the law, of tax law,

178
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:36.989
is not an excuse.

179
00:08:36.989 --> 00:08:39.769
The accountant that you're hiring is so important

180
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.902
for your financial well-being.

181
00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:45.985
I want you to get in the habit of calling your accountant

182
00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:49.577
before investing a large amount of your money,

183
00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:52.209
as they might tell you: wait, wait.

184
00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:56.609
Do that from your tax-savings account instead.

185
00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:59.915
Sometimes it's impossible to actually move an investment

186
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:02.113
that you already made to a tax-savings account

187
00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:04.193
after you've made that investment.

188
00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:06.790
Or better yet, the accountant

189
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.201
might even convince you to not make that investment,

190
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:14.171
which will certainly justify their hourly rate.

191
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:15.869
And so for an example,

192
00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:19.730
go to treasury.gov, that website in the U.S.,

193
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.980
or your government website, and search, if applicable,

194
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.815
to see if your accountant is registered

195
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.538
or operating legally.

196
00:09:27.538 --> 00:09:29.787
And some countries offer this.

197
00:09:29.787 --> 00:09:33.883
This is why I like to get referrals from friends

198
00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:36.908
or your older and wiser relatives,

199
00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:39.242
when it comes to hiring an accountant.

200
00:09:39.242 --> 00:09:42.189
So Google the accountant's name too, obviously.

201
00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:45.319
All states and all countries and all provinces

202
00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:47.935
have different licensing rules.

203
00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:50.511
So know this when you search

204
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:52.594
for an accountant online.

205
00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:56.374
I think accountants are usually likely

206
00:09:56.374 --> 00:10:00.632
to get you much more money back in refunds, in the long run,

207
00:10:00.632 --> 00:10:03.842
than if you filed on your own.

208
00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:07.437
And accountants spend years studying to be an accountant,

209
00:10:07.437 --> 00:10:09.552
and most of them keep up-to-date

210
00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:11.938
with the constantly-changing tax codes.

211
00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:15.465
So not hiring an account, if you can,

212
00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:20.448
is like considering doing some medical procedures yourself.

213
00:10:20.448 --> 00:10:22.656
And if you have a very basic return,

214
00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:24.172
you can even file yourself

215
00:10:24.172 --> 00:10:27.129
if you have very minimal income at this point in your life.

216
00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:30.048
And there's actually a lot of free filing systems

217
00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:32.758
in many countries, online, at government websites.

218
00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:34.978
So just do a Google search.

219
00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:38.819
And many times, actually, the larger tax companies

220
00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:42.070
in your country, they'll let you do your taxes

221
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.488
online for free, at their websites.

222
00:10:45.488 --> 00:10:47.769
What they'll then do is they'll try to upsell

223
00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:49.946
more services to you.

224
00:10:49.946 --> 00:10:53.110
Or you can use software

225
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.475
to do it for a minimal cost,

226
00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:58.870
like TurboTax, there's another one called TaxAct.com

227
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.632
and others, as they link to your banks

228
00:11:01.632 --> 00:11:03.574
and credit cards, and they import the data,

229
00:11:03.574 --> 00:11:05.145
make it easier for you to do.

230
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:08.265
I worry about security issues with that though.

231
00:11:08.265 --> 00:11:10.809
We're gonna cover identity theft protection

232
00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:13.673
and using software programs for your finances,

233
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.073
much later in the course.

234
00:11:16.073 --> 00:11:19.355
Okay, so tax tip number seven:

235
00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:21.272
hire your kids.

236
00:11:22.257 --> 00:11:23.965
(laughing)
If you run

237
00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:27.289
your own business, full-time, like I do,

238
00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:29.543
or on the side, then hire your kids

239
00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:31.513
to do some of the administrative or filing,

240
00:11:31.513 --> 00:11:35.111
or data entry work, as you may get a tax break

241
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.553
and you can actually teach them lessons

242
00:11:36.553 --> 00:11:40.380
about making and saving money at the same time.

243
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.225
And there's usually a limit though, on how much

244
00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:44.627
you can pay them annually.

245
00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:47.773
And the tax code changes all the time on stuff like this.

246
00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:50.787
So for example my kids work

247
00:11:50.787 --> 00:11:54.668
and they get about $1,000 annually tax-free,

248
00:11:54.668 --> 00:11:57.481
when I pay them to do administrative stuff,

249
00:11:57.481 --> 00:12:00.889
in what's called their Roth IRA accounts.

250
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:03.013
IRA is a retirement account.

251
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.318
We're gonna discuss retirement savings

252
00:12:05.318 --> 00:12:07.913
in a lot more detail later.

253
00:12:07.913 --> 00:12:10.589
Okay, tax tip number eight:

254
00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:13.076
housing expense tip.

255
00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:15.043
You actually might be able to depreciate

256
00:12:15.043 --> 00:12:16.141
part of your house,

257
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:18.809
if you use it for a business.

258
00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:21.184
But tax codes change constantly on this,

259
00:12:21.184 --> 00:12:25.337
so either ask your accountant or do more research on this.

260
00:12:25.337 --> 00:12:27.507
Tax-savings tip number nine:

261
00:12:27.507 --> 00:12:29.795
job search tax tip.

262
00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:31.600
In many countries, most people don't realize this,

263
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.854
but in many countries all or most

264
00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.625
of the expenses related to finding a job

265
00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:39.677
are actually tax deductible.

266
00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:42.643
So please keep all your receipts and track your mileage

267
00:12:42.643 --> 00:12:45.065
if you drive to interviews.

268
00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:48.064
And as a quick side-note here, if you wanna track

269
00:12:48.064 --> 00:12:52.781
your mileage, please click this icon here in the course.

270
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:55.181
And we'll discuss mileage tracking

271
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:56.934
a few more times later on in the course,

272
00:12:56.934 --> 00:12:58.278
but you can track it here.

273
00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.115
We'll come back to that soon.

274
00:13:00.115 --> 00:13:02.057
Tax-savings tip number 10:

275
00:13:02.057 --> 00:13:03.941
moving expense tip.

276
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:07.956
Moving expenses can be deducted in many places,

277
00:13:07.956 --> 00:13:08.969
not all but many.

278
00:13:08.969 --> 00:13:10.672
So please just keep the receipts

279
00:13:10.672 --> 00:13:13.337
and the mileage detail as well.

280
00:13:13.337 --> 00:13:15.475
Tax tip number 11:

281
00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:18.448
perception of expenses tip.

282
00:13:18.448 --> 00:13:21.737
Okay, this is a little out there but bear with me please.

283
00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:23.525
I want you to think about everything

284
00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:26.969
that you buy as costing you close to twice as much

285
00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.386
because of taxes.

286
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:33.729
Tax rates are really high in a lot of countries,

287
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:36.175
and if you include income tax, state tax,

288
00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:39.201
or provincial tax, VAT tax, GST tax,

289
00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:41.647
or other taxes and sales taxes

290
00:13:41.647 --> 00:13:44.348
and property tax, et cetera, then you know what?

291
00:13:44.348 --> 00:13:46.652
The total tax that you might be paying

292
00:13:46.652 --> 00:13:48.988
could be 50%, which means

293
00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:51.105
every dollar you spend on anything you wanna buy,

294
00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:53.483
just think of it as costing you 100% more

295
00:13:53.483 --> 00:13:55.361
because half goes to tax, okay?

296
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:57.381
It's a perception thing.

297
00:13:57.381 --> 00:13:58.948
Thinking that way will make you save

298
00:13:58.948 --> 00:14:01.383
a little bit more money too.

299
00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:04.001
Okay, so think about everything

300
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:06.075
costing twice as much as you think.

301
00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.683
I know that's kind of out there,

302
00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:10.779
but if you condition yourself to thinking

303
00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.347
that everything you buy costs way, way, way, way more

304
00:14:13.347 --> 00:14:14.875
because of taxes, then you know what?

305
00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.232
You'll end up spending less and think twice

306
00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:20.359
before you make a purchase you don't need.

307
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.788
I wish I had told myself that years ago.

308
00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:25.044
Okay, tax-savings tip number 12:

309
00:14:25.044 --> 00:14:26.711
refund of taxes tip.

310
00:14:27.646 --> 00:14:31.393
If you get an unexpected tax refund,

311
00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:35.735
100% of that unexpected amount

312
00:14:35.735 --> 00:14:39.347
should immediately be put into your savings account

313
00:14:39.347 --> 00:14:43.536
or reduce high-interest expense-related debt items

314
00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:45.456
from credit cards, by paying them off.

315
00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:47.795
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever spend money

316
00:14:47.795 --> 00:14:50.161
you get from tax refunds,

317
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:52.778
especially unexpected tax refunds.

318
00:14:52.778 --> 00:14:55.226
Out of sight equals out of mind,

319
00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:57.347
within reason of course.

320
00:14:57.347 --> 00:14:59.824
Okay, tax-savings tip number 13:

321
00:14:59.824 --> 00:15:02.067
retirement tax tip.

322
00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:05.511
Please maximize your retirement savings contribution,

323
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:08.067
if available, every single year,

324
00:15:08.067 --> 00:15:09.819
especially when you're younger.

325
00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:12.442
And the older you,

326
00:15:12.442 --> 00:15:14.288
meaning you many years from now, the older you

327
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.135
will thank you for this.

328
00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:18.032
We're gonna discuss what to invest

329
00:15:18.032 --> 00:15:20.876
in your retirement account, and how to diversify

330
00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:25.232
your retirement portfolio, in part three of the course.

331
00:15:25.232 --> 00:15:28.616
Okay, and so retirement programs are a little bit different

332
00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:31.292
in all countries, but for the most part

333
00:15:31.292 --> 00:15:34.940
they're focused on helping you save money today,

334
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.927
in a retirement account that is tax-free.

335
00:15:37.927 --> 00:15:40.915
And then similar to the education savings account

336
00:15:40.915 --> 00:15:42.581
that we spoke about,

337
00:15:42.581 --> 00:15:46.263
when you take that money out of the tax account

338
00:15:46.263 --> 00:15:49.344
many years from now, when you retire, guys,

339
00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:51.980
you pay taxes then on a much bigger amount,

340
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.276
so let your money work for you.

341
00:15:54.276 --> 00:15:57.293
And not taking advantage of retirement savings accounts

342
00:15:57.293 --> 00:16:00.557
is literally like throwing your hard-earned money

343
00:16:00.557 --> 00:16:01.984
in the garbage.

344
00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:06.310
In the United States, it's called the 401k program.

345
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.477
That's the retirement account most people use.

346
00:16:08.477 --> 00:16:10.807
In Canada it's called the R-R-S-P,

347
00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:14.259
or the Registered Retirement Savings Program.

348
00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:15.747
And if you want more information

349
00:16:15.747 --> 00:16:17.968
on the retirement savings program in your country,

350
00:16:17.968 --> 00:16:20.825
if applicable, please go to this location

351
00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:25.769
in your Complete Personal Finance dashboard Excel file.

352
00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:27.845
Tax-saving tip number 14:

353
00:16:27.845 --> 00:16:29.386
other or additional tips.

354
00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:31.853
And again, this is all sorted alphabetically.

355
00:16:31.853 --> 00:16:35.415
So for additional tax incentives where you live,

356
00:16:35.415 --> 00:16:38.874
please Google tax incentives in your country name,

357
00:16:38.874 --> 00:16:41.313
or see this link here.

358
00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:45.251
And we're gonna talk a lot more about tax shelters,

359
00:16:45.251 --> 00:16:47.421
and what to invest in when it comes to retirement

360
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:49.712
savings programs, et cetera, a little bit later

361
00:16:49.712 --> 00:16:50.713
in the course.
