00:00:00.552 --> 00:00:03.045
<v ->Warren Buffett once said that monopolies</v>

2
00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:06.215
and oligopolies are the best investments.

3
00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:10.090
Now monopolies are companies with absolutely no competition.

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.082
Okay, no competition.

5
00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.265
So usually, they usually don't cut prices.

6
00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.299
For example, Microsoft had a near monopoly

7
00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.750
with Microsoft Windows for many many years.

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.910
As such they barely cut the pricing point on Windows

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.151
for about two decades or so.

10
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.581
Now oligopolies are similar to monopolies.

11
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:33.722
But there are a few powerful competitors in the sector.

12
00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:37.916
Examples of near oligopolies include Google with Android

13
00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:39.300
in the smartphone market.

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.308
Okay, and of course Apple, as well.

15
00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.512
And I mention monopolies and oligopolies in this section

16
00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:48.352
as we really need to be aware of government scrutiny as well

17
00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:51.071
on companies that have a large market share

18
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.259
or are very very powerful.

19
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.943
You know for example, the EU has been scrutinizing Google

20
00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:00.005
and Microsoft for many years

21
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.054
given the former's dominance in search

22
00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:05.493
and the later's previously dominant

23
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:07.263
in the operating system market.

24
00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:10.075
And the role of government in free market societies

25
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:13.751
is to ensure that markets stay competitive

26
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:16.743
as competition helps the consumer.

27
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.465
And although we need to look to invest in companies

28
00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:21.603
with high barriers to entry,

29
00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:23.333
meaning little competition,

30
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.366
we also need to be aware of government policies

31
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.628
when it comes to market power.

32
00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:30.827
Okay and the role of governance in business

33
00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:34.080
is partially to make markets more fair.

34
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.185
And I mention this because

35
00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:38.486
when considering investing in companies,

36
00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:40.082
we gotta understand

37
00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:41.395
if companies that we are investing in

38
00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:45.177
can maintain their pricing power in the long run.
