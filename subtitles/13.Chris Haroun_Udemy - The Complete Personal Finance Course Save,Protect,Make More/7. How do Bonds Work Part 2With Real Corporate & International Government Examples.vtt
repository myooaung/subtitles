00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.571
<v ->Now that We understand what coupon bonds are,</v>

2
00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.853
let's talk about what zero coupon bonds are.

3
00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:09.573
Ridiculously called this but

4
00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:11.311
you'll understand why in a second.

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.311
So guess what a zero coupon bond is.

6
00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:18.683
It's a bond that doesn't have a coupon to cut off.

7
00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:22.302
Why bother making a bond with no coupon then?

8
00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:25.451
Well because maybe the company or government

9
00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:27.251
that wants to issue this bond

10
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:31.073
won't have money to pay back the bonds

11
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:34.222
or loan you or give you dividend payments

12
00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:37.273
or coupon payments for many many many years.

13
00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:39.002
Okay, okay I get it, I get it

14
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.643
but hold on a second,

15
00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:42.302
why on earth would I lend a company money

16
00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:44.530
in the form of a bond if I'm not gonna get

17
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.697
a coupon out of it anyway.

18
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.942
Well what they do is they sell you a zero coupon bond

19
00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:53.811
at a discount.

20
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:58.683
Let me first of all go back to one of our other bonds here.

21
00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.649
This is a coupon bond, not a zero coupon bond.

22
00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.982
It's this one here, we paid $1000 for it

23
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.171
for this bond and what happens is

24
00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:17.542
when this bond expires, it's still worth 1000 bucks.

25
00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:20.152
You get $1000 back, I'll explain what that means.

26
00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:22.323
So let me get some of my fake money here.

27
00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:23.802
Perfect, okay.

28
00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:28.131
This is 1000 fake American dollars in tens.

29
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:33.027
So let's say the New York Central Railroad company.

30
00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.562
I think that's Grand Central, that's pretty cool.

31
00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:40.491
Let's say that they wanted to raise a lot of money

32
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.780
in order to build Grand Central Station.

33
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.780
What they would do is they would sell this to me

34
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.143
in return I would give them $1000.

35
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.348
I feel like a player here.

36
00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.413
I give them $1000

37
00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:00.971
and then what would happen is

38
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:05.224
I would cut off these coupons, every six months

39
00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.501
see these coupons here,

40
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.001
for dividend payments and then years later

41
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.720
when this coupon is due contractually,

42
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.800
I give it back them and they give my $1000 back.

43
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.990
Okay, makes sense?

44
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.200
Okay, good.

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.040
Let me just get rid of this stuff here.

46
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.421
Alright, alright I get it, I get it.

47
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:31.080
Okay so I want to give you an example

48
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.247
of a zero coupon bond now.

49
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.367
This is a real war bond issued in 1945 by the United States

50
00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:42.461
and Chris maybe you can just zoom in on that.

51
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:47.065
And in 1945 US government when they issued this bond

52
00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.232
which is January 1945 they had no idea

53
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.811
when World War II might end and they didn't know

54
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:58.148
if they'd be able to pay coupons

55
00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:00.531
to finance the war, World War II

56
00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:03.581
which was ridiculously expensive.

57
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:07.461
So as a result this war bond does not pay you a coupon.

58
00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:11.120
It's a zero coupon but you can redeem it

59
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.209
10 years later meaning 1955 at a value of $25.

60
00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.042
25, okay.

61
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:23.139
If we look at the back of this zero coupon war bond,

62
00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.589
we can see that the bond is sold at a discount

63
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.422
and if you bought this bond in 1945 in January

64
00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:37.756
when it came out, you would've paid $18.75.

65
00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:43.323
It says here on the back and it rises in value

66
00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.323
every six months by a certain amount

67
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.388
until you could sell it at maturity in 1955 for 25 bucks

68
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:56.733
so when you buy it, if you bought it

69
00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:59.650
at the issue price in January 1945,

70
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.833
you would have paid $18.75 and if you sold it,

71
00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.650
I'm just reading off here five years later

72
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.817
meaning in 1950, you'd get $20.50 from the US government

73
00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:18.408
or if you held till maturity meaning till 1955,

74
00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:21.741
you'd be able to redeem it for 25 bucks.

75
00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:25.109
So this is a shared discount.

76
00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:28.197
If you bought it when it first came out,

77
00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:32.439
you would have paid $18.75

78
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.860
and then zero coupons

79
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.679
when it matured 10 years later

80
00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.496
you get 25 bucks back.

81
00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:43.947
Now you understand how many governments and companies

82
00:04:43.947 --> 00:04:46.187
can raise money so they can finance growth

83
00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:50.104
on certain very expensive products or projects.

84
00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:54.936
The riskier the bond investment is,

85
00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:58.267
the higher the interest rate on the bond which makes sense

86
00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:01.736
and so the lowest risk bond investment

87
00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:04.456
according to global markets

88
00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:07.524
is United States government issued bonds.

89
00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:10.885
As a result the rate the US government issued bonds at

90
00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:13.005
or issues bonds that is relatively low.

91
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:16.267
We know from this that if you put in $18.35

92
00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:19.644
and 10 years later you're gonna get 25 bucks,

93
00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:21.925
that's not very much money right.

94
00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:24.575
It's a decent amount but at the same time

95
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:28.393
if we go back, pretend we're in 1945 January right now,

96
00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:30.759
probably the lowest risk places at that time

97
00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.799
to invest your money was I guess United States.

98
00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.000
United States government, whatever.

99
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Anyway, risk and return.

100
00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.899
If you think that a certain government

101
00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:43.859
is at risk of defaulting meaning going bankrupt

102
00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:46.040
and not being able to pay back their debt

103
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.779
then of course, obviously don't ever invest in bonds

104
00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.571
for that government but what happens is

105
00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:55.592
those governments that issued those bonds

106
00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:58.619
will issue very very high interest rates

107
00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.090
to entice you and I to consider buying it.

108
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.152
I don't think you should do it.

109
00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:03.992
Only invest in very high quality bonds

110
00:06:03.992 --> 00:06:06.211
so I'll tell you which ones.

111
00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:09.592
And I'm not referring to countries only when I say this.

112
00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:11.851
When I say bonds from governments.

113
00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:14.507
I'm also referring to municipal bonds

114
00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.379
or bonds issued from local governments or cities.

115
00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.438
Be really careful about that because sometimes

116
00:06:20.438 --> 00:06:24.680
you can invest in cities in America for example

117
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.469
that issue bonds and that city can go

118
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.349
or town can go bankrupt.

119
00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.240
They can default on their payments

120
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.960
and I'm gonna teach you how to buy the right bonds

121
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.259
that are highly rated to protect you

122
00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.669
and make it safer for you very soon.

123
00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.208
Just be careful about also investing in countries

124
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.117
that have very volatile currencies,

125
00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:47.855
meaning their currency goes up and down quite rapidly.

126
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:50.147
Separately how do we know if a bond is too risky

127
00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:52.305
to invest in or not?

128
00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:56.648
The way we know is by using ratings agencies.

129
00:06:56.648 --> 00:07:00.496
Like Moody's or S&amp;P and there's others as well

130
00:07:00.496 --> 00:07:03.637
but just like how there are consumer credit companies

131
00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:06.454
that we spoke about like Aqua Facts, Experian

132
00:07:06.454 --> 00:07:09.568
and Trans Union earlier in the course,

133
00:07:09.568 --> 00:07:12.368
the way that larger debt ratings agency companies

134
00:07:12.368 --> 00:07:14.868
like Moody's or S&amp;P rate bonds

135
00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:20.345
is alphabetically and that's all you gotta know.

136
00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:21.555
I'll tell you what that means.

137
00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:24.597
The top rated bonds RCA is good

138
00:07:24.597 --> 00:07:26.667
and once you go low in the alphabet it's bad.

139
00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:31.187
The top rated bonds are called AAA then AA then A,

140
00:07:31.187 --> 00:07:34.104
then BBB, I think you get the idea.

141
00:07:35.293 --> 00:07:37.875
I prefer for you to never invest in anything

142
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.125
that has a rating below BBB

143
00:07:41.943 --> 00:07:45.253
and that goes for government or corporate bond investments.

144
00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:48.253
BBB or higher ratings from the ratings agencies

145
00:07:48.253 --> 00:07:50.689
Moody's and S&amp;P place.

146
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:54.421
Don't be seduced by bonds with high interest rate returns

147
00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:57.419
if the debt rating from Moody's or S&amp;P

148
00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:01.002
those two companies are low or speculative.

149
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.920
Just be careful and you're gonna hear people call these

150
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.699
riskier bonds, high-yield or junk bonds.

151
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.627
Just please avoid them if you can okay.

152
00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:16.651
Please, please, please and if you do invest in them

153
00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:20.139
make sure you're doing it in a very diversified portfolio

154
00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:23.338
and that the money you invest you're prepared to lose.

155
00:08:23.338 --> 00:08:25.518
There's that risk.

156
00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:29.731
A credit rating of BB or lower by Standard &amp; Poor's

157
00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:31.564
is classified as junk.

158
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.441
Again all I want you to do is invest in BBB bonds or higher

159
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:40.043
and a great example of junk bonds financing

160
00:08:40.043 --> 00:08:42.715
really risky expensive stuff

161
00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:46.336
is if somebody wanted to build many hotels

162
00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:47.816
in the middle of a desert.

163
00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:50.776
It sounds crazy but this is actually

164
00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:54.872
how Las Vegas was financed and I'll let Robert De Niro

165
00:08:54.872 --> 00:08:57.243
tell you more about this.

166
00:08:57.243 --> 00:08:59.733
<v Robert>The town will never be the same.</v>

167
00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:04.443
After the tinges, the big corporations took it all over,

168
00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.974
today it looks like Disney Land.

169
00:09:06.974 --> 00:09:09.391
(hymn music)

170
00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:16.369
And while the kids play cardboard pirates,

171
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:18.521
mummy and daddy dropped the house payments

172
00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:22.354
and Junior's college money on the poker slots.

173
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:27.932
In the old day dealers knew your name,

174
00:09:27.932 --> 00:09:29.601
what you drank, what you play.

175
00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:31.849
Today it's like checking into an airport

176
00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:33.569
and if you order room service, you're lucky

177
00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:35.736
if you get it by Thursday.

178
00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.780
Today it's all gone.

179
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.958
We got a way of performing in a suitcase

180
00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.318
and some 25-year old hotel school kid

181
00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.568
is gonna want a social security number.

182
00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:48.417
After the tips has got knocked out of the box

183
00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:50.568
the corporations tore down practically everyone

184
00:09:50.568 --> 00:09:53.377
of the old casinos and where did the money

185
00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:56.836
come from to rebuild the pyramids?

186
00:09:56.836 --> 00:09:58.449
Junk bonds.

187
00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:02.678
<v ->That's was a clip from Scorsese's awesome film, Casino.</v>

188
00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:03.511
It was great.

189
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:05.792
Okay, quick question for you.

190
00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:08.560
What is a lower risk bond investment?

191
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.727
The US federal government bonds or IBM's corporate bonds?

192
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:16.341
Of course it's the US federal government bonds

193
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:19.480
as the US government is less likely to go bankrupt

194
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.851
or out of business that IBM is

195
00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:24.589
okay which stands for Itty Bitty Machines.

196
00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:26.011
How do I know that?

197
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:30.094
Because the ratings agencies like Moody's and S&amp;P

198
00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:36.049
rate US government bonds higher than IBM bonds

199
00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:39.080
and also because foreign governments like China

200
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.790
own a lot of US debt, meaning US bonds

201
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.491
and there's too much at stake given the interconnectedness

202
00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:47.190
of global markets.

203
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.160
Too big to fail.

204
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.101
I'm not gonna go there but since the US government bonds

205
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:56.511
are lower risk than IBM's bonds do think the interest rate

206
00:10:56.511 --> 00:11:00.678
on US government bonds is higher or lower than IBM's bonds?

207
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:05.111
Yes, IBM's bonds interest rates are higher

208
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.642
because they're higher risk bonds

209
00:11:07.642 --> 00:11:09.861
relative to the US government bonds.

210
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:12.151
It's all relative.

211
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.962
Just like valuation with stocks or any investment.

212
00:11:14.962 --> 00:11:16.423
It's all relative.

213
00:11:16.423 --> 00:11:20.394
I prefer buying ETF-based diversified bond funds

214
00:11:20.394 --> 00:11:22.992
or very low risk United States

215
00:11:22.992 --> 00:11:25.194
or other great government bonds

216
00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:28.691
that have inflation protected mechanisms built in

217
00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:32.170
just in case inflation increases.

218
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.792
So when I say US treasury bonds or treasury bonds

219
00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:41.223
or treasuries we're usually referring to US government debt

220
00:11:41.223 --> 00:11:43.354
and there's four different types of treasuries

221
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:46.091
I want to quickly talk about.

222
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:50.258
Number one, treasury bills which mature in under 12 months.

223
00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.208
They're like short-term bonds.

224
00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:57.517
Number two, treasury notes which mature and one to 10 years

225
00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:58.817
and they give you coupon which means

226
00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:01.150
a dividend every six months.

227
00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:06.837
Number three treasury bonds which mature in 10 to 30 years

228
00:12:06.837 --> 00:12:09.389
and lastly number four which is my favorite one.

229
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:11.229
It's called TIPS which stands for

230
00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:14.075
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.

231
00:12:14.075 --> 00:12:16.407
Remember we looked at tip, T-I-P.

232
00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:21.288
TIPS adjust upwards in value if we get an inflation

233
00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:24.416
and a great resource if you want read more about this stuff,

234
00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:28.666
more about treasuries is treasurydirect.gov

235
00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:30.876
Separately some of you hear people talking about

236
00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:32.635
municipal bonds.

237
00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:35.175
For example, we have a municipal bond here

238
00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:38.528
from the city of Los Angeles in 1927.

239
00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:43.014
It says state improvement bonds, city of Los Angeles

240
00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:47.523
and people call these things "Munis" and on many occasions

241
00:12:47.523 --> 00:12:51.690
muniz or municipal governments will issue these tax-free

242
00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:55.677
and they'll do that just to entice you.

243
00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:56.685
You don't have to pay taxes on them

244
00:12:56.685 --> 00:12:58.704
which is an awesome thing because some of those people

245
00:12:58.704 --> 00:13:02.791
are scared at investing in Municipal governments because

246
00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:05.542
the city of Los Angeles for example

247
00:13:05.542 --> 00:13:07.792
has a much higher chance of going bankrupt

248
00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:12.231
than the US government in general

249
00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:13.940
so it's tax-free long term.

250
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.540
So if a bond or a municipal bond is tax-free

251
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.310
then the way you calculate the equivalent return

252
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.471
on a taxable investment or yield is to take the yield

253
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.489
or the return on that bond.

254
00:13:27.489 --> 00:13:30.271
Let's say it's 5% and you divide it

255
00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:32.438
by one minus the tax rate.

256
00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:38.216
For example if taxes are 30% then this would mean

257
00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:44.369
that the taxable equivalent investment return

258
00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:49.057
on a 5% bond or muni would be 5%

259
00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:52.626
divided by one minus point three percent.

260
00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:54.777
One minus interest rate.

261
00:13:54.777 --> 00:13:59.268
This means that you would be basically getting

262
00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:02.685
a taxable equivalent yield of 7.14%,

263
00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:08.702
so that that 5% bond yields you 7.14%

264
00:14:09.863 --> 00:14:12.714
as you don't pay taxes on it.

265
00:14:12.714 --> 00:14:14.817
So how do you by bonds?

266
00:14:14.817 --> 00:14:18.647
Well ask your bank on how to buy bonds and stocks

267
00:14:18.647 --> 00:14:20.497
as they recommend brokerages

268
00:14:20.497 --> 00:14:23.177
if they don't have one themselves.

269
00:14:23.177 --> 00:14:25.537
If you already have an investment account open,

270
00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:28.606
then buying bonds my way is very easy

271
00:14:28.606 --> 00:14:32.425
as I prefer to only by ETF's which we talked about before.

272
00:14:32.425 --> 00:14:35.280
I'm gonna demonstrate in the next exercise

273
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.200
which is exercise number 20 on bonds, how to buy bonds

274
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.219
and as with stocks please do all of your own research

275
00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:45.119
when it comes to bonds.

276
00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:46.887
Don't rely no me or anybody.

277
00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:50.219
You know read the investment prospectus document

278
00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:51.419
and disclosure documents

279
00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:54.038
and call the company issuing the bonds

280
00:14:54.038 --> 00:14:56.488
or the bank issuing the bonds

281
00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:58.408
or the investment firm issuing the bonds

282
00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:00.389
and ask them questions if you don't understand

283
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:01.490
something that you read

284
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.789
in the investment prospectus documents or disclosures.

285
00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:05.956
Just ask them.

286
00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:09.729
Now I want to show you where you can get

287
00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:12.050
easy to understand bond information.

288
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.950
So we're gonna use Yahoo finance again,

289
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.831
meeting finance@yahoo.com

290
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:20.231
which is convenient as we will also get Yahoo finance data

291
00:15:20.231 --> 00:15:24.721
for our portfolio in the exercise in the next lecture.

292
00:15:24.721 --> 00:15:28.888
Let's now go to finance.yahoo.com/bonds.

293
00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:32.050
Now the first thing we see here

294
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.900
is US treasury bond rates

295
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.280
and you can change this as well.

296
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.896
You can look at crypto currencies, stocks,

297
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.267
ETS, mutual funds commodities et cetera, whatever.

298
00:15:41.267 --> 00:15:43.573
So this will just take you to a different URL

299
00:15:43.573 --> 00:15:46.035
so right now we're at slash bonds.

300
00:15:46.035 --> 00:15:48.635
If you go here the URL will change

301
00:15:48.635 --> 00:15:50.561
just so you could bookmark them.

302
00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:52.163
Let's go back to bonds.

303
00:15:52.163 --> 00:15:54.112
So we have a three-month, six-month

304
00:15:54.112 --> 00:15:56.261
and multiple years up to 30 year

305
00:15:56.261 --> 00:15:59.281
and this important monitor for when you get a mortgage

306
00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:02.819
and we'll cover that very soon in the course and obviously

307
00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:06.251
the rates that you and I will be paying for our mortgage

308
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:09.491
over a 30 year fixed rate is gonna be

309
00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:10.771
higher than the US government because

310
00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:15.068
we're just riskier unfortunately for banks to invest in us

311
00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:16.539
than the US government.

312
00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:18.557
Okay so when you scroll down here

313
00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:20.186
and I want to cover this here,

314
00:16:20.186 --> 00:16:21.728
please be careful and I mentioned this before

315
00:16:21.728 --> 00:16:23.317
but it's important to reiterate it.

316
00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:26.728
Whenever you see this sponsored please don't read those

317
00:16:26.728 --> 00:16:30.311
because there's bias associated with these.

318
00:16:33.077 --> 00:16:34.707
The rest of this is actually pretty good

319
00:16:34.707 --> 00:16:38.575
and try not to read any stories that where

320
00:16:38.575 --> 00:16:40.496
strong opinions are mentioned.

321
00:16:40.496 --> 00:16:42.707
I want you to read the ones that explain

322
00:16:42.707 --> 00:16:45.290
how the world of finance works.

323
00:16:46.627 --> 00:16:48.877
For example the 10-year treasury

324
00:16:48.877 --> 00:16:51.734
yield briefly top that percent after Congress just passed

325
00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:53.508
a pretty big tax overhaul.

326
00:16:53.508 --> 00:16:55.925
It was a big news on that day

327
00:16:58.408 --> 00:17:00.099
but you can go through here and just kinda

328
00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:02.408
learn about the world of finance

329
00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:05.149
by reading these non-sponsored articles

330
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.979
and then what we'll do in the next exercise

331
00:17:06.979 --> 00:17:10.371
is we're gonna create a portfolio and add bonds.

332
00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:13.261
So you can even type in the word bonds

333
00:17:13.261 --> 00:17:15.701
and you can find bond funds here.

334
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:19.931
Now remember earlier we went through this iShares document.

335
00:17:19.931 --> 00:17:23.872
It's a 12 page PDF that's attached to a prior lecture.

336
00:17:23.872 --> 00:17:25.624
You can go back to that if you want

337
00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:29.344
and you can pull up a lot of these trading symbols here

338
00:17:29.344 --> 00:17:32.669
to look at the bond funds that are offered by iShares

339
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:35.184
and the reason I bring this up again is because

340
00:17:35.184 --> 00:17:38.950
the expense ratio is very very low here.

341
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.291
So you can just scroll through

342
00:17:40.291 --> 00:17:42.000
and there's just a ton of bond funds

343
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.984
so it's a pretty cool document to start off with.

344
00:17:44.984 --> 00:17:46.675
You can look at corporate bonds,

345
00:17:46.675 --> 00:17:49.135
you can look at interest rate hedge bonds,

346
00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:53.077
longer duration convertible bonds which basically means

347
00:17:53.077 --> 00:17:55.396
shares that convert to bonds or vice versa.

348
00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:57.555
Little bit outside the scope of this course but anyway

349
00:17:57.555 --> 00:18:00.376
there's tons of bonds you look at in this 12 page

350
00:18:00.376 --> 00:18:02.688
and what you do is you just double-click,

351
00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:06.188
you can copy the ticker, go here hit enter

352
00:18:07.816 --> 00:18:10.275
just like it's a stock ticker and there you go

353
00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:11.555
and you can look into these.

354
00:18:11.555 --> 00:18:14.847
So this one here is a short treasury bond ETF.

355
00:18:14.847 --> 00:18:15.985
You can click through to find out

356
00:18:15.985 --> 00:18:19.447
what positions are within each ETF fund

357
00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:21.688
and you can click on the individual securities below

358
00:18:21.688 --> 00:18:24.747
in most cases and learn more about the companies

359
00:18:24.747 --> 00:18:26.966
just like we learned with by doom

360
00:18:26.966 --> 00:18:29.728
we click on before when we were looking at equity ETF's.

361
00:18:29.728 --> 00:18:31.997
So in the next lesson we'll do an exercise

362
00:18:31.997 --> 00:18:34.816
on adding bonds to your portfolio.

363
00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:35.649
Thanks.
