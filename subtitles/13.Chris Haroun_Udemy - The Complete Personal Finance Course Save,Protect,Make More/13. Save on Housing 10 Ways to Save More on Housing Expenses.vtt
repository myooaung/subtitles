<v ->Housing Expenses Tip #1: Airbnb and Remote Lock Tip.</v>

2
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.668
When you're buying a house, think about if you can

3
00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:21.937
Airbnb a room to cover the mortgage,

4
00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:24.308
or a huge part of the mortgage.

5
00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:27.606
You know, see if you can make a separate door

6
00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:30.756
from the outside, for an Airbnb room.

7
00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:34.072
And I actually installed this door here

8
00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:36.930
when we used to rent out a room to Airbnb guests.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.711
We don't rent it out anymore, though.

10
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.544
And search Airbnb now,

11
00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:44.451
using your country or Zip or Postal code,

12
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:46.254
to see what your neighbors,

13
00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.279
or people that live close to you are charging.

14
00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:52.476
If you want, and if you're curious about,

15
00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:55.244
about finding a way to get additional income,

16
00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.061
as I never want you to please rely

17
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.173
on just one source of income.

18
00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:03.173
And, separately, if you are not home

19
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:09.249
to rent out your vacation house, or part of your house.

20
00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.710
I don't have a vacation house, but a lot of people do this.

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.163
You can buy an August lock.

22
00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:15.673
And I'm gonna show it to ya, hold on a second here, please.

23
00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:18.144
Okay, you can see it, can you see that here?

24
00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.447
Okay, I'll hold it this way

25
00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:20.881
so the glare doesn't get on there.

26
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.381
But you can buy an August lock

27
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:28.785
and send your guests the keys that work.

28
00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:32.085
And the keys actually expire and they're virtual.

29
00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.088
Okay, it actually goes to an app on their iPhone

30
00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:37.184
or Android handset.

31
00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:41.351
And we use this third generation of August's lock.

32
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:43.824
And it works out well.

33
00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.360
The first two generations weren't that great.

34
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.848
This one actually works quite well.

35
00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:51.931
And if you want more details on this,

36
00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:55.561
let me know, I'm happy to do a separate video for ya

37
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:57.441
to show you how it actually works.

38
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.935
But it's pretty cool and, for security reasons,

39
00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:01.722
I love it too, because I can tell

40
00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.568
when my kids come home and that sorta thing.

41
00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:05.969
And if we ever have somebody that has to do work

42
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.205
on the house or in the backyard, whatever it might be,

43
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:10.107
sometimes we'll give them a code that expires.

44
00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:11.902
And we know exactly when they come and go.

45
00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:16.890
And, again, we send them these keys using our iPhone,

46
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.494
which is pretty cool.

47
00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:21.579
Pretty cool, the future is now.

48
00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.472
Separately, get a roommate if ya want

49
00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:25.736
to lower your household expenses, that one's obvious.

50
00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.741
And, lastly, if you work from home

51
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:30.373
for just one of your sources of income,

52
00:02:30.373 --> 00:02:33.401
look into expensing part of your house.

53
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:35.651
Tip #2: Do It Yourself Tip.

54
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:39.670
When it comes to minor renovations or home repair,

55
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.900
use YouTube and do it yourself,

56
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.134
except for anything involving electricity.

57
00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:46.278
And it's a lot of fun too,

58
00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:50.238
and you can always use Pinterest for awesome ideas.

59
00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:54.301
And so use YouTube more often for ideas

60
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:57.624
on how to do stuff that you usually pay others to do.

61
00:02:57.624 --> 00:02:59.684
You know, like installing carpets, et cetera.

62
00:02:59.684 --> 00:03:02.380
I've done all this stuff myself, just using YouTube,

63
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.852
instead of hiring people, and you save a lot of money.

64
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.935
And so, for example, I just renovated

65
00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.694
our attic from scratch.

66
00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:13.758
And the cost was about $1000 in supplies,

67
00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:16.328
and no labor because I did it myself.

68
00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.317
Sure, I made a lot of mistakes.

69
00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:21.120
But we saved a lot of money and it was fun too.

70
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.712
And, you know, we learned a lot as well

71
00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:23.707
through the whole process.

72
00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:26.591
And it felt so good when we were done.

73
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.197
You know, kinda like when ya finish a model

74
00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:30.701
or a Lego house when you're younger.

75
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.150
Or compiling code if you're a programmer.

76
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.194
It just feels like ya accomplished something.

77
00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:38.770
And so, here's what our attic used to look like.

78
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.794
Okay, and here's what it looks like now.

79
00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:46.107
It's not perfect, but we now have an office upstairs,

80
00:03:46.107 --> 00:03:47.696
which is pretty cool.

81
00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:49.564
And I bought really, really cheap materials

82
00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:52.466
from Ikea, Lowe's, and Home Depot.

83
00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:54.942
Which are hardware stores here in the US.

84
00:03:54.942 --> 00:03:56.828
And sales reps at those companies

85
00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.331
were really great and patient

86
00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:01.375
when I asked them for their opinions.

87
00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.705
And YouTube was amazing.

88
00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:05.907
Use Pinterest a lot for money saving ideas.

89
00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:08.897
It's a lot of fun as well.

90
00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:11.600
Housing Expenses #3: Heating

91
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.247
and Monitoring Your Thermostat Tips.

92
00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:19.155
Buy a better thermostat reader that is programmable.

93
00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.620
Like Nest from Google or competing products similar to Nest.

94
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.054
And, using Nest, which looks like this in our house,

95
00:04:27.054 --> 00:04:31.293
you can remotely turn off heat and/or air conditioning,

96
00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:33.327
and it can automatically turn off

97
00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:35.055
the heater, air conditioning,

98
00:04:35.055 --> 00:04:37.531
if it senses that nobody is at home.

99
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.816
And it's fully customizable.

100
00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:42.090
And it can be a great investment,

101
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.063
as you can actually save money in the long run

102
00:04:45.063 --> 00:04:47.831
in utility bills, because of this.

103
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:52.486
Separately, close the curtains or blinds on hot days.

104
00:04:52.486 --> 00:04:55.679
And we had just a brutal heatwave recently

105
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.707
here in the Bay area.

106
00:04:57.707 --> 00:05:01.046
Which, unfortunately, caused some fires too.

107
00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:04.489
And, you know, here's my hack job way

108
00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:06.234
of closing curtains and stuff.

109
00:05:06.234 --> 00:05:09.113
And I just did this for my recording studio, actually.

110
00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:11.703
I bought this silver metal stuff

111
00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:14.430
which comes in, this might hurt the lighting here,

112
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.649
it comes in these big roles, right.

113
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.640
Let me just put this over here.

114
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.567
Don't wanna sling it against he lights and start a fire.

115
00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:25.199
But I bought this stuff and I put it on some of the windows

116
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.388
in my recording studio too, so that, you know,

117
00:05:28.388 --> 00:05:31.055
I could preserve electricity.

118
00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.925
Because I didn't have to air condition too much.

119
00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:36.176
And, also, it got rid of some noise from the outside.

120
00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:38.423
And here's my hack job.

121
00:05:38.423 --> 00:05:40.758
Let me stand back here, sorry about the glare.

122
00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:41.915
(laughs)

123
00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:45.255
I put Velcro on the back so it fits on the window.

124
00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:47.959
And then I created this for my air conditioning unit

125
00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.377
to go through if I need it to.

126
00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:52.146
And I got all creative

127
00:05:52.146 --> 00:05:56.313
with the screen that I put on as well, for this video here.

128
00:05:57.451 --> 00:05:59.926
I had a lot of fun with it as well.

129
00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:03.554
And, also, install insolation if ya can.

130
00:06:03.554 --> 00:06:05.698
And I'm not talking about the pink stuff

131
00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.157
you might already have in your attic.

132
00:06:08.157 --> 00:06:10.286
But you can get creative as well.

133
00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:14.641
And this is something I use, it's called Great Stuff.

134
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:19.117
And it actually, it's this kinda plastic stuff

135
00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:21.891
that comes out in almost liquid format.

136
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.996
And then it expands a bit and then turns hard.

137
00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:27.756
Which can save ya a lot of money

138
00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:31.299
in heating and air conditioning bills over the long run.

139
00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:33.410
And, also, it gets rid of mice as well.

140
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.504
Which can cost ya a fortune.

141
00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:39.984
And bugs, as well, if ya ever want to sell your house.

142
00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:42.310
Okay, so, and just make sure you have enough insolation

143
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.656
in the attic in general.

144
00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:46.889
As that investment, in general, pays off big time

145
00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.051
in just lower fees.

146
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.920
And then change your air conditioning

147
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.896
and furnace filters often, that'll save ya money as well.

148
00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:55.660
Okay, it'll work better too

149
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.925
and people will get less sick in your house, okay.

150
00:06:58.925 --> 00:07:02.425
Home Expenses Tip #4: Home Remodeling Tip.

151
00:07:03.877 --> 00:07:06.811
Don't, please don't remodel your house

152
00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:09.563
during a very positive economic cycle.

153
00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:12.639
And before you do, make sure you understand

154
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.873
that many contractors rip you off.

155
00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:18.241
And that you are not adding to the resell value

156
00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:20.978
of your house at all, if you make your house

157
00:07:20.978 --> 00:07:23.214
the nicest house on the block.

158
00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:26.854
So only do remodels if you think it will enhance

159
00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:28.441
the house when you sell it.

160
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:31.225
And minor bathroom and kitchen remodels

161
00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:34.915
are the best investments you can make.

162
00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:39.328
Housing Expenses #5: Lowering Rent Expense.

163
00:07:39.328 --> 00:07:41.934
If you rent an apartment or a house,

164
00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.720
ask if you can pay less monthly.

165
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.608
And I know this sounds crazy

166
00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:49.515
but imagine the headache that your landlord would have

167
00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:51.957
in finding another person to rent it.

168
00:07:51.957 --> 00:07:54.551
They might have a month where no one's there.

169
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:57.677
And that month of vacancy can cost a lot of money.

170
00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:00.411
And, you know what, nobody asks for a rent break.

171
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.280
Nobody does it, you should though, okay.

172
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.341
And even if it's only five or 10 dollars,

173
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:05.174
or whatever it is per month,

174
00:08:05.174 --> 00:08:07.712
this really adds up over time, as you know.

175
00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:12.309
And if our landlord asks us to pay more in rent,

176
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:14.902
then why can't we ask our landlord, occasionally,

177
00:08:14.902 --> 00:08:16.273
if we can pay less in rent?

178
00:08:16.273 --> 00:08:19.557
And nobody asks, which is one reason why

179
00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:22.632
most people don't save enough.

180
00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:27.238
Housing Expenses Tip #6: Property Tax Savings Tip.

181
00:08:27.238 --> 00:08:29.397
See if you can appeal

182
00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:32.929
and lower what the value is of your house

183
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.843
with your local government representative.

184
00:08:35.843 --> 00:08:39.177
So that you can pay less, annually, in property tax.

185
00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:40.427
It can be done.

186
00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:44.573
Housing Expenses Tip #7: Trees to Plant

187
00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:46.491
to Save You Money Tip.

188
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.915
This one's fun.

189
00:08:47.915 --> 00:08:51.372
If you have hot summers and cold winters,

190
00:08:51.372 --> 00:08:53.812
then plant more trees close to your house.

191
00:08:53.812 --> 00:08:56.593
And make sure they're not evergreen trees.

192
00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:58.064
Like we had in Canada, growing up.

193
00:08:58.064 --> 00:08:59.434
Why?

194
00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:02.146
Because you want the trees, the leaves on the trees,

195
00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:03.769
to be gone in the winter.

196
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:07.143
So that the sun heats the house in the winter.

197
00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:09.844
And you want the leaves to be there in the summer,

198
00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:12.712
in order to block the sun.

199
00:09:12.712 --> 00:09:14.666
And I love Warren Buffett's quote

200
00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:17.633
on somebody is sitting in the shade today

201
00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:20.643
because someone planted a tree a long time ago.

202
00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.167
Very longterm focused, love it, okay.

203
00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:25.334
Tip #8: Vacation Home Tip.

204
00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:29.187
Vacation homes are usually not good investments

205
00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:31.726
because we only use them 10% of the time

206
00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:35.390
and the value drops a lot when the economy gets awful.

207
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.090
And, if you own one, rent it out, using Airbnb,

208
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.874
like we talked about, when you aren't using it.

209
00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:43.488
And, actually, this is interesting.

210
00:09:43.488 --> 00:09:46.064
In the United States and many countries,

211
00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:49.234
you can rent out part or all of your house

212
00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:50.942
for two weeks per year,

213
00:09:50.942 --> 00:09:54.055
and you don't have to claim it on your income taxes.

214
00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:56.720
As long as it's under two weeks.

215
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.311
Separately, timeshares are not the best investment.

216
00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:02.821
Because they're usually incredibly illiquid,

217
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.399
meaning they're very difficult to sell.

218
00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:08.167
But if you have them, and you don't use it,

219
00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:10.020
then just rent it out a lot.

220
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.029
Using, if you want the August lock we talked about, okay,

221
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.775
and Airbnb.

222
00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:18.656
Housing Expenses Tip #9: Water Saving Tips.

223
00:10:18.656 --> 00:10:21.682
Buy a shower head that reduces the flow of water

224
00:10:21.682 --> 00:10:23.361
annually in your shower.

225
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:25.573
You know, find out if it's cheaper to run your dishwasher

226
00:10:25.573 --> 00:10:28.463
at night, as well, which is what we do.

227
00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:31.610
Also, turn off automatic sprinklers, if applicable,

228
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.186
when it's raining.

229
00:10:33.186 --> 00:10:35.244
And water the grass when it's dark

230
00:10:35.244 --> 00:10:38.013
because there's less evaporation.

231
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:42.180
And, lastly, turn off the water when you brush your teeth.

232
00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:47.127
Tip #10: When to Buy a House or An Apartment.

233
00:10:48.337 --> 00:10:50.763
Buy your house or apartment in Q4,

234
00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:53.041
meaning, October, November, December,

235
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:55.119
as that's the hardest time for people

236
00:10:55.119 --> 00:10:57.245
to sell their house or apartment.

237
00:10:57.245 --> 00:10:59.391
And you can get great deals.

238
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:01.479
And we're gonna discuss buying and renting,

239
00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:03.606
as well as real estate, investment properties,

240
00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:06.291
and mortgages, et cetera, later in the course

241
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.041
in this section here.
