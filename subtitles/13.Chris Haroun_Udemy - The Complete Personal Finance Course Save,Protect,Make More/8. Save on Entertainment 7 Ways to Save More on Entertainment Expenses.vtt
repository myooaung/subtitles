00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.920
Entertainment expenses tip number one,

2
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.469
bike rides and family picnics.

3
00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.961
Go on a back ride or have a family picnic

4
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.387
instead of going out and seeing a movie with your kids.

5
00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:24.481
They wanna spend time with you and it's free

6
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:27.023
versus a movie than can cost about $100

7
00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:28.921
in some crazy places.

8
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.263
Including food, gas, parking, tickets, etc.

9
00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:33.180
It's nutty.

10
00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:38.321
Sorry to mention this next part but I gotta go there.

11
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.681
By the time your child is 12 years old,

12
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:43.481
you have already spent 90% of the time

13
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.124
you're gonna spend with them in their lives.

14
00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.573
They grow up too fast, and it doesn't matter

15
00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:51.740
how much money you have, you can't get that time back.

16
00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:56.395
Separately, have you ever missed one of your kids' recitals

17
00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:58.401
or a parent at school day.

18
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:03.052
If so do you even remember why you had to miss it?

19
00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:06.177
I don't which is sad, but I do remember

20
00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:09.980
missing one or two school events from my eldest son,

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.149
and nothing can be possibly more important

22
00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.016
than spending time with your kids.

23
00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:17.198
So just watch out for that.

24
00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:19.690
Sorry I was a little bit off topic.

25
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.663
Entertainment expense tip number two,

26
00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.658
bring your own drinks and your own food tip.

27
00:01:24.658 --> 00:01:26.439
Bring your own candy bars and drinks

28
00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.668
to entertainment events,

29
00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:31.656
especially movies and when you go to the airport,

30
00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:33.250
if allowable,

31
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.008
as prices of these stuff is way too expensive

32
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.261
when you go to movies, concerts, airport, etc.

33
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:42.029
So bring your own empty water bottle everywhere as well

34
00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.587
as you can actually fill up your bottle for free at home,

35
00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:47.337
obviously, or at water fountains.

36
00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.189
Can you believe that we actually pay more money

37
00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.420
in most countries for bottled water

38
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.981
than we do for gasoline, crazy.

39
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.879
Tip number three, buy used entertainment stuff.

40
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:03.541
Just like how a car depreciates the second you buy it

41
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.029
and drive it off the lot,

42
00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:07.301
the same thing can be said for entertainment stuff,

43
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:10.079
like video games, books, movies, etc.

44
00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.440
And so buy the music you can and then sell them used on eBay

45
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.827
when you're done with them.

46
00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:20.090
Or if it's a movie, or a book, or music get it for free

47
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.701
if you can from the library,

48
00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:24.110
instead of watching the movie the day it comes out,

49
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.804
or buying the hardcover version of the book.

50
00:02:26.804 --> 00:02:28.103
Just wait a little bit of time,

51
00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:30.852
you'll always save a lot more money.

52
00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.098
Entertainment expense tip number four,

53
00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:35.563
cancel subscriptions tip.

54
00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:37.859
Please cancel all magazine subscriptions

55
00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.397
as you can read most articles online,

56
00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:42.727
and magazines are so out of date

57
00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:47.322
as social media basically reports live news now.

58
00:02:47.322 --> 00:02:50.631
Did you know that you can not only get the latest magazines

59
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.589
for free to read at libraries and many places,

60
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.290
but also books and DVDs.

61
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.610
And many libraries have free Internet access as well,

62
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.443
of course.

63
00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:01.981
And I actually find that Internet access

64
00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.578
at the libraries is getting a lot better and extended,

65
00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:07.119
it's actually faster than the one I have at my house.

66
00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:08.945
In many places.

67
00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:10.817
Especially if you go to South Korea.

68
00:03:10.817 --> 00:03:12.806
If you go to Seoul, oh my God,

69
00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:14.780
their libraries are off the charts

70
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.416
when it comes to Internet speed.

71
00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:19.636
And there's no need to buy magazines or newspapers anymore.

72
00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:21.711
Unless it's a health magazine

73
00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:23.498
that you get in the mail monthly,

74
00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:26.666
that influences you to exercise more.

75
00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.856
Entertainment expense tip number five,

76
00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:30.917
cook for them at home tip.

77
00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:35.505
Cook more often and make it a fun family or friends event.

78
00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:39.786
And I prefer watching sporting events at home with friends

79
00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.276
when I have friends over,

80
00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:42.620
because we can cook for them at home,

81
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.218
and it's just a lot cheaper and I love it,

82
00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:48.220
you save a ton of money, you don't have to pay for parking,

83
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.387
expensive tickets, and you save time traveling too.

84
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.388
It can be a nightmare here, at least in San Francisco,

85
00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:59.378
when it comes to traffic and then LA and other places.

86
00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:01.121
You know what I'm talking about.

87
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.947
Entertainment expense tip number six,

88
00:04:02.947 --> 00:04:04.867
cut the cord tip.

89
00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:08.200
Most television stuff is cheaper online.

90
00:04:09.108 --> 00:04:10.441
If you use cable

91
00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.091
for just HBO,

92
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.666
then cut the cable and pay $10 per month

93
00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.793
for HBO on your iPad,

94
00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:20.801
and then stream it using Apple TV or Roku,

95
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:25.383
or an Amazon video device, for example, and if available.

96
00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:28.079
And also with Netflix and Hulu,

97
00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:30.389
you'll find that in many countries it can actually

98
00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.309
replace your cable box entirely,

99
00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.357
because the content is good enough

100
00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:38.268
on those aforementioned two services, Netflix and Hulu.

101
00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:40.509
And I know many people are gonna disagree with me,

102
00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.417
because they wanna keep cable or satellite TV

103
00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.770
because of sporting events.

104
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.719
But now you can watch a lot of sporting events online

105
00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:54.707
by subscribing to apps online, like MLB for baseball, etc.

106
00:04:54.707 --> 00:04:59.577
And YouTube actually is also a great longer-term alternative

107
00:04:59.577 --> 00:05:01.629
as YouTube is getting much more aggressive

108
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.047
by competing with cable companies,

109
00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:07.369
and competition we know is great for the consumer.

110
00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:10.572
Tip number seven, drink at home first.

111
00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:13.171
If you're younger and if you party a lot,

112
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:16.185
then drink at home first with your friends before going out.

113
00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.593
You know, it's absolutely criminal

114
00:05:18.593 --> 00:05:22.760
how much alcohol and non alcohol beverages cost at bars.
