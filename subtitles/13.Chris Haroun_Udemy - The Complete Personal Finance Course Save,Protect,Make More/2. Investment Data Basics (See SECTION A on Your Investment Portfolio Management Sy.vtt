00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.079
<v Instructor>Now we're gonna discuss</v>

2
00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.029
what all this data means

3
00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.669
and so, for this lecture

4
00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm just go over section A

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.647
and section A is all the data in this blue box up until here

6
00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.298
in AF and then we'll discuss section B data

7
00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:20.611
in the next lecture,

8
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:21.879
rinse, lather and repeat for the rest.

9
00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.200
You get the idea, okay, cool.

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
So, if you're not already on your portfolio page,

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.080
please make sure to click it

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.771
and oops, I forgot to click Done With This Exercise,

13
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:32.363
so I click that, good.

14
00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:36.731
Okay, so I'm gonna through what all of these items mean now

15
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:38.072
in section A

16
00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:39.571
and if you want more real estate

17
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.489
you can minimize this stuff here

18
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.571
and I will hide this.

19
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:44.843
Sometimes it takes a second to hide.

20
00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:46.260
Hold on a second.

21
00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:50.329
Okay, good, now, I'm gonna go through

22
00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.611
what all this stuff means

23
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:56.320
and what I'll also do is I'm actually going to unhide

24
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.653
this column here

25
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.851
which is gonna be all the descriptions

26
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:03.908
for each of these items here

27
00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:06.891
and you can read through these if you want to later.

28
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:09.069
We'll always come back to it if you're not sure

29
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.518
what a certain column means.

30
00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:13.469
So, let's go through this.

31
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.371
So, we know what the ticker is,

32
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:19.013
it's a unique symbol that identifies the stock

33
00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:22.720
and there's also tickers for indexes as well

34
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.381
and commodities which we covered

35
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:26.181
and we'll continue to cover in this course.

36
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.731
This is the name, it's self-explanatory,

37
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:30.395
and I'm gonna scroll over here

38
00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:31.641
as we go through this.

39
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.829
Market cap means the value of the company,

40
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.621
so if you take the number of outstanding shares

41
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.581
times the price, that's how much the company is worth

42
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:43.232
and so, Apple, for example,

43
00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:47.399
as of this recording is worth about 900 billion US dollars.

44
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:51.433
This is the price that Apple last traded at,

45
00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:54.241
the percent change, it was unchanged,

46
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.649
the daily changes their stock,

47
00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.393
that's self-explanatory.

48
00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:00.625
The highest price here, day high,

49
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.738
this is the highest price that Apple reached

50
00:02:02.738 --> 00:02:04.857
in the last day of trading,

51
00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.257
that's the lowest price.

52
00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:10.677
That's what the stock or ETF opened at,

53
00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:14.277
so Apple opened that day at that price.

54
00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:17.833
That's what it closed at the previous day.

55
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:21.433
This is the number of shares that traded.

56
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.233
And so, you always want to make sure

57
00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:25.797
that the stocks trade a lot

58
00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.656
otherwise they're hard to get out of

59
00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:29.233
and if you invest in companies

60
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.897
that don't trade that much,

61
00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:32.559
meaning they don't have a high volume,

62
00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.623
then what happens is you become a stock holder

63
00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.201
and these shares own you

64
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:39.893
and not vice versa

65
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:40.977
if you try to get out of them

66
00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:42.578
and the market's going south

67
00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:44.441
and so, Apple on this particular day

68
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:47.469
traded 16.35 million shares.

69
00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.636
So, basically what you do is you take 16.35 million shares

70
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.264
times the stock price.

71
00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:57.609
And that's how many shares traded that day.

72
00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.595
And you can see here that the tip

73
00:03:00.595 --> 00:03:02.245
which is an ETF for a bond

74
00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:03.233
wasn't that liquid

75
00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.657
but it's liquid enough for us to be able

76
00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:06.157
to get in and out of

77
00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.601
and when I managed a hedge fund in the past

78
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:10.073
I would never invest in a stock

79
00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:11.621
that was illiquid

80
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.187
meaning there weren't that many shares traded daily

81
00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:19.421
and this here is the average number of shares traded

82
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.338
over the past several months or so.

83
00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:25.585
This is the lowest price the stock has been

84
00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:27.745
in the last 52 weeks.

85
00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:29.665
This is the highest price,

86
00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:31.492
this is the dollar change

87
00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:32.697
from the 52-week high,

88
00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:34.601
it's always going to be negative,

89
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.089
always unless we're right at the 52-week high right now.

90
00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:38.991
So, I think it makes sense.

91
00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:39.824
It's self-explanatory.

92
00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.305
If you have questions, let me know.

93
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.693
This is the dollar change from the 52-week low

94
00:03:44.693 --> 00:03:47.276
and it's always gonna be black.

95
00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:51.865
This was the time last trade was executed,

96
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:55.133
so right now where it's Sunday morning

97
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:56.781
very, very early

98
00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.225
and this was two days ago on Friday

99
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:02.049
and this is the high and the low for the day,

100
00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.481
this is the number of shares outstanding

101
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:07.881
that are available to trade

102
00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.215
and that's the percent change

103
00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:10.537
from the 52-week high,

104
00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:12.650
percent from 52-week low

105
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.129
and this here is the book value per share,

106
00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.273
so what that means is this

107
00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:18.609
and value investors love this.

108
00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.517
We'll talk about value investors very soon.

109
00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:23.797
It basically means if you decide

110
00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.480
to close the company today,

111
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.897
and you sold every asset the company has,

112
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.275
like their buildings, their land, cars

113
00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.169
or machines or whatever it is,

114
00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.290
then this is what you would get for it per share.

115
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.421
In value investors, as I'll take about soon,

116
00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:43.613
love to buy companies that trade at a price

117
00:04:43.613 --> 00:04:47.363
divided by the book per share of one or less.

118
00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.721
And this is the dividend pay date

119
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:52.475
and this is important if you're an investor

120
00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:53.617
and you love dividends

121
00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:56.617
because sometimes you'll see a stock

122
00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:01.490
go down a little bit after they pay a dividend

123
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.310
and you'll understand why the stock went down

124
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.129
because shareholders over there

125
00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.869
just for the dividend selling the next day

126
00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:09.968
and so, the market is somewhat efficient

127
00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:11.797
with this, so for example,

128
00:05:11.797 --> 00:05:13.716
years ago, I think it was back in 2003,

129
00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:18.230
Microsoft issued a very special one-time massive dividend

130
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.706
and the stock gapped down

131
00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:24.653
the second that dividend was paid to shareholders

132
00:05:24.653 --> 00:05:26.871
and this is the dividend yield

133
00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:27.860
and what this means

134
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.777
is how much money you get per share

135
00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:35.813
relative to the price

136
00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:38.781
and so, value investors like Warren Buffet

137
00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:40.389
love to invest in companies

138
00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.133
that have high dividends,

139
00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.893
so GE for example, General Electric

140
00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:48.305
is the ticker or GE,

141
00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:50.705
there's a five and a half percent dividend yield

142
00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:54.557
so that means that for the stock you own,

143
00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:57.320
5.5% of the value of that stock

144
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.570
will be paid to you as a cash dividend.

145
00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:05.296
And you'll see of course the ETFs don't have

146
00:06:05.296 --> 00:06:06.977
these dividends here,

147
00:06:06.977 --> 00:06:09.421
and Facebook is growing very fast right now

148
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:10.649
so there's no dividend yet

149
00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:13.109
because investors want them to grow.

150
00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:15.197
Apple's growth has slowed

151
00:06:15.197 --> 00:06:16.081
and have so much cash

152
00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:17.341
which is a high-class problem they have,

153
00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:20.909
so they've started to issue a dividend

154
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.937
and this is Exon 3.6%.

155
00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:26.221
Exon usually trades based on what the price of oil is,

156
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:28.221
that's the stock driver.

157
00:06:29.137 --> 00:06:31.720
This is the dividend per share,

158
00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:35.022
this here is the price earnings ratio

159
00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:36.749
and we'll talk a lot about valuations soon

160
00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:40.289
but if you basically said that a price earnings ratio

161
00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.940
for a stock is 14 times

162
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.637
which is for Apple,

163
00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.614
then what that means is for every one dollar

164
00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:48.241
that Apple makes, investors are paying 14 times

165
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.069
that one dollar.

166
00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:51.737
Lower is better

167
00:06:51.737 --> 00:06:53.745
and Facebook is growing faster

168
00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:56.625
than Apple, so Facebook is actually in a trade

169
00:06:56.625 --> 00:07:00.389
at a higher priced earnings multiple.

170
00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.573
And we'll talk about this in more detail soon.

171
00:07:04.573 --> 00:07:06.360
This here's the peg ratio,

172
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.213
so basically you take what the price earnings is,

173
00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:12.301
divided by what the earnings growth rate is,

174
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:16.230
so for Facebook, Facebook is growing at close

175
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.571
to one times its earnings growth rate

176
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.869
which is attractive for many investors.

177
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:24.898
So, Facebook's drawing at maybe 26 or 25%

178
00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:28.798
earnings wise and the PE multiple is 27 times,

179
00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:31.081
so if you take 27 times divided by the growth rate

180
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.450
which is 25 or 26% or so,

181
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.929
then you basically get a price to earnings growth rate

182
00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:39.223
or a peg ratio of 1.1 times

183
00:07:39.223 --> 00:07:40.707
which is really, really attractive

184
00:07:40.707 --> 00:07:43.965
and people love to see this way under two times

185
00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:47.357
and that's mainly for growth investors

186
00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:49.289
and not value investors

187
00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:50.161
and we'll talk about the difference

188
00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:52.499
between growth and value very soon.

189
00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.409
Price to book we talked about that,

190
00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:59.326
so Apple is trading at 6.7 times price to book.

191
00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:01.852
That sort of thing.

192
00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:07.360
And then this is the PE ratio which we've talked about

193
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.394
and we've also got the forward PE ratio here

194
00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:13.014
which basically means

195
00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:15.701
what investors are expecting

196
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:17.009
the company to make earnings wise,

197
00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:18.673
so you take the price to stock today,

198
00:08:18.673 --> 00:08:21.629
divide it by what investors are expecting

199
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:22.621
for earnings next year,

200
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:24.569
so that's a forward-looking price earnings

201
00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.371
of 14 times and we love to look forward instead of backwards

202
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:30.865
but this is the trailing or historical

203
00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:32.341
meaning last year's earnings

204
00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:33.841
or most current year,

205
00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:36.685
so Apple is trading at 19 times

206
00:08:36.685 --> 00:08:39.147
the current year's earnings

207
00:08:39.147 --> 00:08:41.220
and 14 times next year's earnings

208
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.885
and this PE is lower

209
00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:44.443
because Apple is growing.

210
00:08:44.443 --> 00:08:47.050
Earnings will be higher in the next year

211
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.393
and this year is price to sales,

212
00:08:49.393 --> 00:08:51.672
it's the last thing I'll talk about for section A

213
00:08:51.672 --> 00:08:52.505
and then next lecture

214
00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:53.557
we'll talk about section B

215
00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:55.869
but price to sales basically is you take

216
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.757
the price of the stock

217
00:08:57.757 --> 00:08:59.590
divided by the revenue

218
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.432
and revenue and sales is the same thing

219
00:09:03.432 --> 00:09:07.932
and what happens is investors love to look at this

220
00:09:07.932 --> 00:09:10.722
if the company doesn't have earnings yet,

221
00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:12.630
so if it's a high-flying tech stock

222
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.090
like Snapchat or whatever,

223
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.051
investors cannot look at price to earnings

224
00:09:17.051 --> 00:09:20.139
because there is no price to earnings ratio yet

225
00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:23.490
because that company for example is not profitable yet

226
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.762
and so, they have to look at price

227
00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:27.808
to sales instead of price to earnings.

228
00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:30.538
And value investors don't care about this.

229
00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:32.802
So, we're done talking about section A.

230
00:09:32.802 --> 00:09:36.014
If you have any questions about the columns

231
00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:37.214
discussed in section A,

232
00:09:37.214 --> 00:09:38.877
please let me know

233
00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:39.806
and again, in the next lecture

234
00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:41.016
we'll talk about section B.

235
00:09:41.016 --> 00:09:41.849
Thank you.
