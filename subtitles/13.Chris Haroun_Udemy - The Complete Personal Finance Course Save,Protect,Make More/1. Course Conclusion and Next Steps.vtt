00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:14.410
or saving a little bit of money every day on a cup of coffee

by making it yourself at home

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.638

12
00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:33.149
and I sincerely hope that you now feel even more confident

18
00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.651
and they will teach you exactly how I made

19
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.535

20
00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.205

21
00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:02.405
or just learn some cool, new excel tricks

22
00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:04.660
that can help you with your excel

23
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.797
and business productivity skills.

24
00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:11.751
And I'm gonna assume that we have no experience in excel

25
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.549
while I explain how to create this spreadsheet.

26
00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.893
Lastly, the best way to ensure

27

28
00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:25.374
is not only to practice what we learned this course,

29
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:28.140
but more importantly to teach others,

30
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.567
especially within your family and your friends

31
00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.775
what you've learned because when one teaches two learn.

32
00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:37.025
Thanks again and God bless.
