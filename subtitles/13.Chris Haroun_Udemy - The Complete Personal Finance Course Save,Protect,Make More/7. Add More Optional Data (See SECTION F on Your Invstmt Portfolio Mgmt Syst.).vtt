00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.517
<v Narrator>Section F simply contains blank cells for you</v>

2
00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:08.203
if you wanted to enter in your own titles,

3
00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:10.463
your own calculations, et cetera, right.

4
00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:12.761
So there's 10 of these here

5
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:15.133
if you wanted to track other information

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.705
on any of the stocks, bonds, commodities,

7
00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:18.855
real estate investments, trusts, et cetera

8
00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.917
that you have in this dash board.

9
00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:22.735
Then I left this here for you

10
00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:25.485
so you can just add more details.
