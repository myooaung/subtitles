00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.901
<v ->Vanguard is great,</v>

2
00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.605
but there are other index funds out there

3
00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:05.243
worth checking out.

4
00:00:05.243 --> 00:00:08.360
One great example is iShares,

5
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.933
which is owned by Blackrock,

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.744
which has over one trillion,

7
00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.294
yes one trillion dollars invested

8
00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:15.294
in 800 ETFs.

9
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.354
So if we go to the iShares website here

10
00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:20.604
at iShares.com,

11
00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:24.553
we see many funds they offer.

12
00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:25.888
Okay for example,

13
00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:28.273
I invested in silver years ago

14
00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:30.822
using the iShares ETF

15
00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.693
and if we search here for silver,

16
00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:37.067
we see that ticker on the silver ETF here is SLV.

17
00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:37.962
Separately,

18
00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:40.253
let's check out what the fees are,

19
00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:42.714
which are called expense ratios.

20
00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:46.774
So for SLV it's .5% or half a percent

21
00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:50.074
which is a bit higher than I expected.

22
00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:51.961
So here's a documents

23
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.700
that I got from the Barclays iShares website,

24
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.583
which is a 12 page menu of their products

25
00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:02.750
and the fees are pretty low for many of their products here.

26
00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.280
And so please find attached this pdf.

27
00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:13.000
And the attachment is called iShares Product List.pdf

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.833
And if you can,

29
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:15.271
please open this right now,

30
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:17.082
so we can go through this together,

31
00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:20.434
if you can't open it and just keep watching thanks.

32
00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.514
So as you can see here on page number one,

33
00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:28.777
we pay only 0.04% per year

34
00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.860
to own the S&amp;P 500 Index.

35
00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.852
That's pretty cheap.

36
00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:34.987
And on the right side here we see that

37
00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:38.476
bond index fees are also quite low.

38
00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:40.890
And we're gonna cover bonds very very soon

39
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.591
and my personal favorite bond fund of theirs is called

40
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:46.591
the iShares TIP Bond ETF

41
00:01:47.653 --> 00:01:49.384
and the ticker is TIP,

42
00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:54.348
which stands for Treasury Inflation Protected security.

43
00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:55.181
Okay,

44
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.127
which basically allows you to invest

45
00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:00.238
without the worry of inflation.

46
00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:03.585
Okay and that's you can see it at the top of page 5

47
00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.748
is the TIP okay.

48
00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:07.599
So we'll talk about inflation later on.

49
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.392
Let's go back now to page number one.

50
00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.044
So we can look at international ETF.

51
00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:14.130
So this is not just a US subject course.

52
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.724
Okay and so here we have European,

53
00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:20.338
Pacific and Emerging Market and other stock market,

54
00:02:20.338 --> 00:02:23.018
stock markets to invest in at the bottom here

55
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.283
on left side of page one.

56
00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.696
And you can also see bond funds to invest in

57
00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.462
on the bottom right side here of page one.

58
00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:32.388
So let's take a look now

59
00:02:32.388 --> 00:02:36.138
at the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Market ETF,

60
00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:39.411
which has the ticker of IEMG.

61
00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:43.362
And my favorite free investment website

62
00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:45.765
is finance.yahoo.com.

63
00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:49.191
And so please go to finance.yahoo.com

64
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.308

65

Again that's finance.yahoo.com.

66
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:53.823
Okay.

67
00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:55.493
And once you're there,

68
00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:58.410
I want you to enter in ticker IEMG,

69
00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:00.705
okay and we're gonna go over

70
00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:04.873
what many of these dated items here mean very very soon.

71
00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:06.338
But I just wanna show you,

72
00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:08.878
how easy this to learn about stocks,

73
00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:10.779
bonds, commodities, etc,

74
00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:15.085
by just typing the tickers in finance.yahoo.com.

75
00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:16.612
And later on the course,

76
00:03:16.612 --> 00:03:17.811
what we're gonna do is we're gonna create

77
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:20.059
diversified investment portfolio

78
00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.675
to fit your financial needs and goals.

79
00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:25.043
So let's learn more about

80
00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:27.933
iShares Core MSCI Emerging Market ETF

81
00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:29.894
which is ticker IEMG now,

82
00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:32.008
on Yahoo Finance.

83
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:34.906
So let's click here on the holdings,

84
00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:38.239
to see what stocks are in this ETF fund.

85
00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.108
And here we can see what the top 10 stocks are

86
00:03:42.108 --> 00:03:44.104
in this ETF funds.

87
00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:46.484
Okay we have Alibaba,

88
00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:49.600
Samsung, China Mobile, Baidu,

89
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.248
and many more of these stocks as well.

90
00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:55.582
And you'll see that none of these stocks are more than 5%

91
00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:56.415
of this fund,

92
00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:59.523
which is great because it's diversified.

93
00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:02.550
And again we'll cover our diversification soon.

94
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.383
Now,

95
00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:05.799
if we want to learn about any of these stocks,

96
00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.505
of course we could just click on them for more details.

97
00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:11.510
And if you want actually,

98
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.154
pause me and go back to our

99
00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:17.822
12 page iShares ETF many pdf document,

100
00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:19.664
and enter in the tickers,

101
00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:22.393
from that pdf in the finance.yahoo.com

102
00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:26.531
to just learn more about each investments.

103
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:29.210
Okay we're done talking about iShares.

104
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.171
Now we now about two great ETF companies.

105
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.855
We got Vanguard and iShares.

106
00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:37.485
So let's talk about a third ETF company now called

107
00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:38.819
PowerShares,

108
00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.019
which is owned by Invesco.

109
00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.273
And their products are good,

110
00:04:43.273 --> 00:04:46.690
but some are a little bit more expensive.

111
00:04:47.527 --> 00:04:49.651
PowerShares has a very popular ETF

112
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:52.825
that represents the US technology stocks

113
00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:57.052
called the Qs by traders and the ticker is QQQ.

114
00:04:57.052 --> 00:05:01.505
And the Qs is an ETF for the Nasdaq stock market.

115
00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:02.895
And the top five positions

116
00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:05.645
or holdings in this QQQ index are

117
00:05:07.356 --> 00:05:10.182
Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,

118
00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:12.204
Facebook and Google,

119
00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:15.341
which is about 40% of this index.

120
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.154
And the Qs is the great way to invest in US tech stocks

121
00:05:19.154 --> 00:05:22.986
instead of buy one or two US larger cap tech stocks

122
00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:25.677
as indexes like this are less risky

123
00:05:25.677 --> 00:05:27.855
than just owning one or two stocks.

124
00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:29.897
And I'll go into lot more detail very soon

125
00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:32.980
on how to do research on stocks soon.

126
00:05:35.054 --> 00:05:37.453
Another ETF company that consider

127
00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:39.671
is State Street's Spiders.

128
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.367
Okay and you can go to

129
00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:45.428
us.spdrs.com/en if you want.

130
00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.318
And one that I've transacted in a lot

131
00:05:48.318 --> 00:05:52.640
is the SPY which is the ticker,

132
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.664
SPY which we called the spies

133
00:05:55.664 --> 00:05:58.664
and this is the ETF for the S&amp;P 500.

134
00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:00.727
Okay and so,

135
00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.737
if you want we can actually go to finance.yahoo.com,

136
00:06:03.737 --> 00:06:05.382
enter in SPY

137
00:06:05.382 --> 00:06:09.270
and we can learn more about this index.

138
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.980
And the fees here are quite low at .09%

139
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.976
and just try to find the lowest expense ratio

140
00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:19.688
whenever you can when you invest in ETFs.

141
00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:20.540
Lastly,

142
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.134
Schwab is the fifth largest ETF company.

143
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:27.009
And they've got some amazingly affordable ETF.

144
00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.874
And I actually met with Chuck Schwab recently

145
00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:32.568
at an education tech based charity event here

146
00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:33.989
in San Francisco,

147
00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:35.353
nicest guy ever.

148
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.387
He also lives here in the Bay Area.

149
00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:40.552
And he actually pioneered getting cheap access

150
00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:44.094
to investing in stocks many years ago for us.

151
00:06:44.094 --> 00:06:45.120
All of us that is.

152
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.481
And Schwab also offers fantastic ETFs.

153
00:06:48.481 --> 00:06:49.890
And he's actually getting much,

154
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.140
Schwab's getting much more,

155
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.569
the company's getting much more competitive with pricing.

156
00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.625
Lastly I wanna mention sector-specific ETFs now.

157
00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:01.649
Okay so just like how we talked about stock index

158
00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.329
and bond and commodity index

159
00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:06.719
or country-based ETFs,

160
00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.941
there's also many sector-specific ETFs

161
00:07:08.941 --> 00:07:12.832
that are cheap, liquid and easy to buy.

162
00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.131
Okay and

163
00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:16.557
that'll give you exposure to different sectors.

164
00:07:16.557 --> 00:07:17.537
For example,

165
00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:21.226
the OIH is the oil services index ETF

166
00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:24.233
offered by a company called VanEck.

167
00:07:24.233 --> 00:07:26.516
And if we go to finance.yahoo.com,

168
00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:29.427
and we type in OIH as a ticker,

169
00:07:29.427 --> 00:07:32.153
we can see what the largest positions are.

170
00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:33.861
And if we click on holdings here,

171
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:37.459
you can see that this oil services ETF contains

172
00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:39.851

which has the coolest ticker ever of RIG,

174
00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:44.714

176
00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.299
You'll also have Tenaris

177
00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:49.813
which is a great pipe company

178
00:07:49.813 --> 00:07:52.347
which is headquartered in Luxembourg.

179
00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:56.065
And there's also an oil ETF called the XLE,

180
00:07:56.065 --> 00:08:00.561
which contains Exxon and other oil companies.

181
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:04.068
There's also an XLF financial services index

182
00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:06.668
which has positions in financial services companies

183
00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:08.317

185
00:08:11.545 --> 00:08:13.210

186
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.544
are invest in real estate companies.

187
00:08:16.544 --> 00:08:18.794
And if you type in the EWZ,

188
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:23.841
it's a great ETF and a way to invest in Brazil.

189
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:24.674
I love it.

190
00:08:24.674 --> 00:08:25.507
Okay.

191
00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:27.264
Now according to Forbes,

192
00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:30.361
the largest five ETF companies in the US

193
00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:32.434
are shown right here.

194
00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:33.513
And it's,

195
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:34.900
we're gonna spend much more time

196
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.161
on picking investments from larger ETF companies

197
00:08:38.161 --> 00:08:40.190
as they have the cheaper prices.

198
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.847
And we know that every dollar we save on fees,

199
00:08:42.847 --> 00:08:45.604
can lead to much higher net worth for us,

200
00:08:45.604 --> 00:08:46.923
in the very very long run.

201
00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:48.263
Okay later in life.

202
00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:50.947
And I just want to offer a lot

203
00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.532

204
00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:57.598
as well as finance.yahoo.com concepts in these lessons.

205
00:08:57.598 --> 00:08:59.192

206
00:08:59.192 --> 00:09:03.810
top-down investment process on your radar screen right now.

207
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.265
And we're gonna drill down

208
00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:07.385
on many different types of investments

209
00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:08.815

210
00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:09.742
