<v ->Welcome to the first exercise of the course.</v>

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.655
Now per this video please open the exercise number one tab

3
00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:10.461
in your complete personal finance dashboard

4
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:13.554
and scroll down to complete the ten questions

5
00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:14.971
in this exercise.

6
00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.994
And as you can see I hid the answers

7
00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:21.564
so please click on this plus sign here

8

to see the answers.

9
00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:26.900
And after you've completed part or all of the questions,

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.695
please watch the next video which explains the answers.

11
00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.983
Use whatever currency you want to use as well please.

12
00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:37.667
And so I'm gonna use Swiss francs for this one.

13
00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.825
And so as of today,

14
00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:44.496
one Swiss franc is worth about the same as one US dollar.

15
00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:46.232
And you can always change the currency value here

16
00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:48.899
as you know in the settings tab.

17
00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:52.691
And as with all exercises in the course,

18
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:55.830
when you have completed it please click

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.742
the checkbox you see here.

20
00:00:57.742 --> 00:00:59.266
Okay?

21
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.563
Now have fun with this one.

22
00:01:00.563 --> 00:01:02.705
Play around with it.

23
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.875
And customize it for your current financial goals,

24
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.674
your spending patterns, et cetera.

25
00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:08.825
Enjoy. Thank you.
