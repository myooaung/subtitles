00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.771
- I was a beta tester for Microsoft

2
00:00:02.771 --> 00:00:05.918
and their Microsoft Money product back in the '90s,

3
00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:08.857
and I've also been using Quicken

4
00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:12.554
for more than 20 years as a consumer.

5
00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.362
And also while I was in the technology industry,

6
00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:18.086
I worked as a tech consultant at Accenture,

7
00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:20.267
Accidenture, no, no, Accenture

8
00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:22.500
and when (chuckles) I worked at Accenture,

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.547
I helped our client at the time,

10
00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:26.879
which was NationsBank, which is now part

11
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.835
of Bank of America, I helped Bank of America export

12
00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:35.788
bank-related files into the Quicken format in the '90s.

13
00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:38.463
Yes, I am that old, right, and so, separately,

14
00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:41.128
since I'm always careful about your security,

15
00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:42.690
if you wanna manage your expenses

16
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.021
with software, Quicken is the way to go.

17
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.245
I think it's secure if you run it only

18
00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:51.005
on your computer place, okay, so, I'm gonna show you

19
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.190
a demo of Quicken on a PC in this lesson, okay?

20
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.131
And if you're using a Mac, just skip to the next lesson

21
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:59.436
please, and before we chat about Quicken,

22
00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:01.421
a higher end version of Quicken that I use

23
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:04.173
and absolutely love is called QuickBooks

24
00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:07.581
and it's so awesome because I set it up

25
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.877
to do everything for me businesswise,

26
00:01:09.877 --> 00:01:13.301
including automatically importing all credit card statements

27
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:16.506
and bank account information, and QuickBooks

28
00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:21.080
is so awesome because it automatically pays my employees

29
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.291
and automatically sends all federal and state taxes

30
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.726
to the tax government agencies

31
00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:31.422
and it also automatically submits all payroll tax forms,

32
00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:35.160
et cetera, to the right government agencies.

33
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.939
And at the end of the year, my accountant

34
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.712
gets a copy of my secure QuickBooks file

35
00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:43.694
and then files my company's taxes.

36
00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:47.786
Now, I don't mind putting some of my business data

37
00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:50.893
on the internet but just not my personal stuff.

38
00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:53.893
And so in my hands here, I'm holding

39
00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:58.607
Quicken for Windows and then there's

40
00:01:58.607 --> 00:02:00.785
this Quicken for Mac here as well.

41
00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:03.710
If use the Mac only, again, skip this lecture

42
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.955
and I'm gonna go into much more detail

43
00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:09.739
on how to use this and so, here's a demo here

44
00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.127
of Quicken for Windows, okay, you can even track

45
00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:17.048
the value of your house if you live in certain places

46
00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:20.548
and if your house is listed on zillow.com.
