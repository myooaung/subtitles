1
00:00:00.677 --> 00:00:02.392
<v ->There's so many different websites that you can use</v>

2
00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:04.592
to manage and track your spending.

3
00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:08.517
I personally don't like putting any finance related

4
00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:12.394
or personal data in the Cloud as it can easily get stolen,

5
00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:15.784
no matter how secure your company says their information is.

6
00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:17.419
It doesn't matter, okay?

7
00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.643
And if you want to do this, if you wanna put stuff

8
00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:24.072
up in the Cloud, like on Dropbox, whatever, personal stuff,

9
00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:26.408
then just make sure your files are secure

10
00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:29.997
and set a password for any document that you send online

11
00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.599
to your accountant or others.

12
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.827
And so, if you wanna secure the Complete Personal Finance

13
00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:39.047
Dashboard Excel file, just click on this button here,

14
00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:41.538
called Secure This File, for information how to do so

15
00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:45.252
including how to set up a password per this feature here

16
00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:46.835
in the spreadsheet.

17
00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:51.922
Note, I don't include any macros or code

18
00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:54.048
in this Excel document.

19
00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:58.684
Some people think that macros are a security issue

20
00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:02.730
because it basically allows code to run on your computer,

21
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.442
which is a no no.

22
00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.034
And so, let me move on now.

23
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:09.389
Here's a couple apps that you can decide to use

24
00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:12.448
and if you want to, don't use your real name

25
00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:15.342
when you use these apps, entering information.

26
00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:20.326
Use a nickname instead, if you want and you're asked

27
00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:21.159
to put in your name.

28
00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.707
I always use the name Christopher (laughs)

29
00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:28.012
as my name and not Chris, when registering for anything

30
00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:29.193
not important to me.

31
00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:32.286
So when I get emails that use the word Christopher

32
00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:35.188
instead of Chris, I usually ignore them.

33
00:01:35.188 --> 00:01:37.926
Except from your mom, I love you mom.

34
00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.135
The first app we're gonna discus here

35
00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:43.647
is actually pretty cool and they also have a website,

36
00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:45.373
called Mint.com.

37
00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:49.540
And here you can track your expenses, find savings

38
00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:54.662
from your current spending patterns,

39
00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:58.617
and this is a reputable site too, because this product here

40
00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.464
is owned by Intuit, which I think

41
00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:03.358
is the best finance software company on the planet.

42
00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:06.782
And I prefer to track my expenses myself, in Excel,

43
00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:09.555
as you know, hence the Excel spreadsheet

44
00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:12.289
you're currently using for this course.

45
00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.077
Okay, next up here, we have a company called Expensify.

46
00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:18.963
And Expensify helps you track your expenses

47
00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:20.983
and create expense reports.

48
00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.739
Another one here is Concur, which is a company owned

49
00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.323
by SAP, that lets you track expenses and create

50
00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.971
expense reports as well.

51
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:33.836
Here we have one called MileIQ which is available

52
00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:36.330
on Android and iOS, and it basically helps you

53
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.731
kind of track your mileage.

54
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.462
Or what you can do is just click on the mileage tracking

55
00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:42.762
button here in the course, see here?

56
00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:47.377
And enter in the dates, the mileage to and from an event,

57
00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:51.590
the event category like charity, or work, or job search,

58
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.343
and then you can enter your comments as well.

59
00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:54.767
'Cause some of this stuff is tax deductible.

60
00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.656
You can ask your accountant about it.

61
00:02:56.656 --> 00:03:00.286
And so I set this up for you, this mileage thing.

62
00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:03.233
So you can, again, hit print if you want to

63
00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.990
and it's already print formatted for you.

64
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.734
Or you can Save As PDF or Print to PDF and send it

65
00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:08.567
to your account.

66
00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:09.776
Okay, move down.

67
00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:13.445
Other apps that people like that get good ratings,

68
00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:15.962
there's one called Credit Karma, it's a cool name.

69
00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:19.065
Credit Karma lets you improve your credit score.

70
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.273
And just please note that I'm gonna cover

71
00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:23.414
what a credit score is and how to improve it

72
00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:25.577
later in the course, in this lecture here.

73
00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:26.577
Okay, great.

74
00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:29.651
And then there's one called Albert (laughs),

75
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.363
Albert Money Managements.

76
00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.642
It's another app that helps you organize your finances.

77
00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:35.228
Then there's a couple more here.

78
00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:37.282
There's WiseBanyan, here.

79
00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:41.155
This is a financial advisor app that you can kind of

80
00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:42.866
play around too if you want to.

81
00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.802
And then just note that we're gonna cover investing

82
00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:48.742
in a lot of detail in part three of this course.

83
00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:50.982
And I hope you enjoy it because I've kind of,

84
00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:52.507
I've taught investing before, but I did this

85
00:03:52.507 --> 00:03:54.907
in a very unique, differentiated way.

86
00:03:54.907 --> 00:03:56.669
It should be fun, I think you'll enjoy it.

87
00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.661
Another one is called Clarity Money.

88
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.775
It's another popular one that can help you lower your bills.

89
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.577
And then there is one called Qapital, spelled Q-A-P-I-T-L,

90
00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.077
with a Q, Qapital.

91
00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:11.890
And it helps you save and meet your financial goals.

92
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.894
And then there's another one called Cover Insurance,

93
00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:15.743
which is a popular insurance app.

94
00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:18.271
We're gonna cover insurance in more detail later

95
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:20.674
in the course in this lecture here.

96
00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:23.363
And then there's another one called Accounts to Checkbook.

97
00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.767
That's pretty good reviews, actually, on this one.

98
00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:28.462
And then there's also a very highly rated app

99
00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:32.171
called Pennies, which has a really cool, simplistic

100
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.334
Airbnb type logo, less is more when it comes

101
00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:37.093
to logos interface.

102
00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:40.049
Okay, no more nerd talk for me, sorry.

103
00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.752
Shoebox is another cool one you can use

104
00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:45.982
for taking pictures and organizing your receipts.

105
00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:49.232
And the last two I wanna show you here,

106
00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:54.050
there's Quicken Mobile which, in the next two lessons,

107
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.165
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you how to use

108
00:04:57.165 --> 00:05:00.582
the desktop versions of Quicken on a Mac,

109
00:05:02.414 --> 00:05:04.246
this is Quicken on a Mac.

110
00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:07.712
And also, I'm gonna show you Quicken on Windows.

111
00:05:07.712 --> 00:05:10.526
And they're both a little bit different.

112
00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:11.912
So I'll go through these to you.

113
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.790
Obviously, you don't have to watch the next two lectures.

114
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.117
You can just watch one if you want or not at all.

115
00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:19.493
(chuckles) I actually had to buy,

116
00:05:19.493 --> 00:05:21.563
for I think it was $11, not bad on Amazon,

117
00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:25.724
a DVD player, 'cause computers don't ship with them anymore,

118
00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:27.794
or a CD player, so I could install these things

119
00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.627
and explain it to you.

120
00:05:31.058 --> 00:05:33.343
And so, if you're interested in running Quicken

121
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:36.320
on your computer, then just watch the next lecture,

122
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.388
next two lectures, if you're a Mac, skip the next lecture.

123
00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:41.629
If you're usin' Windows, just watch the next lecture.

124
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.729
And I actually like, and the reason I bought these things

125
00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.977
is because I wanna impress upon you how important it is,

126
00:05:48.977 --> 00:05:50.654
if you're gonna manage your finances,

127
00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:53.908
to do it on your computer and not in the Cloud.

128
00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:56.720
Hence why I bought this CD drive, to show you guys

129
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.482
how to do this.

130
00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:01.584
I prefer using my own spreadsheet.

131
00:06:01.584 --> 00:06:05.040
But if you wanna use Quicken, again, I'm providing a menu

132
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.854
for you guys that you can use whatever format

133
00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:09.773
or software application that you want to.

134
00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:11.482
And as always, please let me know if you have questions.

135
00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:12.315
Thanks.
