00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.667
<v ->Welcome to Exercise #15,</v>

2
00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.210
called "Is Your Money Safe?"

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.224
In this exercise, we're gonna compare the fees

4
00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:09.318
on the bank that you use,

5
00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:11.971
and also the deposit insurance policy

6
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.690
on the bank that you use versus other banks.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.211
So please go to exercise 15,

8
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.112
which is called, "Is Your Money Safe?"

9
00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:24.030
in your complete personal finance excel dashboard.

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.565
And what I want you to do please,

11
00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:27.472
is select five banks,

12
00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:30.621
including the bank that you currently use,

13
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.176
if you use one that is.

14
00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:34.899
And so, based on your country,

15
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.255
I entered in the five largest banks here for you,

16
00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:39.571
and you can click on them

17
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.498
to go to their website, if you want.

18
00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:44.659
Now, if you want to change the five banks

19
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.903
that I chose for you just

20
00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:49.357
click and type on top of

21
00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:53.515
each one of these five entries here for this video.

22
00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:56.170
And for this exercise, if you want,

23
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.626
we can look at the five banks

24
00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:01.153
based on the five largest ones in your country

25
00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:04.118
or the ones that are closest to where you live.

26
00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:04.986
Okay.

27
00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:07.555
For question #1, please enter in the name

28
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:11.196
of all five banks in the white boxes here.

29
00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.029
Okay.

30
00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:15.158
I'll leave that for you to update there

31
00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.460
if you wanted to.

32
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.212
And for question two, I want you to call

33
00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:21.337
all five of these banks, right?

34
00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:23.318
You can click on the website to get their contact details.

35
00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:25.652
I want you to call all five of these banks.

36
00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.702
And I want you to ask them the following questions

37
00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:30.121
and complete the following table here,

38
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.513
while you're speaking with them on the phone,

39
00:01:32.513 --> 00:01:33.839
or while talking to them in person

40
00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:36.719
at the bank which is what I prefer to do.

41
00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.141
Question #1.

42
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.304
It's about insurance.

43
00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:43.054
How much of my money, your money,

44
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.063
is insured by the government if you were to put

45
00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:50.322
your money into an account with your bank.

46
00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:51.737
You're asking the bank manager this,

47
00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:52.817
or somebody from the bank.

48
00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:55.291
Number two, interest rates.

49
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.102
If I were to put my money at your bank,

50
00:01:58.102 --> 00:02:00.262
and when I say I, I'm pretending I'm you

51
00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:01.978
talking to the bank manager.

52
00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:03.953
If I were to put my money at your bank,

53
00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:07.646
what is the interest rate I would earn on my money?

54
00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:10.265
Number three, withdrawal fees.

55
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.995
What are the fees to take money

56
00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:14.914
out of your bank using a bank machine?

57
00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:18.279
Number four, minimum balance fees.

58
00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.794
Is there a minimum balance that I must have

59
00:02:20.794 --> 00:02:23.163
in order to pay lower fees?

60
00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.734
Number five, bounced check fees.

61
00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:27.384
These are high sometimes.

62
00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:31.771
What is the fee if I accidentally bounce a check?

63
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.521
Number six, closing account fees.

64
00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.342
What is the charge if I decide to close my account?

65
00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:40.443
Seven, wiring fee.

66
00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.300
What is the fee to send a wire?

67
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.414
Number eight, monthly fee.

68
00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:47.150
What is the monthly fee to keep my money

69
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.947
in an account at your bank?

70
00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:51.825
Number nine, checking fee.

71
00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:54.563
What is the charge to write a check?

72
00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:58.203
Number 10, other bank machine fee, or other ATM fee.

73
00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:00.568
Is there a charge for your bank

74
00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:03.737
if I use someone else's bank machine,

75
00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.801
meaning do they charge me and do you charge me as well,

76
00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:09.019
just explain that to me please.

77
00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.267
Number 11, foreign transaction fee.

78
00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:12.923
Is there a fee that I must pay

79
00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:15.701
if I spend money in other countries?

80
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.951
12, other fees.

81
00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.265
What are all the other fees that

82
00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:23.366
I have not asked you about?

83
00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:24.419
Okay.

84
00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.004
Next step.

85
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:28.329
If you found a bank or a financial institution

86
00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.026
based on your research

87
00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.534
by asking these 12 questions,

88
00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:34.777
and if you feel that

89
00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:38.230
other bank is a safer place to put your money,

90
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.397
then I recommend considering switching banks, okay?

91
00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:48.306
But, don't do it without talking to your accountant

92
00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:51.325
if that money in your current bank account

93
00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:54.045
is in a retired, retirement tax shelter,

94
00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:55.421
because I don't want you to move

95
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.999
the money and then pay penalties, okay?

96
00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.095
And as a side note,

97
00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:03.068
if you don't already have an investment account,

98
00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:06.045
where you can buy stocks or index funds, securities,

99
00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.844
which we'll cover in part three of the course,

100
00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:10.322
then you can ask your bank,

101
00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.242
or the banks you are researching,

102
00:04:12.242 --> 00:04:15.515
if they have, or if they can recommend,

103
00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:18.204
investment accounts where you can

104
00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:22.023
buy financial instruments like stocks, bonds, et cetera.

105
00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:24.637
And again, we'll cover that in part three

106
00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:27.279
where we discuss making money.

107
00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.698
And separately,

108
00:04:28.698 --> 00:04:31.341
I just want you to please spend more time

109
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:33.197
reading your monthly bank statements

110
00:04:33.197 --> 00:04:36.487
that you either get in the mail or via e-mail,

111
00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:38.737
and if any fee seems higher

112
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.538
than you thought it should be,

113
00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:42.733
then, no matter what,

114
00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:44.098
please do this for me,

115
00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:46.477
please call the bank right away

116
00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:50.071
and ask them to cancel or lower that fee

117
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:51.541
and other fees as well.

118
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.241
And, you'll be absolutely,

119
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:55.693
you'll be amazed,

120
00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:58.573
how often they say "Yes!"

121
00:04:58.573 --> 00:04:59.778
Why?

122
00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:01.933
Because hardly anybody asks.

123
00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:03.074
But you will.

124
00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:05.002
And you will save money because of this.

125
00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:07.639
And all you have to do is ask and ask often.

126
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.943
And the same is true when you call your cable company,

127
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.575
or your phone company.

128
00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:13.303
You know, complain about the fees.

129
00:05:13.303 --> 00:05:14.855
And if you true them you're considering

130
00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:16.850
closing your account and using

131
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.940
a competitor that has lower fees,

132
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.489
and then ask them to lower their fees,

133
00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:23.794
and you'll be amazed at how much more often

134
00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:25.863
they say yes than no,

135
00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:28.178
and only because you did something nobody else does,

136
00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:30.322
or most people don't do, you ask.

137
00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:32.228
So after the crisis of 2008,

138
00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:36.615
banks are so paranoid about their reputations,

139
00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.535
and government scrutiny,

140
00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:39.549
and so again,

141
00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:40.977
please ask them,

142
00:05:40.977 --> 00:05:43.197
and all companies for lower fees.

143
00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:45.095
You got nothing to lose and everything to gain.

144
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.023
Separately,

145
00:05:46.023 --> 00:05:47.759
if you're a student,

146
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.333
try asking for higher grades,

147
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.416
or argue about the mark of your exam,

148
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:57.415
and I promise you that if you constantly do this,

149
00:05:57.415 --> 00:05:59.890
then your grades will go up by

150
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.514
an average of 5% in the long run, right?

151
00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:04.466
Just ask often, ask often.

152
00:06:04.466 --> 00:06:06.834
And, you know, you never get anything in life

153
00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.085
unless you ask and ask often.

154
00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:11.346
You'll never get a promotion unless you ask,

155
00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:13.136
you'll never get a raise unless you ask,

156
00:06:13.136 --> 00:06:15.364
so please ask often, thank you.
