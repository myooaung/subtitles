00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:01.254
<v Instructor>In Section E,</v>

2
00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:02.760
we're gonna cover your research,

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.920
meaning questions to ask yourself

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.920
about each investment in your portfolio.

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.211
And so what we're gonna do is

6
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:11.301
I've set this up...

7
00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:12.389
This was a lot of fun to make.

8
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.131
But I've set this up so you're just gonna click on each one

9
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:17.589
and then just select an answer yes, no,

10
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:18.464
or not applicable.

11
00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:22.075
And make sure that everything that you put in your portfolio

12
00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:23.309
has these, okay?

13
00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.400
You've done the research.

14
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.108
Yes, no, or not applicable.

15
00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:28.611
And there's a bunch of questions,

16
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.131
and then here you're actually going to

17
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.779
be able to write down,

18
00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:37.411
if you said no in any of these cells,

19
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.749
then write optional comments here

20
00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.029
on what you have to do or what you need to do

21
00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:46.343
to make sure that all the nos here turn into a yes,

22
00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:47.779
if applicable, right?

23
00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:48.760
And this is...

24
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.667
I did this because I don't want you to rely on the media

25
00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.515
or anybody else to pick your investments.

26
00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:55.938
I want you to do the research yourself.

27
00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:57.731
And I promise you if you do the research yourself

28
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:59.229
you'll be a better investor

29
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.106
because you'll be less likely to wanna sell it

30
00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:03.507
when it goes down.

31
00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.512
And remember Warren Buffett

32
00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:07.443
said that the New York Stock Exchange

33
00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:08.861
is the only store in the world

34
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:10.883
where consumers sell stuff when it goes on sale.

35
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:11.907
I don't want that to be you.

36
00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:14.141
I want you to be greedy when others are fearful

37
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.701
and vice versa.

38
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:16.981
Okay, great.

39
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:18.941
And then here all the way on the right is,

40
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:20.108
if applicable,

41
00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:24.552
this is the SEC filing, okay?

42
00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:27.333
So if the stock is on the S&amp;P 500,

43
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.664
then what you can do is

44
00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:34.003
you can go and look at the annual report online, okay?

45
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:37.104
And so the stocks that are in the S&amp;P 500

46
00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:38.883
are these ones here, okay?

47
00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:40.312
And in the United States

48
00:01:40.312 --> 00:01:41.419
and in all countries,

49
00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:45.272
there's usually a government website for the stock market,

50
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.105
right?

51
00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.992
Where companies have to file stuff like their annual report

52
00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:51.243
so everybody knows at the same time

53
00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.053
about material events that happen to a company.

54
00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.672
And so if we were to copy this, right?

55
00:01:56.672 --> 00:01:58.763
We'll just look up for Apple, you know,

56
00:01:58.763 --> 00:01:59.596
what is,

57
00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:01.933
just go to look at their annual report.

58
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:03.283
Now, before I go there,

59
00:02:03.283 --> 00:02:04.832
the annual report,

60
00:02:04.832 --> 00:02:05.665
in the United States, at least,

61
00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:07.748
is called the 10-k, okay?

62
00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:10.981
Great, so let's go here

63
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.112
and let's open a new window.

64
00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:15.945
Paste.

65
00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:20.763
Great, okay, cool.

66
00:02:20.763 --> 00:02:24.424
So you can see the 10-k down there for Apple, right?

67
00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:27.093
So what you can do is you click on Documents

68
00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:28.893
and the top one here, 10-k.

69
00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:29.963
It's not that intuitive,

70
00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:31.492
but there's a lot of cool info here.

71
00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:34.230
And you can read about Apple here, okay?

72
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.224
And this is, by law,

73
00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:38.952
you have to file this if you're a publicly traded company

74
00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:39.785
in the United States.

75
00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:43.952
So Apple has their year ending September 30th, right?

76
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.011
Instead of December 31st,

77
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.131
their year ends September 30th.

78
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.298
And this is the most recent annual report for Apple, okay?

79
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:57.849
So you can scroll through this

80
00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.091
and you can read everything you need to know about Apple.

81
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.800
And these are, these documents,

82
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.989
I know it looks dry,

83
00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.211
but they're actually amazing, amazing,

84
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.811
because it explains all the risks.

85
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.579
So if we clicked on Risks,

86
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.578
these are the risks for Apple, okay?

87
00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:20.339
And sometimes you might not wanna buy a stock

88
00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.811
because of some risks that you read here, okay?

89
00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:25.131
And I think that the United States

90
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:26.909
has more lawyers per capita

91
00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.749
than any country on the planet,

92
00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.029
so all the risks are listed here.

93
00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:31.862
Double-edged sword.

94
00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:34.509
I guess it's good sometimes.

95
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:35.509
Okay, great.

96
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.491
So if you want, scroll through this,

97
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.491
take a look,

98
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:43.120
and this will tell you everything you need to know

99
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.741
about Apple, right?

100
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.500
It's really, really interesting.

101
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.541
Okay, and even management, right?

102
00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:49.992
You're like, well, who's the CEO?

103
00:03:49.992 --> 00:03:52.013
Well, we know it's Cook, right?

104
00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:56.176
So, and you can just do a Control + F if you're using Chrome

105
00:03:56.176 --> 00:03:57.352
and do a search,

106
00:03:57.352 --> 00:03:58.683
I don't know, of Tim Cook.

107
00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:00.933
There he is there, right?

108
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:02.373
So, oh, look at this.

109
00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:04.573
So looks like Tim Cook sold some shares.

110
00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:05.904
Whatever, that sort of thing.

111
00:04:05.904 --> 00:04:06.737
That sort of thing.

112
00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:08.381
You can look through everything.

113
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.213
And we know what a 401(k) plan is.

114
00:04:11.213 --> 00:04:12.821
Remember we talked about the annual limits.

115
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.154
It's actually $18,500 for calendar 2018.

116
00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.295
It's interesting they mentioned that there.

117
00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:20.128
Okay.

118
00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:21.053
Anyway, look through this.

119
00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:22.622
If you have any questions about what you see

120
00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:23.782
in these annual reports, let me know.

121
00:04:23.782 --> 00:04:24.733
I love this stuff.

122
00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:25.974
And, oh, this is cool.

123
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:29.403
You actually can see where Apple's sales

124
00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.929
are not just revenue, right?

125
00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:33.243
Which is sales, same thing.

126
00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:34.942
But also the money they made,

127
00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:36.542
the operating income, right?

128
00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.353
And you can look at trends, as well, right?

129
00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:40.186
It's interesting.

130
00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:41.019
Look at this.

131
00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:44.089
So earnings actually are down year over year,

132
00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:47.848
or I should say are down from 2015 until this year

133
00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:49.329
in the Americas.

134
00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:52.269
You know, and the Americas is North and South America.

135
00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:54.294
And then Europe,

136
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.900
you've got here, there's,

137
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.849
it's, you know, decent growth,

138
00:04:58.849 --> 00:04:59.682
but it went down, as well.

139
00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:01.340
That's interesting, huh.

140
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.329
China, as well.

141
00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:04.071
Japan, rinse, lather, repeat.

142
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.249
You get the idea.

143
00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:06.082
Okay, we can go back.

144
00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:07.169
Sorry if I went off topic there,

145
00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.367
but I thought that was interesting to mention.

146
00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:11.950
All right, next up,

147
00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:13.991
we're gonna go back here

148
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.619
and go through each one of these in order.

149
00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:19.028
Okay, so the first question is here.

150
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:21.197
If this is an ETF, right,

151
00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:22.030
exchange traded fund,

152
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.019
did you get a really low fee,

153
00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:27.101
meaning hopefully under .5%,

154
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:30.118
and do you understand if there are hidden fees?

155
00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:30.951
And if you don't,

156
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:32.505
then call the company and ask them.

157
00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:34.026
The ETF company, that is.

158
00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:35.718
Vanguard or whoever it is.

159
00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:39.356
And just ask a rep on the phone to explain to you,

160
00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:40.636
you know, if there are hidden fees,

161
00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:43.257
and just so you can understand the fee structure, right?

162
00:05:43.257 --> 00:05:45.274
So let's say yes.

163
00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:46.716
Yes, if it's...

164
00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:47.886
Actually, it's not applicable,

165
00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:48.974
'cause that's Apple.

166
00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.697
So this is an ETF here,

167
00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:52.469
and the answer is yes.

168
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:53.473
Okay, great.

169
00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:54.306
Next one.

170
00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:56.225
If this is a stock,

171
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.544
did you try the product or service?

172
00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:00.461
Yeah, I have an iPhone.

173
00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:03.778
Facebook, yeah, I use it.

174
00:06:03.778 --> 00:06:05.076
I understand it.

175
00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:07.817
GE, I guess I have a couple appliances.

176
00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:09.485
I sort of understand it.

177
00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:10.818
So I'll put yes.

178
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.126
IBM, I don't really,

179
00:06:14.126 --> 00:06:16.155
I don't know much about IBM anymore.

180
00:06:16.155 --> 00:06:17.686
It used to be a PC company.

181
00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:19.654
Now it's a software and services company.

182
00:06:19.654 --> 00:06:22.355
So I would enter no or not applicable, whatever.

183
00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:23.534
I think you get the idea, okay?

184
00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:24.367
Moving on.

185
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.364
If this is a stock,

186
00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:29.085
are you comfortable with the valuation?

187
00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:30.515
Is the PE too high or too low?

188
00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.977
Right, and so you can look through it and say yes, no,

189
00:06:32.977 --> 00:06:34.225
or whatever, okay?

190
00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:37.065
And this explains the difference between value investors

191
00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:38.326
and growth investors,

192
00:06:38.326 --> 00:06:40.617
and we'll cover that in more detail in the next section

193
00:06:40.617 --> 00:06:41.844
when we discuss valuation, okay?

194
00:06:41.844 --> 00:06:43.489
All right, moving on.

195
00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:46.395
Is this investment in your retirement account,

196
00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:47.958
right, if applicable?

197
00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.804
And you're like, shoot,

198
00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:51.678
I forgot to add Apple to my retirement account.

199
00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:53.126
I don't wanna pay taxes on Apple.

200
00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:54.028
Let me move it.

201
00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:55.566
Right, that sort of thing.

202
00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:56.838
And then here,

203
00:06:56.838 --> 00:07:00.588
did you read the prospectus on this ETF,

204
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:01.486
if it's an ETF,

205
00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:03.937
or did you read the annual report if it's a stock?

206
00:07:03.937 --> 00:07:04.770
And we did, remember?

207
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.646
We went over here

208
00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:08.132
and we read the annual report.

209
00:07:08.132 --> 00:07:10.452
Of course, spend more time than I have here on it,

210
00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:11.748
but anyway, it's pretty neat.

211
00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:13.006
So I can write yes.

212
00:07:13.006 --> 00:07:13.937
And then right here,

213
00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:16.987
for whatever I entered no to, right?

214
00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:18.017
Which is, I didn't,

215
00:07:18.017 --> 00:07:18.988
but let's just say I,

216
00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:20.988
say this here was no.

217
00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:23.306
I did not read the annual report, right?

218
00:07:23.306 --> 00:07:24.737
Then I would go here and I would say,

219
00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:27.946
well, why don't we turn this into a yes, okay?

220
00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:28.779
To do,

221
00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:34.016
read Apple annual report on sec.gov.

222
00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:38.671
Okay.

223
00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:41.100
Okay.

224
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.438
And if it's a foreign stock,

225
00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:47.997
you can go to the stock market exchange website

226
00:07:47.997 --> 00:07:50.697
and find the annual reports linked to there,

227
00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:53.969
or just go to the website of the company itself

228
00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.318
and do a search on investor relations, okay?

229
00:07:56.318 --> 00:07:58.667
So let me do an example of this, actually.

230
00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:02.214
Let's say that we're investing in Petrobras,

231
00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:05.547
which is an awesome Brazilian energy company.

232
00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:06.380
Patrobras.

233
00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:11.388
Okay.

234
00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:12.496
Ooh, all right.

235
00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:16.163
And let's do a search on investor relations.

236
00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:21.606
Okay, there it is.

237
00:08:21.606 --> 00:08:22.915
So Petrobras,

238
00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:24.495
and it knows I'm English,

239
00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:25.936
so I guess it kind of defaulted there

240
00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:28.486
'cause I didn't do a search on the Portuguese one.

241
00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:30.496
Okay, so investor relations.

242
00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:33.645
And every big company has an investor relations website,

243
00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:34.594
which is awesome.

244
00:08:34.594 --> 00:08:36.606
And you can go here

245
00:08:36.606 --> 00:08:39.606
and learn more about Petrobras here.

246
00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:44.452
And we see here that there's a bunch of different stocks

247
00:08:44.452 --> 00:08:46.824
for Petrobras globally.

248
00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:47.904
So this is PBR,

249
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:51.752
which means it's Petrobras on the New York Stock Exchange.

250
00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:54.264
And these are the local tickers

251
00:08:54.264 --> 00:08:57.011
on the, in Brazil, right?

252
00:08:57.011 --> 00:08:58.112
So PBR.

253
00:08:58.112 --> 00:08:59.483
And to double-check that,

254
00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:02.264
we can open up a new tab here,

255
00:09:02.264 --> 00:09:03.853
go to finance.yahoo.com,

256
00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:05.762
and enter in the ticker for Petrobras,

257
00:09:05.762 --> 00:09:07.512
which we know is PBR.

258
00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:10.671
It's in the game.

259
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:11.671
There we go.

260
00:09:12.849 --> 00:09:14.140
Petrobras.

261
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:14.973
Oh, I didn't know that.

262
00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:15.806
Petroleo Brasil.

263
00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.071
That's how it's, huh.

264
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:17.904
I had no idea

265
00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:19.399
that's how they came up with the name Petrobras.

266
00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.232
Pretty neat.

267
00:09:20.232 --> 00:09:21.065
Okay.

268
00:09:21.065 --> 00:09:23.812
So, and you can go through and read about the company here.

269
00:09:23.812 --> 00:09:25.132
Wow, look at the beta.

270
00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:27.230
That's a hot, that's a risky stock.

271
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.103
Wow.

272
00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:30.111
That means the stock has been very volatile

273
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.052
relative to the market in the recent past.

274
00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:35.612
Okay, there's no dividend here,

275
00:09:35.612 --> 00:09:37.850
at least on this one here,

276
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.172
the Petrobras one that's listed

277
00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:40.930
on the New York Stock Exchange.

278
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.763
Okay.

279
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:46.553
And all this data is in your spreadsheet.

280
00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:47.386
Except for beta.

281
00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.521
I don't know why I didn't pull that in yet.

282
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:50.931
If and when they make that change,

283
00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:53.193
I'll update the spreadsheet for you, okay?

284
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.443
You can look at the charts.

285
00:09:56.412 --> 00:09:59.833
Anyway, you can map it over time, whatever.

286
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:03.361
I don't know if that means statistics.

287
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:04.521
Financials.

288
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:07.961
And when you look at stuff on Yahoo Finance,

289
00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:09.271
if you ever scroll down

290
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:12.481
and you see a story written about a company,

291
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:14.292
if it says sponsored story,

292
00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:15.900
please don't read it, okay?

293
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.303
Because they might be trying to influence you, okay?

294
00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:19.721
And these are options, right?

295
00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:24.063
So basically you can buy a contract called a call

296
00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:27.321
that will pay you a fortune over time

297
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:29.241
if the stock goes up a lot.

298
00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:32.199
Otherwise you'll lose all of it, okay?

299
00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.580
And a straddle is basically when you own

300
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.500
an option for the stock to go up and down.

301
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.089
So you're kind of protected on both sides, okay?

302
00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:40.399
I'm not gonna go into detail there.

303
00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.151
I don't want you to buy options, please.

304
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:43.049
Thank you.

305
00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:45.871
Okay, so you can look at who are the holders.

306
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:47.704
So who owns the stock?

307
00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:51.718
It's, you can see that

308
00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:54.533
the biggest shareholder is Capital World Investors,

309
00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:58.348
and they own about 6% of the company.

310
00:10:58.348 --> 00:11:01.009
And then Wellington, which is in Boston.

311
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:02.871
You get the idea, okay?

312
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.900
And you can just scroll down,

313
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.700
learn more about the company, as well.

314
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.579
And if you have any questions on this stuff, let me know.

315
00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:08.961
I used to actually focus a lot of time

316
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:10.794
on Brazilian equities,

317
00:11:11.828 --> 00:11:13.569
so I enjoy the sector.

318
00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:15.209
I like the market a lot, too.

319
00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:17.292
Okay, let's go back here.

320
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.388
And I think we're done.

321
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.249
We're done, right?

322
00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:24.118
And again, if you cannot find the annual report

323
00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:26.860
on sec.gov because the company's not listed

324
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.708
in the United States,

325
00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:30.047
you can always do a search on that company's name

326
00:11:30.047 --> 00:11:32.148
plus investor relations,

327
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:34.220
because every company that's big

328
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.175
and publicly traded has investor relations.

329
00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:39.217
So let me just do one more really quick here, okay?

330
00:11:39.217 --> 00:11:41.279
So let me open up a new tab here.

331
00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:44.862
And let's look at Baidu investor relations.

332
00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:49.234
Here it is here.

333
00:11:49.234 --> 00:11:50.759
And you can click on it

334
00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:53.538
and you can get access to just a ton of information

335
00:11:53.538 --> 00:11:54.903
on Baidu.

336
00:11:54.903 --> 00:11:57.791
And there's an awesome law which is

337
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:00.525
any company that's listed on American markets,

338
00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:03.327
they have to disclose all information to all investors

339
00:12:03.327 --> 00:12:04.177
at the same time.

340
00:12:04.177 --> 00:12:06.567
So those big mutual funds don't have the advantage

341
00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:07.639
over us anymore.

342
00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:10.887
Maybe that's why they underperform so much.

343
00:12:10.887 --> 00:12:12.748
Anyway, so you can go here,

344
00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:15.415
and if there's an earnings call,

345
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.968
you can actually listen to it.

346
00:12:17.968 --> 00:12:19.900
And they do a lot of a...

347
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.678
A lot of webcasts, right?

348
00:12:22.678 --> 00:12:23.809
At investor events.

349
00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.628
So you can actually watch those events, as well.

350
00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:28.660
You can add these to your calendar,

351
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.528
the next IR events,

352
00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:30.788
that sort of thing.

353
00:12:30.788 --> 00:12:32.508
It's pretty cool, pretty cool.

354
00:12:32.508 --> 00:12:34.089
Anyway, if you have a question about this,

355
00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:34.922
please let me know.

356
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:39.089
Otherwise we are done with the stock research section here,

357
00:12:40.908 --> 00:12:44.271
and next up we'll talk about the optional section.
