00:00:00.995 --> 00:00:02.883
<v ->Even if your country or company</v>

2
00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:04.876
offers healthcare insurance,

3
00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:07.757
it doesn't mean everything is covered, okay,

4
00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.549
in many situations.

5
00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.355
Dental, for example, might not be covered

6
00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.575
as it's thought of as cosmetic.

7
00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:17.783
And when I lived in Canada, I remember,

8
00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.048
dental insurance I had to get separately.

9
00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:22.616
Health insurance was paid for by the government,

10
00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:26.221
which is awesome, but dental was not.

11
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.822
Now, your company that you work for

12
00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:31.533
might already have discounted dental plans available,

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.336
so always just ask them

14
00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.352
what insurance benefits they offer.

15
00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.327
And just find out if the company that you work for

16
00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:41.174
has a group policy, which is the most common

17
00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.917
healthcare insurance policy.

18
00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:46.264
Since the policy covers many people,

19
00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:48.251
the price can be much lower.

20
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:51.443
It's kinda of a perk for working at a big company sometimes.

21
00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:53.011
Although I hate the bureaucracy there.

22
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.012
That's just me.

23
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.965
Okay, also before spending money

24
00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:59.869
on your kids' or spouse's dental or eye care,

25
00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.408
see if your company already has vision

26
00:01:02.408 --> 00:01:05.267
and dental care programs included for the whole family.

27
00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:08.264
Like Christine, my wife, works for a big tech company,

28
00:01:08.264 --> 00:01:11.677
and they cover vision and dental for the whole family

29
00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:13.107
so I don't have to pay that from my company,

30
00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.675
which is cool.

31
00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.949
And if you cannot be part of a group policy,

32
00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:19.644
then do a lot of price shopping

33
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:23.048
for a policy that covers your family,

34
00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:26.205
and speak to at least five different healthcare insurers

35
00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:29.256
as you search online for the best policy for you.

36
00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.353
Prices and options vary dramatically.
