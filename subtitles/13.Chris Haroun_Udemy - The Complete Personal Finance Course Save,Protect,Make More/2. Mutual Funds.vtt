00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.736
<v ->We already know that 95% of all mutual funds</v>

2
00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:07.297
underperform the indexes, like the S&amp;P 500.

3
00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:10.185
Although I don't recommend buying mutual funds

4
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:11.913
because of the rip-off fees,

5
00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:14.863
I have to dedicate a lesson to it, okay.

6
00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:16.855
And by the way, Warren Buffet also says

7
00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:20.533
to buy indexes instead of mutual funds,

8
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.172
and so although I'm not a fan of mutual funds,

9
00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:24.715
I need to give you the full menu

10
00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:26.861
of financial products in this course,

11
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.599
in order to be intellectually honest and objective, as well.

12
00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.190
Now, when it comes to mutual funds,

13
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.456
just like how there were ETFs of all types of investments,

14
00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:40.109
the same can be said for mutual funds.

15
00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.334
Now there are mutual funds that are focused on small stocks,

16
00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:45.352
mutual funds that are focused on big stocks,

17
00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:46.573
mutual funds that are focused

18
00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:49.513
on certain country markets, et cetera,

19
00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:51.733
and if you want to look at examples,

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.582
then using the Yahoo Finance website.

21
00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:58.219
Remember when we researched for ETFs in stock plans before,

22
00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.665
let's do the same thing for mutual funds.

23
00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.440
Okay, so type in the name of the mutual fund,

24
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.496
and pick the ticker, just like

25
00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:07.706
what we did again with stocks,

26
00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:09.735
and what you can do is if you want

27
00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.344
you can add these mutual funds

28
00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:14.025
to your investment portfolio management system as well.

29
00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:15.320
I don't recommend doing it,

30
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.984
but if you already own mutual funds,

31
00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.464
that's your call, I'm trying to be objective.

32
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.946
Okay, so for example, and I'm not picking

33
00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:24.169
on this particular mutual fund company,

34
00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:25.904
as it might be part of the 5%

35
00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:29.269
that outperforms the 95% that underperform,

36
00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:31.489
but if we pull up a ticker and search

37
00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:34.599
for the mutual fund named Fidelity, all right,

38
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.129
which is a massive Boston-based mutual fund company.

39
00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.457
If we search for the word Fidelity,

40
00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:43.721
then we can select whatever fund you want,

41
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:45.272
mutual fund, that is, and add it

42
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.750
to your investment portfolio management system,

43
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.856
as part of your portfolio.

44
00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:53.161
Or in the Watch List section below your portfolio,

45
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.340
in case you wanted to just watch an investment

46
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.257
before adding it to your portfolio.

47
00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:02.747
Now, a load fund means a fund

48
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.551
that has more fees as it's sold

49
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.384
by a middle man, okay,

50
00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:09.435
and not directly from wholesale,

51
00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:11.279
not directly from the source, right,

52
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.612
kind of like when you go to a store,

53
00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.852
you're paying a higher fee than if you went

54
00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:18.060
right to the source to buy a product, okay.

55
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.705
So, if you buy it right from the mutual fund,

56
00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:23.705
then you usually don't pay that fee,

57
00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:27.769
which in this case, those are called

58
00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.436
no-load funds, okay.

59
00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:33.170
We can remember this as it's a load

60
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.365
of rip-off fees (laughs), so we buy wholesale

61
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.564
and not retail, as we don't like to pay

62
00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:41.280
mark-up fees in this course.

63
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280
Okay, great.

64
00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:46.124
Mutual funds are not just for stocks.

65
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:49.792
There's also bond-based mutual funds, okay.

66
00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:53.815
I only want you to buy index funds, meaning ETFs,

67
00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:57.949
and we're done with stocks for now in this course,

68
00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.882
and as always, just please let me know if you have

69
00:03:00.882 --> 00:03:03.838
any questions about stocks as I've been investing

70
00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:07.474
in stocks as a retail investor and professional investor

71
00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:10.115
on Wall Street for most of my life,

72
00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:13.217
and just as a Side Note lecture,

73
00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:16.454
next step on Warren Buffet, there's a lecture I have

74
00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:19.622
on his favorite investment types,

75
00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:23.294
and then after you're done that next Side Notes,

76
00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:25.141
what we're going to do is we're going to talk

77
00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:28.490
about the fascinating world of bonds and interest rates,

78
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.061
and you know, we still have to discuss

79
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:33.222
a few more investment classes before even

80
00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:35.733
talking about investment diversification,

81
00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:38.619
meaning how you should consider investing

82
00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.773
parts of your net worth, meaning what percent

83
00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:44.870
in these types of investment versus these types,

84
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.608
and as always, if you have any questions,

85
00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:47.566
please let me know.

86
00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:48.399
Thank you.
