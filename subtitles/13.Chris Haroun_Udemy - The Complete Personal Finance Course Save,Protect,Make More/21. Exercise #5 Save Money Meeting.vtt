00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.927
<v ->In this exercise, please setup</v>

2
00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:05.931
at least one meeting with someone that you know

3
00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:09.171
that is a successful saver, meaning a friend

4
00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:12.582
or a relative or a mentor or someone at work

5
00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:15.555
that is great at saving money.

6
00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.147
And in hind sight, I wish I did this

7
00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:20.998
with my grandfather, God bless him,

8
00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:23.360
as he figured out how to live well

9
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.787
based on only an annual $9,000 pension

10
00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:28.889
in Canada that he lived on

11
00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:32.606
for the last four years of his life.

12
00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:34.896
When you setup this meeting, I want you to ask

13
00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:39.534
for five pieces of advice on how to save money.

14
00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:40.927
And then what I want you to do

15
00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:42.698
is to open up your complete

16
00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:45.463
personal finance dashboard Excel documents

17
00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:47.436
and complete exercise number five here

18
00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:50.366
called save money meeting.

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.710
And per this video here of this spreadsheet,

20
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.110
simply enter in the five pieces of advice

21
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.866
that they gave you, and then comment

22
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:03.762
on how you can potentially adopt this strategy.

23
00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:07.251
And, if you can, and if you're very determined

24
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:10.259
to save a lot, then setup more meetings,

25
00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.070
not just one.

26
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.094
And lastly, when you meet with this person,

27
00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:17.927
ask them about tax savings as well

28
00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:21.815
in the country that you live in.

29
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.513
And, if you learn great money savings advice

30
00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:27.241
from these people that you meet with,

31
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.822
that is not discussed in this course,

32
00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.589
then please, please, please, please

33
00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:33.574
go back to exercise number three

34
00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:36.936
and update your new and improved income statement

35
00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:39.528
based on their money saving tips.

36
00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:40.361
Thank you.
