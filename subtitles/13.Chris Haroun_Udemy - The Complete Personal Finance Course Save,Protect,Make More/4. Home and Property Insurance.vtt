1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.824
<v ->Home and property insurance is referred to often</v>

2
00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:07.533
as homeowner's insurance, which protects you against

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.401
natural disasters, fires, burglaries, etc.

4
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:14.486
Now if you get a mortgage, many mortgage companies

5
00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.973
require you to have homeowner's insurance.

6
00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.331
I recommend getting it, of course.

7
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:21.896
We're going to talk about mortgages

8
00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.121
and investing in real estate in part three of the course.

9
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:30.102
Now many things impact the cost of home insurance.

10
00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:32.456
For example, location.

11
00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.802
If you're near a place where natural disasters

12
00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.912
occur more frequently,

13
00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.311
and the way the house was built

14
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:41.687
really impacts insurance prices.

15
00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:46.579
Brick-based houses are cheaper to insure than wooden ones.

16
00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.691
Of course the value of the house

17
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:52.096
and the contents in the house or the apartment you live in

18
00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:54.727
impacts the insurance price as well.

19
00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:59.056
I recommend having deductible-based homeowner's insurance,

20
00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:03.229
which means you have to pay the first couple hundred dollars

21
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.877
out of pocket, so if something happens you got to pay

22
00:01:07.877 --> 00:01:10.786
a little bit out of pocket first.

23
00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:13.968
The reason I say that is because if you have a deductible

24
00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.247
your insurance is usually pretty cheap to finance,

25
00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:18.756
to pay for monthly.

26
00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:21.459
Before getting insurance on your house or apartment,

27
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.818
just ask the insurance company what you can do

28
00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.971
to lower the cost of the policy,

29
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:30.705
like installing smoke or burglar alarms, etc.,

30
00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:33.333
on the ceilings and at the doors, which I have.

31
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.276
Just as a quick side note,

32
00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:38.359
and this is really worth reinforcing,

33
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:45.401
I have these really affordable extinguishers

34
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:47.328
in almost every single room.

35
00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:50.411
My kids know exactly how to use them.

36
00:01:52.116 --> 00:01:56.283
I find that the bigger one, of course I have these too,

37
00:01:57.507 --> 00:01:59.315
the kids, if they panic, they might not know

38
00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:01.315
how to use one of these,

39
00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:05.217
but they know how to use these since you fire it at ...

40
00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.689
Anyway, you get the idea.

41
00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.776
As Andy Grove, the late great CEO of Intel,

42
00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:12.982
only the paranoid survive.

43
00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:17.487
Separately, shop around a lot for homeowner's insurance,

44
00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:21.246
of course just like we did with the bank account exercise.

45
00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:25.934
Now homeowner's insurance usually covers three things.

46
00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:29.273
The first thing is stuff in the house that you own

47
00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:32.153
in case of theft or damage.

48
00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:36.320
This covers you in many cases if you are on vacation,

49
00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.175
covers you if you're on vacation as well,

50
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.904
and your stuff, your luggage is stolen.

51
00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:44.058
Also, ask your credit card company,

52
00:02:44.058 --> 00:02:47.514
if when you book travel using their cards,

53
00:02:47.514 --> 00:02:50.724
if luggage is insured because

54
00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:52.966
you already have that credit card.

55
00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:55.146
All right, cool, don't buy travel insurance

56
00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.508
without first finding out if your homeowner's insurance

57
00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:59.804
already covers travel, or if your credit cards

58
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.757
already cover that, travel insurance.

59
00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:04.200
Trying to save you money.

60
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.055
The second thing homeowner's insurance covers

61
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:10.204
is the structure of the house,

62
00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:12.972
meaning stuff that can easily be impacted

63
00:03:12.972 --> 00:03:14.722
by fires and weather.

64
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.260
Earthquake and flooding insurance

65
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.632
are often not included as you need to get

66
00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:25.459
another type of insurance plan for earthquake or flooding,

67
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.190
but they're included in some homeowner's insurance policies.

68
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.658
Always remember to ask, please.

69
00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:35.741
The third thing that homeowner's insurance covers

70
00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:40.061
is liabilities like your kids have

71
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.161
a friend over that is at your house

72
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:44.798
and falls down, etc.

73
00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:47.779
If you own a trampoline, for example,

74
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:50.028
or a swimming pool in your backyard,

75
00:03:50.028 --> 00:03:52.538
you could end up paying more in insurance as well.

76
00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:55.362
Now get a policy that covers the cost

77
00:03:55.362 --> 00:03:58.684
to rebuild your house and replace your stuff

78
00:03:58.684 --> 00:04:00.977
if you have to rebuild.

79
00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:02.811
The policy should cover the cost

80
00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.483
to rent another house as well.

81
00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:09.950
Just lastly, these companies have mobile products

82
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.099
for home inventory calculations.

83
00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.947
I've got them listed here and you can actually

84
00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:18.450
click on them as well in the resources section.

85
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.920
I used to buy earthquake insurance here in California

86
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.687
but I decided to stop doing this

87
00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:26.986
as my homeowner's insurance kind of covered part of this.

88
00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:29.032
Insurance salespeople are really crafty

89
00:04:29.032 --> 00:04:33.683
and you can get insurance for just about anything really,

90
00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:37.433
including meteor insurance in some countries.

91
00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:40.784
Anyway, I recommend sticking

92
00:04:40.784 --> 00:04:43.148
with four types of insurance products

93
00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:44.078
that we discussed in this section.

94
00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:44.911
Thank you.
