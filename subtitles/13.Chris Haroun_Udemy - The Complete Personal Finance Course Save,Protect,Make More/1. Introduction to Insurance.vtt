00:00:00.696 --> 00:00:02.256
<v ->This quote cracked me up.</v>

2
00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:03.756
You can get up to a million dollars

3
00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:07.328
or more in life insurance in case you die,

4
00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:10.320
but you can only get about seven or eight dollars per hour

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.388
to live.

6
00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:13.555
So, anyway, kind of funny.

7
00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:15.812
Once you start a family

8
00:00:15.812 --> 00:00:18.164
and start acquiring items like a house,

9
00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:20.144
a car, and other items,

10
00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:23.192
getting insurance is a great way to protect your family

11
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:25.658
and your family's standard of living too.

12
00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:30.504
So before spending unnecessary money on insurance products,

13
00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:33.410
what I want you to do is to please check to see

14
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.132
if the company or place where you work for or at,

15
00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:42.028
if applicable, has any insurance benefits for you already.

16
00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:44.643
Also, I want you to check to see if your credit card company

17
00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:48.977
also has benefits for you, like free auto rental insurance

18
00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:51.276
when you pay with certain credit cards.

19
00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:53.007
Because I don't want you to pay twice.

20
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.494
And so when it comes to the company that you work for,

21
00:00:56.494 --> 00:01:00.370
quite often, they provide some insurance because

22
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.226
group insurance plans are cheaper than

23
00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.166
individual insurance plans.

24
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.576
For example,

25
00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:10.576
many companies give you dental or eye insurance,

26
00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:15.107
or subsidize your health insurance.

27
00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.607
And so please ask human resources

28
00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:20.749
or your boss about this if applicable.

29
00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.558
And of course, your companies do this, they want to be nice

30
00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:24.936
and keep you happy and everything.

31
00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.706
They get tax breaks too, I'm sure, for doing this.

32
00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:30.802
And so many companies already have life insurance for you

33
00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:34.864
in the form of one to a few times your salary.

34
00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:38.777
So ask HR or human resources, if applicable,

35
00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:41.800
if they have this in place for you already.

36
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.970
Now, in exercise number nine question number two shown here,

37
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.394
we calculated that you should have ten years worth

38
00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:52.960
of annual expenses available to your family

39
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.458
if you, God forbid, pass away.

40
00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:57.992
Now, if your company provides

41
00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:01.850
one, two, or three years of life insurance benefits, then

42
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.558
consider buying an additional seven or so years

43
00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.772
so that your family has about 10 years worth of insurance.

44
00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:12.920
And usually, when your loved ones receive insurance money,

45
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.170
it's tax-free in most countries.

46
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.947
Similar to what we did in exercise 15

47
00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:23.904
when we called five banks and did a price shopping

48
00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:25.455
to find the best bank for us,

49
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:26.860
I want you to do the same thing

50
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.852
when it comes to all types of insurance.

51
00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:31.230
I'm not gonna create a separate exercise for that,

52
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.880
but I think you get the idea.

53
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.748
Call five insurance companies.

54
00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:36.398
And quite often,

55
00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:39.594
you can buy several if not all of your insurance products

56
00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:43.678
from one insurance company, like State Farm or GEICO.

57
00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:47.572
GEICO's got great commercials with that little lizard.

58
00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:48.714
I think that's one of Warren Buffett's

59
00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:50.822
favorite investments too.

60
00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:51.822
For example,

61
00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:55.990
if you buy a lot of insurance products

62
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.031
from one place, you might be able to save money.

63
00:02:59.031 --> 00:03:01.398
Kind of like if you get your mobile phone, your home phone,

64
00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:04.852
et cetera from one place, and your cable as well.

65
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.490
We call it triple play in the US.

66
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.834
There's four types of insurance products that

67
00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.996
I recommend buying, as follows.

68
00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:13.646
And we're gonna discuss more in detail

69
00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:16.325
about each one of these in the next couple lessons.

70
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:18.655
The first kind of insurance that you have to buy,

71
00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:20.695
especially if you have kids or family or dependents,

72
00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:23.362
is life or disability insurance.

73
00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:26.933
The second one is auto insurance,

74
00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:29.232
the third one is home insurance,

75
00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.544
and the fourth one is health insurance,

76
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.955
which includes dental and vision

77
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:37.981
if your company or country doesn't already cover these.

78
00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:39.349
These are the four main ones.

79
00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.581
And every year or two,

80
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:43.593
please call other insurance companies

81
00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:45.749
and see if they can get you a better deal.

82
00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:46.997
And if they say, yes,

83
00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.353
they can give you a lower price on your insurance,

84
00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.469
then call your existing insurance company

85
00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.929
to see if they could lower your rate as well.

86
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.833
So why do we do this?

87
00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:58.021
Because it costs you nothing to ask,

88
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.381
and nobody does this, hardly anybody.

89
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:02.853
Remember, ask and you shall receive.

90
00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:04.457
A little prophetic, I know.

91
00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:07.441
So you could buy more expensive insurance policies

92
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:09.901
that cover every penny you need,

93
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:11.341
or ones that are cheaper

94
00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:13.757
as long as you pay a little bit out of pocket

95
00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:16.125
when you need access to insurance products.

96
00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.105
And this is called a deductible,

97
00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:22.185
and I prefer deductible-based insurance because it keeps

98
00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:24.857
the insurance fees that I pay lower.

99
00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:26.524
And so, for example,

100
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:29.641
on a car insurance policy,

101
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.897
you might choose to have a $500 deductible amount

102
00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.741
if you get into an accident.

103
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.357
This means that you pay the first $500 out of pocket,

104
00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:41.073
and then the insurance company covers the rest.

105
00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:44.149
And the insurance rates are much lower this way too,

106
00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.909
and the likelihood of getting into car accidents

107
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.709
is not too high,

108
00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:49.609
God willing.

109
00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:53.841
So please decide for yourself, though, what you're

110
00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:56.541
most comfortable paying when it comes to deductibles.

111
00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:57.865
And so I'll give you an example.

112
00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.769
My car, this kills me.

113
00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:03.909
My car was recently hit when I was upstairs in the gym,

114
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.477
and police officers came upstairs

115
00:05:06.477 --> 00:05:08.037
and they paged me.

116
00:05:08.037 --> 00:05:10.617
I guess somehow they knew it was my car or whatever.

117
00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:13.873
And what happened was I went down,

118
00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:14.706
and, first of all, I checked to see

119
00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:15.705
if the other guy was okay.

120
00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:18.945
It was some guy, he went underground

121
00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:21.841
really fast for some reason, he hit my car.

122
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:24.437
And so he moved my car six feet as well.

123
00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:27.901
It wasn't my fault, and I was so frustrated, man, because,

124
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.925
you know, like why should I pay that $500 deductible.

125
00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:31.321
It's completely his fault.

126
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.988
So I asked my insurance company,

127
00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:37.589
and I asked aggressively too

128
00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.553
in the nicest way I possibly could,

129
00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:40.785
not impolite too.

130
00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:43.977
But I asked them to call the other insurance company

131
00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.869
and make the other insurance company

132
00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:47.786
pay my $500 deductible.

133
00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.817
And, initially, they said, "No, this is not normally done."

134
00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.217
I said, "No. I want you to do this, please.

135
00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:54.193
"Come on."

136
00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:55.333
And they did it.

137
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.881
I was aggressive, I was a pit bull on a pork chop.

138
00:05:57.881 --> 00:05:59.369
And they did it.

139
00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:01.469
They ended up paying for my deductible.

140
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.525
I still had to rent a car,

141
00:06:03.525 --> 00:06:05.249
which doesn't come out of my insurance,

142
00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.161
comes out of their insurance.

143
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:12.017
You got to be a pain in the neck sometimes and just ask.

144
00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:13.501
Kind of like when you go out to dinner

145
00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:17.413
and ask for your meal to be made a certain or healthier way.

146
00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:21.673
Now, when it comes to insurance, never buy more

147
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:25.081
than the absolute minimum amount you need, of course.

148
00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:27.165
And a good credit history likely

149
00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:30.317
helps you to have lower insurance costs as well.

150
00:06:30.317 --> 00:06:33.421
Now, we spoke about how to improve your credit history

151
00:06:33.421 --> 00:06:35.565
in the previous lecture.

152
00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:38.717
Always ask insurance companies what you can do

153
00:06:38.717 --> 00:06:41.133
to lower your cost of home insurance or life insurance

154
00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:43.337
or auto insurance, et cetera.

155
00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:46.689
Ask them, if you bought more insurance products from them,

156
00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.817
could you get a rebate as well?

157
00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:51.245
And there's so many different types of insurance products,

158
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:55.777
including ones that are investment vehicles for you,

159
00:06:55.777 --> 00:06:58.521
meaning the proceeds of your insurance payments

160
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:01.188
can be invested in mutual funds.

161
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.254
This is called variable insurance.

162
00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.941
And the opposite of this is called term insurance,

163
00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:13.425
term meaning that you just pay for life insurance

164
00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:14.641
for that term.

165
00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:17.789
Term life insurance is the approach I recommend using,

166
00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.241
as it lets you pay an annual or monthly amount

167
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:24.165
that will provide money to your loved ones

168
00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:27.029
for periods of time called terms,

169
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:28.529
terms of five, 10,

170
00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:31.949
I don't have 20 fingers, I'll use my toes,

171
00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:33.657
20 years, et cetera.

172
00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:35.277
Of course, the older you get,

173
00:07:35.277 --> 00:07:38.429
the higher the annual rate is gonna be.

174
00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:41.577
Also, you might need to take a physical exam

175
00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:43.453
and give blood work, et cetera,

176
00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:46.293
which I've had to do a number of times in the past.

177
00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:49.701
And so, stay in shape before these exams,

178
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.501
these health exams,

179
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.481
and always, of course, keep improving your health because

180
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:58.553
you can actually lower your rate

181
00:07:58.553 --> 00:08:00.173
if you're in better shape now

182
00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:03.423
and get your health checkup done again.

183
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:07.205
Here's how much it costs.

184
00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:11.361
A one-million-dollar policy can cost about $75 per month.

185
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:14.661
If you already have life insurance

186
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.117
and you were not in the best shape

187
00:08:16.117 --> 00:08:18.533
before because you smoked or whatever it was

188
00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:21.909
and you don't smoke anymore, then take

189
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:25.181
the physical exam again if you can and ask, as always,

190
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:28.957
for a lower rate after you take that new physical.

191
00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:31.629
I don't like variable insurance products

192
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:34.237
because you pay for insurance by investing

193
00:08:34.237 --> 00:08:35.949
in insurance companies,

194
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.193
and then those insurance companies

195
00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:39.925
invest in stocks and mutual funds for you.

196
00:08:39.925 --> 00:08:42.701
I really don't like this approach because you end up

197
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:46.197
paying a fortune in fees, and a lot of fees are hidden.

198
00:08:46.197 --> 00:08:48.713
I also don't like this approach of buying life insurance

199
00:08:48.713 --> 00:08:51.909
as a way to invest because I just don't trust them

200
00:08:51.909 --> 00:08:54.093
and, again, their hidden fees.

201
00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:56.433
Just stick with term-based life insurance,

202
00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:59.493
meaning only buy life insurance products

203
00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:01.473
from life insurance companies,

204
00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.857
just like you don't buy...

205
00:09:03.857 --> 00:09:05.477
I don't know.

206
00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:10.065
You wouldn't buy cellular phones from McDonald's, right?

207
00:09:10.065 --> 00:09:11.345
Awful example, but I think you know what I mean.

208
00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:12.441
Okay, anyway.

209
00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:14.853
So in part three of the course,

210
00:09:14.853 --> 00:09:16.909
meaning the make money part of the course,

211
00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:18.693
what we're gonna do is we're gonna discuss

212
00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:22.053
why buying mutual funds is not a good investment,

213
00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:23.869
as they have so many hidden fees,

214
00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:25.921
and 95% of mutual funds

215
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:27.505
underperform indexes.

216
00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:29.793
We'll get there soon.

217
00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:32.841
And so we're gonna discuss buying much cheaper

218
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:36.174
index funds in part three of the course.

219
00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:39.193
In the next four lessons here,

220
00:09:39.193 --> 00:09:41.025
we're gonna discuss four types of insurance,

221
00:09:41.025 --> 00:09:42.001
which I mentioned.

222
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:44.665
Life, auto, home, health insurance.

223
00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:48.009
Again, only buy these products if your company

224
00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:50.173
doesn't already give them to you,

225
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:53.321
as these companies you work for get great deals

226
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:55.321
because they buy in bulk

227
00:09:56.349 --> 00:09:59.577
as part of group insurance products,

228
00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:01.389
which means a lower price, kind of like

229
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:04.847
buying products in bulk when you're out shopping.
