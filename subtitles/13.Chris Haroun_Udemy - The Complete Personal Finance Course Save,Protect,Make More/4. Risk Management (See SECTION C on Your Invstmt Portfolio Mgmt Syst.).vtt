1
00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:02.729
<v Instructor>Section C is risk management.</v>

2
00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:04.729
Although it's only four columns,

3
00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:06.670
it's still very, very important.

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.700
And the reason that we have a risk management section

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.621
is we never want to have too much exposure

6
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:15.355
to a certain stock or to a certain ETF fund,

7
00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:17.855
and when we do the diversification exercise

8
00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:20.589
later in the course, you will see that

9
00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.152
I don't want you to ever own more than say 5%

10
00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:24.874
of your portfolio in one stock,

11
00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:27.749
and never more than 10% of your portfolio

12
00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.115
in total in commodities, etc.

13
00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:32.398
There's a bunch of rules that I personally made up

14
00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.264
and if you want, you can look at the diversification rules

15
00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:38.361
right now but don't spend too much time on this yet please

16
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:42.444
because we will cover this is exercise number 24.

17
00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:45.626
Okay, so moving back to C,

18
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.521
which is our Risk Management four columns.

19
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.233
All right, here we go, good.

20
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.145
So here, this is a red flag because,

21
00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:58.805
and I made it appear as a red flag

22
00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.015
with my conditional formatting

23
00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:03.484
because we have too much money in one stock, right?

24
00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:05.592
That's 100% of our portfolio in Apple,

25
00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.314
and obviously, we've only entered in one stock here

26
00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:11.294
so it wouldn't, that wouldn't change yet

27
00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:15.748
but when we enter in more information on other stocks,

28
00:01:15.748 --> 00:01:18.983
if we still have more than say 5% of our portfolio

29
00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:21.868
in one stock, it'll still be a red flag.

30
00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:24.726
I like to have less than 5% if possible,

31
00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:28.289
and that flag will change to green if it's 5% or less.

32
00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.931
Okay, moving on.

33
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:33.931
Now this measures our exposure to sectors, okay?

34
00:01:35.898 --> 00:01:38.981
So we can see that four of our stocks

35
00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:42.645
in this hypothetical portfolio

36
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:44.928
are information technology stocks,

37
00:01:44.928 --> 00:01:47.302
and I never want you to have too much exposure

38
00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:49.955
to one sector, right, and see how this is red,

39
00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.145
and to be fair, I've not entered in data

40
00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:57.474
for other stuff yet, so we don't know our exact exposure

41
00:01:57.474 --> 00:02:00.078
to industrials or consumer staples,

42
00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:02.558
but I did make this red automatically

43
00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.323
because there's too much exposure to one sector,

44
00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:07.537
which is technology.

45
00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:09.458
And if you're curious and you're a techie or a nerd

46
00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:12.297
like I am, you can always just go up here

47
00:02:12.297 --> 00:02:15.886
and look to see where I got all of this information from,

48
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.746
but if it's an S&amp;P 500 stock,

49
00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:21.977
then I'm gonna automatically pull up here for you

50
00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:24.310
what sector the stock is in.

51
00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.403
Okay, and these are not part of the S&amp;P 500

52
00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.943
because they're ETF indexes, so they are for,

53
00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.917
I don't have the sector listed here.

54
00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:35.744
Okay, anyway, moving on.

55
00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:37.048
This here is the beta.

56
00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:40.748
Now beta measures how volatile a stock is

57
00:02:40.748 --> 00:02:42.493
relative to the stock market.

58
00:02:42.493 --> 00:02:45.234
So I want you to accept this.

59
00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:48.929
The stock market index, the S&amp;P 500 in this case,

60
00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:53.252
has a beta of one, okay, and stocks that have a beta

61
00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:55.931
above one are more volatile than the S&amp;P,

62
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:58.888
meaning they go up and down more, they're riskier,

63
00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:03.039
and stocks that have a beta below one are less volatile

64
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.237
than the S&amp;P mean; they go up and down less

65
00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:06.997
than the S&amp;P does, okay?

66
00:03:06.997 --> 00:03:08.282
And that's a measure of risk.

67
00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:12.511
And so less risky stocks have a beta of one or below,

68
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:15.864
because they're less risky, meaning they don't move as much,

69
00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:18.600
as much as the stock market does.

70
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.782
Vice versa, more risky stocks,

71
00:03:20.782 --> 00:03:24.586
especially newer tech companies have high betas

72
00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:27.172
'cause they're very speculative, right, and so

73
00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.768
some of these companies have a beta close to two times,

74
00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:32.270
these risky ones, and so here's what we'll do actually.

75
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.574
Let's go to Yahoo Finance, and take a look at

76
00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:36.680
what the beta is for.

77
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.660
Yahoo Finance, as of right now, doesn't let me

78
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.508
download this information in here,

79
00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:45.136
and I want you to enter it in also because it's something

80
00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:47.301
that you have to understand as well,

81
00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:49.886
as beta is probably one of the best measures of risk.

82
00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:54.210
Okay, so, and for you calculus people out there,

83
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.697
beta is just the rise over the run or the derivative,

84
00:03:57.697 --> 00:03:59.676
how volatile the stock is relative to the market.

85
00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:02.843
Okay, so let's go here to Apple, AAPL.

86
00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.920
Okay, let's go to the stock, it's coming,

87
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.676
and we're gonna look at the beta.

88
00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:13.665
Okay, so the beta on Apple is 1.34 and that's not that high

89
00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.435
for a tech stock, right?

90
00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:17.693
Some more speculative stocks have much higher betas,

91
00:04:17.693 --> 00:04:21.860
so let's go and enter that in to our portfolio here, 1.34.

92
00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:25.759
So I just want you to be aware of how volatile

93
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.111
the stock is, relative to the market,

94
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:31.518
and I don't want to nerd out too much here,

95
00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:33.999
but when I worked at a big hedge fund in the past,

96
00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.813
what I would do is I would calculate what I owned

97
00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:38.631
on a beta-adjusted basis.

98
00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:42.275
So I would take the beta times the dollar value

99
00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:44.667
of the stock that I own, and then what I can do

100
00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:47.998
is I can calculate the beta exposure for each stock.

101
00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:50.498
So I would just go this times,

102
00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:54.523
and then you can go back here and multiply it

103
00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:56.957
by the size of the position.

104
00:04:56.957 --> 00:05:00.115
So Apple actually, on a beta-adjusted basis

105
00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:02.782
is $2,345 dollars, right, and so

106
00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.781
if you wanted to enter this in here

107
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:10.025
and actually speak English to Excel,

108
00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:12.355
meaning instead of referencing certain cells,

109
00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:13.526
what you can do is this.

110
00:05:13.526 --> 00:05:14.810
This is pretty cool.

111
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.560
So we can highlight the data here

112
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:23.954
and what I will do is I'm gonna name this here,

113
00:05:23.954 --> 00:05:25.870
Size of Position.

114
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.620
So I go up here, I got Size of Position, see?

115
00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:32.181
Enter, okay.

116
00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:34.187
And you'll see that that will make sense in a second.

117
00:05:34.187 --> 00:05:35.783
Watch this.

118
00:05:35.783 --> 00:05:37.439
So let's say I'm here and I'm like,

119
00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.946
"Okay, what's my beta times the size of my position?"

120
00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:44.873
So I'll go here times, and I'm like, "Wait a second.

121
00:05:44.873 --> 00:05:47.916
"I don't remember where I wrote the position.

122
00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:50.666
"Oh, okay. I'll just go size of,"

123
00:05:51.743 --> 00:05:54.286
and see how it drops down here, Excel is so cool, man.

124
00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:55.955
Watch, size of, I'll do it again.

125
00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:58.552
Here we go, size of position,

126
00:05:58.552 --> 00:05:59.969
enter, and there.

127
00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.399
That's the dollar size of our position

128
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.530
on a beta-adjusted basis.

129
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.161
Double-click so you can see the math there,

130
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:10.085
the logic I should say, okay.

131
00:06:10.085 --> 00:06:12.725
And I'm gonna nerd one more time.

132
00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:17.290
I'm now going to delete that and let's name this here

133
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.935
Beta, so we can speak English to Excel.

134
00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:22.435
So we'll go here, Beta, enter.

135
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.550
Okay, good.

136
00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:29.676
And let's go here, and let's take the beta,

137
00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:34.009
whoops, beat, times the size of position.

138
00:06:36.154 --> 00:06:38.188
How awesome is Excel, man?

139
00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:40.434
And there, it calculates it for you.

140
00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:43.101
And then you could drag down if you wanted to

141
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.260
and just do the other calculations here.

142
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.548
Now there's nothing that appears in this cell

143
00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:52.504
and what you can do is if you had that formula in,

144
00:06:52.504 --> 00:06:54.657
you can type this.

145
00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:55.505
I'll go up here.

146
00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:59.672
I can say IFERROR, okay, so if it's not an error, show that.

147
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:06.112
If it is an error, I can write N/A,

148
00:07:06.112 --> 00:07:09.932
and you'll see I have N/A a lot.

149
00:07:09.932 --> 00:07:11.076
Cool, right?

150
00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:12.036
All right, great.

151
00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.409
So let me delete this.

152
00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.202
You could play around with that if you want,

153
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:17.588
and then in the second to last section of the course,

154
00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:19.254
I'm gonna go into a lot of detail

155
00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:21.299
on how I made this entire spreadsheet from scratch.

156
00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:23.293
Even if you have no Excel experience at all,

157
00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:27.370
I want to explain it to you in simple-to-understand terms

158
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.456
just because I'm a nerd and I love Excel.

159
00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:30.950
If you have any questions about section C,

160
