00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:02.584
<v ->My grandfather, God bless him,</v>

2
00:00:02.584 --> 00:00:04.572
but my grandfather used to always tell me,

3
00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:07.133
"Chris, buy land, they're not making anymore."

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.203
I agree.

5
00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:10.390
And just like we discussed with commodities

6
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.331
there's a scarcity value when it comes to real estate.

7
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:15.954
And my father used to always tell me

8
00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:18.748
that the three most important things to consider

9
00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:21.301
when investing in real estate are as follows:

10
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.481
location, location, location.

11
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:28.194
Aside from location, location, location,

12
00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.777
when interest rates are low

13
00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:32.502
real estate prices tend to go up.

14
00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:34.482
And there're exceptions of course.

15
00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.596
But when interest rates are low,

16
00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:39.683
then so too is the cost to get a loan

17
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:41.663
to buy a house, meaning a mortgage.

18
00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:44.000
And we're gonna cover how to calculate

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.138
mortgage loan payments in the next exercise

20
00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:51.842
and what to watch out for when considering a mortgage.

21
00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:53.794
So how much do we spend on a house?

22
00:00:53.794 --> 00:00:55.941
Well, please don't buy a house

23
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:58.510
where the loan, meaning the mortgage,

24
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.744
is more than twice your household income.

25
00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:04.428
And some people might think that I'm being

26
00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:08.712
too conservative, but there're many other expenses

27
00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:10.730
that we need to consider when buying a house,

28
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.965
or an apartment, including property tax,

29
00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:17.646
maintenance fees, homeowner's insurance,

30
00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:20.912
transportation expenses if you live farther away.

31
00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:23.653
And this is why I think two times

32
00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:26.334
your total household income is the most

33
00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:29.085
you should spend ever on a mortgage.

34
00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:32.226
And if you and your significant other, for example,

35
00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:35.726
make $100,000 combined per year in income,

36
00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:41.325
then make sure that the loan, meaning the mortgage,

37
00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:45.435
that you're gonna get is not more than $200,000.

38
00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:46.871
And the equation is as follows.

39
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:48.556
Two times your household income

40
00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:51.937
equals the mortgage loan maximum recommended size.

41
00:01:51.937 --> 00:01:53.720
However, please note.

42
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.754
This does not mean that you should not buy a house

43
00:01:56.754 --> 00:01:58.844
that costs more that $200,000.

44
00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.891
This just means that the maximum loan size,

45
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:02.456
meaning your mortgage,

46
00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.402
shouldn't be greater than $200,000.

47
00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:08.486
So, if you save 50K, $50,000,

48
00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:11.209
then you can buy a house that costs $250,000

49
00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.429
as your mortgage maximum size will be $200,000

50
00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.249
and you pay down the 50K

51
00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.677
as part of your down payment, okay?

52
00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:23.345
Now, as a quick side note.

53
00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:27.764
Lenders prefer to see you spend less than 30%

54
00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:31.176
of your annual net income on your house,

55
00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:33.928
or your apartment, including all expenses

56
00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:36.457
like property tax, et cetera.

57
00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:38.744
And for those of you in your twenties

58
00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:41.665
watching this please, please, please, please, please

59
00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:44.447
save, save, save, save as much as you can

60
00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:47.141
so you can put down a big down payment

61
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:49.294
for your first home purchase

62
00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.657
so that your mortgage isn't too high

63
00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:53.657
relative to your salary.

64
00:02:54.493 --> 00:02:57.293
Buying your own house, or your own apartment,

65
00:02:57.293 --> 00:03:00.120
when you can afford it is potentially

66
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.897
the best investment you'll ever make.

67
00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:03.059
Why?

68
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.890
Because think of all the money

69
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.453
you will save by not renting.

70
00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.518
Go back to exercise number one if you want,

71
00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:12.026
the time value of money exercises, and just answer

72
00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.207
how much money you spend on rent

73
00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:16.783
to figure out how much money you'd be saving

74
00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:18.717
if you bought a house in the long run.

75
00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:20.598
Now, let me move on and talk about,

76
00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:22.246
and I want to speak specifically

77
00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:24.879
to those in your twenties watching this,

78
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.769
please save, save, save as much money as you can

79
00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.302
so you can put a down payment on a house,

80
00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:33.965
or an apartment, by the time you're in your thirties

81
00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:37.123
or forties, wherever it might be.

82
00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:39.769
Buying your house when you can afford it

83
00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.784
is the best investment you might ever make.

84
00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:44.600
Just think about the money you're gonna save

85
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.881
by not renting.

86
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.511
And my wife Christine and I, we had a lot of debt

87
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.708
when we graduated from university

88
00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:53.238
and we could not buy in our twenties

89
00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:54.586
so we did it later in life.

90
00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:56.428
And most people can't do it in their twenties.

91
00:03:56.428 --> 00:04:00.829
We actually bought our first place after our twenties.

92
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.949
We lived in New York City at that time,

93
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.814
and I remember how I spoke about, earlier

94
00:04:04.814 --> 00:04:06.862
in the course, about Warren Buffett saying,

95
00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:08.981
"Be greedy when others are fearful,

96
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.209
"and be fearful when others are greedy."

97
00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.981
This means, of course, buy when nobody else

98
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:15.596
wants to and vice versa.

99
00:04:15.596 --> 00:04:18.083
Well, Christine and I lived in New York City

100
00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:21.001
last decade and we really wanted to buy

101
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.757
as we wasted so much money on renting.

102
00:04:22.757 --> 00:04:24.674
It was just ridiculous.

103
00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.733
We lived in New York City and we witnessed 9/11.

104
00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.244
It was awful.

105
00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:31.576
I worked on the 49th floor

106
00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:32.609
of the most southern building in Manhattan,

107
00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:35.005
which is Goldman Sachs, and God bless

108
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.557
all those had passed away, it was awful.

109
00:04:37.557 --> 00:04:38.454
It was awful.

110
00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:42.621
And I remember a couple of months after 9/11

111
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:46.810
Christine and I started to look to buy a place

112
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.266
and I remember it felt so uncomfortable to buy then.

113
00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:52.766
There was so much uncertainty,

114
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.900
and markets hate uncertainty as you know.

115
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.458
Stock market hates uncertainty

116
00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:59.587
and so does the real estate market.

117
00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:01.515
I remember we almost didn't even think

118
00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:03.979
about buying because it felt so uncomfortable.

119
00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.971
And then, Christine and I realized that wait a second,

120
00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:09.485
this feels really uncomfortable,

121
00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:12.529
this means everybody feels uncomfortable buying.

122
00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:13.818
I remember my friends at the time

123
00:05:13.818 --> 00:05:15.533
were saying I was crazy even considering,

124
00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:19.261
and then it hit me that it feels so uncomfortable,

125
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:22.852
then this means that this is the right time to buy

126
00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:24.607
because nobody else is buying

127
00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:26.631
and prices are more reasonable,

128
00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:28.977
when everybody is uncomfortable.

129
00:05:28.977 --> 00:05:31.725
So it turned out to be a great investment for us.

130
00:05:31.725 --> 00:05:33.704
And so we ended up buying a place

131
00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:36.733
in New York, it worked out okay.

132
00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:38.659
So, and then we left New York

133
00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.994
partially because we had our first kid,

134
00:05:39.994 --> 00:05:41.210
it was too expensive living in the city

135
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.043
with a kid, whatever.

136
00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:43.805
Okay, long story.

137
00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:47.005
My job in this section, though, of the course

138
00:05:47.005 --> 00:05:51.172
is to make sure that you don't take on too much debt.

139
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.388
And I also want to help you understand

140
00:05:54.388 --> 00:05:57.309
what to consider and watch out for

141
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.072
when you're buying your first house

142
00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:00.942
or your first apartment.

143
00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:04.942
And I'll also cover investing in what are called

144
00:06:06.788 --> 00:06:09.261
investment properties in this section,

145
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.644
meaning investments in property

146
00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:14.561
that is not your primary residence.

147
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.011
Separately, remember all that stuff

148
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:20.218
we spoke about with your credit score

149
00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:22.378
earlier in the course?

150
00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:23.798
We spoke about the importance of having

151
00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:25.976
a great credit score so you can buy

152
00:06:25.976 --> 00:06:28.089
your own house or your own apartment.

153
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.189
So, what if your credit score is not good enough,

154
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.753
or what if you didn't have enough money to buy your home.

155
00:06:34.753 --> 00:06:38.496
Well, in many countries, there're tax benefits

156
00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:42.262
to your family actually helping you buy your home.

157
00:06:42.262 --> 00:06:44.385
You can get your family to help you out.

158
00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:48.385
And the annual tax benefit is the tax-free gift.

159
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.125
It can be an excess of $10,000 in the United States.

160
00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:55.657
For example.

161
00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:59.835
In the United States, one parent, as of right now,

162
00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:04.260
can give their child $14,000 per year as a tax-free gift.

163
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.622
This means that two parents in the same year

164
00:07:07.622 --> 00:07:10.509
can give that same child 28 grand.

165
00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.532
And let's assume that two parents have a son

166
00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:17.233
and they give their son 28K, or 14K each.

167
00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:19.717
They can also give their daughter-in-law,

168
00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:22.477
for example, that is married to their son

169
00:07:22.477 --> 00:07:26.310
an additional 28K tax free for a total of 56K.

170
00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:29.437
Okay, and this makes the process

171
00:07:29.437 --> 00:07:32.216
of buying a house much easier of course,

172
00:07:32.216 --> 00:07:35.544
if you have that option and if you can swallow

173
00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:37.127
your pride and ask.

174
00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:41.369
I didn't get help but there's a point,

175
00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:43.861
I kind of wish I did, I kind of wish I bought earlier

176
00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:45.241
and just kind of swallowed my pride and asked.

177
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:47.748
But anyway, it is what it is, doesn't matter.

178
00:07:47.748 --> 00:07:51.214
There's no gift tax in Canada actually where I grew up.

179
00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:53.082
But to see if there's a gift tax in your country,

180
00:07:53.082 --> 00:07:56.310
just search for gift tax, country name obviously.

181
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.951
Okay.

182
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.023
Here are 11 things, 11 other things to consider

183
00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:04.461
before buying a house or an apartment.

184
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.118
Number one.

185
00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.901
Can you rent out part of your house

186
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:13.068
or a room in that house or apartment using Airbnb.

187
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.765
We used to rent out a room using Airbnb

188
00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:18.708
to help us pay for the mortgage.

189
00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:22.025
We had a small room that we never used,

190
00:08:22.025 --> 00:08:25.352
and then what I did was I actually built a door

191
00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:28.413
so that our house was more secure,

192
00:08:28.413 --> 00:08:30.475
and then we rented out that room.

193
00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:32.179
And we won't do it anymore but,

194
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.323
anyway it looks like this here.

195
00:08:35.323 --> 00:08:38.639
But we also, and I mentioned this earlier

196
00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.159
in the course, I won't spend much time on this.

197
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.326
Go to August.com and buy a secure lock like this one.

198
00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:48.282
And you can send the digital key of this

199
00:08:48.282 --> 00:08:51.116
to the people renting so they can use their iPhone

200
00:08:51.116 --> 00:08:55.195
or Android device to get the key which expires.

201
00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:58.029
Again, see August.com for more details on this.

202
00:08:58.029 --> 00:09:00.205
I just installed this generation three

203
00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:01.479
and it works out great.

204
00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:02.547
Number two.

205
00:09:02.547 --> 00:09:05.487
Hire a lawyer before you sign anything,

206
00:09:05.487 --> 00:09:07.793
especially since a real estate lawyer

207
00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:10.498
will have your back and have your best interest

208
00:09:10.498 --> 00:09:12.935
in mind, when it comes to inspection fees,

209
00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:15.096
the appraisal, et cetera.

210
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.328
Number three, and I hate to say this.

211
00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:20.273
But it makes sense to have a real estate broker

212
00:09:20.273 --> 00:09:23.887
help you despite their crazy 5% fee

213
00:09:23.887 --> 00:09:26.755
when you're buying or selling

214
00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:28.403
unless you're incredibly sophisticated

215
00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:31.804
when it comes to real estate which I'm not.

216
00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:34.238
There's an insane amount of paper work

217
00:09:34.238 --> 00:09:38.185
that needs to be completed by these brokers,

218
00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:41.022
and these real estate brokers can actually,

219
00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:42.626
they can help you a lot with this stuff.

220
00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:43.459
It's worth it.

221
00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:44.292
It's worth it.

222
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:48.001
And if you can, get pre-approval for a mortgage amount

223
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:51.641
and tell the buyer this, if you give them an offer,

224
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:54.734
because a lot of your competitors won't do this

225
00:09:54.734 --> 00:09:56.246
when trying to buy the house or apartment

226
00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:58.010
you want, and you might be able to get

227
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.593
a better price because of this.

228
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:03.719
Number five.

229
00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.963
Make sure you live in a good school district

230
00:10:06.963 --> 00:10:11.130
as it can really help your property value over time.

231
00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:13.764
Six.

232
00:10:13.764 --> 00:10:16.248
Try your best to get a fixed mortgage

233
00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:19.890
and not one that floats, which can be catastrophic.

234
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.659
We will discuss what this means

235
00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:25.074
in a lot more detail in the next lesson.

236
00:10:25.074 --> 00:10:28.504
The ones that float are often called ARMs,

237
00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:31.492
which stands for adjustable rate mortgage.

238
00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:34.576
And if you do an ARM, make sure you can pay

239
00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:38.342
the adjustable, floating, or variable, rate

240
00:10:38.342 --> 00:10:42.102
in the absolute worst case scenario.

241
00:10:42.102 --> 00:10:46.534
If rates were to go from 5% to 8%,

242
00:10:46.534 --> 00:10:48.007
most of these loans can't adjust

243
00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:50.243
more than 300 basis points or 3%,

244
00:10:50.243 --> 00:10:52.147
would you be okay still?

245
00:10:52.147 --> 00:10:54.069
We'll do an exercise in the next section,

246
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:55.233
look at that.

247
00:10:55.233 --> 00:10:56.998
Okay, so just be conservative please,

248
00:10:56.998 --> 00:10:59.202
when it comes to buying your home,

249
00:10:59.202 --> 00:11:02.808
or you might have unnecessary sleepless nights,

250
00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:03.807
which can hurt your health,

251
00:11:03.807 --> 00:11:05.897
and I don't want that to happen to you.

252
00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:07.662
And we're gonna cover mathematical examples

253
00:11:07.662 --> 00:11:09.137
of all this mortgage stuff

254
00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:12.474
and interest rates stuff in the next exercise.

255
00:11:12.474 --> 00:11:13.381
Yeah.

256
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.265
If you get a mortgage and interest rates drop,

257
00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:20.091
you need to immediately call your mortgage broker

258
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:23.254
and ask if you refinance at a lower rate.

259
00:11:23.254 --> 00:11:24.746
And again, we'll cover this in detail

260
00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:25.976
in the next exercise.

261
00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.719
When interest rates dropped a lot,

262
00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:29.533
I couldn't get my mortgage broker live

263
00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:31.728
because everybody was refinancing.

264
00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:33.735
He wouldn't return my calls he was so busy.

265
00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.818
So I ditched work one day

266
00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:39.155
and I went to his office door and I waited

267
00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:40.381
till he came in that morning.

268
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:41.470
And he was like, "Hey, how are you?"

269
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.653
And I got it done anyway.

270
00:11:42.653 --> 00:11:43.582
Side note, sorry.

271
00:11:43.582 --> 00:11:44.918
Number seven.

272
00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:49.061
Try to pay down at least 25% for your down payment.

273
00:11:49.061 --> 00:11:51.300
If your credit rating is high meaning it's good,

274
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.069
meaning above 700 in the United States,

275
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:56.854
you don't even need to make a big down payment.

276
00:11:56.854 --> 00:11:59.540
But I want you to be conservative,

277
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.992
so I strongly advise against making a small down payment.

278
00:12:02.992 --> 00:12:05.030
Just try to put down much much more

279
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.677
than 25% for your down payment if you can.

280
00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:10.640
Number eight.

281
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.965
Be organized please, as there will be

282
00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:14.978
a lot of paper work involved.

283
00:12:14.978 --> 00:12:16.732
Remember earlier in the course

284
00:12:16.732 --> 00:12:20.123
where we discussed our accordion folder

285
00:12:20.123 --> 00:12:22.556
tax documents organization system.

286
00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:25.437
Just keep all of the documents

287
00:12:25.437 --> 00:12:27.334
you get for buying the house or apartment

288
00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:30.666
in the year when you buy that house or apartment.

289
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:33.167
Just keep all of your paycheck receipts

290
00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:35.505
or paper work and bank statements

291
00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.721
and the job offer letter you got when you got the job

292
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:38.946
and documentation for everything,

293
00:12:38.946 --> 00:12:40.137
and just throw them all

294
00:12:40.137 --> 00:12:41.862
into those annual accordion folders

295
00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.905
we spoke about because I promise you,

296
00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:46.225
you will need a lot of that stuff later in life

297
00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.262
when you buy a house, or buy another house,

298
00:12:48.262 --> 00:12:50.455
or move, et cetera, that sort of thing.

299
00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:52.155
It's so hard hunting down all the addresses

300
00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:54.462
when you rent so long like I did.

301
00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:55.864
Okay, number nine.

302
00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:58.242
Please, please, please, please

303
00:12:58.242 --> 00:13:02.492
do whatever it takes to not renovate your house.

304
00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:05.359
Because contractors will rob you blind

305
00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:07.577
as they often, and I'm not exaggerating here,

306
00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:11.011
but contractors often charge you 100% more

307
00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:14.011
than what you thought you would pay.

308
00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:16.094
Number 10.

309
00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:19.498
Don't buy the nicest or most expensive house

310
00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.017
in the neighborhood.

311
00:13:21.017 --> 00:13:23.417
Because when you sell it buyers will compare

312
00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:26.225
the price with the price of other houses

313
00:13:26.225 --> 00:13:29.194
in the area that recently sold for less.

314
00:13:29.194 --> 00:13:31.541
And lastly, number 11.

315
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:33.855
Don't buy in a remote area that is too far away

316
00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.534
from public transportation,

317
00:13:35.534 --> 00:13:38.052
unless it's a cottage or a country home, et cetera.
