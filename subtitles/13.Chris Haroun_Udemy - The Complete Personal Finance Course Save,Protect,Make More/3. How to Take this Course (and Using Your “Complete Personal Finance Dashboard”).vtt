00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.590
<v ->There are three parts to this course.</v>

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.475
In part one, we will discuss saving money

3
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.501
and the unbelievable power of compound interest,

4
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.597
and how very small changes in your savings habits

5
00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:15.353
can lead to incredible wealth generation in the long run.

6
00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.248
Your Complete Personal Finance Dashboard is very easy

7
00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:20.702
to use, and I will tell you when to open it

8
00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:23.350
and how to complete the exercises.

9
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.396
And so, in part one of the dashboard,

10
00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:29.010
we cover the following savings concepts

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.050
through very easy and enjoyable exercises, as follows,

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.313
we will start off with how very small changes can lead

13
00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:41.221
to huge savings later in life, then we'll analyze

14
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.249
what you make and what you spend by building

15
00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.303
an income statement, and don't worry please if you haven't

16
00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:49.381
learned about income statements before,

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.245
as this exercise is all about money in and money out,

18
00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:54.949
which is what an income statement is,

19
00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.124
I'll make it very easy to understand.

20
00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.222
We will then create your new and improved income statement

21
00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:03.104
based on more than 100 different ways

22
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.021
that we will discuss to save money.

23
00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:09.956
And you can also completely customize this entire

24
00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:13.139
spreadsheet, and of course I will show you how to do this

25
00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:17.005
in the second to last section of this course.

26
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.632
We're gonna look at many very easy to understand graphs

27
00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:24.047
and simple ratios to analyze your spending

28
00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:25.884
and savings patterns, with the goal

29
00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:29.311
of helping you to save much, much more.

30
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.630
Then at the very end of part one of the course,

31
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.009
meaning the Save portion of the course,

32
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.541
we will do a comprehensive Save Money Checklist exercise.

33
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.899
Then in part two of the course,

34
00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.337
we will discuss protecting your money.

35
00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:46.025
We will complete a very simple net worth exercise,

36
00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:48.037
which is a balance sheet, and again,

37
00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:50.928
don't worry if you don't understand what a balance sheet is,

38
00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:53.130
as I'll make this very easy to understand

39
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.961
as we'll discuss what you own and what you owe,

40
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.324
which is basically what a balance sheet is.

41
00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:03.172
And we'll analyze easy to understand ratios

42
00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:05.901
based on your net worth, meaning based on your balance

43
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.406
sheet, so we can make sure that your financial health

44
00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:14.098
is in excellent condition, including very easy to understand

45
00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:16.693
life insurance and other insurance concepts.

46
00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:21.588
I'll make a boring financial set of rules very easy

47
00:02:21.588 --> 00:02:25.053
to understand and interesting as well, you'll enjoy this.

48
00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:27.671
So we'll also talk about how to minimize how much tax

49
00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:30.601
you will pay, how to know how money you'll need

50
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:34.025
in case you lose your job, which has happened to me before,

51
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.873
or how much money you should spend on a house

52
00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:41.024
or on a mortgage or how to calculate all the stuff

53
00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:44.681
that will help you achieve your financial goals.

54
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:47.286
And you'll enjoy this, too, and in part two,

55
00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:50.183
we'll also discuss a budgeting exercise.

56
00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:54.510
We're also gonna discuss if your money is safe at your bank

57
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.206
or not, and making sure that you're not getting ripped off

58
00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:03.692
on banking fees by completing an exercise on that topic.

59
00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:07.434
I'm also gonna teach you how to organize your finances

60
00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:10.119
so that your financial health is optimized

61
00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.727
when it comes to paying taxes.

62
00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:14.972
Then at the end of part two of the course,

63
00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:17.062
meaning at the end of the Protect portion

64
00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:20.078
of the course, we'll do a comprehensive

65
00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:23.374
Protect Your Money Checklist exercise.

66
00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:25.815
Don't worry, again it won't be boring,

67
00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:28.539
and if you think it is, then please know

68
00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.204
that there is a money-back guarantee on this course.

69
00:03:32.204 --> 00:03:34.932
Then in the third and final part of the course,

70
00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:38.722
we're gonna discuss making money and making your money work

71
00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:43.113
for you, so you can make much more money in the long run.

72
00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:45.432
And we will discuss investing in bonds

73
00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:48.201
and fascinating economics concepts that you need

74
00:03:48.201 --> 00:03:51.540
to understand, given globalization, like fiscal policy,

75
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.908
monetary policy, et cetera.

76
00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:56.068
And again, this won't be boring,

77
00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:59.447
and this certainly will not be a theoretical course.

78
00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:02.096
And in part three, we will also discuss picking stocks

79
00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:06.001
to invest in, and the right investment funds to invest in,

80
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:09.135
as well as investing in commodities, real estate,

81
00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:12.111
and other investment classes.

82
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:14.758
We will also discuss diversification,

83
00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:17.499
meaning what percent of your investments should be in stocks

84
00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:22.060
or bonds, et cetera, based on factors like your age.

85
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.542
Although I will always tell you when to open

86
00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:28.205
and complete exercises in your Complete Personal Finance

87
00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:32.533
Dashboard, I wanna highlight a few other features

88
00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:36.883
in the dashboard, so you can continue to use the document

89
00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:39.536
after you complete this course.

90
00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:43.509
And so, you can see here in the top left hand corner,

91
00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.615
you will see a dark blue button

92
00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:48.588
called the Dashboard Navigator.

93
00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.761
And this is a high-level snapshot of the status,

94
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.410
or health, of your Save, Protect, and Make Money exercises,

95
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.386
and this will automatically be populated and updated

96
00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:01.547
as you go through this course,

97
00:05:01.547 --> 00:05:04.401
and again I'll make it very easy to understand.

98
00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:06.275
Now beside this dark blue button you'll see

99
00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:08.858
a light blue Save Money button,

100
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:11.607
then a Protect Money button,

101
00:05:11.607 --> 00:05:13.850
and then a Make Money button here.

102
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.317
And you can always click on this three buttons

103
00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:18.756
for an overview of those three

104
00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:21.527
respective parts of the course.

105
00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:23.277
Moving over to the right,

106
00:05:23.277 --> 00:05:25.723
there is a speedometer that will update

107
00:05:25.723 --> 00:05:29.390
as you complete each exercise in the course.

108
00:05:30.328 --> 00:05:35.097
I included a few smaller icons here that you can click on

109
00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:36.967
if you want to watch a video

110
00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:39.974
on how to use the tab you're currently on.

111
00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:41.686
You can click on this little button here

112
00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:45.853
and it'll give you an overview video of that tab, okay.

113
00:05:47.262 --> 00:05:51.170
And click this one here to see a checklist of what exercises

114
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.957
you have completed, and this one if you want

115
00:05:54.957 --> 00:05:58.547
to document your mileage for potential tax deduction

116
00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:00.338
reasons, and don't worry, we'll cover that

117
00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:02.176
in more detail later.

118
00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:04.905
Then to right of that, you can navigate

119
00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:07.510
to the next exercise in the course,

120
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.623
or go back, and you can also actually click to any exercise

121
00:06:11.623 --> 00:06:15.540
in the course by clicking on this feature here.

122
00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:20.836
And if you can't see this option, then go here to view,

123
00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.669
and then select Formula Bar, okay.

124
00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:28.158
And as you go through the exercises,

125
00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:30.315
when you are done with an exercise,

126
00:06:30.315 --> 00:06:34.482
please just click the completion checkbox option here,

127
00:06:36.138 --> 00:06:40.097
so that your completion speedometer is updated, okay.

128
00:06:40.097 --> 00:06:41.362
So you know the status of the course,

129
00:06:41.362 --> 00:06:43.277
how much you've completed.

130
00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:46.616
And below this, you'll see a bunch of gray buttons

131
00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:49.426
that I created as helpful resources for you,

132
00:06:49.426 --> 00:06:52.235
like your balance sheet, your income statement,

133
00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:56.144
your diversified investment portfolio, your budget also,

134
00:06:56.144 --> 00:06:59.235
so you can map out your financial goals,

135
00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:02.614
as well as make money, as well as look at the many different

136
00:07:02.614 --> 00:07:05.375
Make Money calculators that are easy to understand

137
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.813
and fun to use in this course.

138
00:07:07.813 --> 00:07:10.300
And there's also a tax filing organizer

139
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.127
and other options like how to secure this file.

140
00:07:14.127 --> 00:07:19.085
Now separately we're gonna discuss identity theft protection

141
00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:22.995
in this course as well, and if you click on the dark gray

142
00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:27.189
settings button here, you can actually customize the course,

143
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:30.644
and so please complete the settings tab

144
00:07:30.644 --> 00:07:33.215
right now, and just feel free to pause me

145
00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:37.078
and un-pause me as we go through this.

146
00:07:37.078 --> 00:07:39.155
And so, on this settings tab,

147
00:07:39.155 --> 00:07:42.577
the first thing to do is to enter in your country name here,

148
00:07:42.577 --> 00:07:45.471
and let's change it from the United States to France

149
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:46.749
for example, for this exercise,

150
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:50.620
okay, you see here, okay.

151
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.878
You will notice that the flag changed here to France,

152
00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:58.315
and the text here is updated to reflect this change.

153
00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:01.533
And your currency rate has also been updated here,

154
00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:05.285
if this rate is not accurate, and I've tried to customize

155
00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.019
for every currency in the world, if it's not accurate

156
00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:10.748
and not completely up to date, then please just click

157
00:08:10.748 --> 00:08:14.648
on the hyperlink here, see it there, and update,

158
00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:17.558
just get what your latest currency exchange rate is at,

159
00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:20.629
okay, and so if you want you can type over

160
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:24.052
in this white box here what the currency is at right now.

161
00:08:24.052 --> 00:08:26.659
Now, you're gonna see many items

162
00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:29.750
in this spreadsheet that are customized for you

163
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.793
based on what you enter on the settings tab.

164
00:08:33.793 --> 00:08:37.401
For example, once we enter the exchange rate,

165
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:41.597
this sentence here appeared, okay, and what we'll do

166
00:08:41.597 --> 00:08:45.300
is we're gonna express how many units of your currency

167
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.724
is needed to buy one U.S. dollar per this sentence here,

168
00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:50.477
again this is optional.

169
00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:53.565
Next up, enter your first name or your nickname,

170
00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:54.997
and don't enter your last name please,

171
00:08:54.997 --> 00:08:57.193
just your first name or your nickname, okay,

172
00:08:57.193 --> 00:09:00.043
so that the user experience is more enjoyable

173
00:09:00.043 --> 00:09:03.708
and customized, and you'll see why later in the course.

174
00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.402
And then next, just enter in your age here,

175
00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:08.686
as we're gonna use this to come up with the right

176
00:09:08.686 --> 00:09:11.655
tax and portfolio investment savings plan for you

177
00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:15.667
later in the course, we'll build this together.

178
00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:19.307
Now, select the age also that you want to retire at,

179
00:09:19.307 --> 00:09:22.810
if you ever wanna retire, okay, and if you want,

180
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.276
enter in your favorite charity here, and again,

181
00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:29.614
many exercises will use the data that you enter here

182
00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:33.200
on the settings tab, okay, and now, if you scroll down

183
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.533
a bit here, see, in the gray shaded box,

184
00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:39.797
you'll see that once you fill in your country name,

185
00:09:39.797 --> 00:09:42.653
and other details, that a lot of helpful information

186
00:09:42.653 --> 00:09:46.608
will appear here that we can reference in future lessons

187
00:09:46.608 --> 00:09:51.194
and exercises, including government tax websites, et cetera,

188
00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:54.043
so just click on the hyperlinks here as this information

189
00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:56.737
is customized for you and for my students

190
00:09:56.737 --> 00:09:59.753
in every single country in the world.

191
00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:02.886
And the last thing I wanna say about this Excel file

192
00:10:02.886 --> 00:10:06.309
is that if you wanna make more room to view

193
00:10:06.309 --> 00:10:08.995
and complete exercises, just please click on this

194
00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:13.162
minus or plus box here, to make it bigger or smaller, okay,

195
00:10:14.487 --> 00:10:18.028
and you can even get rid of the toolbar there at the top

196
00:10:18.028 --> 00:10:20.515
by clicking the minus, okay, it takes a second to update,

197
00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:23.689
but once you do it, you're set, and that's for every single

198
00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:27.856
tab as is, so customize it for yourself just so that there's

199
00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:30.860
enough real estate for you on your screen

200
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.161
to be able to complete the exercises, if you want to.

201
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:38.875
And you can also click this upward facing triangle here,

202
00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:41.572
to make more room, and I had a lot of fun putting this

203
00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:46.540
together, and I really really hope that you enjoy it.

204
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.555
And so, many of the tabs will update

205
00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:52.732
as you complete the exercises in this course.

206
00:10:52.732 --> 00:10:56.807
For example, if we click on the Dashboard Summary

207
00:10:56.807 --> 00:11:01.443
blue button, we can see a snapshot, bottom line update

208
00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:04.740
on our savings, our money protected,

209
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.907
and money making status, and you can even save this tab

210
00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:15.094
actually as a PDF, so you can track your financial health

211
00:11:15.094 --> 00:11:17.734
and how it's improving over time, so the print preview,

212
00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:20.219
I've already set it up for you so you can print it

213
00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:23.564
if you want to or just save it as a PDF by printing the PDF,

214
00:11:23.564 --> 00:11:26.087
if you have questions on how to do that, just let me know.

215
00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:30.202
Lastly, there's many optional side notes in the course

216
00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:33.835
dealing with really fun topics like Warren Buffet's favorite

217
00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:36.571
types of investments, protecting yourself

218
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.357
from identity theft, should you hire a financial advisor,

219
00:11:40.357 --> 00:11:43.170
should you start your own business, et cetera,

220
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.141
and so, please watch the next lecture to get started

221
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:49.162
with part one of this course, Saving Money.

222
00:11:49.162 --> 00:11:50.638
Thank you.
