00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:03.961
<v ->You can usually write off more than you think you can</v>

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.121
by hiring an affordable accountant,

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:08.695
unless you become very, very well versed

4
00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:10.547
in tax strategies.

5
00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:14.616
I all want you to ask for a receipt though, okay?

6
00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.216
Quite often we pay for items with our phone

7
00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:22.296
using Square or PayPal or other payment forms.

8
00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:25.184
When you do this, please always request that

9
00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:28.243
your receipt is emailed to you so you can easily

10
00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:31.175
search your inbox for the word receipt or bill

11
00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:34.099
or invoice, et cetera, before tax season.

12
00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:35.870
And print out these receipts and give them

13
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.320
to your accountant, if you have one.

14
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.737
Or use these printouts when filing taxes.

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.657
And please always ask charities

16
00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:49.576
that you're gonna donate to for a charitable receipt.

17
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:53.139
And please not that they must be a registered charity

18
00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.472
in order for you to get a tax deduction.

19
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.931
And take a picture on your mileage on your car

20
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.437
before and after a business trip

21
00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:07.239
and before and after you commute to a charitable event.

22
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.071
And at the end of the year, search your calendar

23
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:13.517
for the name of the charitable events that you want to,

24
00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:15.816
and also the names of the business trip

25
00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:18.274
so you can open up your mobile camera phone,

26
00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:20.353
you know, or iPhone, whatever it is, Android handset,

27
00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:23.815
and just calculate the mileage based on the data,

28
00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:26.681
or dates I should say, of the photos

29
00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:28.815
of your cars odometer; take a picture of your

30
00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:30.911
car's odometer, okay?

31
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:35.078
Alternatively, you can consider buying an ODP port

32
00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:42.575
item from companies like automatic.com

33
00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.133
like we spoke about earlier in the course

34
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.392
in this lecture here.

35
00:01:45.392 --> 00:01:48.709
And you can even expense the purchase

36
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.425
if you run your own business,

37
00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:54.012
full time or on the side.

38
00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:57.392
And there's so many benefits to having your own company,

39
00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:59.253
it's unbelievable.

40
00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.488
I have my own company, I set it up as an S corp.

41
00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:05.589
And from a retirement perspective, it's awesome because

42
00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:08.869
I have my company, which is mine, 100% mine,

43
00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.759
match my retirement savings every year.

44
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.909
You can do that, okay, and we'll talk about this

45
00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.829
very soon when we talk about retirement savings programs.

46
00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.469
Okay, separately, you can also track your mileage

47
00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.544
by clicking on this road icon in the bottom

48
00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.511
right-hand corner of your speedometer right here.

49
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:31.421
Then you can print or save as a PDF when you complete this.

50
00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:35.741
I formatted the printing option for you on this tab.

51
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:38.541
You can print a PDF or save as PDF.

52
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.864
And when your accountant does your taxes,

53
00:02:41.864 --> 00:02:44.701
or when you do your taxes, if you choose to do so,

54
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.004
download all credit card statements as well

55
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.141
and all bank statements online if you can

56
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.202
so your accountant can help you with tax deductions,

57
00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:55.501
or so you can review all of your expenses

58
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:59.597
and decide if you can deduct some expenses.

59
00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:02.742
And if you do a lot of charity work,

60
00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:06.744
you can even consider using Intuit's tax software program

61
00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:09.336
called ItsDeductible right here.

62
00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:13.016
Use it on your computer or on your phone.

63
00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.249
Also, please don't forget to print out

64
00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.501
all of your retirement savings accounts,

65
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:22.141
and any other documents pertaining to your assets

66
00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:24.701
and your liabilities which you calculate

67
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.207
in exercise seven, and revenue expense items,

68
00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.381
which you calculate in exercise two.

69
00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:32.139
This sounds like a lot, but don't worry,

70
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.869
this will make a lot more sense very soon in this course.

71
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.445
And this one's crucial:

72
00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:40.322
if you've actually lost money on an investment this year

73
00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:43.841
or in the past, your investment statements

74
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.402
that you sent, your accountant will document this.

75
00:03:46.402 --> 00:03:48.619
So you can pay less taxes.

76
00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.341
And yes, if you've lost money on an investment

77
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.138
in the past, you should pay less taxes today.

78
00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:57.464
And this is actually called the tax loss carry forward.

79
00:03:57.464 --> 00:03:59.485
And because you lost money, or might've lost money

80
00:03:59.485 --> 00:04:01.282
in the past on an investment,

81
00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.861
you should pay less taxes today

82
00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:06.605
on money you made on investments.

83
00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:09.122
And companies do this all the time,

84
00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:12.221
especially here in the technology sector in Silicon Valley.

85
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:16.541
Tech companies lose a lot of money for many, many years.

86
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:19.021
And they actually don't pay taxes for many years

87
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.344
because they carry forward their losses from previous years.

88
00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:25.325
And this concept is called an NOL,

89
00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.647
or a Net Operating Loss.

90
00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:30.962
Separately, hiring an accountant is a great idea,

91
00:04:30.962 --> 00:04:34.184
and it won't cost you as much as you think it will.

92
00:04:34.184 --> 00:04:36.609
And they'll explain this whole NOL concept to you

93
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.601
if you've lost money in the past.

94
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:39.899
Every country's a little bit different,

95
00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:42.939
but make sure your accountant knows about your losses

96
00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.061
in the past.

97
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:46.257
And tax codes change all the time,

98
00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:49.124
and accountants stay up to date on this stuff.

99
00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.484
It's too hard for me to do so,

100
00:04:50.484 --> 00:04:53.582
or any of us that aren't accountants.

101
00:04:53.582 --> 00:04:56.425
So you're actually more likely to get money back

102
00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:59.705
and not be audited if you use the right accountant.

103
00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:02.860
And ask your parents or successful friends

104
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.569
or relatives to recommend that you use their accountant.

105
00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.924
And hopefully you will get money back

106
00:05:09.924 --> 00:05:12.441
that will more than cover the cost

107
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:14.257
of hiring that accountant.

108
00:05:14.257 --> 00:05:18.520
And a good accountant can keep you out of trouble as well

109
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.020
as ignorance of the tax laws is no excuse.

110
00:05:23.065 --> 00:05:25.719
And you can also, you might also have to double check

111
00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.910
what they do just in case.

112
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.041
But if you're talking to your friends or family

113
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:31.561
about hiring the right accountant,

114
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:33.182
your friends and family are very credible,

115
00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:35.980
and they've dealt with this accountant for years, whatever,

116
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.578
so you should be okay.

117
00:05:37.578 --> 00:05:40.437
But hiring an accountant also makes sense because it

118
00:05:40.437 --> 00:05:42.862
is so incredibly difficult to keep track of

119
00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:46.724
all the existing and constantly changing tax laws,

120
00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:49.905
as tax laws and codes are literally

121
00:05:49.905 --> 00:05:52.785
millions and millions of words long.

122
00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:55.898
And this is why the accountant profession exists.

123
00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:59.279
Some people believe that not hiring an accountant

124
00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.381
to file your taxes is like doing your own research

125
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:05.661
only when it comes to self-medication.

126
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.184
And the only reason I would recommend not hiring

127
00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:11.763
an accountant is if you don't make much money at all,

128
00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:14.789
as you work part time or you're a student.

129
00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.285
And in addition to giving all receipts

130
00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:21.146
and statements and mileage to an accountant,

131
00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:25.601
give them all tax documents that you receive as well.

132
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:28.845
In the United States, your annual tax form

133
00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:30.861
from your employer is given to you,

134
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.941
it's called the W-2 form.

135
00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:36.720
There's also a form called a 1099 that you might have

136
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.879
that might've been given to you if you did

137
00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.165
any consulting or part-time work.

138
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:44.141
And there's another form called a K-1

139
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:48.961
which is a form you get if you invested in a fund.

140
00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:51.661
Right, at the end of the year they give you a K-1.

141
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.984
And just give all that stuff if you can to your accountant.

142
00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:58.484
Or keep them handy as you file your taxes,

143
00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.477
online or on paper.

144
00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:05.310
And to see what tax documents you should file,

145
00:07:06.243 --> 00:07:08.803
hopefully with the help of your accountant in your country,

146
00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:13.205
please click on the Tax Filing Organizer button,

147
00:07:13.205 --> 00:07:15.926
and click on this link here.

148
00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:17.728
See this box here, there are a bunch of

149
00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.664
links that should help you based on what country

150
00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:21.187
you're in for taxes.

151
00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:22.864
And we're gonna cover this, don't worry,

152
00:07:22.864 --> 00:07:26.064
in the other stuff on this Tax Filing Organizer tab

153
00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:27.814
in exercise 13, okay?

154
00:07:28.978 --> 00:07:30.158
Okay.

155
00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:34.325
At least 10% of all tax filings have errors in them.

156
00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:37.721
And most of the time it's because the person filing

157
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:42.371
the tax form didn't understand how to complete the forms.

158
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:46.843
And unfortunately, tax avoidance can be a felony,

159
00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:48.822
even if it's by accident,

160
00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:50.968
and ignorance of the tax law, or laws in general,

161
00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:52.314
is no excuse.

162
00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:53.549
It's just not worth it.

163
00:07:53.549 --> 00:07:55.840
This is really why I recommend hiring an accountant

164
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.238
if you can, as the tax laws, again,

165
00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:01.103
are complicated and the rules change all the time.

166
00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:04.067
And accountants can be very, very affordable.

167
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.518
Again, ask you friends and relatives for suggestions

168
00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:09.524
on who to use for your local accountant.

169
00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:11.819
And please don't wait, please don't wait until

170
00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:16.181
a few weeks before taxes are due to ask for recommendations.

171
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:18.344
Plan well in advance.

172
00:08:18.344 --> 00:08:21.642
And the personal tax filing deadline in your country

173
00:08:21.642 --> 00:08:23.392
is listed right here.

174
00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:27.402
Also, in many countries, hiring an accountant

175
00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:28.902
is tax deductible.

176
00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:32.479
And if you don't make more than, say,

177
00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:34.653
5,000 or 10,000 in many countries,

178
00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:36.624
or whatever it is equivalent in your currency,

179
00:08:36.624 --> 00:08:38.977
you don't need to file.

180
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.847
And just please search first if you need to file

181
00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:44.514
instead of relying on me though.

182
00:08:45.422 --> 00:08:48.865
And in the United States, there are more than

183
00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:51.081
16,000 pages of tax laws, and close to

184
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:53.205
500 different tax forms.

185
00:08:53.205 --> 00:08:55.126
And a good account will help you to

186
00:08:55.126 --> 00:08:59.446
file as a single person or a married person, if applicable,

187
00:08:59.446 --> 00:09:01.883
or head of the household, if applicable;

188
00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:05.163
and how to document dependents like children, et cetera,

189
00:09:05.163 --> 00:09:07.465
which can really decrease the amount of taxes

190
00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:09.387
that you're going to pay.

191
00:09:09.387 --> 00:09:13.182
And that means that, yes, (chuckles) your 23-year-old

192
00:09:13.182 --> 00:09:15.880
that's living in your house can decrease the taxes

193
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.463
you pay, et cetera.

194
00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:21.602
I lived, when I was that age, I lived at home too.

195
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:24.624
Okay, if you make money on the side,

196
00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:28.387
your accountant can also tell you if it makes sense

197
00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:31.406
for you to register a separate company,

198
00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:35.423
so you can write off gas mileage, computer,

199
00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:38.563
part of the rent or mortgage on your house, et cetera.

200
00:09:38.563 --> 00:09:42.483
Now in the United States, close to 100 million Americans

201
00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:45.668
receive a tax refund of close to $3,000

202
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.168
every single year.

203
00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:52.425
And I guess the last thing I wanna stress in this lesson

204
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.282
is please don't every take money out of your tax

205
00:09:55.282 --> 00:10:00.027
savings account without first talking to your accountant.

206
00:10:00.027 --> 00:10:02.726
And I promise you that the one hour you pay

207
00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:04.429
for your accountant for advice,

208
00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:07.462
before taking money out of your retirement account,

209
00:10:07.462 --> 00:10:10.689
is a smart investment because you might end up paying

210
00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:14.856
a lot more in taxes, or have early withdrawal penalties,

211
00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:17.708
et cetera, if you do this.

212
00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.787
And I have to stress again

213
00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:23.023
that all tax codes in every country on the planet

214
00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:26.347
change a lot overtime based on new political leaders,

215
00:10:26.347 --> 00:10:27.484
et cetera.

216
00:10:27.484 --> 00:10:30.966
So hence, my recommendation is to always

217
00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:32.384
work with an accountant.

218
00:10:32.384 --> 00:10:33.217
Thank you.
