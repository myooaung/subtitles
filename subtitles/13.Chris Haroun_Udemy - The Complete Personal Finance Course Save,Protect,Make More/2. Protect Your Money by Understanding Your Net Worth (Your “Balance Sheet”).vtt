00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.563
<v ->A balance sheet tells you what you own, and what you owe.</v>

2
00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:07.728
What you own minus what you owe

3
00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:09.400
is called your net worth,

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.443
which is also called equity.

5
00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.961
And equity is just another word for ownership.

6
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:16.900
I have equity in my house, I have ownership in my house.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.953
Again, what you own minus what you owe

8
00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.374
equals your net worth.

9
00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:26.016
So what you own is also called assets.

10
00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:30.047
Like money in the bank, which is an asset.

11
00:00:30.047 --> 00:00:32.948
And what you owe is called liabilities,

12
00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:35.189
as you are liable to pay it back.

13
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.459
Kind of like debt, which is a liability,

14
00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:40.526
because I am, again, liable to pay it back.

15
00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:43.943
So since what you owe minus what you own,

16
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:48.570
what you owe minus what you own equals equity,

17
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.222
then we can understand that assets minus liabilities

18
00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:53.389
equals equity.

19
00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:58.124
And this formula of assets minus liabilities equals equity

20
00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.848
is your balance sheet equation.

21
00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:04.136
And why is it called a balance sheet?

22
00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:05.418
It's called a balance sheet because

23
00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:07.854
the left side of the equation

24
00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:10.847
must equal the right side of the equation.

25
00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:15.503
Because what you own minus what you owe equals equity.

26
00:01:15.503 --> 00:01:18.283
And just please understand this concept,

27
00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:20.286
instead of memorizing it.

28
00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.569
You can rearrange the equation so that

29
00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.142
assets equals equity plus liabilities.

30
00:01:26.142 --> 00:01:29.642
Or assets minus liabilities equals equity.

31
00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:32.978
That sort of thing.

32
00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:35.451
So, again, the left side will always equal

33
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.272
the right side, and when we say

34
00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:40.791
assets equals equity plus liabilities,

35
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:43.663
it means everything you have in your possession,

36
00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:46.963
meaning assets, is owned by you,

37
00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:49.287
and the bank, if you have debt.

38
00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:50.836
Here's an example.

39
00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:52.875
And this will all make much more sense to you soon,

40
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:53.975
because we really want to maximize

41
00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.147
your net worth the long run.

42
00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:57.608
Here's an example.

43
00:01:57.608 --> 00:02:01.621
Let's say you own a house that costs $100,000.

44
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.371
And you owe $50,000 of the house,

45
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:09.249
and that's called a mortgage.

46
00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.985
But you own the other $50,000 portion of the house

47
00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:14.870
because you paid cash for it.

48
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.045
Then that means the asset of $100,000,

49
00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.047
remember the scale, the balance sheet,

50
00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:22.041
the asset of $100,000 for the house on one side

51
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.041
equals the debt, or liability, on it

52
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.455
of $50,000, plus you own of it,

53
00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:31.372
meaning $50K in equity.

54
00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:33.873
Let's move on.

55
00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:38.576
So when we look at our assets, meaning what we own,

56
00:02:38.576 --> 00:02:41.748
we also want to understand what can be converted

57
00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:44.155
to cash quickly if needed.

58
00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:45.975
This is referred to as liquidity,

59
00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:48.095
meaning how liquid are you?

60
00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:50.133
And it's kind of a bizarre saying,

61
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.357
but you want to own stuff that's liquid,

62
00:02:52.357 --> 00:02:54.947
meaning you can get rid of it like water.

63
00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:56.807
It is what it is, bizarre terminology,

64
00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:58.526
but I just want you to understand that.

65
00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:00.792
And why is liquidity important?

66
00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:02.891
Because we want to be able to own stuff

67
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.687
and invest in stuff that we can sell quickly

68
00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:08.354
and convert to cash quickly if needed,

69
00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.136
to not only pay off your liabilities,

70
00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:14.353
but also so we can make sure that we don't incur

71
00:03:14.353 --> 00:03:18.630
unnecessary fees by paying stuff like credit cards back

72
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.513
later than we should.

73
00:03:20.513 --> 00:03:22.701
Of course, we need to make sure

74
00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:26.270
that we pay off short-term debts like credit cards quickly.

75
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.483
Not just because of the ridiculously high interest rates,

76
00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:33.476
but because we want to make sure our credit rating

77
00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:36.586
is great, so we can get a mortgage to buy a house,

78
00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:38.294
or we can get loan at some point if needed.

79
00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:40.665
And we're gonna cover loans, credit cards,

80
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:42.557
mortgages, and credit ratings

81
00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:46.120
in much more detail a little bit later in the course.

82
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.865
Now, in the next exercise,

83
00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:50.882
we're gonna create our own balance sheet,

84
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:53.325
so we can calculate our net worth.

85
00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:57.900
Why? So we can understand if we can afford a house,

86
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.508
or other items, or not.

87
00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:00.966
Meaning not yet.

88
00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.860
And I mention owning a house because

89
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.500
it can really be the most important investment

90
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.136
you'll ever make.

91
00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:07.646
And my grandfather used to always say to me,

92
00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.841
"Chris, buy land. They're not making it anymore."
