00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.363
<v ->In this exercise which is exercise 11,</v>

2
00:00:03.363 --> 00:00:06.824
we're gonna calculate how much money to save

3
00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:09.960
so that we can cover our children's college

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.716
or university expenses.

5
00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:14.803
Okay and since we all have different expectations

6
00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:17.880
of how much we need to have saved to pay

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.920
for our children's education I'm gonna create

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.824
a framework for you here okay.

9
00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:25.261
And you can fill in your own assumptions

10
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.957
in order to determine how much you need to save monthly

11
00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:31.698
in order to have enough money if applicable,

12
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.296
for your child's education.

13
00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:37.554
And so in this framework you can also enter in

14
00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:40.914
your expected interest rates on the money you save

15
00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:43.138
and the number of years.

16
00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:46.514
And please don't forget that you need to pay taxes

17
00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.357
on what you save when you take it out of,

18
00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:52.157
of an account like this okay.

19
00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:55.576
And so please select exercise 11 if you haven't

20
00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:59.057
already done so and complete the exercise called

21
00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:00.935
exercise 11, educations needs.

22
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.374
And if you have any questions as always

23
00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:03.363
please let me know.

24
00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.196
Thank you.
