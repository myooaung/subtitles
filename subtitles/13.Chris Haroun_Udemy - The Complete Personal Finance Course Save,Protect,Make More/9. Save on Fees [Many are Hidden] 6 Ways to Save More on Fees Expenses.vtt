00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:14.240
<v ->Fees and fee related expenses.</v>

2
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.935
Tip number one.

3
00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:17.935
Argue all fines, period.

4
00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:20.117
Okay?

5
00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:21.824
If it's a speeding ticket,

6
00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:25.077
go to court if applicable and appropriate where you live.

7
00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:29.035
And ask the judge to make the fine lower.

8
00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.347
And I've done this.

9
00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:34.264
I've saved 50% or so on a couple occasions

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.941
when I had to go to court to argue speeding tickets,

11
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:38.774
et cetera.

12
00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:39.607
And it's really important,

13
00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:42.549
because when we talk about insurance later in the course,

14
00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.052
if you don't appeal these fines,

15
00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:48.136
sometimes it can impact how much insurance you're

16
00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.035
gonna pay in the future,

17
00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:52.733
which can lead up to literally thousands and thousands

18
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.013
of dollars over time.

19
00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:55.943
And all you gotta do is ask.

20
00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:59.112
You know, appeal all fines as most people don't do this.

21
00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:03.144
So just ask often like Steve Jobs says per this video.

22
00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:05.384
And pause me if you wanna watch this video.

23
00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:08.533
If not, fast forward to this time here

24
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.208
to watch the next tip.

25
00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.821
<v ->I've actually always found something to be very true,</v>

26
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:16.757 line:15% 
which is most people don't get those experiences,

27
00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:18.590 line:15% 
'cause they never ask.

28
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.563
I've never found anybody that didn't wanna

29
00:01:21.563 --> 00:01:24.228
help me if I asked them for help.

30
00:01:24.228 --> 00:01:25.061
I always call 'em up.

31
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.760
I called up, this will date me,

32
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.596
but I called up Bill Hewlett when I was 12 years old,

33
00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:31.471
and he lived in Palo Alto.

34
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.198
His number was still in the phone book.

35
00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:34.180
And he answered the phone himself.

36
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.013
He was like, yes?

37
00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:36.709
I said hi, I'm Steve Jobs, I'm 12 years old.

38
00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.992
I'm a student in high school,

39
00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:41.403
and I wanna build a frequency counter.

40
00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:44.315
And I was wondering if you had any spare parts I could have.

41
00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:45.616
And he laughed,

42
00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:46.991
and he gave me the spare parts

43
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.131
to build this frequency counter,

44
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.490
and he gave me a job that summer in Hewlett Packard

45
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.825
working on the assembly line putting nuts and bolts

46
00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:54.565
together on frequency counters.

47
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.549
He got me a job in the place that built them,

48
00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.627
and I was in heaven.

49
00:01:57.627 --> 00:02:00.987
And I've never found anyone who said no

50
00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.525
or hung up the phone when I called.

51
00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:04.912
I just asked.

52
00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:06.052
And when people ask me,

53
00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:07.605
I try to be as responsive,

54
00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:11.492
you know to pay that debt of gratitude back.

55
00:02:11.492 --> 00:02:14.384
Most people never pick up the phone and call.

56
00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.546
Most people never ask.

57
00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:17.627
And that's what separates sometimes the people

58
00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:20.901
that do things from the people that just dream about them.

59
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.068
You gotta act,

60
00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.109
and you've gotta be willing to fail.

61
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.360
You've gotta be willing to crash and burn,

62
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.531
you know with people on the phone,

63
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:32.389
with starting a company, with whatever.

64
00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.101
If you're afraid of failing, you won't get very far.

65
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:39.952
<v ->Fees and fee related charges expenses tip number two.</v>

66
00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:42.395
Eliminate many bank charges tips.

67
00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.228
Okay?

68
00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:45.456
Never use bank machines from other banks

69
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:48.219
given how ridiculous the fees are getting now.

70
00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.797
They charge a fortune now.

71
00:02:49.797 --> 00:02:52.069
And we're gonna do an exercise later in the course

72
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.792
at this point here that will help us change

73
00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:59.237
to a bank account where the fees are way way lower

74
00:02:59.237 --> 00:03:00.528
and hopefully where your money

75
00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:03.028
is insured by your government.

76
00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:08.090
Fees and fee related charge expenses number three.

77
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.515
Ignore the media and all advertisings tip.

78
00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:15.184
Anybody interviewed on a finance program is biased.

79
00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:17.296
I'm not saying they're unethical,

80
00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.176
but they're biased if they're discussing an investment,

81
00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.331
because they own that investment,

82
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.325
or they work for that company,

83
00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:26.000
or they have a partnership

84
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.837
with the investment company, et cetera.

85
00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:30.299
And just please form your own opinions

86
00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.067
and ignore commercials and people

87
00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:35.440
that speak gooder than us on TV.

88
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.691
Better than us, I know.

89
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:40.229
Nobody is smarter than you, I really believe that.

90
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:41.701
And if you want,

91
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:45.371
you can pause this video and also watch this short video

92
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.037
from Steve Jobs on this topic.

93
00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:49.529
If you don't wanna watch it,

94
00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.048
fast forward to this point in this lecture.

95
00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:52.881
Thank you.

96
00:03:56.283 --> 00:03:58.533
<v ->The thing I would say is,</v>

97
00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:04.513 line:15% 
when you grow up, you tend to get told that the world

98
00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:07.680 line:15% 
is the way it is and your life is just

99
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:10.856
to live your life inside the world.

100
00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:13.863
Try not to bash into the walls too much.

101
00:04:13.863 --> 00:04:15.592
Try to have a nice family life.

102
00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:18.092
Have fun, save a little money.

103
00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.440
But life, that's a very limited life.

104
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.427
Life can be much broader once you discover once simple fact.

105
00:04:27.427 --> 00:04:30.448
And that is everything around you that you call life

106
00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:34.587
was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

107
00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.057
And you can change it.

108
00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:37.040
You can influence it.

109
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.177
You can build your own things that other people can use.

110
00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:44.549
And the minute that you understand that you can poke life

111
00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:46.063
and actually something will,

112
00:04:46.063 --> 00:04:46.931
you know if you push in,

113
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.708
something will pop out the other side.

114
00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:52.848
That you can change it, you can mold it.

115
00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:54.426
That's maybe the most important.

116
00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:57.285
<v ->Fees and fee related charges expenses tip number four.</v>

117
00:04:57.285 --> 00:04:59.716
Mutual funds are a rip-off tip.

118
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.555
We're gonna talk about mutual funds in a lot more detail

119
00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:04.345
in the make money portion of the course

120
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:06.597
which is in part three.

121
00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:09.637
But I wanted to put this on your radar screen right now.

122
00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:13.648
95% of mutual funds underperform the stock market indexes.

123
00:05:13.648 --> 00:05:15.824
And mutual funds have so many hidden fees

124
00:05:15.824 --> 00:05:17.947
that cost you a lot of money.

125
00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:20.283
And why do we buy mutual funds anyway

126
00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:22.395
given what I just mentioned?

127
00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:23.557
Because mutual fund companies

128
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:25.979
spend a fortune in advertising,

129
00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.069
and they are very powerful when it comes

130
00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.059
to government influence with campaign donations, et cetera.

131
00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.016
And so instead of buying mutual funds, only buy ETFs

132
00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:38.597
which stands for exchange traded funds.

133
00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:42.757
And you can buy ETFs from amazing companies like Vanguard

134
00:05:42.757 --> 00:05:46.597
for incredibly smaller fees compared to mutual funds.

135
00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:49.509
And you can buy ETFs for all major stock market indexes,

136
00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.956
commodities, sectors, country-based investments, et cetera.

137
00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:56.773
And just like how we spoke about buying generic

138
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.704
instead of brand name products.

139
00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:00.464
You know, please do the same with ETFs

140
00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:01.945
instead of mutual funds.

141
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:05.037
And we're gonna do many many many exercises on this topic

142
00:06:05.037 --> 00:06:07.749
in part three of the course.

143
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:09.819
Tip number five.

144
00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.019
Stamps cost you a fortune, so eliminate them.

145
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.165
Try to pay every single bill if you can online

146
00:06:16.165 --> 00:06:17.819
and save on stamps.

147
00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.993
Every small amount adds up to a lot of money

148
00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:20.826
in the long run.

149
00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:21.659
Right?

150
00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.792
And if you wanna understand how much money

151
00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:25.221
you will save on this,

152
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.675
then open up exercise number one in the course,

153
00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.533
and just play around with the savings you will have

154
00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:33.104
in your lifetime on stamps.

155
00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:36.164
And we can really help the environment this way as well,

156
00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:37.880
especially if we receive all

157
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.751
of our statements electronically.

158
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:42.001
Tip number six.

159
00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.042
Use cash only.

160
00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:47.855
Do you really need credit cards?

161
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:50.149
If you paid for everything using cash,

162
00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.623
I bet you we would spend a lot less.

163
00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:53.456
So if you want,

164
00:06:53.456 --> 00:06:57.412
consider canceling all or many of your credit cards.
