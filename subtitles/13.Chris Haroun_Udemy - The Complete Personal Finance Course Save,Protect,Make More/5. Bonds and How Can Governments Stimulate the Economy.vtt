00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.085
<v ->We talked about monetary policy,</v>

2
00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.720
which is the policy of controlling

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.316
everything to do with money and currencies,

4
00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:11.195
like interest rates, inflation, money supply, et cetera.

5
00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:13.211
And, usually, central banks in countries,

6
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:15.356
or the federal reserve in the United States,

7
00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:18.315
is responsible for monetary policy.

8
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:19.801
Let's move on now and talk about

9
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:21.781
something called fiscal policy,

10
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.392
which is basically how governments

11
00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:26.340
try to stimulate or improve the economy

12
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.061
by spending money that is collected by taxes

13
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.416
or money that it has borrowed.

14
00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:34.701
And the money usually comes from

15
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.901
citizens like you and I as we have paid taxes,

16
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:39.847
or you and I buy bonds from the

17
00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:42.832
government as an investment for us.

18
00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:46.046
So, when we buy a bond the government

19
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.525
promises to pay us money back plus interest.

20
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:51.608
And they use that money,

21
00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:54.980
that they got from us when we bought that bond,

22
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.334
to make the economy grow

23
00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.785
or to fund projects that should

24
00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:02.468
benefit the economy, like building a bridge

25
00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:05.446
or for, unfortunately funding wars,

26
00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:07.242
which, for what it's worth, can

27
00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:09.270
really help the economy grow.

28
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.856
And war, again, for what it's worth,

29
00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:15.983
can help the stock markets as well, in that country.

30
00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:18.692
We know that when it comes to monetary policy

31
00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:20.175
the government can help the economy

32
00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:22.334
by lowering interest rates,

33
00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.889
but with fiscal policy, the government

34
00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:28.737
spends money to help stimulate the economy.

35
00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:31.016
And I think it makes most sense

36
00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:33.274
for governments to spend a lot

37
00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:35.997
of money building roads, or bridges,

38
00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:40.432
or bullet trains, or next-generation transportation systems

39
00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.550
when the economy is contracted.

40
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.071
Now, recall that the definition

41
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.601
of a recession is when GDP, or gross domestic product,

42
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.543
contracts for two quarters in a row, year over year.

43
00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:57.859
Now, a depression is defined, by some economists,

44
00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.359
as meaning "two years of GDP contraction."

45
00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:05.035
So, that means eight quarters in a row.

46
00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:08.109
So, who is in charge of fiscal policy?

47
00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:09.708
In the Unites States, it is the

48
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.860
Secretary of the Treasury who heads

49
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.017
up the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

50
00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:16.486
And this person's goal is to manage

51
00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:18.659
the government's revenue,

52
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.070
and to make sure that the economy is growing,

53
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.542
and that the country's financial situation is doing well,

54
00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:28.134
meaning they look at tax policies,

55
00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:31.279
the amount of debt the country has, et cetera.

56
00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.599
And the first treasury secretary in the 1700s

57
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.914
and the person that made many

58
00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:37.846
of the policies and financial systems

59
00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:39.784
and rules, that we still use today

60
00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.492
in the United States, was Alexander Hamilton,

61
00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:45.608
who is on the front of this U.S. ten-dollar bill.

62
00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:48.194
Unlike Kieth Richards, from the Rolling Stones,

63
00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:51.184
who is on the front of the American twenty-dollar bill.

64
00:02:51.184 --> 00:02:53.174
And, I'm kidding, obviously, about Kieth Richards,

65
00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:54.016
(laughs)

66
00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:54.979
this section can be a little bit

67
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.562
dry without my awful attempts at dad humor.

68
00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:01.629
And, as you can see, the Treasury

69
00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.554
billing is on the back of the ten-dollar bill.

70
00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:07.963
Okay, lets get back to fiscal policy.

71
00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:11.421
Countries are not run like companies are.

72
00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:14.210
When a country has economic problems,

73
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.777
quite often they run a huge deficit,

74
00:03:16.777 --> 00:03:19.065
which means they might cut taxes

75
00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.126
in order to stimulate the economy

76
00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:22.743
or to stimulate economic demand

77
00:03:22.743 --> 00:03:26.253
by enticing consumers to spend more money,

78
00:03:26.253 --> 00:03:29.146
which helps to stimulate the economy.

79
00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:32.143
Similarly, countries can stimulate

80
00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:35.405
their economy by spending a lot of money

81
00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:39.026
on building roads or bridges or trains, et cetera,

82
00:03:39.026 --> 00:03:42.389
during very difficult economic times.

83
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.353
And so when countries take on

84
00:03:44.353 --> 00:03:46.485
more than they can make in taxes,

85
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:48.108
this is called a deficit,

86
00:03:48.108 --> 00:03:50.690
and the opposite of this is called a surplus.

87
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.418
And it's very controversial to have

88
00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:55.188
deficits for a very long period of time.

89
00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:59.043
And I remember during the crisis of 2008

90
00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:02.094
governments created massive stimulus policies,

91
00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:04.278
which some younger people said,

92
00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:07.292
"It's not a stimulus; it's a steal-from-us."

93
00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.686
And I understand that concern.

94
00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:10.681
It's a tough call.

95
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:12.912
But desperate times always call

96
00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:14.030
for desperate measures,

97
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.318
and governments ran out of monetary

98
00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:18.749
policy bullets in 2008.

99
00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:20.224
And they massively cut interest

100
00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:21.693
rates almost to zero,

101
00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:24.267
and the global economy was still

102
00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:27.780
in a, nearly unprecedented, free fall.

103
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.696
And the government here, in the United States,

104
00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:33.025
created unprecedented fiscal policies,

105
00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:35.255
like buying cars from people,

106
00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:37.994
which was called Cash for Clunkers.

107
00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.198
And, at that point, it seemed like

108
00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:43.636
monetary and fiscal policies didn't work,

109
00:04:43.636 --> 00:04:47.524
which was an economic, catastrophic conundrum.

110
00:04:47.524 --> 00:04:49.797
And the stock markets were crashing

111
00:04:49.797 --> 00:04:50.889
all over the world.

112
00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.982
It was just terrible.

113
00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:54.544
And, eventually, the government

114
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.586
in the United States declared it illegal

115
00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.551
to short or bet against more than

116
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:02.192
800 of the largest companies on

117
00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:05.033
the major U.S. stock market exchanges.

118
00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:07.938
The government then pumped a ridiculous

119
00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:10.044
amount of money into the banking system

120
00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:13.060
by buying troubled assets from banks

121
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.712
in huge, unprecedented proportions.

122
00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:18.199
And this was called the

123
00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.449
Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP,

124
00:05:22.317 --> 00:05:23.903
which was part of the

125
00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:28.081
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

126
00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:32.014
When the Department of the Treasury created TARP,

127
00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:34.005
this initially gave them the ability

128
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.838
to buy back or to create insurance

129
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.947
on 700 billion dollars of troubled assets,

130
00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:44.703
many of which were financial instruments

131
00:05:44.703 --> 00:05:48.248
tied to low-quality mortgage securities.

132
00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:49.216
We'll talk about mortgages in

133
00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:50.607
a lot of detail soon.

134
00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:52.992
But we need to understand this first.

135
00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:55.541
What happened, was that the banks

136
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.328
got more money, of course,

137
00:05:58.328 --> 00:06:01.325
but they then did not want to lend it to anybody.

138
00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:02.646
How ridiculous.

139
00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:04.998
I know this firsthand because

140
00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:08.323
none of us could get our mortgages approved.

141
00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:11.768
Then, the government pressured the banks to lend us,

142
00:06:11.768 --> 00:06:14.511
and thank God they did because they lent us money.

143
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:16.864
And I remember at the time it was so hard man.

144
00:06:16.864 --> 00:06:18.255
My neighbors, on the left side

145
00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:21.094
and the right side of mine in 2008, foreclosed,

146
00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:23.181
meaning the banks took over their houses

147
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:26.123
because poor guys couldn't

148
00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:28.936
afford to make their mortgage payments.

149
00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:30.782
And I actually, this is true,

150
00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:33.746
I got down on my knees and I begged

151
00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:36.190
my mortgage broker to let me refinance

152
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.147
my mortgage at a lower rate then.

153
00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:39.279
I had to beg.

154
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.196
I had to beg.

155
00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:43.723
And, miraculously, the global economy recovered,

156
00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:46.981
but there's a generation of people

157
00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:50.485
that got shafted and had trouble finding jobs,

158
00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:51.954
and the fact that interest rates

159
00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:54.846
are still very low, historically speaking,

160
00:06:54.846 --> 00:06:57.687
is a signal that things are not that great yet.

161
00:06:57.687 --> 00:07:01.002
And recall that, when rates are very low,

162
00:07:01.002 --> 00:07:05.584
then higher risk investments do relatively well,

163
00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:08.503
like more speculative stocks and real estate

164
00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:11.272
in many parts of the world.

165
00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:12.925
And because if rates are high

166
00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.158
then you'll just put you money

167
00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:16.381
in the bank anyway and earn the interest.

168
00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:19.091
So, if there is a huge deficit

169
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:22.926
in some of the larger economies in the world,

170
00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:24.402
then why don't governments just

171
00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.892
raise taxes, especially on the very very rich?

172
00:07:27.892 --> 00:07:31.565
And I agree there should be, to a certain extent,

173
00:07:31.565 --> 00:07:34.684
higher taxes on the higher tax brackets,

174
00:07:34.684 --> 00:07:36.589
but there are so many reasons why

175
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:39.172
many politicians don't do this.

176
00:07:40.444 --> 00:07:42.849
One of the reasons they don't do this,

177
00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:46.748
is they might not get re-elected if they do this.

178
00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:49.167
So, why do governments spend too much,

179
00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.273
aside from the fact that they want

180
00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.489
to get re-elected?

181
00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:58.033
Well, in the 1930s, during the Great Recession,

182
00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:00.970
for quite a while the government did nothing,

183
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.661
and thought that, eventually, the

184
00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:04.994
economy would get better,

185
00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:07.802
and then a brilliant Cambridge University

186
00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:10.385
guy, named John Maynard Keynes.

187
00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.412
said that governments should spend

188
00:08:13.412 --> 00:08:16.246
a lot of money when the economy is bad,

189
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:19.645
and this will get us out of extreme recessions.

190
00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:21.699
Keynes was right.

191
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:23.747
He was right, and this is referred

192
00:08:23.747 --> 00:08:26.216
to now as Keynesian economics,

193
00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:29.707
which means that active fiscal policy

194
00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:32.366
and monetary policy can rescue

195
00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.583
a bad economy in the short run.

196
00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:38.060
In the long run, who knows?

197
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.237
But for years people have been saying

198
00:08:40.237 --> 00:08:43.565
that running deficits is a bad thing,

199
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.424
and Ronald Reagan, when I was a kid,

200
00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:48.713
back in the 80s, was a big advocate of this.

201
00:08:48.713 --> 00:08:50.280
And, heck, I don't know, maybe

202
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.425
2008 occurred partially due to

203
00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:54.466
overspending, actually, it definitely did.

204
00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:56.448
But it is what it is.

205
00:08:56.448 --> 00:08:58.586
And some of the larger economies

206
00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:00.556
will continue to run massive deficits

207
00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:02.929
for the foreseeable future.

208
00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:05.256
And so, we have to ask ourselves,

209
00:09:05.256 --> 00:09:07.661
"How can they get away with this?"

210
00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:09.501
Because they still make interest

211
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:11.801
payments on their debt.

212
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.936
Okay?

213
00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:15.173
If they don't make interest payments

214
00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:18.319
on their debts, then, one day,

215
00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:19.679
if the don't make these payments,

216
00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:21.416
they will default on their debts,

217
00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:25.491
which will be a catastrophe, given globalization

218
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:29.528
and the fact that all major economies are connected.

219
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:33.195
As one big economy, that has a huge deficit,

220
00:09:34.109 --> 00:09:35.910
is only allowed to do so because

221
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.003
another major economy lets them do it,

222
00:09:38.003 --> 00:09:40.155
they're joined at the hip.

223
00:09:40.155 --> 00:09:42.221
And I want to quickly mention why

224
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:43.781
the United States spent so much

225
00:09:43.781 --> 00:09:45.883
money and cut taxes to try to get

226
00:09:45.883 --> 00:09:48.522
out of the 2008 recession

227
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:51.746
and some other major economies did not.

228
00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:53.669
Well, what happened in the United States,

229
00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:54.984
and you really have to understand

230
00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:56.647
government policies when it comes to

231
00:09:56.647 --> 00:09:58.505
investing in bonds longer-term,

232
00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:00.181
that's why we're going through this, Okay?

233
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:02.487
But the head of the Federal Reserve

234
00:10:02.487 --> 00:10:04.989
in the United States in 2008 was

235
00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:06.463
a guy named Ben Bernanke.

236
00:10:06.463 --> 00:10:09.805
And I mention him because he did his thesis,

237
00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:11.916
when was at Princeton University,

238
00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:14.393
on depressionary economics,

239
00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:17.163
and had he not had extreme views

240
00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:19.893
given his tutelage, it's debatable,

241
00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:22.044
but perhaps the U.S. economy today

242
00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:23.826
would be underperforming like some

243
00:10:23.826 --> 00:10:25.391
other very large economies are today.
