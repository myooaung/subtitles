00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.640
Now that is it

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.610
for this module.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.230
Now, we're leveraging a backend for fetching our meals

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.800
and for sending our orders there.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.720
We did add a form with validation,

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.410
which we have to fill out.

7
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.470
And we're there for practice the key concepts

8
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.330
and aspects we learned about

9
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.300
over the last cores sections.

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.840
Now, of course, there's a lot which you could fine tune

11
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.890
or change.

12
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.880
As I mentioned, you can implement more elaborate

13
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.540
foreign validation.

14
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.380
You can definitely add more complexity to this project.

15
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.800
But my goal with this project here,

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
was to dive into the essence of those previous sections

17
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.950
so that we practice the core concepts

18
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.700
taught in those sections.

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.920
Again, I can only encourage you to dive deeper,

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.510
build some custom hooks,

21
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.550
experiment with this project.

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.720
Maybe build your own project as well.

23
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.440
That's always a great practice to ensure

24
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.370
that you get better and better with React.

25
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.860
In this course, however, we got so much content,

26
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.360
and I don't wanna waste your time.

27
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.770
Therefore, I'll try to find the right balance

28
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.170
between diving deep when I introduce a concept,

29
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.640
and then practicing the core takeaways

30
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.380
and the core concepts in practical projects like this.

31
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.620
And therefore, let's now move on

32
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.223
and let's dive deeper into React.
