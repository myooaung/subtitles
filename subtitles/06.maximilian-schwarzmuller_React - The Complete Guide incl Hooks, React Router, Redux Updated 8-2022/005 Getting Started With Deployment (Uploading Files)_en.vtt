1
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.560
Now that we built the app for production,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.380
the next step is that we wanna take that code

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.980
in the build folder and move it onto a real server.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.770
We wanna upload it to some hosting provider,

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.920
to a real server, so that it is made available

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.930
to visitors from all over the world.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.228
And now when it comes to uploading that code,

8
00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:27.340
there is one super important thing to realize.

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.950
A React Single Page Application

10
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.750
or any Single Page Application actually,

11
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.976
no matter which framework you used, is a static website

12
00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:41.403
which it means that it's only made up of HTML, CSS,

13
00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:44.333
and browser site JavaScript code.

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.520
There is no server side code involved.

15
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.670
If we take a look at the output in the build folder

16
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.870
then we have a couple of images and conflict files here

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.730
and we have one HTML file, and in the static folder

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.970
we have CSS and JavaScript.

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.310
And the JavaScript code here is not server side

20
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.580
JavaScript code, it's not node js code,

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.240
it is client side, browser side JavaScript code.

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.640
And therefore this is code

23
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.275
which executes in the browser, hence the entire build folder

24
00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:20.884
contains no code at all that needed

25
00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:23.630
to be executed on a server.

26
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.560
No node js code, no PHP code, nothing.

27
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.530
You can of course also build your own backend,

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.910
your own API instead of Firebase, which we used

29
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.858
as a dummy API in this course,

30
00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:39.260
but that's a totally different story.

31
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.428
I do cover this in my Mern course, for example,

32
00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:45.623
but when it comes to just a react application,

33
00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:49.760
it is just such a static website

34
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
and there is no server side code involved.

35
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.430
And therefore, when we want to deploy

36
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.190
such a react single page application,

37
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.030
we need a static side host.

38
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.210
So we need a hosting provider

39
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.720
an offering for hosting a static website.

40
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.320
We don't need a hosting provider that allows us to

41
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.200
run server side code

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.090
like no JS or PHP or anything like that.

43
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.540
We don't need that here.

44
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600
Now, how do you find such a host?

45
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.850
Well, for example, you can simply Google

46
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.550
for a static website hosting provider

47
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.550
and you'll find different comparisons, certainly

48
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.988
also some advertisements and you'll find different results

49
00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:34.839
for hosting providers that help you

50
00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.610
with hosting your static site.

51
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.696
For example, Google has a built in service.

52
00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:45.052
AWS has a service that helps you with hosting static sites,

53
00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:48.810
the S free service to be precise.

54
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.413
If you click on here, you can learn more about that.

55
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.410
But here to give you an example, I will go

56
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.610
with Firebase again, but it's just one possible option.

57
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.170
And just because we're using Firebase

58
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.899
as a dummy backend does not mean

59
00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:07.180
that you need to use Firebase for hosting.

60
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.770
You're totally free there.

61
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.330
You can use any hosting provider.

62
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.670
You don't have to use Firebase, not in general

63
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.730
and also not specifically for this demo here.

64
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.060
I simply picked it because it is fairly easy to use

65
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.340
and if we have a look at the pricing,

66
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.680
we can get started for free here

67
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.080
which is also quite nice.

68
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.460
Now to host a site on Firebase,

69
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.130
you need to create an account there, a Google account

70
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.163
and then log into Firebase.

71
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.390
And here I'll use the project we worked on

72
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.193
before in this course already.

73
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.444
And here in that Firebase project,

74
00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:45.520
you can simply create a new one

75
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.378
if you don't have one already, you can pick hosting.

76
00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:51.590
And if you then click on get started,

77
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.140
you'll learn more about how that works.

78
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.294
And it all starts

79
00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:59.643
by installing a certain tool on your system.

80
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.774
So I will just copy that command here,

81
00:04:03.774 --> 00:04:07.560
go back back to my command line here

82
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.380
and then run this command.

83
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.700
On Mac iOS and Linux,

84
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.300
you might need to add pseudo in front of it.

85
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.810
On Windows you don't, to give it the right permissions.

86
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.649
So here I'll add that and enter my password.

87
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.840
And then now this installs this Firebase tools software

88
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.853
on my system.

89
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.770
Now because of dash G, it installs it globally.

90
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.850
So that is now not a project specific tool

91
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.590
and it's also not a react specific tool.

92
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.345
It's just a general piece of software provided by Firebase

93
00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:43.893
for deploying any kind of static site to Firebase.

94
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.070
So let's wait for this installation to finish now

95
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.920
and now that it is finished,

96
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.153
if we go back to Firebase, we can click on next here.

97
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.980
And you see that as a next step

98
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.260
you need to log in.

99
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.930
So you now need to run this command, which should now work.

100
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.889
Now that Firebase tools was installed to log

101
00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.943
into your Firebase account.

102
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.510
Now, I am already logged in here.

103
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.690
For you, it might prompt you

104
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.340
for your credentials in the command line here

105
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.270
or it opens a browser tab where you need to log in.

106
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.790
And once you did that, you should also be able to

107
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.883
continue here in the command prompt.

108
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.450
Now once you are logged in, you need to run Firebase in it.

109
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.710
And now this needs to be executed in your project folder

110
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.640
so in this overall react project folder.

111
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.600
Now since I'm using this integrated terminal here,

112
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.050
I am already navigated in there

113
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.883
and hence, I can just run it here.

114
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.230
Now, this command, when you execute it

115
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.410
will ask you a couple of questions.

116
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.010
For example, it will ask us

117
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.800
which Firebase features we want to use

118
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.380
because you can use this Firebase tools

119
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.280
software to administer other Firebase features as well.

120
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.660
But here, we just want to go to hosting and hit space.

121
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.820
The space button on our keyboard to select this option.

122
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.490
And that is the only option we need to select here.

123
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.670
So once you've selected hosting, hit enter

124
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.940
and now you need to choose whether you want to

125
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.390
create a new Firebase project or use an existing one.

126
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.520
And I'll go with an existing one here

127
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.780
and then select this project

128
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.043
which I also opened here in my browser console.

129
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.480
So select that project and hit enter.

130
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.720
And now it asks us a very important question here.

131
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.540
It asks what we want to use as our public directory.

132
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.680
And that simply means

133
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.390
that it wants to know where the files are

134
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.160
that it should deploy.

135
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.094
Now, by default, it uses the public folder here

136
00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.060
but that would be wrong here

137
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.865
because public is a folder in our project, but

138
00:06:56.865 --> 00:07:00.160
it is a folder where we can change

139
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.930
the images we use and so on.

140
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.900
The actual output which we want to deploy, lives

141
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.100
in the build folder, as you learned.

142
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.060
So here we don't want to use the default, but instead

143
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.260
manually enter build here

144
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.190
since that's the folder name that contains our files

145
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.350
that should be deployed.

146
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.640
So that's super important.

147
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.070
And if you use another hosting provider like AWS as free

148
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.310
you also want to upload the content

149
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.780
of your build folder to that hosting provider.

150
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.880
Now, as a next step, it conveniently asks us

151
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.280
wherever we want to configure this app as a single page app.

152
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.927
So if you want to rewrite all URLs to index HTML

153
00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:45.190
but that can be a confusing question here.

154
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.330
Why does this matter?

155
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.563
And what is it about?
