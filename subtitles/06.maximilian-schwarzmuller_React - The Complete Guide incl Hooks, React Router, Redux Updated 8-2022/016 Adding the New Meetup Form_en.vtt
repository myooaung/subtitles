00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.700
So for this NewMeetup component

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.660
we again create a function here a component function

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.270
like the NewMeetupPage function.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.570
And of course, as before we need to export this

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.580
so that NextJS is able to find this

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.890
and then we can render our content here.

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.050
Now our content in this case

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.850
should be the NewMeetupForum component

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.860
which I prepared in advance, which renders a form

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.560
with some controls, with some styles attached

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.840
using CSS modules here for styling.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.690
I'll come back to that in a second, that is supported

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.510
by NextJS out of the box, which is really convenient.

14
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.290
And then here we get that data.

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.900
We extract that data, the user entered, with help offer Refs

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.940
which has a built in React feature

17
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.370
has nothing to do with NextJS.

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.630
And then we basically call a function which we expect to get

19
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.570
on the onAddMeetup prop.

20
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.050
And to that function

21
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.360
we then pass the collected meetup data.

22
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.173
So this object with all the collected data.

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.130
And hence now in this newMeetup index JS file here

24
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.647
we can use that component and we can import newMeetupForm

25
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.960
from going up two levels to leave the pages folder diving

26
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.453
into the components folder, Meetups, and then newMeetupForm.

27
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.110
And then we can return newMeetupForm

28
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.563
this component like this if we want to.

29
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.520
Now as I just mentioned, in this component

30
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.580
we do expect that there will be a onAddMeetup prop

31
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.860
which holds a function that we can call.

32
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.320
And hence we might want to prepare

33
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.550
this function here as well.

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.950
We can add our addMeetupHandler function

35
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.500
or however you want to name it and then pass a pointer

36
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.500
after this function to the onAddMeetup prop a pointer

37
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.580
and not the result of executing it.

38
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.430
So no parentheses here, because this function

39
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.650
should be executed eventually from inside that component,

40
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.723
when the form is submitted as it turns out.

41
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.733
Here, we then get our enteredMeetupData.

42
00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:23.570
And we can, for example, for the moment

43
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.923
simply log this to the console.

44
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.090
And with that out of the way, if we go back again

45
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.100
we can visit localhost3000/newMeetup

46
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.790
and we see this form again,

47
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.010
not to final styling a bit too wide,

48
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.970
but we see the form.

49
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.440
And if I opened the developer tools here

50
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.440
and I enter test and test, or here, we actually need a URL.

51
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.140
So I will just quickly grab that URL

52
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.700
which I set up for my dummy data, this URL

53
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.710
I'll grab that and use this here Test Address.

54
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.260
And This is a test.

55
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.650
If we enter this data and we click Add Meetup

56
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.370
we see this object logged to the console.

57
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.630
So handling form submission works.

58
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.020
Obviously we're not doing anything with that data.

59
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.470
At this point, we're not navigating away

60
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.590
and we are going to do all these things later

61
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.430
but this again just shows us how we can use pages

62
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.290
and also mix regular React components into those pages.

63
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.110
And then, with that, that's a great start

64
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.130
but now we're already facing a couple of issues here.

65
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.900
We've got a lot of missing functionality, of course.

66
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.970
And for example, we also have no way

67
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.710
for navigating between pages

68
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.880
and we have no general layout around our pages.

69
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.190
Every page takes up the entire width.

70
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.120
We get no header above them.

71
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.053
And that is probably something we want to change.
