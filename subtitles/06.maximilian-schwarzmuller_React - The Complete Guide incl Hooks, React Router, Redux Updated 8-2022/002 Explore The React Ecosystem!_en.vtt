00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.250
Now besides practicing,

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.800
which is a super important next step,

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.660
I can also only encourage you

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.870
to explore the React Ecosystem.

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.270
Because in this course, I gave you a great foundation

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.130
and we had a look at a couple of key third-party libraries

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.250
which you also need in a lot of React projects,

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.500
for example Redux and the React Router.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.510
But there are so many other projects and libraries out there

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.470
which are worth exploring

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.790
to make your life as a React developer easier

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.150
or to build brand new kinds of applications

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.260
which you maybe didn't even consider up to this point.

14
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.940
For example, in this course you learned about Next.js

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.150
which is a super amazing framework

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.900
but also consider exploring Gatsby.js.

17
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.910
Gatsby is another library for React,

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.480
so which builds up on React,

19
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.890
which acts as a static site generator using React.

20
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.570
And you can learn more about Gatsby

21
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.540
on their official page of course,

22
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.580
but in the end Gatsby allows you

23
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.340
to leverage your React knowledge

24
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120
to then produce static websites

25
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.930
which only consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

26
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.230
but which are pre-rendered in advance

27
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.160
so that search engines see what your users will see

28
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.770
before JavaScript code is executed in the browser

29
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.500
and therefore Gatsby can help you offer

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.460
a better user experience,

31
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.430
it can help you with search engine optimization,

32
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.470
and it can act as a nice alternative to Next.js

33
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.260
which I did cover in this course.

34
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.860
So definitely also consider exploring that.

35
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.720
Another interesting project and library

36
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.520
you might wanna look into is Preact,

37
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.730
so that's React with a P in front of it.

38
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.480
Now Preact, in the end, is React

39
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.350
with a way smaller footprint.

40
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.390
It has the same API,

41
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.887
so the same functionalities React offers,

42
00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:09.250
for example, it has all those React hooks,

43
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.949
but it's way smaller.

44
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.070
Now this of course sounds like magic

45
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.070
and it sounds like you should always use Preact,

46
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.420
but of course, it achieves this very small size

47
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.030
by stripping out internal functionality

48
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.920
React has built-in,

49
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.210
functionality that might offer a smoother user experience

50
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.600
once your app is up and running.

51
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.960
but that is something you'll have to find out on your own.

52
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.980
Diving into Preact and playing around with it,

53
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340
might definitely worth a thought

54
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.220
because you might not be building an application

55
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.310
that needs all those built-in optimizations

56
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.220
React has to offer, and in that case,

57
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.550
Preact might be a great alternative.

58
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.910
So that's another very interesting

59
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.190
third-party library and project

60
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.050
which you might wanna explore

61
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.090
now that you did learn about React in this course.

62
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.360
And then I got one other extremely nice project

63
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.250
which I absolutely recommend that you take a look at,

64
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.400
and that's React Native.

65
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.250
Now React Native is a framework for React

66
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.260
also built by Facebook,

67
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.740
so by the same company that's responsible for React,

68
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.420
that actually allows you to build mobile apps

69
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.870
for iOS and Android with React.

70
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.100
And that's of course super amazing,

71
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.070
because that means that you can use

72
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.340
the knowledge you already have

73
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.830
and you cannot just build websites and web apps with it,

74
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.060
but you can also build mobile apps with it.

75
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.950
And you don't need to learn

76
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.190
Android or iOS development or programming languages

77
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.710
for those devices,

78
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.860
you can really just use what you already know,

79
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.090
JavaScript and React.

80
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.720
And I got a complete course on React Native

81
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.220
which you might want to check out

82
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.380
if you wanna learn all about React Native.

83
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.940
But definitely consider

84
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.400
looking into the official webpage at least,

85
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.300
and explore React Native,

86
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.070
if building mobile apps with React

87
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.079
sounds interesting to you.

88
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.459
This is a super amazing project,

89
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.860
and it's a great example for what you can achieve

90
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.620
with your React skills.

91
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.283
You really can build anything.
