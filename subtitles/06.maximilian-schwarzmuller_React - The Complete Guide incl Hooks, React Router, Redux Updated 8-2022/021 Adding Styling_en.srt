1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,630
Now let's continue, and first of all,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,350
I wanna add some styling.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,630
For this, I prepared free dot module dot CSS files,

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,160
which you'll find attached.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,870
The to-do's module CSS, the to-do item,

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,340
and the new to-do dot module CSS files.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,780
And we will simply add them

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,320
like we did it before in this course.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,490
There is nothing TypeScript specific about adding CSS files

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,000
to your component files,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,820
no matter if you use global CSS or CSS modules.

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Here I am CSS modules, hence the naming of these CSS files,

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,470
since we are in a project created by Create React app,

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,530
we got that built in CSS modules support,

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,220
and here we can now import the classes,

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,623
for example from,

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,600
to-do's dot module dot CSS.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
So just as we did it without TypeScript.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,300
And then here on this unordered list,

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,300
we can add the list class, that's sorry, the to-do's class.

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,800
That's the class I defined in

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,023
that to-do's module CSS file.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,990
And we'll do the same in the other files as well.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,990
In the to-do item, TSX file, we can import classes from

25
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:23,160
dot slash to-do item dot module dot CSS.

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,890
And then we add class name dot classes dot item

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,203
to this list item,

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,970
dot item,

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,660
because in this to-do item dot module CSS file,

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,750
I have this item CSS class

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,610
and in the new to-do TSX file,

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,210
we also import classes from

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,180
dot slash new to-do dot module dot CSS.

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,740
And with that imported we can go to the form

35
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,843
and on it, add class name classes dot form.

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,480
And if you do all of that and save everything,

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,880
you should have that look here

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,610
on your screen,

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,380
where you can learn, react,

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,020
and then learn TypeScript.

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,180
And that works just like that.

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,330
And that's now the same app as before,

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,363
just with some styling.
