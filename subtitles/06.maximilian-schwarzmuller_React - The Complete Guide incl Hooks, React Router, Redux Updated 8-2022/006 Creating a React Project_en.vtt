00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:04.290
So let's get started with, React

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.560
and let's dive into that react code,

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.560
and learn how to work with react,

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.070
and how to write react code.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.097
Now in the project I showed you before,

6
00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:15.470
you might've noticed that,

7
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.190
I had a couple of files here,

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.860
in this react project,

9
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.480
and these files are actually Java script files,

10
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.330
but in those files, I then use HTML code.

11
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.220
And that is not something you can normally do.

12
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.470
Normally, you can't add HTML in Java script.

13
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.970
At least not like this.

14
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.840
You can add it as part of a string,

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.570
or have a template literal,

16
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.690
but not just like that.

17
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.993
That's not syntax that would work out of the box.

18
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
And indeed it wouldn't work, just like this.

19
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.470
That's why for working with react,

20
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.110
we set up a project,

21
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.140
that's a little bit more complex,

22
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.470
than a vanilla Java script project.

23
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.980
In the standard Java script project,

24
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.900
I just have a HTML CSS and a JavaScript file,

25
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.700
and in the HTML file,

26
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.600
I simply import those external files,

27
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.480
and then they do their thing.

28
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.080
Because that is all just,

29
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.270
standard modern Java script.

30
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.270
With react, to write react code in a convenient way,

31
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.240
We can't just set up a project like this,

32
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.240
because we want to use this HTML in JavaScript syntax,

33
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.360
and the browser would not understand,

34
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.190
this syntax out of the box.

35
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.350
That's why our react project is a bit more complex,

36
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.190
and involve some more files,

37
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.660
because it involves a so-called built step,

38
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.440
which means to code we write,

39
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.920
will not be the code that ends up in the browser.

40
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.200
We simply write code in a very convenient way,

41
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.070
for us as a developer,

42
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.060
and then behind the scenes,

43
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.050
that code will be transformed,

44
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.730
before it reaches the browser.

45
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.920
And in addition to that build step,

46
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.270
with a modern react project,

47
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.960
we typically also want a development server,

48
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.060
which hosts our running react application locally

49
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.100
on our machine.

50
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.420
And which for example,

51
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.440
updates the page in the browser,

52
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.320
whenever we make changes to our code.

53
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.020
So that we don't have to reload

54
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.720
that page manually all the time.

55
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.230
And because that's the kind of setup we need,

56
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.850
we don't just create a couple

57
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.510
of HTML and JavaScript files.

58
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.400
Instead, we typically create a react project,

59
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.840
with an extra tool that gives us all that,

60
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.980
behind the scenes magic,

61
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.090
added to the project automatically.

62
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.000
And the most popular tool for that,

63
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.870
would be Create React App.

64
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.160
You can simply Google

65
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.910
for a create dash react dash app,

66
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.140
and you either find this entry on the official docs

67
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.420
or disk git hub repository.

68
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.560
In the end, you can use either of the two,

69
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.489
there you learn a bit more about it

70
00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.450
and that you might not need it,

71
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.220
but, in reality for, most react projects you do.

72
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.680
And then you'll learn

73
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.450
how you can set up a project with that tool.

74
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.923
And it's in the end just one easy command.

75
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.510
Now for this command to be executable

76
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.000
on your system though,

77
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.850
you need to install Node JS first.

78
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.310
Now node JS is a JavaScript run time,

79
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.180
that allows you to run jobs outside of the browser.

80
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.520
We don't, write any note JS code with react.

81
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.670
React is not a node JS library or framework.

82
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.170
It is about browser side JavaScript instead.

83
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.450
But we do need node JS,

84
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.540
to install, this create react app tool,

85
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.530
or to use this create react app tool,

86
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.020
and the project, generated by that tool.

87
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.020
will always use node JS behind the scenes,

88
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.920
for this automatically reloading development server

89
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.530
and for some code transformations,

90
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.500
which transformed the code we write,

91
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.980
into code that runs in the browser.

92
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.910
That's why you should visit node.js.org.

93
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.690
And there, install the latest node JS version.

94
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.750
Whatever that version is when you are visiting this.

95
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.500
Simply install the latest version here

96
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.900
by clicking on it.

97
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.700
That will then give you an installer

98
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.650
for your operating system.

99
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.456
It's available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows,

100
00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:34.640
and it should automatically select,

101
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.390
your operating system here.

102
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.010
And then you simply walk through that installer

103
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.550
and install node JS.

104
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.000
Here I'm on macOS,

105
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.010
but the process will in the end be the same on windows.

106
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.530
You can just accept all the defaults.

107
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.900
Don't need to change anything there.

108
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.830
And that will then install node JS on your system.

109
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.710
Now, once that is done, you are ready,

110
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.520
to run this NPX create react at my app, command.

111
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.330
And for this, simply open up your default terminal

112
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.470
or command prompt on windows.

113
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.070
And in there, use the CD command,

114
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.310
to navigate into a folder,

115
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.770
where you wanna create your react project.

116
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.980
Your development folder, your desktop,

117
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.053
anything like that.

118
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.640
Then, once you're in that folder,

119
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.310
once you navigated that they're,

120
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.970
inside of that terminal,

121
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.700
or a command prompt, run NPX,

122
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.650
create dash react dash app,

123
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.950
and then simply, something like,

124
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.950
my first app, or in my case, react dash course,

125
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.870
simply we had entered (indistinct),

126
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.070
and this will now create a new folder named a react course,

127
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.050
in that folder, in which you ran that command.

128
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.770
And here I need to confirm,

129
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.230
that I wanna, temporarily install,

130
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.140
this create react app tool.

131
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.370
And then this folder will be created,

132
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.010
off that name you chose here.

133
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.270
And in that folder,

134
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.490
a brand new react project will be set up for you.

135
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.340
Now, react project sounds like a big thing.

136
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.490
It will still be a simple webpage with Java script,

137
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.730
Java script managed through react in the end.

138
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.570
But because of these transformations, I discussed,

139
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.500
because of data, it will be a project

140
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.550
where all these transformation steps,

141
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.410
are already pre-configured for you.

142
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.360
So that you can focus on the code,

143
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.570
and not on the setup of the project.

144
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.510
Notice can take a short while,

145
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.520
and if you're facing any problems here,

146
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.150
make sure you got no firewall blocking,

147
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.190
outgoing traffic, or anything like that.

148
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.900
No antivirus tool that could be interfering here.

149
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.240
And then at some point, you should be done.

150
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.163
You should see output that looks something like this.

151
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.500
Now with that, we can CD into that,

152
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.600
newly created folder,

153
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.230
and then run NPM start, which is a command,

154
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.860
based on, the node package manager,

155
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.720
which is a tool that was installed,

156
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.240
together with node JS,

157
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.890
which will in the end execute a script,

158
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.480
that was pre-configured

159
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.980
in that created react project.

160
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.980
And when we run this script,

161
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.560
a development server will be started,

162
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.900
as it says here,

163
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.270
which will host this react project.

164
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.880
It should open a new tab

165
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.560
in your browser automatically,

166
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.780
on local host, free thousand,

167
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.960
and display a starting project there, a starting website.

168
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.240
If it didn't, simply manually go

169
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.270
to local hosts free thousand,

170
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.813
or whichever address is shown to you here.

171
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.700
And then you should see something like this.

172
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.220
The exact starting project can change over time.

173
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.610
Since the starting project template can be changed

174
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.890
by the create react app team,

175
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.900
but all you made you should see something like this.

176
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.530
And that's now a little, dummy website,

177
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.290
which was pre-built for us,

178
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.533
and which already exists in that starting project.

179
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.850
Now we're going to get rid

180
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.500
of that starting project here,

181
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.720
and build our own website though,

182
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.693
our own react project.
