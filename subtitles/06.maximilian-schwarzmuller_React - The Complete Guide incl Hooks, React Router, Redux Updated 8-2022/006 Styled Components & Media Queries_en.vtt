00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.520
Now, there is one last thing I want

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.280
to cover when we talk about styling

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.040
and that will be media queries.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.420
Media queries, of course, often are important

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.300
to get the right look.

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.830
At the moment, if we preview this in a mobile device here,

7
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.283
let's say the Pixel 2, doesn't matter which one you use,

8
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.980
this is how it looks like, let me zoom in a bit.

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.940
This is how it looks like and that's definitely all right.

10
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.760
Right, of course, you might want to add more

11
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.260
to make this look good on mobile

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.370
but, from a pure styling perspective, that looks good.

13
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.913
Nothing is going beyond the edges, so that looks okay.

14
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.470
But maybe we want to make sure

15
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.100
that this button actually spans

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.400
the entire width, if we're on a small device.

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.260
And only takes the space it needs,

18
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.120
if we're not on a mobile device.

19
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.590
And that would be a scenario,

20
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.390
where we might want to use a media query.

21
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.960
So, let's go back to the button,

22
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.310
and how can we now add a media query here

23
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.700
when we're using style components?

24
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700
It's actually super simple,

25
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.827
you just add your media query here,

26
00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:04.810
@media, and define your criteria.

27
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.620
For example, min-width 768 pixels.

28
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.390
And now you just put the styles

29
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.700
into that media query that should affect this element

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.950
when that condition here is met.

31
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730
That's all, you need no selector in there, nothing else,

32
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.840
just the styles that should be applied to this component,

33
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.973
if this condition here for this media query is met.

34
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.480
So, here that is actually now the media query

35
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.570
for big devices, non-mobile devices,

36
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.380
and there I wanna set the width to auto.

37
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.020
The default width, so if the media query is not met,

38
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.023
can be set to 100% and up there.

39
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.690
And as a result, if we save this,

40
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.670
we have that big button here on mobile.

41
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.400
But if I go to a bigger screen here,

42
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.090
by zooming out a bit, you see now

43
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.970
the button only takes as much space as it needs.

44
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.800
And keep in mind I'm zoomed in here,

45
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.240
so that you can see things a bit better,

46
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.650
which is why, for me, I have to drag quite

47
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.823
a bit to go to this big screen mode.

48
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.560
But this is now a media query in action

49
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
and it's in action with the help of style components.

50
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.770
So, style components, definitely a nice package

51
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.040
for, well, styling components and ensuring

52
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.250
that components really only affect

53
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.293
the styles on which you set them up.
