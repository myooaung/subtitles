00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.400
Now for this course section,

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.760
attached you find a starting project,

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.730
which you can download, extract,

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.040
and then run npm install in the extracted folder

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.660
to install all the dependencies this project needs.

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.320
And then npm start to start up that development server.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.480
And once you do that, you'll be greeted

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.450
with this basic form with this basic input.

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.240
And that's what we're going to get started with.

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.560
It's this simple input component, which you're seeing.

11
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.930
We also have a basic form component

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.520
at which we'll take a look later

13
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.890
but we're going to start with this simple input.

14
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.740
And that is just a regular React component

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.530
returning some JSX.

16
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.530
To be precise returning a form element, a form tag,

17
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.620
and then one form input in there with a label and a button.

18
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.250
Now this course section will not be about

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.220
how to write forms when it comes to HTML.

20
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.690
So we're not going to dive

21
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.530
into which HTML elements you could use.

22
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.800
And we're not going to talk about accessibility here.

23
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.020
We're also not going to dive into the styling.

24
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.870
I provide some basic styling here for you

25
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.880
in this index CSS file, which gives us this look here.

26
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.310
But beyond that, it's up to you to of course style this

27
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.810
and structured this however you want.

28
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.570
In this course section, I really wanna focus on React

29
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.310
and what we do with React when it comes to forms

30
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.890
because after all this is a React course.

31
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.483
So what's difficult about forms though?
