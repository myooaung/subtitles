1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,240
That's it for this summary about NextJSs.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,060
Now NextJS has more to offer.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,740
There are more configuration options

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,460
for getStaticeProps and what you can return there.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,550
There also are ways of optimizing images

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,680
with the built-in Next Image component.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,790
You can also easily add authentication,

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,020
and add user signup, and login, and logout,

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,080
and manage sessions with NextJS.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
All of that is possible.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,440
It's very powerful, and all these are things

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
we're going to take a look at in my full Next Course.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,530
This course here, this tutorial had to goal of summarizing

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,870
the core NextJS features.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,505
And had to goal of introducing you to NextJS.

16
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:52,580
And I hope it's now clear what NextJS is,

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,870
and why using it might be interesting.

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,320
How it can simplify building complex React apps.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,370
How you can work with pages here,

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,270
including dynamic pages.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,280
How pages are pre-rendered,

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,160
and how you can fetch data for pre-rendering

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,634
with getStaticProps or getServerSideProps.

24
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:15,910
That for dynamic pages, you also need getStaticProps

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,660
to tell NextJS which specific instances of this dynamic

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,030
page should be pre-rendered.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,280
And how you can run your own Server-side code in there.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,040
Like here, where we are connecting to a database.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,400
You'll also learn about API routes,

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,740
so that it's not just about fetching data all the time.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,740
But that you can include your own rest API

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,090
as part of this React project.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,930
And you can add your Server-side code here.

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,740
You're own API code, to which you then can send requests

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,490
from inside your Client-side application.

36
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,240
Like we're doing it here for storing a new meetup.

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,910
And that's NextJS.

38
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,520
A super-powerful framework for React,

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,630
which adds many nice features,

40
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,990
which can really make your life easier.

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,170
And which can help you solve problems

42
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,002
which you're actually facing in a lot of React projects.
