00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.400
So let's now add

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.990
this comments section together.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.430
And again, let's make sure that it only shows up

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.643
if we are on slash quotes slash some id slash comments.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.530
Now for this, we can render a nested route here,

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.680
which means we can import that route component

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.080
from React Router DOM, and then below the paragraph,

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.033
we can add this route component.

9
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.640
We then give it a path of, for example,

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.240
the path here could be slash quotes

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.800
slash some id slash comments.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.920
And here we'll have a problem.

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.140
Some id, of course, is not always the same id.

14
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.310
It's dynamic.

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.590
This quote detail page will be loaded for different ideas.

16
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.840
But we do get the id here,

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.470
so we can actually construct a dynamic path here.

18
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.360
And that is something we haven't done up to this point,

19
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.150
but since this is a regular React component

20
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.090
with a regular prop, you can, of course,

21
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.963
also pass in dynamic values, and not just hard-coded paths.

22
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.450
So here we can pass a dynamic value as a path.

23
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.360
And for example, create a template literal,

24
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.850
which is slash quotes slash.

25
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.720
Then we inject params.quoteId,

26
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.320
and then we add slash comments.

27
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.970
So now this route path is constructed dynamically

28
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.860
and it depends on the quote id

29
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.430
for which this quote detail component was loaded.

30
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.940
And that is absolutely something you can build

31
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.940
that you register a route where the path

32
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.760
for which it loads a component is dynamic.

33
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.220
That's not something we did thus far,

34
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.930
but since this is a regular React component,

35
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.640
it is something we can do and we're doing it here.

36
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.940
So now here between the opening and closing route tags,

37
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.150
we can again define which components should be loaded.

38
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.160
And for that I did prepare

39
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.460
this comments component in advance here,

40
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.199
and it's this component which should be loaded now.

41
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.690
So I import comments from going up one level,

42
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.850
diving into components, comments,

43
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.933
and then this comments component here.

44
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.970
And simply add comments here like this.

45
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.770
If I now save this,

46
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.460
if I visit slash quotes slash first quote slash comments,

47
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.180
I do see this comments block here

48
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.810
with this add a comment button

49
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.650
which then opens this super big forum.

50
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.940
The styling is not final yet,

51
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.770
we'll continue working on that.

52
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.750
But we see that it works.

53
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.050
If I just visit slash quotes slash first quote

54
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.210
without slash comments, we don't see that comments block.

55
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.513
So this nested route is working in the way it should.
