00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.200
Now, this course is about React,

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.490
but it is worth noting

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.130
that there are alternatives to React.js.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.400
Now, we're going to focus on React here

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.100
and React is one of the most popular front-end frameworks

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.260
or libraries, however you want to call it, you can learn.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.600
It's a lean and focused component-based UI library.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.920
It really focuses on this component thing,

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.900
and it doesn't have a lot of other features built in.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.650
If you need other features like routing,

11
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.330
which we are going to learn about in this video,

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.200
then you need to bring extra third-party packages.

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.040
That's not horrible, but it is something to be aware of.

14
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.070
React itself is really just focused on bringing stuff

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.670
onto the screen and updating that for you,

16
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.060
and allowing you to build these custom HTML elements.

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.823
These components, that's the core focus of React.

18
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.670
Now, an alternative to React, which has more built

19
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.390
in features would be Angular, another very important

20
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.120
and very popular front-end framework.

21
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.540
And I got a course on this as well.

22
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.320
Angular is a complete component-based UI framework,

23
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.330
so it also focuses on components, just like React,

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.380
but it ships more built in features than React.

25
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.020
It also embraces TypeScript right from the start.

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.340
And it can be overkill for smaller projects therefore,

27
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.840
since it has way more features built in.

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.810
But for large projects, on the other hand,

29
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.900
you don't need to rely on the community as much

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.090
because there's more built into that framework.

31
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.220
So, that's simply a little consideration you have to make.

32
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.530
The syntax also looks a bit differently

33
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.040
because whilst it is component focused,

34
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.790
building these components works

35
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.570
a bit differently with Angular than it does with React.

36
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.120
Again, I got a course on that,

37
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.760
if you want to check out Angular as well.

38
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.713
And we also have another very popular framework,

39
00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:03.100
another popular alternative and that would be Vue.js.

40
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.730
Vue.js is kind of like the mixture of Angular and React.

41
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.780
In between those two extremes,

42
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.740
if you want to call it like this.

43
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.090
It's also a complete component-based UI framework,

44
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.520
and it also includes a lot of features,

45
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.270
but a bit less features than Angular, but more than React.

46
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.780
It includes core features like routing, for example,

47
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.490
and therefore with Vue, you also have to rely less

48
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.750
on the community and still you don't have

49
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.730
as much overload possibly as you might have

50
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.850
with Angular, depending on what you build.

51
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.450
I also got a more detailed comparison video

52
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.240
on these free technologies

53
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.490
in case you are interested in that.

54
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.620
Now, all three are super popular.

55
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.110
React, currently, is probably the most popular,

56
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.400
but all three are great.

57
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.100
I got courses on all three and therefore checking

58
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.430
those out might be a good idea as well.

59
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.120
But this course, of course, is about React

60
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.583
and therefore let's not lose any time, let's dive right in.
