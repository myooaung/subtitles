1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,990
Now that's it for this module,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,880
which is only an introduction to testing

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,250
or to testing React apps.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,700
Now, testing as I mentioned at the beginning

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,910
is definitely a topic an entire course could be created on.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,540
But this course is not about that.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,680
It's about React and therefore I want

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,150
to introduce you to React testing.

9
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,020
I don't want to include an entire testing course

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,803
into this course as well.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,610
Now, if you want to learn more about testing,

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,360
of course there are dedicated tutorials and courses

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,520
you can check out.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,837
But what's also definitely worth a look,

15
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,443
are the official docs of Jest.

16
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:41,040
This tool we used under the hood

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,130
for running our tests and for asserting the results

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,133
and the docs of the React testing library.

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,500
Now let's start with Jest.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,000
If you Google for Jest you find these official docs

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,900
and these docs aren't too bad.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,660
Now, keep in mind that all these setup steps here

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,910
are not required by you because in our React project

24
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,610
you already have a setup.

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,340
And also keep in mind here,

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,120
that Jest is not a tool focused on just React.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,440
It's a general JavaScript testing tool,

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,350
and therefore the docs represent that.

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,970
But still here, you can learn more

30
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,360
about the different matchers, which you have,

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
the different ways of expressing expectations.

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,900
You can learn more about testing async code.

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,270
How you can wait for promises to complete, if you want that.

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,660
You can learn more about mocking functions,

35
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,300
something we also did in this module.

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,460
Here you can dive deeper and learn more

37
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,890
about the possibilities you've got there,

38
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,130
for mocking regular functions.

39
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,610
And also of course, for mocking promises,

40
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,160
as we did it here as well.

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,480
You can learn more here and in general.

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,920
Check out these different guides here to learn

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,880
about the different examples and the different features

44
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,653
this tool has to offer.

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,190
Now, when it comes to testing React

46
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,740
you want to check out the React Testing Library docs.

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,570
These docs are also great, and in there you learn way more

48
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,710
about testing React with that library.

49
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,900
You also find a complete example here,

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,150
which could be interesting to check out.

51
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,110
You find the complete API, which you have available.

52
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,470
Also check out the core API here to learn

53
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,280
about these different query methods.

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,320
GetBy, findBy, queryBy.

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,690
You also get the differences explained here again.

56
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,540
You also learn more about firing user events here.

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,770
You'll learn more about async code here,

58
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,790
and therefore that definitely also is a documentation

59
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,570
that is worth a closer look if you are serious

60
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,290
about testing React apps.

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,190
I especially also want to highlight the ecosystem part here.

62
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,850
Where you learn about extensions, that you can install.

63
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,240
Some of these extensions already are part

64
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,840
of a default project set up in a React app.

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,720
For example, the user-event extension.

66
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,160
But I especially also want to highlight one extension,

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,830
which is not listed here.

68
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,700
And that is the React-hooks-testing-library extension,

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,850
which makes testing React hooks especially custom hooks,

70
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,073
way easier.

71
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,240
Here you can learn how to use that extension

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,010
in case you have custom book functions,

73
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,350
which you want to test.

74
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,210
Which of course, typically do want to test

75
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,860
because you should test your entire code base if possible.

76
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,050
And therefore these are resources you can dive

77
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,360
in as a next step, but I hope

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,880
that this course module gets you started with testing

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,410
and you now at least have a general idea

80
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,223
of how that all works.
