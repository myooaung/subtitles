00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.090
Now, when it comes to deploying NextJS apps

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.980
there are different hosting providers you can use

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.420
and there are different ways

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.910
of configuring your project as well.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
You can, for example, use environment variables.

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.750
For example, to hold things like your database credentials.

7
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.940
I'll not dive into that here.

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.120
I do in my full next JS course, though.

9
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.700
But for this example here we'll just keep

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.540
the credentials stored here in this code

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.330
and from a security perspective, this is fine by the way

12
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.910
because this code will never end up on the client.

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.880
It just might be unconvenient

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.930
to use one and the same database and one and the same user

15
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.210
for development and for production.

16
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.210
But for this demo, this does not matter.

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.620
So I'll stick to this approach here.

18
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.630
And regarding the hosting provider

19
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.545
I will use Vercel.

20
00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:58.700
Vercel is a great hosting provider for NextJS applications

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.160
because the Vercel actually is a hosting provider

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.670
by the same team that's developed NextJS.

23
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.440
So it's really embracing NextJS

24
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.990
and optimized for NextJS if you wanna put it like this.

25
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.330
And deploying NextJS applications to Vercel

26
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.393
is thankfully also extremely simple.

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.900
Now what you'll need to do to start deploying

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.300
is sign up with a Git repository provider,

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.550
because with Vercel you will directly link

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.700
your GitHub repository,

31
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.480
which holds your source code, for example,

32
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.240
to Vercel and they will then get your source code from

33
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.963
that repository and deploy it for you.

34
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.460
Therefore you need to use GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket,

35
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.290
which are Git repository providers

36
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.880
to put your code there before you can deploy it with Vercel.

37
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.200
Now here I will use GitHub, which arguably is

38
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.630
the biggest and most popular Git repository provider.

39
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.573
And I already did log in with my account here.

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.960
Once you did create an account and login,

41
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.880
it's free,

42
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.770
you can create a new repository

43
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.520
and you can give this repository any name you want,

44
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.950
like NextJS course demo or anything like this.

45
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.690
You can also give it a description.

46
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.060
And then chose whether it should be public or private.

47
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.320
If it's public, everyone can see it.

48
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.830
Everyone can see your code.

49
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.320
If it's private only people you grant access to can view it.

50
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.300
And I'll go with private here,

51
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.620
but either of the options can be correct.

52
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.130
It simply depends on which kind of project it is.

53
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.323
If it's a open source project it will probably be public.

54
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.543
So I'll go with private and create my repository.

55
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.050
Once that is created, you need to push your code here.

56
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.870
Now for that you need to install Git on your local system

57
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.810
and you can git git-scm.com.

58
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.220
It's available for all operating systems.

59
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.230
You can download the installer from there

60
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.863
and simply walk through it to install Git on your system.

61
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.850
And once you installed get on your local system

62
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.620
you can create a so-called commit in your project,

63
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.600
a code snapshot, you could say.

64
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.450
And then push that commit,

65
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.130
that repository as a whole, actually, to GitHub

66
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.000
to move your code with your code history to GitHub.

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.040
Now, I won't turn this course into a Git course.

68
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.400
If you wanna learn more about Git and GitHub

69
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.230
we got a standalone course on that which you can take.

70
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.860
Here I will assume that you have those Git basics

71
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.420
and that you have Git installed now.

72
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.030
And if you have it installed

73
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.970
you can then go back into your local project,

74
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.030
into your project folder and create a code snapshot,

75
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.100
a commit as it's called.

76
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.230
You do this by running git add dot

77
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.920
and you can run this if you got Git installed

78
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.160
and then git commit and then some message of your choice.

79
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.090
For example, ready for deployment.

80
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.000
Though typically you want to add commit messages

81
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.233
that describe what you changed.

82
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.920
But with that, I now created such a snapshot, such a commit

83
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.970
and now we're ready for deployment.

84
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.800
Now that means that now we need to push our code to GitHub.

85
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.260
For this we can grab this URL here,

86
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.370
which will point to the repository we created.

87
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.370
And in our local project folder run git remote add origin

88
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.123
and paste that URL in here.

89
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.550
Now depending on whether you worked with Git

90
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.310
and GitHub before or not,

91
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.650
you might wanna add your GitHub username here

92
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.310
in front of github.com.

93
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.230
If you did work with GitHub before

94
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.460
and push before you probably don't need to do that,

95
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.840
but if you never pushed anything to GitHub

96
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.290
adding this will ensure

97
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.540
that you're prompted for your password

98
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.830
and that you have a chance of entering your credentials,

99
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.740
because of course you'll need to authenticate yourselves

100
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.980
in order to successfully push to this repository.

101
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.770
You can't just start pushing to some random repositories,

102
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.400
which you don't own.

103
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.750
So therefore here I will now add this origin here

104
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.670
and then run git push -- all.

105
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.410
And this will now push our code here.

106
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.150
Now you might be prompted for your password here

107
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.650
and you can then enter your GitHub password

108
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.870
or you as a token

109
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.120
for

110
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.840
authentication

111
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.810
For this to generate such a token

112
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.730
you need to go to your GitHub settings

113
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.560
and then there go to developer settings,

114
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.483
personal access tokens,

115
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.270
and generate a new token here.

116
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.230
Once you confirm this with your password

117
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.180
you can add some note here like NextJS deployment

118
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.370
or a more general purpose.

119
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.323
And then under scopes select repo,

120
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.570
delete repo,

121
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.020
and

122
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.023
admin repo hook here,

123
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.933
and then generate a token.

124
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.280
And now you'll need to copy that token here,

125
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.833
which is showing up here,

126
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.670
and enter this as a password when you're prompted for it.

127
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.820
Once you did all of that and you pushed successfully

128
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.730
you should see your code in this repository,

129
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.883
which you just created in the main branch.

130
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.360
And now we can link this repository

131
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.090
to Vercel to start deploying.

132
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.370
Now, before we do that

133
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.830
let me talk about building for production

134
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.400
and what Vercel actually does.

135
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.200
Vercel is a hosting provider,

136
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.480
which you can not just use for NextJS.

137
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.460
You can also use them for other projects,

138
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.840
but which definitely is optimized for NextJS.

139
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.630
So whilst you can host other things there as well

140
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.000
and it might be optimized

141
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.410
for those other types of projects as well.

142
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.947
It is definitely optimized for NextJS.

143
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.600
And that means that you can just connect Vercel

144
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.870
to your GitHub repository

145
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.270
and the Vercel will build and then deploy

146
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.100
and start your project for you.

147
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.280
So you don't need to run any built command on your own,

148
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.590
Vercel we'll do that for you.

149
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.800
Nonetheless, I wanna show you what Vercel does.

150
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.770
And therefore I'm back in our local code here

151
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.740
and there in package.json we see a couple of scripts,

152
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.890
which are commands we can execute in this project.

153
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.020
We worked a lot with the dev script

154
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.410
to start this development server.

155
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.570
And that is the script

156
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.833
which we used during local development.

157
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.070
But we can also run the build script

158
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.720
to build our project for production.

159
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.560
So to optimize all our code, minify it, and so on.

160
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.720
And you wanna run this if you do deploy it on another host,

161
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.470
which does not build the project for you.

162
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.950
So we don't need to do it with Vercel,

163
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.940
but you might need to do it forever hosting providers.

164
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.200
And then once you run this command

165
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.700
this will give you a .next folder,

166
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.120
which contains some of these optimized files.

167
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.220
For example, this thought .next folder

168
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.230
will also contain all those pre-generated page files,

169
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.400
those HTML files for your pages,

170
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.060
like the starting page here,

171
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.380
or the individual meetup detail pages.

172
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.120
So this is what npm run build will do for you

173
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.210
and Vercel execute this command

174
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.230
on our behalf on their servers.

175
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.250
So we don't need to do that.

176
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.460
But if you would host your project on another server,

177
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.890
which you manage yourself, for example,

178
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.960
you need to run npm run build

179
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.650
and there after with npm start

180
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.420
you can start a production server.

181
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.540
So now again, we have a running server,

182
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.880
but this is now the production server,

183
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.000
which you could start on a remote machine,

184
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.760
which you administer yourself

185
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.050
to run the server for your next application.

186
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.770
And that server therefore should of course stay up

187
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.440
and running on that machine

188
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.860
to which you deployed your application as long as you want

189
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.890
to expose it to the world.

190
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.750
Though I work with it here though.

191
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.770
Now all of that will be done by Vercel

192
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.000
and therefore let's now go back to Vercel

193
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.530
and continue with GitHub here.

194
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.610
And now here we'll need to link GitHub to Vercel.

195
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.130
Now you are then prompted

196
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.370
to give Vercel certain permissions,

197
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.580
give it access to your repositories,

198
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.893
and I'll do that here.

199
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.300
And once you did that, you can select that repository,

200
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.750
which we created a couple of minutes ago here,

201
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.670
and connect it to Vercel.

202
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.410
So I'll click import here on that repository.

203
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.800
Now we'll select this personal account here.

204
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.940
You might be prompted to create an account here.

205
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.210
And there you wanna choose the personal one,

206
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.980
which is free to use or free to get started.

207
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.340
Definitely check out their pricing pages

208
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.190
to learn more about the different options you have there.

209
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.090
And with that, we now can configure

210
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.930
how our code should be pulled

211
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.620
and how the project should be built.

212
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.100
And all the defaults here typically should work for you.

213
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.070
It detected that it's a NextJS project.

214
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.880
The default build and output settings work for us

215
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.510
And we could override environment variables here

216
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.920
if we would be using any.

217
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.993
But we aren't and hence, we can just click deploy.

218
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.910
Now to ensure that it really works

219
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.110
we'll also need to go to MongoDB Atlas

220
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.120
and change something here.

221
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.690
There under network access you will need to make sure

222
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.913
that you allow access from anywhere.

223
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.180
This ensures that the Vercel servers

224
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.050
on which our application will run,

225
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.051
will be able to connect to MongoDB.

226
00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:42.710
Otherwise this will fail

227
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.730
and our data can't be loaded and stored.

228
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.180
So we need to grant this access.

229
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.430
We still, of course, use our credentials

230
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.000
for actually establishing the connection,

231
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.490
but we need to open up that global access to allow Vercel

232
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.770
and its servers and our code running on their servers

233
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.690
to connect to MongoDB.

234
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.340
Now it can take a while until this operation is done.

235
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.350
So let's wait for this.

236
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.530
And once it's done,

237
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.400
here, we actually see an error that connection failed

238
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.450
because I just changed it after starting the deploy,

239
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.080
but we can simply hit deploy again and start a new deploy,

240
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.780
which should now succeed

241
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.390
because now we did open up MongoDB for outside access.

242
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.483
So let's now wait whether

243
00:11:27.483 --> 00:11:30.350
that now starts up successfully here.

244
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.030
It definitely built our site successful here.

245
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.440
That's good.

246
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.810
And that is looking good.

247
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.980
Now we can click visit and we see our site up

248
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.370
and running on Vercel's servers here.

249
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.740
We can also try adding a meetup here

250
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.600
test street five, this is a test and see whether that works

251
00:11:54.617 --> 00:11:55.700
and it does.

252
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.410
It might not show up immediately on this page

253
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.120
because this page is statically generated

254
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.980
and then only revalidated

255
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.360
once every second for incoming requests

256
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.870
and then it needs to be pre-generated again.

257
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.980
So even after one second, it might not show up immediately,

258
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.030
but eventually we see our new meetup here

259
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.290
and we can't visit it here though.

260
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.250
We get a 404 error here

261
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.630
and that's actually an expected error at this point.

262
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.993
What's the problem here?
