1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,390
So in this module you learned a lot about react transition group,

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,500
this package which gives us all these components we used to animate things in react especially and

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,830
most of the time relevant when we are removing and adding elements to and from the dom.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,630
There are alternatives to this package,

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,340
one popular alternative is react motion,

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,480
if you google for it you'll find the github repository where you find more instructions about it.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,490
Now react motion follows a totally different approach, in react motion

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,910
for example you don't really define manually the timer animation should take,

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,300
instead react motion tries to emulate real world physics to figure out the best timing an animation

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,880
should take and it simply allows you to define end and starting states and it tries its best to use

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,390
this real world physics to emulate or to interpolate the state in-between.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,850
You can check out the various demos on this page to see if that's an effect you want

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,920
and then of course dive into the docs linked

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,850
here on this page and seen on this page to use this library.

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,970
It can be tough to get started with react motion due to its very unorthodox way of thinking about animations

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,690
and some animations are kind of hard to do with it but it might be awesome for a lot of other cases

17
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,330
and might give you this more natural looking animation

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,610
look you might want for certain kinds of animations. Another alternative is react move for which you

19
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:45,600
can also simply google to find its github page or official web page. React Move has two basic components

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,970
it exposes to you which allow you to animate single items or groups of items, animate a node group

21
00:01:52,410 --> 00:02:01,140
and with react move, you always work with objects describing the state of an animation. React move is

22
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,190
heavily influenced by the three JS transitions

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,150
so if you know that, you might have an edge using this and in the end, you could find detailed docs and

24
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,420
explanations on how it works in its documentation.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,130
Here you do define durations but you then don't just define styles like opacity and so on

26
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,450
but you can really control way more with that and build more complex animations with it.

27
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,220
So this might be especially interesting to you if you have more complex animations and some examples

28
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,980
like this nice switching between US

29
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,580
states can be found on its page.

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,640
It also has an element for animating groups like here,

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,990
these bars.

32
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,740
Now again this is a little bit of a more complex library,

33
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,210
it might also have functionalities you don't need

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,690
so I recommend starting with react transition group but if you need more control, react move is an alternative

35
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,590
you might want to look into.

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,650
And finally, there is react router transition that's another library I want to mention, though I'll be

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,560
honest there are more libraries than that and you can get the feeling of a new react animation library

38
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,270
coming up every week but to react router transition is a very interesting and special one.

39
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,740
It is as the name suggests

40
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,550
there to allow you to easily create route transitions, so animations between different routes.

41
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,520
It builds up on react motion and it basically gives you this animated switch component which you

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,420
use to replace your normal router switch with and it's made to work with react router version four which

43
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:44,100
I covered in this course or higher, and animated switch then does all the same the normal switch does

44
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,300
but it allows you to define atEnter, atLeave, atActive and then a class name here which is

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:04:00,750
set up like this to allow you to animate the routing, so to animate the switching of pages and that is

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,370
something I wanted to mention,

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,950
you can dive deeper on this github repository where you find links to the docs because animating route

48
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,580
transitions can be very tricky with react transition group,

49
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,029
the package I showed in detail in this module. And with the react router transition package,

50
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,880
it's so much easier and it allows you to really build a nice looking, highly dynamic application and

51
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,890
add these route transitions

52
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,740
if you need them.
