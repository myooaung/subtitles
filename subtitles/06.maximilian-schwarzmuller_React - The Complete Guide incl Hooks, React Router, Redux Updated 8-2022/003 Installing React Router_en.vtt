00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.240
There is a very popular package

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.970
that helps us with creating multi-page React applications,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.810
and that package is called React Router,

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.660
which provides client-side routing.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.660
So routing functionalities in our client-side React app.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.850
And routing simply means that different URLs,

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.840
different paths in the URL load different pages.

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.930
Now, you can visit the React Router website

9
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.380
to learn more about it

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.400
or also dive into its official GitHub repository

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.310
where you could explore its source code

12
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.180
and also learn a bit more about it.

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.750
But you don't need to do that

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.160
because in this course,

15
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.450
I'm going to teach you React Router.

16
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.130
Now, it is worth pointing out

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.926
that there are two main versions of React Router,

18
00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:55.000
version 5 and version 6.

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.180
And version 6 is the newer one

20
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.520
but version 5 is the version

21
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.129
that's getting used in basically all projects.

22
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.580
Therefore in this course,

23
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.040
I will start with version 5

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.730
and I will then explain how you can update

25
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.750
to version 6 since that will be super easy

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.110
and what you'll learn for version 5

27
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.180
will apply to version 6 as well.

28
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.870
Now, to use React Router,

29
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.940
I created a brand new starting project,

30
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.480
which you find attached to this lecture.

31
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.430
And once you downloaded and unzipped it,

32
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.200
you just need to run npm install in there

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.050
to install all the core dependencies,

34
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.360
which basically means that you install React.

35
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.890
And then once you did that,

36
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.150
you can add React Router.

37
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.430
And you do this by again opening your terminal,

38
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.190
and navigating into this project folder.

39
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.530
And then we again use npm install

40
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.520
to install another package

41
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.950
into this project.

42
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.440
And we install the react-router-dom package.

43
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.410
React-router-dom.

44
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.562
And that's very important.

45
00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:05.670
We don't install react-router

46
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.340
but react-router-dom,

47
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.880
which is the React Router version for React apps

48
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.200
that run in the browser,

49
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.330
which is the use case we have here.

50
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.240
Now, to make sure that you install the correct version,

51
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.490
you should then add a @5 thereafter,

52
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.130
which guarantees that you install React Router version 5,

53
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.111
which is the version we're going to cover here.

54
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:32.500
So therefore, add @5 and then hit enter.

55
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.320
And this will now download and install this package

56
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.120
into your project.

57
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.853
And with that, we can then also use this package, of course.
