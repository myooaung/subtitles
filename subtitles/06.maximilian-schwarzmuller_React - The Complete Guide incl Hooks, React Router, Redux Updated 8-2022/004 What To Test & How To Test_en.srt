1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,800
Now, when you start writing tests,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,240
there are two super important questions

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,070
you have to answer, relatively early.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,960
And, these questions are

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,580
what you should test,

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,990
and how you should test that.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,410
And, I don't mean how you should technically test that.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,620
So, how you make sure that you have some code

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,290
that is then executed by some other tool.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,110
I'll come back to that technical question later,

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,930
but I mean, which kind of code

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,533
should you put into your testing code?

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,150
Now, when it comes to what to test,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,490
then, as mentioned for unit tests,

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,690
you wanna test the different building blocks

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,600
that make up your application,

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,160
and you really wanna test

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,190
small building blocks,

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,350
so that you have small, focused tests,

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,010
that only test one main thing each.

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,320
So, that you really have a lot of focused tests,

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,400
which then also fail for a clear reason,

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,640
if they do fail,

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,270
instead of having a few large tests,

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,943
which could fail for all kinds of reasons.

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,460
Now regarding the "how",

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,050
you wanna test success and error cases,

28
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,320
that could occur,

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,580
if a user interacts with your application.

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,020
And, you also, of course,

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,590
wanna test some rare,

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,890
but possible scenarios and results.

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,400
And again, that will become a bit clearer,

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,303
once we start writing some code.
