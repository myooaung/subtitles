00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.160
Now, rendering our list like this

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.210
is of course not our goal.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.090
We want to render a more beautiful,

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.220
a more good looking list.

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.660
And for this we could structure our code here differently

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.590
and add more styling,

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.320
but ultimately I simply want to create a new component here

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.210
and add component specific styling.

9
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.690
So that's what we'll do.

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.000
In the components folder I'll add another subfolder

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.630
next to layout, and I'll name it meetups.

12
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.030
And this holds all my meetup specific code.

13
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.600
And in there I'll add a MeetupItem.js file,

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.180
and a MeetupList.js file

15
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.550
because I want to outsource both the list

16
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.040
as well as the individual list items

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.010
into components.

18
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.260
Because, as mentioned earlier, it is a good practice to

19
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.700
split your components and your application as a whole

20
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.940
into small, reusable pieces.

21
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.350
Now let's start with the MeetupItem.

22
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.349
In that file, we create our MeetupItem function of course,

23
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.700
as we did before,

24
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
and we export that function.

25
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.720
Then in here, we return a list item.

26
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.210
And then in that list item, I want to have a div,

27
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.130
in which I render the image and set the source to something

28
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.620
and the alt text to something,

29
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.570
and then that's a self-closing element,

30
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.040
and below that div I have another div with the content,

31
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.220
where I have a h3 tag with the title,

32
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.410
an address tag, which is a default html tag,

33
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.870
where I output the address later,

34
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.600
and then a paragraph with the description.

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.330
And all this hard coded text will of course

36
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.740
soon be replaced with dynamic data.

37
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.240
And then below that we can add another div

38
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.240
with a button, where we say to Favorites,

39
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.180
so that this adds the item to our Favorites later.

40
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.710
That's the general structure I want to have here.

41
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.850
Now as mentioned, title, address, and description,

42
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.340
and also the data for the image, should be dynamic.

43
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.820
I don't want to hard code it here.

44
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.680
Instead, it should be passed in from outside,

45
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.270
from the so-called parent component,

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.020
so the component where we use this component

47
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.180
in its jsx code.

48
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.825
And we learned how we can make that happen,

49
00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:34.720
we can accept props here and use props.

50
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.810
And then for example, for the image source,

51
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.030
we could set this to props.image,

52
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.050
expecting a image prop on the MeetupItem,

53
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.050
which holds that URL that should be set as a source here.

54
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.000
And the same for the alt text that could be our title.

55
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.170
The title can also be used down there,

56
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.530
so that'd be output props.title here.

57
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.040
And for the address, it's props.address.

58
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.083
For the description, it's props.description.

59
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.070
And now, all of a sudden this component is reusable

60
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.223
and dynamic.

61
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.860
Some styling would also be nice, and for that,

62
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.290
again attach, you find css files here,

63
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.830
the meetupitem.module css

64
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.140
and the meetuplist.module css files,

65
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.140
which you can copy in next to these JavaScript files,

66
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.544
and then in meetupitem.js we want to import

67
00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:38.544
classes from./meetupitem.module.css

68
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.660
and assign a couple of classes in that JavaScript file.

69
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.350
On the list item for example,

70
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.350
we'll add the item class like this on this div,

71
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300
which is wrapped around the image,

72
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.680
we'll add the image class like this on the div

73
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.370
which is wrapped around the title and description and so on,

74
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.454
we'll add the content class,

75
00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:07.363
and then down there, for the button,

76
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.263
I'll add a class of actions, like this.

77
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.060
Now that's not all. I also want to work on that MeetupList

78
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.970
component already.

79
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.911
So here we can again create another component,

80
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:26.730
MeetupList, and export that as a default.

81
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.640
Also accept props here, because I expect

82
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.900
to get that list data from outside as well,

83
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.070
and I'm expecting this because I'm the one

84
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.530
building this app.

85
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.620
We could also write the code for fetching meetups

86
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.530
in this component, but I instead want to make this component

87
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.870
reusable and not care about the data source in here,

88
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.500
but instead just expect that I get meetups

89
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.830
through some prop,

90
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.190
and then it's a component which uses the MeetupList

91
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.990
component that has to worry about getting the meetups.

92
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.610
And I'm setting it up like this

93
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.800
because I plan on using the MeetupList component

94
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.970
in the AllMeetups component,

95
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.780
and also in the Favorites component later.

96
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.694
And there we'll have different data sources,

97
00:05:11.694 --> 00:05:14.640
but the same way of displaying the data.

98
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.600
And that's what we can make work

99
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.883
by adding a separate reusable component.

100
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.410
In here I also already wanna import classes

101
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.020
from ./MeetupList.module.css,

102
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.432
and return an unordered list here,

103
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:36.720
which receives a class name of classes.list

104
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.590
which is the only provided css class for this component.

105
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.650
And inside of the unordered list here,

106
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.832
I now wanna output my MeetupItems

107
00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:53.000
in the same way we did it in AllMeetups,

108
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.170
by mapping an array of objects

109
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.070
into an array of jsx elements.

110
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.070
Just that the jsx elements will now be the list items.

111
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.630
And for this here we again add a dynamic expression

112
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.952
with curly braces,

113
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.290
and we can expect that on our props here

114
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.094
in MeetupList, we get, let's say, a meetups prop,

115
00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:20.250
the name is up to you, because it's your component,

116
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.830
this could all be named items,

117
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.990
but here I'll go with meetups.

118
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.173
And then I'll map every meetup into another object.

119
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.750
Into a jsx element, to be precise.

120
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.700
So therefore, using the arrow function

121
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.750
shorthand subtext here,

122
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.370
I'll transform every meetup into a MeetupItem.

123
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.140
And for this, you need to add this import.

124
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.650
It was automatically added for me here by the IDE.

125
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.760
If that does not work for you, just add it manually,

126
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.423
and import MeetupItem from the MeetupItem file.

127
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.570
Now we render one MeetupItem per object

128
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.350
in the meetups array,

129
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.500
and that now needs to be configured.

130
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.470
It needs this key prop, this special prop,

131
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.650
React expects, one of the very few special props

132
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.930
that are built into React, and that can be used

133
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.130
on any component, including your own components,

134
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.820
without you writing any special code for it

135
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.870
inside of your components.

136
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.530
So you can just add that anywhere.

137
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.783
And we set that equal to Meetup.id.

138
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.830
Then, in my own component, I'll actually pass

139
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.450
in the id as well, as a id prop,

140
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.920
we will use that later for the Favorite feature.

141
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.626
I'll pass in the image prop with meetup.image,

142
00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:48.280
let me reformat this to make it a bit more readable.

143
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.273
At the title prop and point at meetup.title,

144
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.643
and also at address and description.

145
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.500
So meetup.address, and description is equal

146
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.893
to meetup.description.

147
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.750
Now alternatively, we could've also just passed

148
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.810
in a meetup prop, or any other name,

149
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.600
and just passed in the meetup as a whole.

150
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.890
Then we would have to de-structure it

151
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.350
inside of the MeetupItem component.

152
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.470
It's up to you which approach you prefer,

153
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.283
here I'm passing in individual props.

154
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.040
With all of that done, though,

155
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.910
we can go back to AllMeetups

156
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.650
and now use the meetup list component

157
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.159
instead of the unordered list.

158
00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.629
So we go up and we import.

159
00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:40.900
MeetupList from, going up one level,

160
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.669
out of the pages folder,

161
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.400
into the components folder,

162
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.000
into the meetups folder,

163
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.833
to MeetupList,

164
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.433
and then just output MeetupList like this,

165
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.580
and very important, provide the meetups' prop.

166
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.010
Because we're expecting that prop inside

167
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.293
of the MeetupList component, here.

168
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.200
So set up the meetups prop here,

169
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.610
and pass in the dummy data array

170
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.420
as a value.

171
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.510
With all of that done, if you save all the files,

172
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.343
you should see something like this.

173
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.920
Now this is not the final look,

174
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.840
we'll continue tweaking this,

175
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.240
but it shows that our content is being rendered.

176
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.920
And that's not too bad.

177
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.810
But now it would be nice to kind of restrict the width,

178
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.570
which we use on the screen,

179
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.440
and it would also be nice if the individual meetups

180
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.730

181
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.230
maybe rounded corners, something like that.

182
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.030
That's what we're going to add next.
