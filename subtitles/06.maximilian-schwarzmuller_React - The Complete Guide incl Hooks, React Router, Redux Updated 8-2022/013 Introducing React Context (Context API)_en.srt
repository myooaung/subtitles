00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,090
[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] So with useReducer

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,200
out of the way,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,170
let's dive into a different problem you might face

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,870
in bigger React applications specifically,

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,270
but even in this tiny demo here, we already have it,

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,683
that can be solved in a more elegant way.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm talking about a problem, in quotes,

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,730
where you are passing a lot of data

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,447
through a lot of components via props.

10
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:30,300
And a good example here is our isLoggedIn state

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,020
and the login functions.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,940
We're managing this state in the app component

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,020
because I lifted this state up to that component

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,130
because we basically need this state,

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,018
this isLoggedIn state and the functions to change it

16
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:46,283
everywhere in this application.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
We use the logged in state in the header

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,240
to which I'm passing it through the isAuthenticated prop.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,460
From there, we are able to logout.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,200
So I passed the pointer at the logoutHandler

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,770
to my header on the onLogout prop.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,860
And we also need the login state

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,100
to render different content here,

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,350
either the login or the home component,

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,040
and to those components,

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,690
I also passed the logoutHandler or the loginHandler.

27
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,110
Now the logoutHandler being passed to the home component,

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,940
that's something I'm doing here

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,310
so that we theoretically could add a button there

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,350
with our button component, for example,

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,900
to allow the user to logout there as well.

32
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,240
Not something we need in this app,

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,010
but something you could add here with props on logout

34
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,240
since we're getting a pointer to this handler anyways.

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,773
And if you do that, once you login here,

36
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:44,690
you all have the logout button here.

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,580
So long story short, we need, or we use this login state

38
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,260
in a lot of different places in the app.

39
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,910
Now, obviously this is a very, very, very simple app,

40
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,320
a very simple demo,

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
and here passing our state around like this

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,553
is not a huge problem.

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,740
Now it is quite common that you pass data

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,600
to components through props,

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
but it's always a problem if you forward state

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
through multiple components.

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,160
So if you basically just leverage props to forward data

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,860
to another component.

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,500
And that's actually something we're doing

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,110
in the main header.

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,890
Here in the app component,

52
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm passing isLoggedIn through the isAuthenticated prop

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,010
to main header.

54
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,800
And I'm passing the logoutHandler

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,930
through the onLogout prop to the main header as well.

56
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,770
Now in the main header though,

57
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,220
I'm using neither of those two props.

58
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,170
I'm using them only to forward them again

59
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,480
to the navigation component

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,140
because it's the navigation component in the end,

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,720
which needs the isLoggedIn data

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,928
to render different links and which needs the

63
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:53,610
onLogout prop and the logoutHandler therefore,

64
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,163
to do something when the logout button is clicked.

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,930
So essentially what I'm doing here, is in the main header

66
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm receiving props,

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,070
I'm receiving data through props

68
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,480
which I'm not actually using primarily in the main header.

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,430
Instead, I just forward that data.

70
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,790
That's not necessarily a problem,

71
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,100
but in big apps, that chain of forwarding

72
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,033
might become longer and longer.

73
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,350
Consider this example of a fictional app.

74
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,620
We could have an app with an app component,

75
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,490
with, let's say, an auth section,

76
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,890
with a login form,

77
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,020
with a shop section where we have a list of products

78
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,890
in which we render individual product items,

79
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,113
and with a cart.

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,560
Now in the login form,

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,630
we might have the login event when the user fills

82
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,270
out the form and submits the form,

83
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,780
and we validate the data and find out

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,720
that the user is logged in.

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,790
And we might need that login data,

86
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,320
So the login status,

87
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,690
the information that the user is logged in

88
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,670
in different parts of the app.

89
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,100
We might need it in the shop.

90
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,990
We might need it in the cart,

91
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,740
to show the cart to avoid that the user can go there

92
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,690
if he or she is not logged in.

93
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,150
It's easy to imagine that we need information

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,083
about the login status in different parts of the app.

95
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,670
And we have something similar.

96
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,060
Let's say the user adds a product to the cart.

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,360
We need that information in the cart component

98
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,220
to show the product there, for example.

99
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,800
But since the product is a direct child of products,

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,850
which is a child of shop, which is a child of app.

101
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,290
And since the login event happens in the login form,

102
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,460
which is a child of auth, which is a child of app,

103
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,014
we don't have those direct connections

104
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,423
to the other components where the data might be needed.

105
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,250
If a user clicks a button in the product component

106
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,460
to add a product to the cart,

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,980
the information needs to reach the cart component

108
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,740
but there is no direct connection

109
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,190
between the product component and the cart component.

110
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,100
And the same for the login.

111
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,960
And therefore, what we typically would do is

112
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,270
we would use props to pass a function handler

113
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,400
to the login form, for example,

114
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
so that in there we can call it.

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,760
But that essentially means

116
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,570
that we're forwarding data through our different components.

117
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,580
And the same, of course, if we add something to the cart.

118
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,180
Now, that means that this function that should be triggered

119
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,610
when the user adds something to the cart

120
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,460
would probably be managed in the app component,

121
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,280
because we lifted the state up to the level

122
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,170
where we have access to both the product component,

123
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,003
indirectly,

124
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,431
and the card component.

125
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,900
And that's only the case in the app component.

126
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,980
Only this component has at least indirect connections

127
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,590
to both components, product, and cart.

128
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,390
And therefore we would forward a pointer

129
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,610
to the add to cart function

130
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,700
through all those other components,

131
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,080
the shop component and the products component,

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,050
even though those components probably don't need

133
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,260
that function.

134
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,920
They only need it so that they can forward it

135
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,733
to the product component in the end.

136
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,600
So in the end here,

137
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,800
we have the same problem I described here

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,660
just on a larger scale.

139
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,250
Here, it's a very simple app

140
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,950
but even here we are forwarding data

141
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,070
through the main header to the navigation component

142
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,520
on props we receive in the main header

143
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,500
even though we don't really need the data there.

144
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,020
So therefore, in bigger apps,

145
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,890
you could easily build such prop chains,

146
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,930
which are used to forward data through components

147
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,650
to other components.

148
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,830
That's something you can do, and that's not necessarily bad

149
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,540
but the bigger your app gets,

150
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,140
the more inconvenient it is to do that.

151
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,450
Instead, it would be nicer if we could use props

152
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,050
in a component to only receive the data

153
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,021
this component really needs from its parent,

154
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:47,010
and not to forward our data through the parent

155
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,250
which the parent doesn't ever manage nor need itself.

156
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,517
And for that we got a component-wide,

157
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:57,000
"behind the scenes", State Storage, built into React.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,850
We have a concept called React Context,

159
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,180
and this then allows us to, for example, trigger a action

160
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,580
in that component-wide State Storage,

161
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,220
and then directly pass that to the component

162
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,670
that is interested without building such a long prop chain.

163
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,930
And that allows us to solve our problem

164
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,910
in a more elegant way here.

165
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,910
So let's take a closer look at this now.
