00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:03.960
[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] So now that we use CSS modules,

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.510
let's also use the concept here

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.520
in the course input component.

4
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.600
We got the course input CSS file,

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.520
and as you learned, you need to change the name

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.830
to .module.css

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.740
With that, I mean the file name.

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.973
So CourseInput.module.css.

9
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.550
In the course input component, you then import

10
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.360
from CourseInput.module.

11
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.220
And as you learned, you import something from there.

12
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.860
Again, the name is totally up to you.

13
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.580
Typically you name it styles or classes

14
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.510
or anything like that.

15
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.470
We can remove the styled import from styled components

16
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.460
because I'm going to comment out this form control

17
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.293
like this.

18
00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:44.270
I'm not going to use it anymore.

19
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.790
Instead down there, I'll go back to my good old div,

20
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.550
and on that div, I will add class name

21
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.127
to styles dot

22
00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:54.940
form

23
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.773
control.

24
00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:57.200
And now we have a problem.

25
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.907
This is an invalid property name,

26
00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:02.003
but I named my class form control in here.

27
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.260
Well, it's not a problem.

28
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.010
We just have to use a different syntax

29
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.700
for accessing the property.

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.580
We use the square brackets and wrap this name

31
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.090
into single quotes.

32
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.000
This is how we can also access properties in JavaScript.

33
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.280
And with that, we can also access properties

34
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.313
with such a name,

35
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.350
because strings are valid keys in JavaScript objects.

36
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.540
Alternatively, of course, you pick different CSS class names

37
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.913
without dashes in them.

38
00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.840
Here, however, I'll stick to that.

39
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.830
And there, for now, we got our styling back.

40
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.800
Now, of course the invalid style is not getting applied.

41
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.016
And the reason for that is simple.

42
00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:43.490
For that invalid style to be applied,

43
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.440
we need to make sure that the invalid CSS class

44
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.610
is added on the element.

45
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.240
And currently that's never happening.

46
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.640
We're only adding foreign control, only adding this class

47
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.840
or the transfer in CSS modules version of that class,

48
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.830
to be precise.

49
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.403
We're never adding the transformed invalid class version.

50
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.360
It is something we can also do easily though.

51
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.229
We can go back to that backtick syntax

52
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.400
to create a string where we inject values.

53
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.270
And the first value I want to inject

54
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.933
is that resolved class name here.

55
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.720
So I inject this converted class name,

56
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.553
which we're in the end,

57
00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:25.800
extracting from that styles object here into this string.

58
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.403
With that, if we save this, nothing should change.

59
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.990
And now, of course, just as before,

60
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.740
we can add an additional clause here.

61
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.750
We can check if not is valid,

62
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.410
and if that's the case, I add styles.invalid here

63
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.890
referring to that converted version of that invalid class.

64
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.450
Converted because that's what the CSS module process

65
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.823
will do behind the scenes.

66
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.930
And invalid because the CSS class name is invalid in here.

67
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.350
So with that, we're adding this converted version

68
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.750
of our own class, this scoped version of this CSS styling,

69
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.740
so to say,

70
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.620
to this div if isValid is false.

71
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.810
If we now save us and we go back,

72
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.680
if I click add goal, it's red.

73
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.890
If I type, it's no longer red,

74
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.260
it gets red again and so on.

75
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.544
So this now works again,

76
00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:22.544
but now we're adding dynamic classes here with CSS modules.

77
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.800
It's not really that different from normal classes

78
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.470
because these are normal classes.

79
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.700
We just extract the converted class names

80
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.350
as they were generated by CSS modules, that's all.

81
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.463
And then we combine them as needed.

82
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.660
Last but not least, let's see how media queries

83
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.070
are set up in CSS modules.

84
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.870
And for that, let's go back to the button.

85
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.320
There I had a media query in my styled components,

86
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.170
so we can copy that and go to the CSS file

87
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.810
which we're using now.

88
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.480
And here you just add a media query as you would always

89
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.253
add it, maybe here at the bottom.

90
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.023
Let me get rid of these slashes.

91
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.540
The important difference to styled components, of course,

92
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.020
is that now you need your selector again.

93
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.380
You always need that in CSS.

94
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.830
The non selector syntax here in styled components

95
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.950
is really just a styled components feature

96
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.740
because it processes your CSS code.

97
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.283
This is not CSS code that would work like this in a browser

98
00:04:24.283 --> 00:04:26.850
because CSS always needs a selector.

99
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.800
And that's why we need to add a selector here.

100
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.670
With that, however, we got everything we need.

101
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.040
We set the width here to 100% on small devices,

102
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.820
and then on bigger screens, we reset it to auto,

103
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.360
and that should be all that's needed.

104
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.920
No other changes are required because I'm working

105
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.152
on the same CSS class, which I'm already adding

106
00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.943
to the component here.

107
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.540
So with that, you'll see, I have the big button there,

108
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.990
and on bigger screens, it's a smaller one.

109
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.740
So that all works and it also works with CSS modules.

110
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.240
Now, ultimately, it's absolutely up to you

111
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.130
which approach you prefer.

112
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.210
I showed you the CSS only,

113
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.400
the styled components, and the CSS modules approach

114
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.870
and then mentioned the different pros and cons.

115
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.110
And you can simply use the approach you like.

116
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.470
For the rest of this course,

117
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.380
I will use CSS modules because I liked that scoping.

118
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.320
and I like having my CSS code

119
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.200
and my JavaScript code separated.

120
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.250
But if you prefer a different approach,

121
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.363
that's, of course, also perfectly fine.
