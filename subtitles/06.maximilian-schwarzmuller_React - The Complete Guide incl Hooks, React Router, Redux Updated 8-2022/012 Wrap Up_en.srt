1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,230
And that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,840
Now you learned that React is able to talk to a backend

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,050
but not to a database directly

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,820
for a security and performance reasons.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,140
But you can send requests to backend APIs

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,190
very often that will be rest APIs like we see it here.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,910
And then you can, for example, use the fetch API

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,080
or a third-party libraries like X,

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,970
yes to perform that request.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,230
And to then also get the response, analyze the response

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,140
and maybe throw and generate an error if it's needed

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,080
and or work with the data you get back

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,330
as part of the response.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,620
You learned how you can send both get and post requests.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,240
And you also learned how you can handle different States

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,990
which are involved with sending requests.

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,610
A loading and an error State.

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,320
And the we have no data State

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,610
as well as the we do have data State.

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,990
All of that is important

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,060
and allows you to build rich user experiences

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,970
which you want to have in most

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,480
of your applications of course,

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,182
because sending HDP requests is a crucial task.

25
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:13,793
And here in this demo, you learned how it generally works.
