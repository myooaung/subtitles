00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.280
Now to dive in,

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.800
I want to start with a couple of pages here.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.970
And for this year, I also got my terminal open.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.220
First of all, we need to install all dependencies though

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.160
with npm install and then we can use npm run dev.

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.480
And then we'll start the development server,

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.410
but of course at the moment I got no pages.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.480
And hence we should add some pages.

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.890
And for this demo application for this project

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.870
which we're building here, we will need three pages.

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.030
A starting page, which shows a list of all meetups.

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.890
Then the new meet up page,

13
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.020
which allows us to add a new meetup.

14
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.290
And then the meetup detail page

15
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.070
which allows us to show the details for a selected meetup.

16
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.150
And hence here in the pages folder,

17
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.250
I'll start with the starting page with index.js

18
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.450
directly in the pages folder,

19
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.050
because you learned that index is this special file name

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.209
which will be loaded for just slash nothing

21
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.140
in the given sub-folder.

22
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.490
And here we're not in a sub-folder at all,

23
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.183
so index.js will be loaded for our-domain.com slash nothing.

24
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.670
But then we got more pages.

25
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.020
For example, a page for adding a new meetup.

26
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.410
And hence we could add a new meetup.js file

27
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.410
which then would be loaded for our domain slash new meetup.

28
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.790
And you did learn over the last minutes

29
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.270
that we also have an alternative here.

30
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.740
We could also create a new meetup folder

31
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.760
instead of the file, move the file in there,

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.660
and then rename it to index.js.

33
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.100
And that would then be loaded in exactly the same way.

34
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.320
It's up to you which approach you prefer,

35
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.320
you need that sub-folder approach if you need nested routes,

36
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.290
but we will not have any nested routes here,

37
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.080
so in this case, it's really up to you.

38
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.090
And I will go for this sub-folder approach here.

39
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.240
But again, it's your choice.

40
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.610
And then we also need this detail page

41
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.630
which we load if a specific meetup was clicked,

42
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.930
and we want to view the details of that meetup.

43
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.380
And for this, we need a dynamic page

44
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.700
because of course we'll have multiple meetups

45
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.670
with different IDs and DID should be part of the URL,

46
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.970
and then when we load the page we want to use that ID

47
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.810
to fetch and to display the appropriate data.

48
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.700
And we also learned how this worked.

49
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.000
We can create a dynamic page with square brackets

50
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.800
and then dot JS,

51
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.550
and then simply use any identifier name of our choice

52
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.053
between the square brackets.

53
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.520
For example, meetup ID.

54
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.840
And here we could also use the sub-folder approach.

55
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.070
It also is available for dynamic pages.

56
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.240
We could also create a folder named meetup ID

57
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.800
between square brackets,

58
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.210
and move that file in there and then it index.js.

59
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.530
And that also works.

60
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.770
That's something we haven't seen before,

61
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.990
and that's why I'm showing it to you here

62
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.210
because it is always important to be aware of the fact

63
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.050
that you can also have dynamic folder names here,

64
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.880
and then create dynamic nested pages if you need them.

65
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.410
Or, like in this case, one single dynamic page.

66
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.040
And the width that we got the page structure we want

67
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.340
with those three pages.

68
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.130
And hence we can now get started working on those pages.

69
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.100
We can fill those components with some live,

70
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.510
and then also step-by-step at data fetching

71
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.423
and learn how NextJS helps us with that.
