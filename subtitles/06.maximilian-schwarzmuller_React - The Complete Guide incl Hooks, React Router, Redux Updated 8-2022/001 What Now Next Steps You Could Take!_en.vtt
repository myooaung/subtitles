00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.260
Great job, you completely this course

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.270
and this certainly was not a short course.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.680
This instead was a course packed with content

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.050
and you now did learn a lot about React

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.340
and not just about its core features,

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.720
but also about advanced features

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.170
and we also had a look behind the scenes

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.680
and you really got a lot of in depth knowledge

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.270
about all those React features.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.310
Now, with this lecture I wanna ensure

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.880
that you can build up on what you learned in this course,

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.900
that you don't forget what you learned in this course

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.320
and that you can use this course as a foundation

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.300
to become an expert React developer

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.410
and use React for whatever you wanna use it.

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.910
To find a job as a React developer,

17
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.670
to start your own business,

18
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.460
whatever your goals are.

19
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.022
And to very important next step

20
00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:01.713
therefore instead you practice and practice.

21
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.760
This course gives you all the basic knowledge you need

22
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.560
and not just the basics,

23
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.110
also advanced concepts of course.

24
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.420
But it gives you a very solid foundation

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.300
and of course, this course also already contains

26
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.780
a lot of exercises and demo projects.

27
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.720
But you need to build up on that,

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.180
you need to practice on your own,

29
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.280
build your own demo and dummy projects

30
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.060
and use what you learned in this course

31
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.820
to apply it onto problems you face in your own projects.

32
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.280
And then of course also solve those problems on your own

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.920
because that is ultimately

34
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.110
what will turn you into an expert

35
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.760
and what is the key for every developer.

36
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.980
If you wanna become a developer you need to practice

37
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.510
and you need to solve problems.

38
00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.020
And therefore consider cloning simplified versions

39
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.480
of popular websites and web apps.

40
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.790
Build your own Amazon clone with React,

41
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.530
maybe leave out the payments part

42
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.120
but add the shopping cart, the products page

43
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.513
and all those core features that make up Amazon.

44
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.110
Maybe all the re-built the course demos

45
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.730
and projects you saw in this course

46
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.660
and then use my lectures again

47
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.490
to compare your solution to mine.

48
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.420
And come up with your own dummy business ideas

49
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.660
and websites which you could build.

50
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.480
These are all possible steps you can take

51
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.940
to apply what you learned in realistic projects.

52
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.930
You can also search and Google for React examples

53
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.660
to find plenty of example, code bases out there

54
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.930
which you can also use to get inspiration

55
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.670
and to then also have a working code base as a solution

56
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
once you tried replicating it on your own first.

57
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.450
So really take this advice from me

58
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.030
and apply what you learned and practice.

59
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.170
This is the key to ensure that what you learned today

60
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.830
will not be something you forgot tomorrow

61
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.060
and you will need to practice to really become

62
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.450
and stay

63
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.053
a React developer.
