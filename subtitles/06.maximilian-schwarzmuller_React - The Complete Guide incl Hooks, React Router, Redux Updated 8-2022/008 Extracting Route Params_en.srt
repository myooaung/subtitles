1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,670
To really utilize this dynamic path feature,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,160
we need access to the concrete value

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,590
entered in the URL inside of the loaded component.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,660
So here in the product detail component,

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,420
I wanna find out what the product ID is

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,539
for which this component whilst loaded

7
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,870
so that then in this component,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,290
I could make a request to the back-end,

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,080
to the API, to fetch the full data for that product.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,830
And getting that concrete value is again,

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,160
thankfully, straightforward.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,200
Again we can import from React Router DOM

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,882
and from there, we import a special hook,

14
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,797
a custom hook not created by us

15
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:47,690
but by the React Router team.

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,093
We can use the UseParams hook.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,940
And if we call UseParams, this hook will return

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,920
a params object, which we can store in a constant.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,750
And this object will have key value pairs

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,660
where the keys are the dynamic segments

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,160
leading to that page.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,750
In this case, we have one dynamic segment

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,080
but we could have multiple segments if we needed.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,300
Here, we don't need multiple segments though

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,690
so one segment is fine

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,860
and we'll then have this identifier,

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,277
which we specified here after the colon

28
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:26,920
as a key in this params object, which we get here.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,147
So here we could console log params.productID,

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,933
productID because I used productID as a key here.

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,160
And we can of course not just console log it,

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,563
but we could also output it here.

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,370
We could add a paragraph here

34
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,450
and then the value which I wanna output here

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,277
is params.ProductID.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,390
If we save this,

37
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,080
now I see anything dash else here,

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,260
because I am on product dash details slash anything else.

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,660
If I enter P1 here, I see P1.

40
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,720
If I enter P2 here, I see P2.

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,009
And for the moment, we're not doing anything fancy

42
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,560
with it, we're not using it to send an HTTP request

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,720
or anything like that,

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,010
but we will do that a little bit later

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,810
once we build a more realistic project with React Router,

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,323
right after we finish these basics here.
