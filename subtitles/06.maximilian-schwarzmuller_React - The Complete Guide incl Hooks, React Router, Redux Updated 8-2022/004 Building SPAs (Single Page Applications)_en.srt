1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,260
Now because things get easier with React,

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,730
and because we can build those rich user interfaces

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,950
with React and JavaScript, when working with React,

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,290
we often build so-called signal page applications.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,570
Because whilst we can use React

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,410
to control parts of a HTML page,

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,200
let's say some interactive sidebar,

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,810
and therefore we add a widget, you could say,

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,550
to a page where only a part of the page

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,410
is controlled with React,

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,580
it is more common to control the entire page with React,

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,320
which means that we use React

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,500
for everything we see on the screen,

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,370
and even for switching pages.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,840
So when we click on a link and we load a new page,

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
as I did with Netflix when I clicked on my list,

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,350
it looks to the user as if we switched the page,

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,350
but actually don't request a new HTML file from some server,

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,710
instead, we just use the JavaScript through React.js

20
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,790
to change what's visible on the screen.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,230
And that often leads to a smoother UI

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,450
and a better user experience,

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,280
as you see it at the example of Netflix.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,720
It's built with React,

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,880
and there we never request a second HTML page,

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,420
hence it's a single page application

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,700
where after the initial request to the side,

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,130
React takes over and controls what we see on the screen.

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,830
Now throughout this course,

30
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,220
we are going to learn React in depth,

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,870
and we're going to start with this basic dummy demo here

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,230
to learn about some core concepts.

33
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,800
And then later throughout the course,

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,440
we're going to build this Meetup project,

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,930
this mini project here,

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,210
where we see more React features in action

37
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,650
and where we can practice all those basics.

38
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,530
And where then, at the end, really understand

39
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,693
how React works, and which features it brings.
