1
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.530
This course got updated.

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.050
I rerecorded this entire course from scratch,

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.500
from the ground up, which means I built a brand new course,

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.500
and you do get this brand new course, this update for free.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Now in this lecture, I will explain why I did that,

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.510
why I did update this course,

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.010
and of course what that means for the old course.

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.830
I will explain how I updated the course,

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.490
so what changed in the course.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.440
I will talk about the content that changed

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.040
and brand new content dead was added.

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.430
And of course, I'm also going to explain

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.350
what that means for you,

14
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.090
specifically of course how you should proceed

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.470
and what that means for your course progression,

16
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.010
your completion certificate, and so on.

17
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.080
Now, very important.

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.060
After this lecture, so the very next lecture

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.510
is a written summary of this lecture basically.

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.020
So please, definitely also check that out

21
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.670
to find a written version,

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.470
to find all the details again,

23
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.470
and to also find some answers

24
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.860
to some frequently asked questions there.

25
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.340
Now let's start with the most important part first.

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.950
How do you get access to this updated course?

27
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.710
And the answer here is simple.

28
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
I inserted this new course into this existing course

29
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.440
in front of the old course content.

30
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.150
So you'll automatically get this new course

31
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450
since you are enrolled in this course here

32
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.670
since I inserted all the updated content,

33
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.640
so the brand new course therefore,

34
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.490
into this existing course,

35
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.010
which therefore currently holds two courses in one course.

36
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.920
But I'll come back to that problem in a couple of minutes.

37
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.490
Now why did I update this course?

38
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.130
There are two main reasons.

39
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.610
The first reason and the most important reason

40
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.050
is that React evolved.

41
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.830
I did originally recorded this course in 2017,

42
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.710
and I have kept updating it over the years.

43
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.800
I added new content, but React evolved.

44
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.820
And the way I teach React in this course

45
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.230
is simply not the most future-proof way possible.

46
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.140
Specifically and most importantly,

47
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.290
functional components and React Hooks

48
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.690
are the standard way of building components

49
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.680
and React apps going forward.

50
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.820
And this course still focuses very much

51
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.900
on class-based components, the old course that is.

52
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.380
The new course fully embraces

53
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.000
functional components and hooks.

54
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.850
Now I really wanna emphasize.

55
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.900
The existing course, the old course,

56
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.910
does include React Hooks.

57
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.750
I do teach React Hooks in depth there.

58
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.720
We got many hours of just React Hooks content in there,

59
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.000
but I do start with class-based components.

60
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.420
I focus very much on class-based components

61
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.830
in the beginning of the course,

62
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.490
and that's imply not the future-proof way anymore.

63
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.290
Instead, when you learn React,

64
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.660
you should learn it with a focus on functional components

65
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.890
and React Hooks right form the start

66
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.360
and not only dive into React Hooks later

67
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.260
as the old course currently does it.

68
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.230
So that's the main reason for me recreating this course,

69
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.160
but the other reason is of course I also evolved,

70
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.590
and I got tons of helpful feedback from all of you.

71
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.380
And of course, I also used that feedback

72
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.840
to incorporate it into this course

73
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.070
to sharpen explanations, improve examples,

74
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.093
and simply make this course better.

75
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.810
So speaking of that, what did change?

76
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.750
Of course the general structure is the same.

77
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.580
We start with the basics,

78
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.130
components, props, state.

79
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.920
But since I've focused on

80
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.020
functional components and React Hooks only,

81
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.190
the lectures of course are not the same.

82
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.710
Instead, I did rerecord everything.

83
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.390
I did replace all the modules and lectures

84
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.510
in this new course,

85
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.280
and it's not a one-to-one replacement

86
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.150
because of course I introduced hooks very early.

87
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.130
We dive into the different hooks,

88
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.920
the problems related to them.

89
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.430
And therefore, whilst the general concepts are the same,

90
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.620
the content of the lectures is not.

91
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.370
And as I mentioned, I also picked up

92
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.210
lots of feedback you provided,

93
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.950
and I, for example, got rid

94
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.100
of that big course project which we had, the Burger Builder,

95
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.990
and I instead added many smaller,

96
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.800
more focused projects,

97
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.070
so that there is more variety

98
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.440
and it's also easier to switch between sections,

99
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.750
and you don't have to go through

100
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.480
all the other sections first

101
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.163
just to dive into some advanced section.

102
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.230
So that's why I have a brand new course

103
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.510
and why the general structure is the same,

104
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.700
but the content is not.

105
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.510
I do encourage you that you'll have a look

106
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.350
at the course curriculum

107
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.640
and at section one of this new course

108
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.140
to get a good overview of its structure and of the content

109
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.680
and which concepts are taught where.

110
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.220
Because it's a huge course,

111
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.170
if I cover all of that here,

112
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.170
this will be a two-hour video.

113
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.293
So please have a look at those existing resources.

114
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.930
Now the update also brings some brand new content

115
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.720
which you should not miss,

116
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.660
no matter what your current status is.

117
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.660
If you completed the old course, if you just started it,

118
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.150
there is some content which you should not miss,

119
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.850
though I will come back to my recommendations for you

120
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.000
on how to perceive based on your status

121
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.180
in a couple of minutes as well.

122
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.610
As mentioned, in general, you should check out

123
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.590
that full curriculum and that first course module,

124
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.600
but then there are some specific sections

125
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.040
which I wanna highlight here,

126
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.720
which you of course also find in that curriculum though.

127
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.070
For example, there is a brand new Next.js section.

128
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.310
I mean all the sections are brand new,

129
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.480
but this also has way more content

130
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.860
than the old Next.js section, the old course had.

131
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.510
And I definitely recommend

132
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.410
diving to that section therefore.

133
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.850
it's a huge section, more than three hours long,

134
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.010
and it really gives you a great in-depth introduction

135
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.660
into Next.js, which is a framework for React

136
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.650
that helps you improve search engine optimization,

137
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.020
that helps you with server-side rendering,

138
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.920
and that's really worth a closer look.

139
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.530
I also added a pretty big React summary module

140
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.830
to this React course,

141
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.740
which is a great module to dive in if you have limited time,

142
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.310
and you don't wanna go through the entire course just yet.

143
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.010
Or if you took the course in the past

144
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.880
and you wanna get a quick wrap up and summary

145
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.960
of the core React features.

146
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.020
So definitely also have at least a brief look

147
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.343
at this module.

148
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.470
I also recommend that you dive

149
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.570
into the brand new routing module,

150
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.020
since there I used React Router version five,

151
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.810
whereas in the old course we used version four.

152
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.590
The differences are not huge,

153
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.150
but the syntax is slightly different.

154
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.240
So definitely have a look at that.

155
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.870
It's also simply better with all your feedback I got.

156
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.270
And also explore the new Redux modules.

157
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.820
Redux still works as I taught it,

158
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.450
but here I now also do not just teach Redux,

159
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.870
but I also explore Redux toolkit in addition,

160
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.310
which is a great library

161
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.590
that makes working with Redux simpler,

162
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.230
and therefore you should definitely also check out

163
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.660
those sections in this new course.

164
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.770
I did also add a brand new testing module,

165
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.260
a brand new authentication module,

166
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.020
and a brand React + TypeScript module.

167
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.370
And for example, React + TypeScript

168
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.570
was not covered in the old course at all.

169
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.220
Definitely also have a look at those modules

170
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.370
since those modules also contain

171
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.520
lots of very important and useful information

172
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.480
which you should not miss.

173
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.400
And as I mentioned,

174
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.520
I also got rid of that big Burger Builder project,

175
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.750
instead we have many smaller demo projects and examples.

176
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.030
So also have a closer look

177
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.050
at all the course sections that have

178
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.373
practice or project in their names.

179
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.360
Now one important note about the testing,

180
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.640
authentication, and React TypeScript modules,

181
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.630
those modules are not unlocked yet.

182
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.570
They will soon be unlocked

183
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.570
because I am currently hitting that

184
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.460
maximum lecture limit here on Udemy,

185
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.789
and therefore I can only unlock them

186
00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.660
once I remove the old course.

187
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.880
And that actually brings me to the next point.

188
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.430
What happens with that old course,

189
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.023
with the existing React course?

190
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.790
Well, as I mentioned, I inserted this new course

191
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.150
into this existing course,

192
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.620
and therefore for a brief period,

193
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.920
you got two courses in one.

194
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.540
This is not something I can keep around forever.

195
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.870
Udemy doesn't like it.

196
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.340
A lot of students don't like it

197
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.730
because you have to go through two courses,

198
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.230
instead of just one.

199
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.200
And it makes the course look bigger

200
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.989
to the outside world than it is.

201
00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:21.080
Therefore, old course lectures

202
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.940
will be unpublished and removed on May 3rd.

203
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.403
So they stay online until May 3rd,

204
00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:28.850
They they will be removed.

205
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.580
But in this course section here,

206
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.950
in the lecture after the next one,

207
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.870
you find download links to all that old course content,

208
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.800
which will also stay around after May 3rd.

209
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.530
So you will keep access to that old course,

210
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.210
even after May 3rd,

211
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.620
just not here in the Udemy platform,

212
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.960
but through those download links.

213
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.470
So you still have access there,

214
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.820
and these download links don't just contain the videos,

215
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.860
but also the captions and extra attachments,

216
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.870
like all those code snapshots.

217
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.810
So you keep that access just not here in the Udemy platform

218
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.810
simply because I'm facing certain limitations here

219
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.390
around which I have to work,

220
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.850
and that is the best possible way I can work around them,

221
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.460
giving you that short transitional period,

222
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.600
and then even thereafter, full access to this old course.

223
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.110
Unfortunately, that means that Q&A threads

224
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.100
and notes will be lost.

225
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.140
These are just limitations that are beyond my control,

226
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.630
but you do get a brand new course for free,

227
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.653
so I guess it's not too bad overall.

228
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.640
But what does this now all mean for you?

229
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.440
How should you now proceed

230
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.260
now that this update is there?

231
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.780
That depends on your current status.

232
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.740
And again, also check out the lecture after this one

233
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.640
for a written summary where you also find

234
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.480
my recommendations again.

235
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.850
There are basically three main states

236
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.720
which we can differentiate.

237
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.930
You did not start the course yet

238
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.510
or you're in very early stages.

239
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.090
You're the third section or something like this,

240
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.760
you are currently doing the course

241
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.490
and you're well into the course,

242
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.900
so you're in section six, or seven, or 10,

243
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.830
or something like that.

244
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.230
Or, you completed the course in the past.

245
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.850
If you just start at the course,

246
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.690
my strong recommendation is that you restart

247
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.210
this course with the updated course.

248
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.720
Since I added the course in front of the old course,

249
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.590
simply go to lecture one and section one,

250
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.900
and restart with that,

251
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.930
and then ignore the old course thereafter.

252
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.250
You can download it through these download links,

253
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.310
which you'll find in this core section here,

254
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.280
in the lecture offered a next one, but you don't have to.

255
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.890
If you are currently going through the course,

256
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.090
you might wanna finish an old course first.

257
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.240
You can also ignore the new course if you want to.

258
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.500
You can either finish it until May 3rd here

259
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.060
inside the Udemy platform,

260
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.710
or you download it so that you can finish it

261
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.313
whenever you want in the future.

262
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.273
Now again,

263
00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:03.210
you can ignore the new course if you want to.

264
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.580
The old course does teach everything you need,

265
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.700
just the structure is not ideal anymore I would say,

266
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.550
but of course have a look at the new course if you can.

267
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.170
Restart the course if you can,

268
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.710
if you have the time and willingness to do so.

269
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.280
Maybe ramp up that playback speed

270
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.430
in the parts that bore you, that you already know.

271
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.450
And go through the new course if possible.

272
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.930
But again, it's not a must-do.

273
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.330
You can stick to the old course if you want to,

274
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.333
also with those download links.

275
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.540
Now if you completed the course in the past,

276
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.680
then you can ignore this update,

277
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.860
you can ignore this new course,

278
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.940
though I do recommend that you at least have a look at those

279
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.570
brand new sections at these

280
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.930
specifically highlighted section

281
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.340
I talked about a couple of minutes ago.

282
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.000
Definitely check out those.

283
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.030
But other than that,

284
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.700
you can ignore the update if you want to.

285
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.470
But of course, you can also restart with the updated course

286
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.140
and take it again to agan learn React

287
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.460
with all that feedback I got from your side

288
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.070
and with this improved way of learning React

289
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.090
that I incorporated into this new course.

290
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.120
Now you can also download the old course

291
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.400
so that you have it for the future,

292
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.650
but you don't have to.

293
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.970
So here, really you have to decide

294
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.920
whether you wanna go through it again or whether you don't.

295
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.013
Now of course I'm aware that there are

296
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:28.280
two topics that matter to a lot of you,

297
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.310
and that would be the course progress

298
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.600
and the completion certificate.

299
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.780
Now you can manually mark those course lecture as completed

300
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.890
to regain that course progress,

301
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.510
and you then also get that certificate again.

302
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.820
That might sound like cheating,

303
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.810
but since you went through the course before,

304
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.620
this is of course absolutely fine.

305
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.830
And whilst it's annoying,

306
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.850
it's just a couple of minutes of work,

307
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.330
and then you restored your state.

308
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.600
So that's my recommendation here.

309
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.770
And that's it for this lecture.

310
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.030
Again, check out the lecture thereafter,

311
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.920
and I hope you enjoy the update

312
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.563
and you get a lot out of it.
