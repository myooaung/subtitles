1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,110
Now, this course

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,490
is about React, but it is worth noting

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,130
that there are alternatives to React.js.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,890
Now we're going to focus on React here and React is one

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,100
of the most popular front-end frameworks

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,260
or libraries, however, you want to call it you can learn.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,610
It's a lean and focused component-based UI library.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,920
It really focuses on this component thing,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,900
and it doesn't have a lot of other features built in.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,580
If you need our features like routing which we are,

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,140
of course, going to learn about in detail in this course

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,080
then you need to install a extra third-party library.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,800
And that will sometimes be the case when working with React,

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,260
that you need to install third-party libraries

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,240
to add certain pieces of functionality to your application

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,700
because React itself really just focuses

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,740
on these components, which we're going

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,440
to learn about in greater detail later,

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,150
what exactly they are and how we create them,

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,350
and how it then renders these components,

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,310
and your user interface onto the screen.

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,983
That's the focus of React and extra functionality

23
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:18,070
which you might need for your React app,

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,800
therefore, sometimes has to be added

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,563
with help of some third-party package.

26
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,650
Now, an alternative to React, which has

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,350
more built in features would be Angular

28
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,040
another very important,

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,800
and very popular front-end framework.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,210
And I got a course on this as well.

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,980
Angular is a complete component-based UI framework.

32
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,000
So, it also focuses on components just like React,

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
but it ships more built in features than React.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
It also embraces TypeScript right from the start.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,490
And it can be overkill for smaller projects,

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,510
therefore, since it has way more features built in.

37
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,490
But for a large project, on the other hand,

38
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,580
you don't need to rely on the community as much

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,750
because there's more built into that framework.

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,870
So, that's simply a little consideration you have to make.

41
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,199
The syntax also looks a bit differently

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,710
because, whilst it is component focused,

43
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,520
building these components works a bit differently

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,240
with Angular than it does with React.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,790
Again, I got a course on that,

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,420
if you want to check out Angular as well.

47
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,383
And we also have another very popular framework,

48
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:29,750
another popular alternative and that would be Vue.js.

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,390
Vue.js is kind of like the mixture of Angular and React,

50
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,460
in between those two extremes,

51
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,410
if you want to call it like this.

52
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,760
It's also a complete component-based UI framework.

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,170
And it also includes a lot of features,

54
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,930
but a bit less features than Angular, but more than React.

55
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,460
It includes core features like routing, for example,

56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,920
and therefore with Vue, you also have

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,089
to rely less on the community and still you don't have

58
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:04,089
as much overload possibly as you might have with Angular,

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,520
depending on what you build.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,110
I also got a more detailed comparison video

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,910
on these three technologies,

62
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,160
in case you're interested in that.

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,290
Now, all three are super popular.

64
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,770
React currently is probably the most popular,

65
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,910
but all three are great, I got courses

66
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,770
on all three and therefore checking

67
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,110
those out might be a good idea as well.

68
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,760
But this course, of course, is about React

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,223
and therefore let's not lose any time, let's dive right in.
