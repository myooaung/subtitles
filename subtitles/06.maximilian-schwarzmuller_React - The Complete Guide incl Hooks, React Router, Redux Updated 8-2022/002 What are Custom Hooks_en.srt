1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,420
So, what are custom hooks?

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,160
And we need to clarify what they are

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,570
before I can dive into the why.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,270
So, what are custom hooks?

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,270
Custom hooks are, in the end, just regular functions

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,970
just as the built-in hooks, like use state, are

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,550
in the end just functions, but they are functions

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,140
which can contain stateful logic.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,930
You can build custom hooks, these custom hook functions

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,930
to outsource stateful logic into reusable functions.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,180
Unlike regular functions, custom hooks can use

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,690
other React hooks, including other custom hooks.

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,220
And they can, therefore, also leverage React state managed

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,180
with use state or use reducer.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,670
They can access use effect and so on.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,770
With custom hooks, you can outsource logic,

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,580
which you might be using in different components,

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,200
into a custom hook, which you can then call

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,210
from all these various components.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,980
So, it is simply a mechanism of reusing logic,

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,510
just as regular functions are with the special thing

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,150
that in these custom hook functions,

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,950
you can use React hooks and other hooks.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,710
And that might, of course, still be a bit abstract.

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,230
So, therefore, let me give you

26
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,840
a concrete example which shows you

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,070
why you might wanna explore custom hooks

28
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,860
and how you then build a custom hook,

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,203
step-by-step and how you use it.
