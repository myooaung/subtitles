00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:03.062
[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] Now with

2
00:00:03.062 --> 00:00:05.090
the conditional content covered here,

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.510
before we continue,

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.350
I wanna restructure the expenses component a little bit.

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.710
And I actually wanna extract that list logic

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.630
into a new component

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.623
to again, make that expenses component a little bit leaner.

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.460
Therefore, I'll add a expenses list JS file,

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.800
and also expenses list dot CSS file

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.130
which you also find attached.

11
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.517
And you can already download my CSS file

12
00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:38.873
and copy the styles into your expenses list CSS file.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.420
In the expenses list JS file,

14
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.230
I will then add a constant expenses list

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.040
which receives props and return something.

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.800
And of course, we export this expenses list

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.420
and we can if we want to also import React from react.

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.343
But again, that is optional.

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720
Now you're in expenses list,

20
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.940
I wanna output my expenses list.

21
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.610
I will not filter in there.

22
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.280
I will keep the filtering logic in expenses

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.750
since that's also where I managed the filtered year

24
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.800
but I will take this fallback content, this if check,

25
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.490
I will take all of that

26
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.403
and move that into my expenses list component.

27
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.630
That means that we also, of course,

28
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.270
wanna import the expense item

29
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.490
from ./ExpenseItem here

30
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.290
since I'm using that component here.

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840
And the filtered expenses no longer exist here.

32
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.000
I just wanna get, let's say, my items here or expenses.

33
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.110
It's up to you. I'll name it items

34
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.890
as props

35
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.733
like this.

36
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.460
Now in expenses JS,

37
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.560
that, of course, means that here

38
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.800
I now wanna output my expenses list

39
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.743
down there.

40
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.770
And of course, we therefore also wanna import expenses list

41
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.030
from the expenses list file

42
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.663
and we can get rid of the expense item import.

43
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.310
And the filtered expenses should now

44
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.160
be passed to expenses list through the items prop,

45
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.370
which I'm using inside of expenses list.

46
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.203
Like this.

47
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.580
Now inside of the expenses list JS file,

48
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.850
I also want to make a couple of changes now.

49
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.140
Of course, we need to return some JSX

50
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.250
but I want to return an unordered list here

51
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.550
and actually give that list a class name

52
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.833
of expenses-list.

53
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.230
This is a class to find here in my CSS file

54
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.370
and therefore, we also wanna import

55
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.370
this expenses list CSS file into the expenses list JS file.

56
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.760
And instead of this unordered list,

57
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.840
I now wanna output

58
00:02:53.685 --> 00:02:54.518
my map here,

59
00:02:54.518 --> 00:02:56.583
my expense item array.

60
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.000
So we'll again, grab that

61
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.350
and render this dynamically here like this.

62
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.510
And I will handle this if case a little bit differently now.

63
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.730
I will add a if check

64
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.620
but I'll check if props items length is equal to zero.

65
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.910
So if we have no items and if that's the case,

66
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.240
I will simply return a totally different JSX snippet

67
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.000
because that's yet another way

68
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.750
of handling conditional content.

69
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.140
If what your component returns changes entirely

70
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.310
based on different conditions, you can use this approach.

71
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.730
It would have not been appropriate here

72
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.660
in expenses JS before,

73
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.160
because only a part of the JSX snippet,

74
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.840
which we returned changed.

75
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.350
So there, the approach I showed

76
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.710
in the last lecture was better,

77
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.510
but if your entire JSX content changes,

78
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.920
when data is missing,

79
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.680
you can always add a if check where you return

80
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.500
a different JSX block if some condition is met.

81
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.030
And here, I simply want to return an h2 tag

82
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.980
with a class name of expenses-list__ fallback

83
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.283
with a text of found no expenses.

84
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.029
So that's what this component, expenses list, will render

85
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.430
if we got no expenses.

86
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.233
Hence, we can also get rid of that variable here.

87
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.310
And then with that,

88
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.270
we see there's found no expenses text

89
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.600
or the filtered list if we switch.

90
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.270
But now, with help of this extra component,

91
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.360
which uses a different logic for rendering

92
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.750
or for returning different JSX code,

93
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.030
and we now also got a little bit

94
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.650
of a leaner expenses JS file again.

95
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.880
Now one additional tweak, which I want to make here

96
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.380
which I almost forgot is that

97
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.620
since I'm using unordered list here now

98
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.834
for semantic reasons in the expense item component,

99
00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.680
I actually wanna switch away

100
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.860
from having a div being rendered to a list item instead.

101
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.090
So I will just wrap this entire card here

102
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.650
with a list item

103
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.560
and visually this doesn't change anything

104
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.190
but semantically this is a little bit better.

105
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.020
So that's just another tiny tweak

106
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.513
which I wanted to make here.
