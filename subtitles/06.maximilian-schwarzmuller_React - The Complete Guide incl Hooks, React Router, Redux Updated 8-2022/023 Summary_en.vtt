00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.600
Now that is it for this course section.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.450
Was again another long section

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.760
but it was about a super important topic, Redux.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.010
And you did learn initially how you can set up Redux

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.040
without React and then how you can set it up

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.770
without Redux Toolkit.

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.820
Now Redux Toolkit is amazing and my strong recommendation

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.610
is to use it because as you saw

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.550
throughout this course section,

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.070
it's much easier to manage your state and your reducers

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.370
and your actions when using Toolkit

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.747
instead of having to set up everything on your own.

13
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.610
Still it's important to know what happens behind the scenes

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.880
which is why I did start without Redux Toolkit

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.800
so that you really know everything about Redux

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.930
what you need to know and so that you're also able

17
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.130
to dive into projects that might not be using Redux Toolkit

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.220
but just Redux.

19
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.420
Now then you learn about these core Redux concepts

20
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.900
and this Redux flow you learned

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.720
about actions and reducers or this one root reducer

22
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.757
and about the fact that Redux has this one

23
00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:16.090
central data store that we can create this store

24
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.780
with configure store when using Redux Toolkit.

25
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.570
And that then as an argument,

26
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.850
we pass in an object where we assign our route reducer.

27
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.500
We either point at just one reducer function,

28
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.138
or we set up such a map of reducers,

29
00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:34.680
which are then merged together

30
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.200
into one big reducer behind the scenes.

31
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.605
Now we also learned how we can then use

32
00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:44.100
our Redux managed data

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130
that we can use useSelector

34
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.020
in our components to read data from our Redux managed state

35
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.060
and that we can use useDispatch to get access

36
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060
to that dispatch function

37
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.150
which we use to dispatch our actions,

38
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.330
which then ultimately leads to our Redux state

39
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.530
being changed.

40
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.870
We also learned that we can pass extra data

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.300
to those actions because you often have actions

42
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.300
and reducer function there for which do need extra data.

43
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.640
We also learned how we would connect a

44
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.200
class-based component to Redux.

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.290
We're not going to use that in this course

46
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.090
and you might not see it too often out there

47
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.810
but on the other hand, there are a lot

48
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.170
of projects which still only use class based components.

49
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.500
So that's definitely also something you

50
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.593
should be aware of.

51
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.900
And there for now we have a very solid foundation

52
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.120
when it comes to Redux.

53
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.260
Redux is an amazing library.

54
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.550
It can replace React context as you learned

55
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.820
but it's also not a must use library.

56
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.350
It's always up to you to decide whether for your project

57
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.580
you want to go with React context,

58
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.600
or if you need Redux.

59
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.760
React context can have certain disadvantages

60
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.393
as I mentioned, but they might not matter in your project.

61
00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:11.030
You might not see or measure any performance issues

62
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.110
and you might not have a super complex setup and management.

63
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.970
Then of course, there's nothing wrong with sticking

64
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.900
to React context, because you must not forget that

65
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.590
if you use Redux, you do add an extra third party library.

66
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.010
And that of course adds

67
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.020
up to the overall code of your application.

68
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.010
It makes your application bigger.

69
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.230
So Redux is not always better.

70
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.071
It can be a decent option and now

71
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:43.030
you know how it works and when you should maybe consider it.

72
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.200
Now we are going to work more with it throughout the course

73
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.690
but this is now a solid foundation

74
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.253
which you need as a React developer.
