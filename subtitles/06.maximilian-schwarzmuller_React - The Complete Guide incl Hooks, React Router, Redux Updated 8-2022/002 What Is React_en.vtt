00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.330
So, let's dive right

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.540
into this video and this topic by answering

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.960
the most important question first.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.960
What exactly is React.js and why would we use it?

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.510
Why do we need it?

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.520
What's the problem it helps us solve?

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.060
Regarding the what, we can, of course, visit reactjs.org,

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.310
the official webpage of React.js.

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.470
And there, we learn that React is a JavaScript library

10
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.470
and it's a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.130
Now, that's quite straightforward.

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.540
It's a library for the JavaScript programming language

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.970
that helps us build user interfaces.

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.513
But what exactly does this nice sentence mean?

15
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.410
React.js is a library and, to be precise,

16
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.550
it's a client-side library.

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.220
It's about client-side JavaScript.

18
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.610
So, the JavaScript code, which runs

19
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.450
in the browsers of your visitors.

20
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.360
And that is important because we use JavaScript

21
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.810
in the browser to manipulate web pages

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.600
after they were loaded, and that allows us

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.630
to build rich, highly interactive,

24
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.310
modern user interfaces for our websites.

25
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.330
Take something like Netflix, for example,

26
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.500
which is actually built with React.

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.140
There, we can browse around, we can hover over one

28
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.020
of the movies or series, and we get more details there.

29
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.460
We can add it to our list, and we can go to that list page

30
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.160
and everything here happens very smoothly,

31
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.410
and also quickly.

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.410
We never need to click anywhere, and load a new HTML page.

33
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.170
That refresh icon, in the top left corner, never spins

34
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.910
Because we never request a new HTML page,

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.840
we never have to wait for a new HTML page

36
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.540
to be generated by the server.

37
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.810
And that happens because JavaScript is doing some work here

38
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.539
and it's updating what we see on the screen,

39
00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.780
the dom, whilst we are working on that page.

40
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.010
And that gives us that nice user experience,

41
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.010
that nice UI, which we know from mobile apps, for example.

42
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.600
When we work with a mobile app,

43
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.320
we're used to things being very reactive.

44
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.930
There, we can work with the app and switch

45
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.150
between different screens without having that latency,

46
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.270
which we know from some websites,

47
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.730
without requesting new HTML pages behind the scenes.

48
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.910
So, mobile apps therefore feel very reactive,

49
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.730
things happen instantly, we don't need to wait

50
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.990
for new pages to load, or for actions to start.

51
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.960
And, traditionally, in web apps that was different.

52
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.350
There, we often had to click a button

53
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.750
and then wait for a new page to be loaded and to show up.

54
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.070
And whilst that, of course, also does work

55
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.150
it is not the same user experience our users know

56
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.030
from their mobile apps, and it's often not

57
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.110
the user experience we want to deliver therefore.

58
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.630
Now, that's a problem we can solve with JavaScript,

59
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.870
JavaScript in the browser, because that allows us

60
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.490
to manipulate the dom and therefore what the user sees

61
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.690
without requesting a new HTML page and waiting for it.

62
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.630
And therefore, just JavaScript would be enough.

63
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.720
But let me give you an example

64
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.840
of just JavaScript and why we might want

65
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.873
to use something like React instead of just JavaScript.
