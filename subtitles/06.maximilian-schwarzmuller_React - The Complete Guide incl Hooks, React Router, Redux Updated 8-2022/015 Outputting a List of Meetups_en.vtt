1
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.870
So for filling those pages with life,

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.150
I will start with that starting page.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.970
So with index.js in the pages folder

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.823
with this index.js file.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.160
In there, we can add our component

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.340
for example, the homepage component.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.800
And of course also exports that,

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620
that's always important.

9
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.090
And then we wanna return the JSX code

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.380
that defines this component,

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.850
and that therefore defines what should show up on the page.

12
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.990
And here, what should show up in the end

13
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.160
is our meetup list component.

14
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.690
And that's a component that wants a meetups prop here

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.350
which holds a list of meetups,

16
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.570
which we then map into a list of JSX elements.

17
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.330
Where every meetup needs to have an ID,

18
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.230
an image, a title, and an address.

19
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.680
And hence, when we use meetup lists in our page component

20
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.810
we need to make sure that we do provide

21
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.410
that meetups prop to it.

22
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.220
It's also worth noting that meetup list

23
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.350
like meetup item and so on,

24
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.290
is a regular React component.

25
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.950
It is however stored in a components' folder,

26
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.270
not in a pages folder.

27
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.120
Now that folder name is up to you.

28
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.800
The only reserved name in the end

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.560
is the page's folder name.

30
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.600
You can name your other folders however you want.

31
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.070
I named it components though,

32
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.140
because I do store React components in there.

33
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.530
But the important difference to the page components is

34
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.400
that those components stored in there

35
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.730
will not be loaded as pages automatically.

36
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.540
Instead, we can simply use them

37
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.220
in the JSX code of other components,

38
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.930
including page components.

39
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.610
So we can include the meetup list component

40
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.710
on our main page here, on the homepage.

41
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.310
Simply by going to that homepage component

42
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.230
and importing meetup lists there

43
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
from going up one level components,

44
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.650
meetups, meetup list.

45
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.110
So I import this component from this file

46
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.950
and then we can use it here.

47
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.600
And hence here we can, for example,

48
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.100
output meetup lists like this

49
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.190
and then set this meetups prop

50
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.430
which this component expects.

51
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.600
And for the moment we can then construct

52
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.380
some dummy meetups here,

53
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.980
later we'll be able to create

54
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.400
and store our own meetups in a database.

55
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.820
For the moment let's use some dummy meetups.

56
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.023
And that actually should be an array,

57
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.430
an array of meetup items where every item has an ID,

58
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.600
for example M1 for the first meetup,

59
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.600
where every meetup then has a title like a first meetup,

60
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.030
where every meetup then has an image.

61
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.840
And for this here, I'm using an image from Wikipedia

62
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.930
which is not taken by me

63
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.220
but which instead was taken by Tomas Wolf

64
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.020
to whom I therefore wanna give due credits.

65
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.780
So this image is taken by him.

66
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.070
And I'll just grab that image here,

67
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.150
grab the URL to that image

68
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
because we're not going to implement file upload here

69
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.323
and use that here as an image URL.

70
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.146
Now, every meetup should then also have an address

71
00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:18.340
because that's another piece of data

72
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.130
which we extract in the meetup list component here.

73
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.940
So we wanna have that address field here as well.

74
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.561
And I'll set this to some address 5,

75
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:31.780
12345, Some City.

76
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.930
And we can also add a description

77
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.400
even though we don't need that yet, but I will add it here.

78
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.700
A description with, "this is our first meetup."

79
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.400
And now we can of course replicate this.

80
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.810
So duplicate this meetup

81
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.500
and give the second one an idea of M2

82
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.430
and then name it as second meetup,

83
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.550
and this is a second meetup.

84
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.000
And maybe change the address

85
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.920
and use a different image as well if you want to.

86
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.570
I'll stick to the same one.

87
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.410
And then we can pass this dummy meetups array

88
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.403
into this meetups prop of the meetup list component.

89
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.190
And that's all standard React.

90
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.400
There's nothing NextJS specific about that.

91
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.600
The only NextJS specific part here

92
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.530
is that we're in a special component

93
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.670
which is special because it's in such a page file.

94
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.150
Other than that, it's a regular React component.

95
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.580
And if we now save that,

96
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.650
if we save this and restart our development server here

97
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.240
because it crashed, because I had no page content initially.

98
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.970
If we visit local host 3000

99
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.460
we should see this on the screen.

100
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.400
This is not the finished look, but this shows that it works

101
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.710
and that our first page has loaded successfully.

102
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.370
And we're using another React component in that page,

103
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.410
a component which is not a page component,

104
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.283
that is also worth pointing out.

105
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.020
And with that, we got this page in place.

106
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.270
Let's now also work on that new meetup page

107
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.103
and let's make sure we render some content here as well.
