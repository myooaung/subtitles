00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.170
Now with that, that's it for this module.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.320
We again practiced using Redux and more importantly,

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.060
we learned about a very important concept,

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.750
we learned about Redux and side-effects

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.850
and asynchronous code.

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.590
We learned that there are different places

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.210
where we can put this asynchronous code

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.830
or where we can put such side-effects,

9
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.770
our components or action creators and we saw both in action.

10
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.479
We also saw how not to do it

11
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.610
when we added all the data transformation code

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.290
in the component which led to a very fat component

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.090
and whilst that was working,

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.470
it simply was not the idea behind using Redux.

15
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.750
There, you should prefer reducers for data transformations

16
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.700
and only put side-effects or async code

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.420
into your components or action creators.

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.320
So that's what we did thereafter.

19
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.140
And we then also moved from component to action creator

20
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.670
to learn about that concept as well

21
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.200
which allows us to keep our components lean

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.790
and focused on a couple of core tasks

23
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.740
instead of doing all the heavy lifting.

24
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.800
Then at the end, we also had a look at the Redux DevTools

25
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.120
and now the important piece of software

26
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.280
which allows us to fully understand

27
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.040
our Redux store and state, and what's going on,

28
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.640
where we can time travel

29
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.540
and where we can gain deep insights into Redux.

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.990
And therefore, now after this module,

31
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
you learned a lot about Redux, a lot of advanced concepts

32
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.410
and you are ready to use Redux

33
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.410
in any kind of application you might be building

34
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.150
with any kind of logic you might have in this application

35
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.480
including side-effects, HTTP requests

36
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.133
or any other kind of async code.
