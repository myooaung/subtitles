00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:04.220
Now we are soon going to get started

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.480
with writing our own React.js code

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.360
and working in our own React projects

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.890
and we are going to learn about

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.840
all of React's cool features.

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.630
Now for writing React code,

7
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.650
you will need a code editor

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.990
and any Web Development Editor

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.250
or IDE can be used.

10
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.780
Atom, Sublime text, Web Storm,

11
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.590
whatever you want.

12
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.360
My recommendation and the Editor

13
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.400
I will use in this course though,

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.650
is Visual Studio Code.

15
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.740
It's a free code editor,

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.960
and it's amazing.

17
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.850
So free and amazing is a pretty good combination.

18
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.660
And that's why I will use it.

19
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.430
You can download and install it

20
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.840
for all major operating systems

21
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.510
and therefore this is the editor I will use

22
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.830
throughout this course.

23
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.040
You can simply visit code.visualstudio.com.

24
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.970
Download the installer from there,

25
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.950
and then simply walk through that installer.

26
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.600
It's a standard installer, nothing special there.

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
Now, once you did install Visual Studio Code

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940
you can open it.

29
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.280
And once you did open it,

30
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.940
it will look something like this.

31
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.870
Now the exact look can differ

32
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.350
but it should look something like this.

33
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.170
You can tweak the appearance

34
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.610
under View Appearance.

35
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.800
For example, I will remove the Status Bar

36
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.410
and you can then open files or folders.

37
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.010
Through this Open Folder button here

38
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.973
or this File, Open or Open Folder button in the File menu.

39
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.410
And you can simply open the React projects

40
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.160
you are going to work on throughout this course

41
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.880
with this editor.

42
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.480
So at this point we don't have a project yet.

43
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.350
Later once we do have projects,

44
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.930
simply open those project folders

45
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.510
with this editor,

46
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.173
and you'll then be able to work on your code.

47
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.740
Now regarding the settings and the styling

48
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.480
and the look of this editor

49
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.700
you can of course fine-tune it to your requirements.

50
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.590
I'm using a theme here

51
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.660
and you can change it under preferences, color theme

52
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.850
and I'm using the Dark+ theme here.

53
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.210
You can, of course also switch to other themes

54
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.570
but I like this Dark+ theme.

55
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.330
So if you wanna have that same look

56
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.360
you can use that same theme here.

57
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.210
Throughout this course

58
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.010
I will also be a bit zoomed in.

59
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.150
And of course, that is something

60
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.210
I'm just doing here for this course

61
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.110
so that you can view my code without issues.

62
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.200
I will also sometimes remove this Side Bar

63
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.800
which you can do with View Appearance Show Side Bar

64
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.973
or with the shortcut you see here.

65
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.710
Now, in addition,

66
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.550
the great thing about Visual Studio Code is

67
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.790
that you can install extensions

68
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.340
under View Extensions.

69
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.470
And here I got a bunch of extensions installed

70
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.710
but there aren't many important ones.

71
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.580
Most of these extensions have nothing to do with a React.

72
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.980
There are two extensions

73
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.320
I wanna mention though.

74
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.430
The first one is Prettier.

75
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.580
This is an extension which will help with code formatting

76
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.860
because in Visual Studio Code,

77
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.740
if you go to your keyboard shortcuts,

78
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.290
there is a Format Document shortcut,

79
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.090
which you can bind in case it's not bound for you yet,

80
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.550
which you can press once you got some code

81
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.260
and it will then format your code so that it looks nicer.

82
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.610
Simply remove redundant white space

83
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.460
and so on.

84
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.600
So this can help with keeping your code clean and readable.

85
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.210
And this shortcut can benefit from this extension

86
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.220
which helps with formatting.

87
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.113
So installing Prettier might be a good idea.

88
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.970
Once you did install it,

89
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.580
you might just wanna check out your settings

90
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.110
under Preferences Settings

91
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.890
and then search for format here

92
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.563
and make sure you set your Default Formatter to Prettier.

93
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.710
And then this Format Document shortcut

94
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:05.760
which I showed you

95
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.350
should use Prettier.

96
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.960
Now that's one extension.

97
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.410
The other extension,

98
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.320
which I use in some course modules,

99
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.810
is the Material Icon extension.

100
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.173
The Material Icon Theme extension.

101
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.120
You can download and enable this as well.

102
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.060
And I will be using it in some,

103
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.440
but not all course sections.

104
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.860
This extension will simply change the file icons,

105
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.960
the look of the file icons.

106
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.020
And therefore, of course, it's 100% optional

107
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.310
and you don't need it.

108
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.450
And that's all that is the setup I'm using in this course.

109
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.950
This is the editor I'm using in this course.

110
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.610
And of course you can and should tweak it exactly

111
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.670
how you want it.

112
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.123
I just wanted to introduce you to my set up.
