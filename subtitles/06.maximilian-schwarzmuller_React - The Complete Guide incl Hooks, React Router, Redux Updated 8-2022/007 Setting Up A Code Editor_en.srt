1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,040
Now I did now open this React course folder,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,340
which we created in the last step

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,910
with my editor, Visual Studio Code.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,240
Now you can use any code editor you want.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,360
If you have a favorite editor all ready,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,860
you can stick to this.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,020
But you should you as some code editor to have a better time

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,140
working with React.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,430
And here I'm using Visual Studio Code,

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,880
which is a great free IDE for web development.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,359
It's available for all major platforms.

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,340
MacOS, Windows, Linux.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,020
You can simply download it from code.visualstudio.com

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,520
and then once you download it and installed it,

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,550
simply open your folder that we created

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,650
in the last step.

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,210
This react course folder.

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,040
In my case with Visual Studio Code,

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,900
simply with the file open,

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,340
or open folder on windows.

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,980
Now, once you did that, you should see something like this.

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,200
Now you can tweak the settings of Visual Studio Code.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,270
If you want to, if you have a different theme

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,610
and you want my theme,

25
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,180
you can go to preferences, color theme.

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,760
I'm using the dark plus theme, and it is worth noting that

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,400
with Visual Studio Code under, view,

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,110
you can tweak the appearance of the editor.

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,870
For example, if you have a status bar at the bottom

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,000
and things like that, which I disabled here,

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,120
and you can go to view extensions,

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,450
to install extra third party extensions into

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,803
Visual Studio Code, which can add new functionality.

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,770
Now I got a bunch of extensions installed,

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,070
which you don't need,

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,480
but there's one extension which I do recommend.

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,110
And that's the Prettier extension.

38
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,550
You can simply search for Prettier here,

39
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,550
and then install that extra extension.

40
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,790
This is an extension that helps with code formatting

41
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,620
and which therefore helps with making

42
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,220
your code more readable with a simple keystroke

43
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,410
For this you then also want to make sure

44
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,330
that under preferences,

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,720
keyboard shortcuts, if you search for format document,

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,760
you have discharge cut bound

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,690
because that format document shortcuts can then

48
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,180
use Prettier to format your code and make it more readable.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,570
For this to ensure that you use Prettier.

50
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,830
You might want to go to your settings

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,970
to your user or project specific settings,

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,590
and then there's simply searched for format

53
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,640
and under default formatter,

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,550
you want to select Prettier vscode,

55
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,513
which should be available since we installed Prettier.

56
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,640
Now that's the set up I'm using here in the end.

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,320
And with that, I got an editor configured

58
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,810
for my requirements, which we can now use to dive into

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,090
that react project that was created for us

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,420
and which we can now use to write some react code.

61
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,130
So let's now as a first step,

62
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,570
clean up this project to get rid of some

63
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,680
of the starting files and then start

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,153
from scratch again, to learn, react in depth.
