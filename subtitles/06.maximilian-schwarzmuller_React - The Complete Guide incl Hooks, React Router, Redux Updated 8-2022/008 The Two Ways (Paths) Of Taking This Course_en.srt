1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,719
Now for this course,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,660
I got two different approaches

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,920
two different options for you on how to take this course

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,570
how to go through that course.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,640
The first approach which I have

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,110
which is the recommended one, is to standard approach.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,130
With this approach.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,390
You simply start in lecture one in section one

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,940
I guess you already did that

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,480
but you simply then continue lecture by lecture.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,040
You maybe code along.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,930
You might repeat some concepts

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,100
but you go through the entire course.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,660
Step-by-step in order

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,980
because I built the course such

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,200
that all the modules built up

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,460
on each other and you'll learn react.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,640
Step-by-step if you simply go

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,590
through the course in the order, I give it to you.

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,270
You can optionally go

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,280
through that JavaScript refresher section

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,160
which is the next core section

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,240
but you can also skip that refresher if you don't need it.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,430
And then at the end of the course

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,260
I have a react summary module,

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,120
which basically sums up all the course concepts

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,410
from the ground up

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,140
not diving into them as deeply as the entire course does

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,550
but giving you a good overview

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,880
of what you'll learn in a very concise way.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,690
And you can use this react summary module.

32
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,730
Once you've completed the course to get a good wrap

33
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,330
up off the course and of what you learned

34
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,860
and all to half this module.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,400
If you come back to this course

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,900
in a couple of months or years even

37
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,600
if you want to quickly dive into react again

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,480
because maybe you haven't worked

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,170
with it for a couple of months

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,570
and then this summary module can also help you

41
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,920
and you don't have to go through the entire course again.

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,030
You can instead just take that summary module

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,810
and save some time.

44
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,280
So that's the first approach go through the entire course

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,150
step-by-step in the recommended order.

46
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,180
And then at the end, go through that summary module

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,342
to get a nice summary of what you'll learn.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,250
Now, the alternative approach is

49
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,210
the summary approach as I like to call it.

50
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,640
And that approach is for you if you are in a hurry.

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,060
With this approach if you decide to take this approach,

52
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,900
you simply skip the entire course basically,

53
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,210
and you skip forward

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,440
to that react summary module at the end.

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,370
Maybe you also go through

56
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,820
that JavaScript refresher module first.

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,120
So that next course section

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,003
but that's also optional, of cause.

59
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,970
So you then skip to the end

60
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,800
to this react summary course section.

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,950
And you go through that summary section first

62
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,990
because that summary section is built

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,728
such that you can take it

64
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:03,320
without going through this entire course first.

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,210
It works standalone

66
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,050
and then it will give you a very concise

67
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,310
and compressed way of learning react.

68
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,850
You'll learn about all the core features

69
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,220
that you need to know about react in four hours

70
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,180
and that's of cause way faster than

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,620
if you go through the entire course.

72
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,300
Now it should be needless to say

73
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,730
that of course, we're not going to dive as deeply

74
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,510
into react in that summary section as we do

75
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,690
in the rest of the course

76
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,290
and that not all concepts are covered there

77
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,460
but it's a quick overview of all the core features.

78
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,030
And if you just wanna get started with react quickly

79
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,120
going through that summary section is a good idea.

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,590
You can then still go

81
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,810
through the entire course they're after

82
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,420
once you have more time.

83
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,540
And that is something I would recommend

84
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,240
because of cause it's this complete course,

85
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,620
which will teach you react in death,

86
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,500
not the summary course section.

87
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,350
There is a reason why this is a huge, very long course

88
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,920
and you can't pack that all into four sections.

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
If that would be possible, I would have done it.

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,370
So that is simply an alternative approach.

91
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,519
And you can go

92
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,173
with whichever approach were expander for you.
