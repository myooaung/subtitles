1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,210
So let's work on this button in the header

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,190
and we could add all the JSX code in here.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,560
I will create a separate component for this, though.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,680
Again, you could do the same for the image here, by the way,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,630
but I will leave the image in here, actually,

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,220
since that's not a lot of JSX code,

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,670
but I will create a separate component

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,000
for the HeaderCartButton.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,623
So, HeaderCartButton.js is my file name here.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,290
And we could create that component

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,950
in the header JS file, as well,

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,460
since we're only going to use it in that file

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,330
but I wanna keep that file lean and not bloated,

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,930
therefore, I will follow this common convention

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,893
of creating a separate file.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,470
We will also need some styling and for this, attached,

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,590
you find a HeaderCartButton.module.css file

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,630
which you can simply copy into your layout folder

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,383
and this includes some styles for this button.

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,730
And then in the JS file for the HeaderCartButton

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,480
I will add my HeaderCartButton function,

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,113
my component function, which receives props.

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,210
And, of course, also export it

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,960
like this and then let's work on

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,823
the JSX code for the button.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,500
For this, here, I wanna return a button, of course,

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,450
and inside of that button

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,200
I now wanna have an icon, then some text

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,750
and then a little badge

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,133
with the current number of items in the cart.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,220
Therefore, I will add three spans in there.

32
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,470
The first one will wrap the icon, the second one the text

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,883
and the third one the batch.

34
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,130
And when it comes to this icon,

35
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,940
I also got a finished component for you which you can use

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,890
and that's the CartIcon JS file,

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,200
which you could add to the layout folder

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,720
because that's where we use it so this would make sense,

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,030
but what you can also add to the cart folder

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,183
because, of course, it is a icon specifically for the cart.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,170
And whilst in this application

42
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,780
we will only use it in the HeaderCartButton.

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,720
You could be using it in other parts of the app as well

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,030
and therefore you might want to

45
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,090
store it in the feature folder,

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,390
in the cart folder instead of the layout folder,

47
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,520
but that is totally up to you.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,740
Either way, this attached CartIcon JS file

49
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,190
simply holds an SVG icon, and not much more,

50
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,253
and you can use that to WellRender this CartIcon.

51
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,830
So, therefore, here back in the HeaderCartButton JS file

52
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,830
I simply wanna import CartIcon from going up one level

53
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,290
Cart/CartIcon.

54
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,760
So, I import it as a regular component

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,513
because it is our regular functional component.

56
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,060
And then, here in this span, I will add CartIcon like this,

57
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,440
as a self-closing component.

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,740
So, it's a regular React component even though it holds SVG

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,990
because that is something you can do in React.

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,173
You can use SVG code in your JSX code, as well.

61
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,353
Now, in the second span I will have a text of Your Cart.

62
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,970
And in the third span I wanna output

63
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,110
the total amount of items in the cart.

64
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,320
And, for the moment, we don't have the logic

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,810
for accounting this yet so, therefore,

66
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,970
here for the moment I will just hard-code it,

67
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,333
let's say, free, as a dummy value.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,630
Now we will need some styles so, therefore,

69
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,020
here I will import classes from the

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,060
HeaderCartButton.module.css file

71
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,180
and then on the button itself we can add a class

72
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,003
which should be classes.button.

73
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,910
Then, on that span with the icon

74
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,610
I will add a class of classes.icon

75
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,430
and, of course, these again, button, icon and so on.

76
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,050
These, again, are just predefined CSS classes

77
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,423
in that CSS file.

78
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,403
And for the badge we, therefore, add classes.badge.

79
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,620
If we do that, we can now use this HeaderCartButton

80
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,680
in the header JS file.

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,854
Here, I wanna replace this button with it

82
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:38,854
so, therefore, I will simply import HeaderCartButton

83
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,683
from "./HeaderCartButton"; like this.

84
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,130
And then here, simply add HeaderCartButton.

85
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,670
And now, if you save everything you should have a button

86
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,000
that looks like this in your header.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,470
If it doesn't look like this, definitely download

88
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,690
and compare my code snapshot

89
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,923
because, well, this is all just JSX

90
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,080
and CSS working together right now.

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,653
So, you should definitely have a output like this.

92
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,790
The button, of course, doesn't do anything yet

93
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,030
but that is something we will add throughout this module.

94
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,560
But for the moment we, therefore, are done with that header.

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,630
We added this header, it's finished now

96
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,103
and now we can work on the next parts of this application.
