00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,350
Now that's it for this introduction

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,120
to class-based components.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,130
I showed you that they exist, how they work

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,020
and how you write your own ones,

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,140
how you work with prompts and the render method,

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,410
how you work with state, and also how you work

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,830
with these life cycle methods for side effects

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,280
and we also had a look at how you use context.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,890
You can build your entire application

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,770
with class-based components if you want to.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,020
That is absolutely fine.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,000
And in the past, as I mentioned, you had to use them

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,770
in some cases.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,290
But in modern React apps, you typically

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,050
stick to functional components instead,

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,170
simply because they are leaner and more flexible,

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,560
as you learned throughout this module.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,270
That's why I also started with functional components

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,680
in this course now, because the React Echo system

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,600
transitioned to functional components as the main thing

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,820
and that's why I focus on functional components

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,790
in this course.

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,210
Also, going forward, for the rest of this course,

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,722
functional components will be the focus

25
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:13,680
and I will only occasionally show you

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,243
how to work with class-based components.

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,418
Nonetheless, I wanna emphasize that you don't have to use

28
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:24,808
functional components, it is fine to use class-based ones

29
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:27,130
if you prefer them,

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,200
but chances are that you also see the benefits

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,150
of functional components, and therefore it is fine

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,320
to generally ignore class-based components.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,718
With one exception, to which I'll come back to

34
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:41,420
in a couple of minutes.

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,690
Now if you're not sure which approach to use,

36
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,850
if you're not sure whether you wanna go with class-based

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,950
or functional components, here's a little

38
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,490
helper decision tree, if you wanna call it like that.

39
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,260
As a general rule, you should simply prefer

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,000
functional components and you should instead

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,850
use class-based components if you personally prefer them

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,646
so if you disagree, if you like them,

43
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:11,170
of course you can use them, there's nothing wrong with them.

44
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,360
If you are working on a project or if you're in a team

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,630
where there are a lot of class-based components being used,

46
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,210
you might not have a choice then and you might be

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,700
confusing your colleagues if you start working

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,240
with functional components only,

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,450
and you also should use, and you must use,

50
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,930
class-based components if you're building error boundaries.

51
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,020
Now, that's something we haven't learned yet,

52
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,450
but that's exactly what we're going to take a look at

53
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,023
in the next lecture now.
