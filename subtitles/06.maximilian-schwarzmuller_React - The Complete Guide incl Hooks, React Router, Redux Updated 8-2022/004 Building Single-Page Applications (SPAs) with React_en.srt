1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,260
Now because things get easier with React,

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,090
and because we can build those

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,100
rich user interfaces with React and JavaScript,

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,170
when working with React we often build

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,290
so-called Single Page Applications.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,570
Because whilst we can use React

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,410
to control parts of an HTML page,

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,200
let's say some interactive sidebar,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,810
and therefore we add a widget, you could say

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,110
to a page where only a part of

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,410
the page is controlled with React.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,110
It is more common to control

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,580
the entire page with React.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,320
Which means that we use React

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,500
for everything we see on the screen

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,370
and even for switching pages.

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,970
So when we click on a link

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,509
and we load a new page

19
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,600
as I did with Netflix when I clicked on my list

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
it looks to the user as if we switched a page

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
but we actually don't request

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,940
a new HTML file from some server.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,710
Instead we just used JavaScript through React.js

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,790
to change what's visible on the screen.

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,230
And that often leads to a smoother UI

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,450
and a better user experience.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,290
As you see it at the example of Netflix.

28
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,740
It's built with React

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,900
and there we never request a second HTML page.

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,430
Hence it's a Single Page Application

31
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,750
where after the initial request

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,350
to decide React takes over

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,833
and controls what we see on the screen.
