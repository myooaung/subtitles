1
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.950
So with that error solved

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.770
the application is running again.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.700
Now I can start adding goals again

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.160
for example, Master React.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.233
And also let's say,

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.560
Check out other courses on React.

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.290
Now I added these goals

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.223
and now I actually also have

9
00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:26.640
another error in this application.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.080
Another error, which won't lead

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.750
to a compilation error here

12
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.140
and which won't show up here

13
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.830
on the main screen though.

14
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.210
If I delete my newly added

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.410
Check out other courses on React goal,

16
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.830
you see it's there.

17
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.760
Actually the other goal I added was deleted

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.030
even though I clearly clicked on

19
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.593
the Checkout other courses on React goal.

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.110
So since that worked before

21
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.830
in the other course modules

22
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.000
there has to be something in my code

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.330
that is causing this error.

24
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.730
So what could be the problem here?

25
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.030
I'm not getting an error message here on the screen

26
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.250
not here in the terminal either.

27
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.313
So how can we now solve such error?

28
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.350
Well, there are a couple of things you can do.

29
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.040
A couple of steps that are worth a try.

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.670
Let's first of all go to the place

31
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.220
where we have that deletion logic.

32
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310
We got our course goal list

33
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.550
and there we have on the lead

34
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.700
where we trigger props on the lead item.

35
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.100
If you go into a course goal

36
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.084
item we see on the lead

37
00:01:28.084 --> 00:01:31.040
is in the end triggered when we click on that.

38
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.810
I don't really see an error here

39
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.200
with our forwarding that ID in course goal list.

40
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.110
We just pass on that event in the end to

41
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.620
on the lead item, on the course goal list component.

42
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.480
So if you go to the app component

43
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.550
where this ultimately is being rendered,

44
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.680
we see that the delete item handler is executed

45
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.100
and there we get the goal ID

46
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550
and we delete a goal.

47
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.750
Now a goal was deleted as we saw just the wrong one.

48
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
So did the leash logic in general seems to work,

49
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.743
but maybe the ID is wrong.

50
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.804
So maybe we should go to the place

51
00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:11.270
where the IDs are generated and assigned.

52
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.040
And that's here in the add Goal Handler.

53
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.890
And here indeed, I changed something.

54
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.170
I set my ID to a hard-coded string.

55
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.620
Previously here I used math random

56
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.230
to derive a pseudo unique ID.

57
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.130
Now with the hard-coded string

58
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.010
I introduced a logical error here.

59
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.010
The error is that I assigned the same ID to all goals.

60
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.250
So therefore they're no longer distinguishable by ID.

61
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.160
And hence, if we click on a goal

62
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.020
the first goal that has the ID

63
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.860
which is found in the goals array, is deleted.

64
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.550
And that's always the first goal I ever added.

65
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.740
That's why not this goal was deleted

66
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.573
but the goal which I added before.

67
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.370
So that's a logical mistake

68
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.420
and I was able to narrow it down

69
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.920
by going through that complete chain of events.

70
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.670
Click on a goal, we triggered a deletion handler

71
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.010
and I had to look at all those steps

72
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.580
to narrow down the problem

73
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.030
to finally find this problem here.

74
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.363
And this is a perfectly fine way of trying to solve this.

75
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.010
Now here's another thing that could help you.

76
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.150
If I add goals again.

77
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.980
Check out other courses on React

78
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.283
and Master React.

79
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.690
If I do that

80
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.187
and I again click on the first goal

81
00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:36.080
and the second one is deleted.

82
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.340
Let's now open up the developer tools here

83
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.760
And there, let's have a look at the console,

84
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.760
the JavaScript development and debugging console.

85
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.730
Here the browser gives us any

86
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.880
logging messages we added to our code

87
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.620
and also some warnings and errors

88
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.300
that are thrown by the library

89
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.403
which don't crash the whole application necessarily.

90
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.173
And here we see that we got a warning actually.

91
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.570
And we get that warning already when we add a goal.

92
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.130
The warning that I get here is in the end that

93
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.893
React encountered two children with the same key.

94
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.830
So two children with the same key

95
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.433
were found here with the key goal1.

96
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.310
And this is implicitly related to our deletion problem.

97
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.650
Now, again, we're not getting that

98
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.130
warning when I delete something.

99
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.640
We already get that warning when I add a new goal.

100
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.020
But this already tells us that

101
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.630
we have some error in our code.

102
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.600
Because if we got two children with the same ID,

103
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.120
with the same key in the end,

104
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.500
then we seem to have an error in our code

105
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.780
where we assigned the same ID multiple times,

106
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.280
which indeed is the problem we have.

107
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.870
And React of course also tells you

108
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.760
where the problem occurs.

109
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.690
This here is an error related to our list

110
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.900
because that key concept as learned

111
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.010
in the lists and conditional module is related to lists.

112
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.930
But it is related to the list here

113
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.203
in the unordered list in the

114
00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:07.010
core skill list component, line eight.

115
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.370
So again, you get a pretty clear idea

116
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.870
of where this warning in this case is coming from,

117
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.010
and you can then have a look at the code there

118
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.050
and find out why that problem occurs.

119
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.870
And if you then work your way back

120
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.910
to the place where goals are added

121
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.090
which is the place where the IDs are added

122
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.590
which in turn are the things that are used as keys here

123
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.760
we do use the goal ID as a key.

124
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.990
Well then you would be able to come back

125
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.300
to the place where the hard-coded goal1 ID is.

126
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.930
Because we even see that goal1

127
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.130
is the problem here in the warning.

128
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.460
So that's another way how you

129
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.940
might've solved this problem.

130
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.180
But you can also use another approach.

131
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.250
You can use the debugger built into the browser.

132
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.833
You can use break points.
