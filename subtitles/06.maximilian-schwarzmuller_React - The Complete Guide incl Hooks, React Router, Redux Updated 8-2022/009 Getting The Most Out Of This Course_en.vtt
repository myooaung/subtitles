00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.600
Now, before we now finally get started

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.310
with React and with writing code,

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.990
I want to give you a couple of tips and tricks

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.900
that help you with getting the most out of this course.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.530
Of course, this is a video on-demand course and therefore,

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.230
the most important thing you can do when taking this course

7
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.340
is that you watch the videos.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.010
You should of course do that, but watch them at your pace.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.730
You got those speed controls in the video player.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.710
You can speed me up if I'm going too slow

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.210
or slow me down a bit if I'm going too fast.

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.370
You can also pause and rewind and repeat

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.030
and these are all things you should do

14
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.920
and take advantage of.

15
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.690
It's a video on-demand course, no live course.

16
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.920
So take advantage of this and go through the course

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.440
and through the lectures at your pace.

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.020
It's totally normal

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.060
that you sometimes will need to repeat a lecture

20
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.840
because you maybe didn't fully understand the concept yet.

21
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.880
Do that, that is the idea of this course.

22
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.760
But also, don't just watch the videos

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.500
also consider coding along and practicing what you learn.

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.230
Often in this course, I will tell you to practice something.

25
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.260
I will challenge you to try something on your own

26
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.520
before we then do it together.

27
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.720
But even if I don't do that, always consider pausing

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.420
and trying something out on your own first

29
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.670
before we do it together.

30
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.120
Once we did something together, maybe pause

31
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.020
and try rebuilding what we just build on your own.

32
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.790
These are really crucial steps and tricks

33
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.830
that help you get way more out of this course.

34
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.440
So definitely, consider coding along and practicing

35
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.130
because it is practice

36
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.763
that will turn you into an expert at the end.

37
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.170
Now it is 100% normal that at some point

38
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.050
when you follow along and when you practice,

39
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.750
you will face problems.

40
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.660
You will have some errors

41
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.199
and you will need to find solutions.

42
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.430
And definitely, try debugging errors

43
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.660
and finding solutions on your own first.

44
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.230
Also, use the code attachments

45
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.710
which you find on the last lecture of every module

46
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.890
to solve problems on your own.

47
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.480
Those code attachments come as links to GitHub

48
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.470
and from GitHub, you can download my code snapshots

49
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.890
to then compare them to yours.

50
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.560
And when you compare my code to yours,

51
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.920
when you maybe replace your code with mine

52
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.050
temporarily step by step,

53
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.130
you should be able to narrow down issues

54
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.610
and solve problems on your own.

55
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.450
And that is extremely important.

56
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.750
As a developer,

57
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.600
you need to be able to solve problems on your own.

58
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.230
So use what you learned in this course, use Google

59
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.360
and use the code attachments

60
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.223
to try and debug and solve problems on your own.

61
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.230
Now, of course, you also might sometimes be stuck

62
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.120
and you're not able to find a solution on your own.

63
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.760
Now for that, we got a great community here.

64
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.470
Help each other and learn together.

65
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.540
We got a highly active Discord channel,

66
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.960
attached, you'll find a link to that channel,

67
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.130
which you can join for free.

68
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.525
And there, you will find a lot of like-minded people,

69
00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.670
other developers, and you can discuss problems

70
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.480
or anything there with them.

71
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.420
And we of course, also have the Q&A board

72
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.890
where you can post questions if you're stuck

73
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.170
but also consider not just posting there,

74
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.920
but also try helping others, because it is helping others

75
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.490
and diving into problems and solving problems

76
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.180
which will turn you into an expert developer at the end.

77
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.220
And if you consider these tips and tricks,

78
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.780
then you should be able to get a lot out of this course

79
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.890
and there is nothing that would keep you

80
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.383
from becoming a React expert.
