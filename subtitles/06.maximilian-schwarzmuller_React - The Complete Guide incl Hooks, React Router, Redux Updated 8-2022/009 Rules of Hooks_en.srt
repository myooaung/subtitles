1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:08,590
So we spend a lot of time on you state, but it is the most important state react, offers, react,

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,750
offers more hooks than just use state, but it really is an important hook.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,440
If we analyze it, then it's clear that the idea behind you state is that we can manage state in a functional

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,380
component by calling you state with some initial state which we can set up.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,070
You don't have to pass an initial state.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,229
By the way, if you want to have null or undefined as initial state, you simply pass no argument at

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,130
all to use state.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,460
And this creates a state which is managed by Riak behind the scenes and which survives referendum cycles

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,180
and what you get backed by your state is that array with exactly two elements a pointer at your state.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,600
That's the first element and a state update function.

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,670
That's the second element.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,500
This is how you state works.

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,970
Now, there are two important rules when you work with Hooke's, with any Hooke's, not just with use

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,040
state, but also with any other rehook you'll learn about in this module.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:12,280
For one, you must only use the hooks in functional components or inside of Abre custom hooks, which

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,010
will build later.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,690
The second important rule is that you always have to use the hooks on the root level in your component.

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,980
Now, what does this mean?

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,000
It means that you can't use a hook in the nested function.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,490
Here I have to submit Handler, which isn't doing much right now, but we can't use use state in here,

21
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,300
for example.

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,240
And actually we already get an error here because modern reac projects already have code checks which

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:46,180
determined that this year is using a hook in something that's never a react function component nor another

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,110
hook, and therefore it's not allowed to use it here.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,710
You're also not allowed to, for example, use a hook in some if statement.

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:59,080
So if you had some condition and then you want to create some state that's also not allowed here.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,060
Unfortunately, my project doesn't determine that this is wrong, but this is simply not allowed.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,810
You must not use your hooks in a for loop.

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,780
And if statement or in another function, use it on the root level of your functional component or on

30
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,520
the root level of approx.
