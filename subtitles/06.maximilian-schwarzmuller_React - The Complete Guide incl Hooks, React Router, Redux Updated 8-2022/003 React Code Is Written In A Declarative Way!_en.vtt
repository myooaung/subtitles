00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.160
So React is all about components

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.210
and I hope I could make it clear

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.430
why it's all about components

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.960
and what exactly a component is.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.240
So therefore the next question is,

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.330
how exactly is a component built?

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.030
Now we'll dive into the concrete code in just a second.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.180
In general, it's just important to keep in mind

9
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.800
what I mentioned earlier.

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.070
In the end user interfaces are about HTML,

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700
CSS and JavaScript.

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.080
And therefor all these components are about combining HTML,

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.700
CSS and JavaScript.

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.420
When we work with React and we build components,

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750
we in the end do just that.

16
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.650
We combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript in all these components

17
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.850
and then we combine all of these components together

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.940
to build the entire user interface.

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.840
Though, I will say while CSS of course matters

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.930
and we're going to add CSS in this course,

21
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.950
it's the least important part here.

22
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.230
Mostly React components

23
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.910
are about combining HTML and JavaScript and then of course,

24
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.250
you also can add CSS but that's not the focus of React.

25
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.430
Nonetheless, I will teach you of course

26
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.790
how you can make sure that your components look beautiful.

27
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.900
So long story short,

28
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.040
React is all about components and about building

29
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.710
these components which we combined together.

30
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370
React allows you to create these re-usable

31
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.170
and reactive components,

32
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.270
and you are going to see

33
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.950
what reactive means in detail later,

34
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.210
React allows you to build these re-usable

35
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.610
and reactive components consisting of HTML and JavaScript

36
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.710
and as I mentioned also a bit of CSS.

37
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.950
Now here's the important part though.

38
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.000
As you will learn throughout this course,

39
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.850
React uses something which is called a declarative approach

40
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.380
for building these components.

41
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.420
And you will see what exactly that is,

42
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.010
but it basically means that with React,

43
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.009
you will not tell React that a certain HTML element

44
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.370
should be created and inserted in a specific place

45
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.570
on the user interface as you would be doing it

46
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.750
with Vanilla JavaScript,

47
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.570
so with just JavaScript, for example.

48
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.060
Instead with React and that's really important,

49
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.850
you will always define the desired end state,

50
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.080
the target state or possibly also different target states

51
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.010
depending on different conditions

52
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.610
and it's then React's job to figure out

53
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.610
which elements on the actual webpage might need to be added

54
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.400
or removed or updated.

55
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.290
And you don't write these concrete DOM

56
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.880
updating instructions on your own

57
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.580
as you would be doing it with just JavaScript,

58
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.140
instead with React and React components,

59
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.220
you just define these end states

60
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.150
and under which conditions which state should be used

61
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.090
and then React will do all of the rest under the hood.

62
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.640
It's a bit like magic,

63
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.340
it's of course not actual magic

64
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.900
but it will make your life as a developer much easier.

65
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.810
So you could say that in the end

66
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.600
we just built our own custom HTML Elements

67
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.040
and we combined them together for building a user interface.

68
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.600
But that's enough of the theory for now.

69
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.890
Let's now finally dive into some code

70
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.053
and start building these components.
