00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,830
Hi, and welcome to this course about React.js,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,363
the most popular JavaScript library

3
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:08,180
you can learn these days.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,320
I'm super happy to welcome you on board.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,270
My name is Maximilian Schwarzmuller

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,770
and I will be your instructor in this course.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,040
Now in this first course section here,

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,060
I'm going to walk you through the most important questions.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,980
What is React?

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,010
Why do we use it?

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,090
And I'll also explain what's inside this course,

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,500
how you can take this course,

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,200
which content you find in here.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Therefore, my recommendation is that you carefully

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,259
go through all those lectures

16
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,620
so that you will get a great overview of both

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,660
React and this course.

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,450
And then thereafter, in this course,

19
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,100
you're really going to learn all about React

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,550
in great detail, step-by-step.

21
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,510
You don't need any prior React knowledge.

22
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,120
You just need basic JavaScript knowledge,

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,360
and I also got a refresher on that,

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
so that we're all on the same page,

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,970
and therefore I'd say let's not waste any time.

26
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,440
Instead, let's dive into the most important question first.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
What exactly is React

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,483
and why might it be a good idea to learn it?
