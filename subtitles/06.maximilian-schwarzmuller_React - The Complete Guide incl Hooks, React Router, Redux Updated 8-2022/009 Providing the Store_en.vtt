00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:04.130
To provide our Redux store

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.650
to the React app,

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.700
we typically go into this index JS file,

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.800
where we rendered the entire app.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.190
So to the highest level we can go,

6
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.250
in our react application,

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.720
to the top of our component tree,

8
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.400
where we render this root component.

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.800
And now here,

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.800
we can import from react Redux.

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.220
So not from Redux,

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.630
but from react Redux.

13
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.760
And what we import here,

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.970
is now the provider component.

15
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.653
This is actually a component.

16
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.980
And now we wrap,

17
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.770
all our root component, with provider,

18
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.130
a little bit,

19
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.910
as we used our own context provider components.

20
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.040
If you recall that

21
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.830
from earlier in the course.

22
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.690
We also build our own context, provider components,

23
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270
using react context,

24
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.560
and we wrapped our app

25
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.490
or a part of our app

26
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.260
with that as well.

27
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.410
We're basically doing the same here,

28
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.610
and you don't have to use provider

29
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.920
on this highest component level.

30
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.300
You could also wrap nested components with provider,

31
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.890
but only wrapped components

32
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160
and their child components,

33
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.420
and the child components

34
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.500
of the child components,

35
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.410
and so on.

36
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.920
Only those components will have access

37
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.620
to Redux thereafter.

38
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.290
And if the vast majority

39
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.100
of your components need access

40
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.080
to the store,

41
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.080
if maybe your entire app,

42
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.670
needs access to the store,

43
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.590
you should typically provide,

44
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.603
on this highest level.

45
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.330
Now just by wrapping Provider around app,

46
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.140
we're not telling react Redux

47
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.650
and react therefore,

48
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.300
which store we wanna provide.

49
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.560
Sure. We only have one store,

50
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950
but that's stored in this index JS file,

51
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.130
react Redux of course doesn't know

52
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.010
that data file holds our store.

53
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.843
Instead we have

54
00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:06.363
to import our store from,

55
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.289
store index in this case.

56
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.270
So that store,

57
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.330
which we're exporting in there,

58
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.440
we're importing this

59
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.250
into index JS,

60
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.000
and on this provider,

61
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.380
which we import from react Redux.

62
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.250
We have a store prop,

63
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.810
which we have to set.

64
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.820
And this one's a value,

65
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.670
a value which is our Redux store.

66
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.800
So this store,

67
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.270
which we're importing here,

68
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.330
we're setting this as a value,

69
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850
for the store prop

70
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.180
on this provider component.

71
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.430
And that now provides our Redux store,

72
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.253
cue this react app.

73
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.210
Now on its own,

74
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.900
that doesn't do much.

75
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.770
Now to store is provided,

76
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.280
but that doesn't change anything

77
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.320
at the moment.

78
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.460
But now our components in this app,

79
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.600
the app component,

80
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.690
and any other child components,

81
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.900
can tap into that store.

82
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.340
They can get data out of the store.

83
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.090
They can set up a subscription

84
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.320
to that data to be precise,

85
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.995
and they also can dispatch actions.

86
00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:11.513
And that's what we're therefore going to do next.
