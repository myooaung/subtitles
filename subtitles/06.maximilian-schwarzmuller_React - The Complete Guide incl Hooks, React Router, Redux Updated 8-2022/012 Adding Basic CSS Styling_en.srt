1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,389
Now regarding the styling

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,880
of our components, we still use CSS,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,540
but there is nothing too React specific

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,070
when it comes to that CSS code.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,880
In the end, we can just add a new CSS file.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,730
And typically for the CSS code of a given component

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,050
you add that file next to the component JavaScript file

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,773
and that would be the ExpenseItem.CSS file here.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,250
Then you want to write your CSS code in there

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,480
but since this is no CSS course,

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,710
I don't want to bore you with writing a lot of CSS code

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,180
and hence you attached find a finished

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,750
ExpenseItem.CSS file, which you can simply download

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,090
and use or simply download it, open it,

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,420
and copy the code you find in there

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,283
into your ExpenseItem.CSS file.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,620
Now back in ExpenseItem.js,

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,780
we need to do one important thing.

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,770
We need to make this overall build process

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,860
aware of that CSS file and tell it

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,250
that the CSS code in there should be considered

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,760
and should be injected in the finished application

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,670
because it's not by default browsing all your files

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,000
and automatically including everything,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,520
you explicitly have to tell React, you could say,

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,410
or that build process that a certain file

27
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,920
should be considered.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,090
For ExpenseItem.js, we did this

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,360
with this import and app JS.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,070
For expenseItem.CSS, we need to do that

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,610
instead of ExpenseItem.js,

32
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,013
there we simply import ./ExpenseItem.CSS

33
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,623
just like that.

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,790
This simply tells the build process

35
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,113
that the CSS files should be considered.

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,620
Now instead that CSS file, I in the end,

37
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,430
just prepared a bunch of CSS classes

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,350
which can be added to elements to apply a certain look

39
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,700
and they are, for now, on this HTML code

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,320
in ExpenseItem in our component

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,923
we need to add these classes.

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,200
For example, on the wrapping div here.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,490
Now there's one special thing here.

44
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,490
We don't type class here as we would do in regular HTML,

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,413
but instead className.

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,170
And this can be strange, but you have to keep in mind

47
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,930
that this here is not really HTML.

48
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,900
It looks like HTML, but it's this special

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,290
JSX syntex invented by the React team.

50
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,083
And in the end under the hood, it's still JavaScript code,

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,530
that's why most attributes are the same, but not all.

52
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,450
And here the class attribute was renamed to className

53
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,400
because class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,860
Technically it would still work

55
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,127
if you would use class here, but should use className.

56
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:05,210
Now here on this overall div, which wraps everything,

57
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,040
we then add the expense-item class here

58
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,160
On this div, which holds our title and our amount,

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,660
we add another of className,

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,150
which is expense-item__.

61
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,310
So here we got two underscores.

62
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,593
Description.

63
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,650
And then here on that div with the amount

64
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,650
we simply add className and then expense-item__price.

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,846
And if you now save everything,

66
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:42,840
it should look like this, which is definitely nicer.

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,850
Still not the final look you want,

68
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,360
but definitely nicer.

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,640
By the way, I'm super zoomed in here

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,130
to make this easier to read,

71
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,500
otherwise it would look something like this

72
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
and that's definitely also not great,

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,770
but again, it's not the final look.

74
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,210
Again, let me zoom in closer

75
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,110
so that we can better see that though.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,730
Now that is how easy it is to add styling

77
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,570
to your React components though.

78
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,220
It's really not too fancy.

79
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,950
You have to be aware of the fact

80
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,188
that it's className instead of class,

81
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:15,830
but other than that, it's really just standard

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,529
CSS code, which then is added to your elements.

83
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,890
And in that CSS code, you can use

84
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,100
all the selectors you might know,

85
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,780
you're not limited to classes, but again,

86
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,370
I don't want to turn that into a CSS course,

87
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,563
so we'll keep that fairly simple.

88
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,930
This import might be the strangest thing in the end

89
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,880
because that is needed to make

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,220
this entire project aware of that CSS file.

91
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,393
And that's how we can style our components.
