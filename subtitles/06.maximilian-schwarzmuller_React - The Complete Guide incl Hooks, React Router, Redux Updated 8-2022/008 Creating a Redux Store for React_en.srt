00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,766
- Now to get started with Redux,

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:07,366
in this React application,
I will create a new folder

3
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:10,266
in the source folder
and I'll name it, store.

4
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,700
This is not something you have to do.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,033
It's just a common convention.

6
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,266
To store your Redux related code files,

7
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,800
in a store folder, in the source folder.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,166
And then they are all, just
create an index.js file.

9
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,133
This file name is also up to you,

10
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,233
into which I'll put my Redux-logic here.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,500
Now in there, I, in the
end, for the moment,

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,233
wanna repeat what we did before already.

13
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,800
Create a store, create a
reducer for the counter

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
and then not subscribe though.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,933
We'll not do that, but we
wanna create the store.

16
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,300
We wanna create the reducer.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,033
And that's of course, also
a great practice for you.

18
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,800
Without looking at the last lectures,

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,800
try to create that store on your own

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,600
and try to create that
reducer for the counter,

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
which has a increment
and decrement action,

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
which is supported.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So basically, what we did before,

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,400
without looking at those lectures,

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
try to do this on your own first.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,466
We'll do it together after a short pause,

27
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,833
which you can use to pause the video.

28
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,266
Were you successful?

29
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,100
Let's try it together.

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,500
We wanna create a new store.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,366
And for that, we need to
import something from Redux.

32
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,133
Now, since we're back in React,

33
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,466
our import statements
again, look like this now.

34
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,500
And here we can import Redux from Redux,

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,433
or we can also pull out specific things

36
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:48,833
from the Redux library,
with this import syntax.

37
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,100
And we can then, for example,

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,000
import the createStore function.

39
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,533
Now, once that's imported, we can call it,

40
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,133
to create a new store.

41
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,900
And store that store in
a, well store constant.

42
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,633
Now you did learn that
createStore wants a pointer

43
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:10,265
at a Reducer function as a parameter.

44
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,266
So I'll set up my counterReducer here.

45
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,433
And that then is a function, which gets

46
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:21,600
the existing state as a first argument.

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,800
And then the action it wants dispatched,

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,066
as a second argument.

49
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:29,766
Now, we can give this
state a default value,

50
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,666
so that when the reducer is executed

51
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,166
for the first time, we
have an initial state.

52
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,000
And here I'll stick to
the exact same state

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,233
we used before.

54
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:43,333
Counter set to zero, in an object.

55
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,600
And in the function body

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,333
of the counterReducer function,

57
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,366
we now wanna handle different actions,

58
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,500
increment and decrement and then

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,933
return different state snapshots.

60
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,300
So here we can check, if action.type

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,066
is equal to increment, in which case

62
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,733
I wanna return a new
object, where the counter

63
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,100
is set equal to state counter plus one.

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,000
Else, I check if action.type
is equal to decrement.

65
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,566
In which case I wanna return an object,

66
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:24,266
where the counter is set
to state.counter minus one.

67
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,666
Or, if we make it into neither of these

68
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,666
if statements, I'll return
the unchanged state.

69
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,766
So the state, which I get here,

70
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:38,200
I returned that without
any changes in that case.

71
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:44,033
So now, we can use this
counterReducer function

72
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:48,500
and point at that function
here, in our store.

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,766
When we call createStore,

74
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:54,633
this now creates our Redux store.

75
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,633
Now previously, we did now subscribe here

76
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,433
and dispatch from inside this file

77
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,433
and that's now not what we wanna do here.

78
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:07,166
Instead now, I wanna connect my React app

79
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,200
to this Redux store.

80
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,433
So that the components of that app

81
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:13,766
can dispatch and listen.

82
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,600
And that's now the new part.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,065
For this, I'll start by
exporting this store,

84
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:23,600
which we created here,
as the default export

85
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
of this file, so that
we can use it outside

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,400
of this index.js file.

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,566
And now I want to connect
my React application

88
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,133
to that store.

89
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:37,266
For this, we need to provide this store

90
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,900
to the React app.

91
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,900
And since, remember, we
only have one Redux store,

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,033
we only need to provide our store once,

93
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,833
the only store we have.

94
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,666
The question just is,
what does provide mean?
