00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.830
Now I did prepare some components here

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.970
in the layout folder

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.010
in the Components folder that give our pages,

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.130
a general layout and also a main navigation bar

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.033
which holds some links, some list items with links.

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.680
We just need to use that.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.690
Now this layout component is built such

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.460
that we can wrap it around other components

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.090
so that we can wrap it around our content

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.320
that should be framed by that layout

11
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.000
because layout, this component uses props children

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.690
to take what's between the opening and closing layout text

13
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.933
and wrap this component around that content.

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.730
That means that we can, for example,

15
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.500
go to the starting page,

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.820
so in NextJS and the Pages folder,

17
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.520
and we can wrap meetup list with layout.

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.370
Now for this, we also need to import layout, of course.

19
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.490
So we import layout from going up,

20
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.180
components, layout, layout.

21
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.220
We can add this import,

22
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.810
and once this import was added

23
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.573
we can wrap layout around meetup lists like this.

24
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.620
And if we do that and save this, we get an error

25
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.780
that link is not defined.

26
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.500
Now we get this error because

27
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.820
in that main navigation component,

28
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.300
I'm using the link component

29
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.830
but I'm not importing it deliberately

30
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.760
because I wanted to do this together with you again.

31
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.110
We learned about this link component

32
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.060
and we import it from next/link.

33
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.360
And that allows us to create those links.

34
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.630
However, the two prop then should be changed

35
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.510
to ref because the link component offered

36
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.090
by NextJS wants this ref prop

37
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.790
where we define the destination of that link.

38
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.990
But with that changed and with that link import added,

39
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.980
if we now save everything and reload,

40
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.420
we got this nice navigation bar at the top here

41
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.630
and we've got a white border around that

42
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.700
for that go into your global styles

43
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.110
and here in body, set margin to zero.

44
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.592
That's something I forgot for the starting project.

45
00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:11.110
But if we add margin zero to body in the global CSS file

46
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.740
then this white border is gone,

47
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.540
and now we got this frame here

48
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.310
and now we can also click all meetups to go

49
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.370
to this starting page and click add new meetup

50
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.330
to go to this page.

51
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.562
On this page, we are, of course

52
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:26.450
still missing the layout though.

53
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300
We only have it on the starting page.

54
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.270
Now we want to have it on this new meetup page as well,

55
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.300
and therefore, of course,

56
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.300
we can always wrap layout around our content

57
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.900
on the new meetup page to add the layout here as well.

58
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500
But you will probably see that, this becomes cumbersome,

59
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.450
the more pages our application has.

60
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.580
If we have an application with dozens

61
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780
or maybe hundreds of pages wrapping our general layout

62
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.370
around all the page contents,

63
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.560
so going into all the page components to then wrap layout

64
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.870
around the content that becomes cumbersome,

65
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.550
and that's now where this _app.js file becomes important.

66
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.080
This is a special file, which exists

67
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.020
in this Pages folder out of the box

68
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.830
at which you could create on your own as well

69
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.620
if it doesn't exist in which should contain content

70
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.800
like this.

71
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.760
This is kind of your route component.

72
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.049
This MyApp component, which is defined in there,

73
00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.200
and that is just a regular react component in the end.

74
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.600
This special component acts as the root component

75
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.353
NextJS will render.

76
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.790
It receives props and uses object de-structuring here

77
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.330
to pull information out of the props

78
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.590
and the information it pulls out there,

79
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.890
is a component prop and a page prop.

80
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.830
These props are passed into this

81
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.280
MyApp component automatically by NextJS,

82
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.280
since NextJS is the thing using that specific component.

83
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.120
and component is a prop that holds the actual page

84
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.030
contents that should be rendered.

85
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.070
So it will be different

86
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.370
whenever we switch a page and page props are specific props

87
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.540
our pages might be getting,

88
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.580
and at the moment our pages are not getting

89
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.060
any props at all,

90
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.820
because at the moment we have no source

91
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.950
that would provide such props

92
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.870
but that is something we're going to change.

93
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.850
But with that, we now know that component here

94
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.700
in this _app.js file will in the end

95
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.180
be the actual page content of our different pages.

96
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.140
And it will change whenever we navigate

97
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.973
from page A to page B.

98
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.940
Now, since that's the case,

99
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.179
we can utilize this _app.js file

100
00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.070
and simply wrap this component here

101
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.820
with our layout or with whichever wrapper you have.

102
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.630
And we then don't have to do it

103
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.870
inside of our different page files.

104
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.870
So we can remove the layout wrapper

105
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.390
from index.js here from our homepage,

106
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.600
we can remove that and go back

107
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.070
to just returning the meetup list

108
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.170
and remove the layout import here

109
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.753
and instead go to _app.js,

110
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.150
and then here, we import layout

111
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.530
from going up one level diving into components,

112
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.060
layout and then pointing at the layout file.

113
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.330
And we now wrap this component here

114
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.660
with the layout component.

115
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.370
And that means that our different page contents

116
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.273
will be wrapped with this layout component.

117
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.220
And hence, if we now save all files

118
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.970
with all those changes, now on the new meetup page,

119
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.110
we also got this layout applied.

120
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.690
We got the navigation bar,

121
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.050
we got the extra styling, which ensures

122
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.850
that the page content does not take the entire width.

123
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.820
And hence now on all the pages,

124
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.070
we got this layout and we don't need to wrap it

125
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.022
around the different page contents inside

126
00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:52.870
of the different page files.

127
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.870
And of course that therefore is the way,

128
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.113
more maintainable and convenient approach

129
00:05:57.113 --> 00:06:02.113
of applying general components to our application.

130
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.150
So whenever you have some component

131
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.600
or some setting that affects all your pages

132
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.530
you can utilize this _app.js file to easily add

133
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.163
that without diving into dozens of files individually.
