1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,240
Now with the project cleaned up, let's explore React

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,200
and let's write our own React code.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,470
Currently, we got two Java script files here,

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,890
index JS and app JS.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,990
The index JS file will be the starting point

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,660
of our React application.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,200
The code written in here

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,860
will be the first code

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,403
that will be executed in the browser

10
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:30,580
when we load our project in the browser.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,300
So what we see here in the browser is the result

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,500
of this code line here, executing in the end.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,820
Now we don't fully understand this code line yet

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,620
but what we do in this file

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,580
is we're importing a couple of things.

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,120
That is how in modern JavaScript

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,430
support that by that build setup we have here

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,970
supported by the NPM start script

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,210
and what it does behind the scenes

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,210
how we combine multiple files and how we import features

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,220
like objects or functions from file A into file B.

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,740
And here we are, for example

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,740
importing the React Dom object from the React Dom library.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,570
So that's not object we created.

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,420
That is an object created by the React team

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,280
exposed in that React Dom library,

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,060
which is part of our project

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,003
because it's part of our dependencies here.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,200
Now on that object

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,030
we call a render method

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,570
and queued at render method.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,470
we pass this strange HTML code.

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,410
Now this HTML in Java script syntax here

34
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,500
only works because of that build step,

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,630
as mentioned before

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,690
and it's actually called JSX.

37
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:48,378
This kind of code is called a J S X code.

38
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:54,460
This HTML in Java script code.

39
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,060
JSX is a special syntax

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,430
which is not understood by the browser

41
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,010
and which the offer is converted behind the scenes.

42
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,570
But which is more convenient for us as a developer to write

43
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,220
because working with React

44
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,240
will be about building custom HTML elements,

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,200
these components

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
and combining them together.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,380
And that is way easier.

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,620
If we can just write HTML code

49
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,120
kind of in our JavaScript files

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,930
to describe the desired output.

51
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,686
So here we kind of create

52
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:30,590
or we use our own HTML element, the app element

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,020
which is actually imported from that app file.

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,880
The file extension is missing here

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,480
because for JavaScript files, it can be omitted.

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,830
And the second argument to the render method

57
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,730
in the end just tells React where this element

58
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,993
should be rendered into real Dom.

59
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,730
Now, here we are selecting an element by ID

60
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,030
with an ID route

61
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,160
and we can find this

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,960
on the single page that is part of this project.

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,160
We find it in the public folder.

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,890
There we got a couple of images, but also one HTML file.

65
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,710
That is the single HTML file

66
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,160
that makes up this React application.

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,590
Because I mentioned before

68
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,830
you typically build

69
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,190
these single page applications with React

70
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,080
where only one HTML file is fetched from a server

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,600
and then React takes over and controls the Dom

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,120
and what's visible on the screen.

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Now in this index HTML file in the body section

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,740
we got a div with an ID route.

75
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,370
And that ID route should be look familiar.

76
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,290
That is the div,

77
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,590
which we in the end

78
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,590
select with this document,

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,940
get element by ID code snippet here.

80
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,970
And therefore, in the end

81
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,880
what we tell React with that line

82
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,780
is that we want to render our app HTML element

83
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,080
our custom HTML element,

84
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,010
which is defined

85
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,960
in this app JS file into this place

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,750
into the place of this element with this route ID.

87
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,160
So into the place of that div here in the end.

88
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,963
That's what we're telling React.

89
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,470
That's why if we visit our page and we inspect it.

90
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,240
So we don't view the page source

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,010
but we inspected with the Dev tools here.

92
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,540
When we have a look at the rendered Dom here

93
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,829
we see embodied that there is this div

94
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,320
with an ID of a root.

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,080
And in there we see our div with hello

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,250
which is the content we defined an app JS,

97
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,560
and that should make sense

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,062
because it is the app thing,

99
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,690
which we import from the app JS file,

100
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,380
which we rendered here.

101
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,870
Now let's take a closer look at this app thing.

102
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,320
Then that is a function,

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,030
a function which we export

104
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,120
to make it available outside of this file.

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,000
But in the end, just a standard function

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,610
a standard JavaScript function.

107
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,991
The only special thing

108
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:59,991
about that function is that it returns such JSX code.

109
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,900
So there's HTML in JavaScript code.

110
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,170
That's the only special thing.

111
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,530
Other than that it's a regular JavaScript function.

112
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,390
And that is super important.

113
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,120
What we have here is a so-called React component.

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,060
We can use it like an HTML element

115
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,520
as we're doing it here in, in index JS

116
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,510
but it's of course not an HTML element.

117
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,920
the browser would know,

118
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,610
but one defined by us

119
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,150
the developers of this project.

120
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,640
Now this component, as it's called in Reacts world

121
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,460
this custom HTML element,

122
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,530
is in the end just a function.

123
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,363
A function

124
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:39,770
which is to defined and exported

125
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,810
and specifically a function that returns JSX.

126
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,090
That's important.

127
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,050
A component.

128
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,760
so a function that should act

129
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,670
as a component and be usable as a component by React

130
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,510
must return something

131
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,200
that can be rendered in the browser.

132
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,240
That could be text.

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,230
It could be a couple of other things,

134
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,230
but it can and most typically will be HTML code as well.

135
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,660
So this JSX code.

136
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,050
And what's interesting

137
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,210
is that in the browser,

138
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,879
if we have a look at the Dom again

139
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,360
we don't see our app element anywhere here.

140
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,150
We don't see an HTML tag called app.

141
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,810
Instead, we just see the content of our component here

142
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,030
this div with hello as a text,

143
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,550
because these custom elements,

144
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,530
these are not known by the browser.

145
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,330
We just write this code in our React application.

146
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,000
And then when it runs in the browser,

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,950
React will not render these custom elements,

148
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,210
which wouldn't tell the browser anything,

149
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,450
but instead it will render the content

150
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,080
returned by these custom elements.

151
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,260
And that's how these React components work

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,093
in a nutshell.

153
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:53,740
That is already one very important

154
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,820
first piece of knowledge here

155
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,700
that we have these React components

156
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,970
which are functions returning JSX,

157
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,270
which we can use to well tell, React,

158
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,210
and therefore in the browser

159
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,550
what should appear here on the screen.

160
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,680
But of course, we typically don't do that

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,570
with just one simple component

162
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,420
that just returns a div of hello.

163
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,970
Instead I mentioned before

164
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,430
that I want to rebuild this basic first example

165
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,160
with this delete button.

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,850
And then there after

167
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,420
dive into a little bit of a more complex project

168
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,940
in a second step

169
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,827
and therefore let's now work towards that first example

170
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:31,954
with that delete button

171
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:34,743
and that modal overlay.
