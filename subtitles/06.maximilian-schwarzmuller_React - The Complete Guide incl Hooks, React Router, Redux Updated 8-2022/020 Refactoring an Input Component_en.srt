1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,310
Now there is one last hook,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,060
not in general there are more hooks,

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,550
but there is one last hook which I wanna dive in right now

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,660
because it fits really well into this section here

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,820
into this module.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,610
For that we'll first of all have to change

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,170
our code a little bit though.

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,280
We'll create a new component,

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,860
a input component that contains our input divs,

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,240
and that receives all the data it needs through props.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,170
So that just like the button it's reusable

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,900
because we will indeed reuse it

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,850
for the email and the password input.

14
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,350
Now, feel free to try to create such an input component

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,100
on your own and use it here in this log in forum.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,150
That's a little mini assignment,

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,180
a little mini tasks you can dive in.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,810
Here's a short pause for you to pause the video

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,260
and thereafter we'll do that together

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,373
and thereafter, we'll see which hook I'm talking about.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,380
So, very successful, let's do it together.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,060
For data in the UI folder,

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,620
I'll edit input folder with their input JS file.

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,850
And in there from React, I import React

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,610
because we're going to create a component in there

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,770
the input component which gets props

27
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,563
and which we export here just like this.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,530
Now the JSX that should be returned here as I mentioned

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,550
should be that div here,

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,250
so I'll grab that div from the email,

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,360
cut it from the login component

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,243
and add it here as a return value.

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,460
And therefore I'll also add an input.module.CSSfile,

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,350
to bring over all the styles I want.

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,333
So I'll import classes from ./input.module.CSS,

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,190
and of course all the migrate the respect of styles.

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,040
Here in the login module,

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,563
I'm basically talking about all those control styles here.

39
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,550
They are all related except for the actions,

40
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,940
so actually I'll cut everything in front of actions

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,470
because actions is part of the login component.

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,480
Bring the control part into the input module,

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,470
CSS file build and that of course,

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,493
then all includes this media Curry.

45
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,950
Bring that over as well,

46
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,420
and with that we got the styles migrated.

47
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,660
Now back in the input component,

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,830
we now got some data we need to get from outside.

49
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,100
To make this reusable,

50
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,780
I of course don't want to focus

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,860
on just the emails state here,

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,470
instead I'm just interested in

53
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,770
whether these input is valid or not,

54
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,270
so I expect to get just is valid prop

55
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,700
on my prompts object here to then add

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,750
these invalid clause or not.

57
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,410
This text here should be settable from outside.

58
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,263
Let's say on a label prop,

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,803
this ID here should be settable from outside.

60
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,973
So I will expect us on our ID prop,

61
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,810
this type here should be settable from outside.

62
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,290
The value should be settable from outside,

63
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,040
and here to change and the blur handlers as well.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,777
So here I'll have onChange, and here I'll have onBlur.

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,940
And this should be a quiet reusable input component.

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,910
And we can now use this here in the login component

67
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,853
where we previously had that div.

68
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,160
So there I'll add the input component,

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,410
of course, for that make sure you do import it.

70
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,610
You do import your input component here

71
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,310
from the newly traded input file,

72
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,960
and now we need to configure that component.

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,760
So for example, we need to pass our ID,

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,580
email, our label, which was email like this,

75
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,057
our type which is email and also is valid prop

76
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,700
which is the email is valid constant,

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,800
which we essentially have up here

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,250
pulling it out from the email state.

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,950
That's something we wanna forward.

80
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,100
And of course we also need the value prop

81
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,070
that needs to be set on our email state value

82
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,493
and also onChange and onBlur.

83
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,960
So onChange here is our email change handler,

84
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,960
and onBlur is our validate email handler.

85
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,410
And with that, we have our email input.

86
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,980
Now we also of course, need to migrate the password,

87
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,110
so here we're going to replace this div

88
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,253
with this input but now for password,

89
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,040
the label text should be password.

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,230
The password at a type should be password.

91
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,800
Here we have password is valid,

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,400
we have the password state value.

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,760
We got the password change handler

94
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,313
and we got the validate password handler here.

95
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,690
So with that, we should have to the same behavior as before,

96
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
and we do that works

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,850
but now we have these separate components here.

98
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,060
Now that's a nice practice and that's always good.

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,590
And it's also a good example

100
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,130
for when we wanna use props verses Context.

101
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,980
We absolutely want props here

102
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,710
because those input components,

103
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,560
as you can see should be reusable

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,690
and they offer you as props so that we can configure them

105
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,730
from inside the parent where we are using them.

106
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,210
If we would use Context inside of the input,

107
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,070
every input would do the same thing,

108
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,940
it would be bound to the same Context,

109
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,033
it might be less reusable then.

110
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,600
But that wasn't the main focus,

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,600
this instead just now allows me to move on to the next hook,

112
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,880
which I want to show you.
