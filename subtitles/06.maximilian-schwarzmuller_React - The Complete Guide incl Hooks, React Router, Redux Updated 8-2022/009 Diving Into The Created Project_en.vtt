00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.560
Now this project, which was created for us

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.540
has a couple of starting files which we don't need here

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.861
for example, a file for automated tests

4
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:11.610
that is something which I covered

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.870
in my complete guide course but we don't need it here.

6
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.274
So, I'll get rid of that file and also of the logo.svg,

7
00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:22.300
reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js and App.css.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.200
If you got more files you can get rid of those as well

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.440
you should be left with an index.js, App.js

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.853
and the index.css file thereafter.

11
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.620
Now in index.js I will get rid of that

12
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.620
import of reportWebVitals and I'll explain these imports

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.370
in greater detail in a second

14
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.140
for the moment let's just focus on cleaning up

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.150
and I'll get rid of that code down there

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.930
and I'll get rid of React.StrictMode because for the moment

17
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.660
for getting started it is simpler

18
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.453
if we just get started like this.

19
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.760
In index.css I'll get rid of all that code as well

20
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.820
we're going to add different CSS code soon.

21
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.680
And then App.js they're all getting rid of

22
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.750
these two imports at the top

23
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.870
and then of all the content here in this return statement

24
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.920
all this HTML code.

25
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.420
For the moment, we can just add a simple div here

26
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.883
where we say hello.

27
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.050
Now we can save that and that's now the starting set up

28
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.210
with which I wanna get started.

29
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.140
You'll also find this starting project snapshot attached

30
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.480
to this video so that you can also download it from there

31
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.470
and get started with that.

32
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.460
If you do download my attached snapshot though,

33
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.550
there's one important step you must not miss

34
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.180
and you have to go through.

35
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.400
You have to install third party dependencies of this project

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.400
because since it is a bit of a more complex project setup

37
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.119
working with third party packages like the React project

38
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.000
works a little bit differently here.

39
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.070
We got this package.json file

40
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.637
which lists all the dependencies of this project.

41
00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:04.538
And there we for example, see the React library

42
00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:08.013
and another package which is part of the react library

43
00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:11.970
which are listed as dependencies.

44
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.820
Now, these dependencies are managed

45
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.900
and installed automatically for us and the big code bundle

46
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.570
with our code and that third-party library code

47
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.870
will be generated automatically behind the scenes

48
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.410
by those build steps which exist in this project as well

49
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.860
those are brought in by that react-scripts package.

50
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.020
Now I am aware that this silence fairly overwhelming

51
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.540
and complex right now,

52
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.200
especially if you've never worked

53
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.360
with anything like React before

54
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.040
and you're used to standard setups

55
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.770
where you have an HTML file

56
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.950
and a bunch of JavaScript imports

57
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.940
but we can ignore all of that for the moment.

58
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.852
We just add dependencies here

59
00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:57.380
and we can then import them into our JavaScript files

60
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.210
that's what you see here with those

61
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.320
strange import statements

62
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.260
and then this build step

63
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.510
which is part of this project set up which is started

64
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.620
when we run one of these scripts like npm start

65
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.018
which we did before.

66
00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:14.560
These scripts will then in the end combine

67
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.290
and transform all the code and combine

68
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.660
the third party package code with our code

69
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.310
and make sure that the result is an output

70
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.620
which the browser understands.

71
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.940
Now, because we have that setup,

72
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.597
if you download my attachment

73
00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:31.020
you need to run one extra command

74
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.690
before everything here will work for you.

75
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.710
And for this it's best if you open the terminal

76
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.150
or command prompt which is integrated

77
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.160
into Visual Studio Code with new terminal

78
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.350
which is your standard operating system terminal

79
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.860
or command prompt just already integrated into this IDE

80
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.810
and any commands we run here

81
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.620
are then automatically executed in this project folder.

82
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.617
And here you need to run the npm install command

83
00:04:00.617 --> 00:04:03.610
which will simply download all those dependencies

84
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.870
this project has and store them in this node_modules folder

85
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.200
which we have here.

86
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.380
That's a folder in which we will never work

87
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.279
because that holds all these third party dependencies

88
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.430
and they are dependencies which our project needs.

89
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.320
So, that's a folder which is here

90
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.820
but which was not part of the attached code

91
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.622
because it's a fairly large folder

92
00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:30.010
and hence the attachment would be unnecessarily big

93
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.980
and you can simply recreate it by running npm install

94
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.260
in that folder that has this package.json file

95
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.300
so that's why we need to do that then.

96
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.620
And there after you can run npm start again

97
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.741
to bring up that's development server.

98
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:48.120
And I will do that here again and for this I'll go to the

99
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.193
Albert terminal where I run it npm start before

100
00:04:51.193 --> 00:04:55.200
and I'll quit this process with controlled C now.

101
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.210
Now, as long as you don't quit that process

102
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.650
the development server is up and running

103
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.550
and listening to code changes

104
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.960
to then displayed them in the browser.

105
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.700
You can quit this server whenever you're done

106
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.120
with development for today and then you simply restart it

107
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.830
with npm start again if you wanna pick up development again

108
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.277
but now I'm not restarting it in this standalone terminal

109
00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:20.818
but instead in this integrated terminal

110
00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:24.190
which has already navigated into my project folder

111
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.290
and the advantage of starting it here

112
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.930
is that I will always immediately see any errors

113
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.430
that might occur if I have an error in my code for example.

114
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.231
And that's well started here zoom out a bit

115
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.500
make this a bit smaller and keep that up and running

116
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.260
as long as I'm developing.

117
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.940
So don't close the terminal, don't run control C here,

118
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.920
keep it up and running.

119
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.430
And if you do that and you go back to localhost 3000

120
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.630
and reload, you should just see hello there

121
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.760
because of our cleanup process.

122
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.230
Now that was a lot of work just to get started

123
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.520
but I am a big fan of having a clean start

124
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.760
and explaining what's going on here

125
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.310
instead of just throwing code at you

126
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.460
and leaving it up to you to figure out what's happening.

127
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.540
That's the project set up we're dealing with

128
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.650
that's my ID and that's the cleaned up project

129
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.170
which you all to find attached.

130
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.340
and therefore now, let's start writing our own code

131
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.950
and let's understand these different React features

132
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.083
and this strange syntax here step-by-step.
