1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,590
So this was a lot of content about animations in react.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,530
As I mentioned, there are more libraries you can look into and actually you could fill an entire course

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,770
with content just about react animations.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,460
The key takeaways are that

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,900
you should always think about css animations and transitions.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:29,510
A lot of things can be achieved with just these and even if you fall back to libraries like react transition

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,640
group, as you saw behind the scenes you still work a lot with css transitions,

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:43,210
you just have a javascript layer to orchestrate the addition of these different css styles.

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,850
That's the key takeaway I want you to have in this module

10
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,270
and then it's up to you which javascript library you use, react transition group,

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,270
the one I presented here is nice because it gives you a nice little javascript layer you can add to

12
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,910
your application to

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:08,720
as I mentioned, orchestrate your css animations. You can look at packages like react motion if you want

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:17,810
a more css independent solution which still behind the scenes uses css but which emulates real

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,810
world physics

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:25,250
in the case of react motion and which therefore might give you the look you're looking for. These are the

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,180
things I want you to take away from this module,

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:34,790
it's of course as always about practicing these things, maybe adding them to the burger builder or your personal

19
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:42,740
next react project. As mentioned at the beginning of this module, animations can be very important at guiding

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,860
user attention and providing a nice user experience and I hope that with the tools presented in this

21
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,670
module,

22
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,220
you have a good well toolset for building and orchestrating these animations.
