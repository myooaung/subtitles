1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,430
Now as part of this first course section

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,970
I also wanna give you an overview

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,590
of what you can expect from this course

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,100
and which topics will be covered.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,980
Now, of course,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,760
you maybe already had a look at the course curriculum

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,420
and you absolutely should take a brief look at least

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,090
because this is a huge course

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,370
and I can't pack all the contents that's in the course

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,150
into this one lecture here,

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,390
I don't wanna turn this into a 20 minute lecture

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,820
and in addition,

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,770
I kept this course updated in the past

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,960
and i kept adding new content from time to time,

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,780
and i do plan to do that in the future.

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,870
So the, curriculum you see on the course page

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,520
is always up to date.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,250
The content here in this video is just a summary

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,400
of the most important features.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,010
There's way more in the course,

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,190
so definitely check out that full curriculum in addition.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,180
Now, with that out of the way,

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,340
this course is organized into three main categories

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,480
or course sections you could say.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,550
And the first category of sections,

26
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,070
is about the basics,

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,510
the foundation of React.

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,070
These will be sections

29
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,233
that cover core features

30
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:19,010
which React offers to you,

31
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,520
which you have to know no matter

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,870
which React App you're building.

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,340
Now, the second category of course sections,

34
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,520
then is about more advanced concepts.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,390
So this course does not stop after the basics.

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,260
Instead, we are going to dive

37
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,290
into a lot of advanced concepts as well.

38
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,060
These are the concepts which you need for real apps

39
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,390
which you really wanna push to production I would say.

40
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,900
These are concepts which you don't need in every app

41
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,500
but realistically you will need them in a lot of apps

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,470
and that's why we're also going to dive

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,340
into such advanced concepts in depth

44
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,860
in this course.

45
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,780
Now the last kind of course, sections and content

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,550
which you'll find in this course

47
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,479
will be sections that contain the summaries

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,900
or refreshers on certain concepts

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,640
ensuring that we're all on the same page

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,270
and that you got a single place to go to,

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,211
well, summarize the core concepts you learned about.

52
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:25,220
But let's now take a closer look at

53
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,910
which kind of content you can expect in detail

54
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,880
for these different categories of content.

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,640
We will, of course start with the key basics

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
that you have to know.

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,680
And when you'll learn, React,

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,750
those core basics will be about components,

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,960
you will learn that react is all about components

60
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,070
and how you can build your own components

61
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,910
and how you can combine them

62
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,050
and how you can build user interfaces

63
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,930
with this component approach React takes.

64
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,720
You will also learn how to work with events

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,760
and data, so how you can listen to button clicks

66
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,070
and then change something on the screen,

67
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,030
and you will learn about props and state,

68
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,380
which probably doesn't tell you anything right now

69
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,250
but which are key React concepts

70
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,235
which I am going to introduce in great detail

71
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,940
in this course.

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,860
Now, since this course is about

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,220
building user interfaces in the end

74
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,670
of course you're also going to learn,

75
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,540
how you can style your react apps and components,

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,750
how you can make sure that your user interfaces,

77
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,260
which you build with React look the way

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,810
you want them to look.

79
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,400
And I'm also going to introduce you to

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,620
another key feature called React Hooks.

81
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,560
You will learn what exactly that is,

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,240
and you will learn that it is one of

83
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,780
the most important concepts of modern React

84
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,120
and therefore, of course it's also covered

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,440
in great detail In this course.

86
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,880
Now, these four boxes on this slide here

87
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,880
are not four course sections.

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
These concepts, which are listed here

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,090
in this basics category

90
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,370
are indeed taught through a lot more course sections.

91
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,290
This is just a summary of the content you can expect.

92
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,740
And if you simply continue with the next lectures

93
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,250
and sections, you are going to learn

94
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,080
these key concepts step by step.

95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,810
Because of course I ordered all the course content

96
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,640
and all the course lectures,

97
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,840
such that you are learning

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,970
about all those important React features step-by-step

99
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,683
so that everything builds up on each other.

100
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,070
Now, as I mentioned, we don't stop after those basics.

101
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,030
Instead we'll directly move from basics to more

102
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,370
advanced concepts.

103
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,780
And therefore, this course also

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,700
contains sections about working with side effects

105
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,670
and Refs and what Refs are

106
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,850
and more React hooks.

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,340
And if this all sounds very cryptic right now

108
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,620
that's no problem

109
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,150
This is just an overview,

110
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,610
Some terms you might've heard about before,

111
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,790
which are also covered by this course,

112
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,720
you will learn what these concepts are about

113
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,280
and how they work throughout this course of course.

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Now we are also going to explore app wide state management

115
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,850
with Reacts context API and Redux.

116
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,810
React Redux is a third party library,

117
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,350
one of the most important React, third party libraries

118
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,580
and we're going to cover it in detail in multiple sections

119
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,160
in this course.

120
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,840
And you are also going to learn how you can handle

121
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,760
user input with forms,

122
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,580
how you can send HTTP requests

123
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,030
behind the scenes to store data

124
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,610
in a database or fetch data from there,

125
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,910
And you're going to learn how to build your own custom Hooks

126
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,763
and what that actually is.

127
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,900
You're also going to learn how to implement routing

128
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,340
and what routing is in detail,

129
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,670
how you can build a page that gives the user the illusion

130
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,960
of having multiple pages, even though

131
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,420
it's a single page app as you learned.

132
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,720
you're going to learn how to deploy your React App,

133
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,490
and we're for example, also going to dive

134
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,640
into another framework called Next.js

135
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,116
which builds up on React.js,

136
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,940
which will make building production-ready

137
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,060
React Apps even easier.

138
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,690
And that will be another a huge module on Next.js

139
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,190
which is also included in this course

140
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,380
a little bit later in this course

141
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,890
since that will already be quite advanced then.

142
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,640
And there is more,

143
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,930
as i said, this is not exhaustive,

144
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,660
have a look at their full course curriculum

145
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,290
to see all the content

146
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,200
this is just the general structure of this course

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,053
and what you can expect from it.

148
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,940
Now, as I mentioned, there also are some summary

149
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,420
and refresher course sections,

150
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,900
and specifically there is

151
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,190
a JavaScript refresher course section,

152
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,060
that's the next course section after this one actually

153
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,290
which is 100% optional

154
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,830
but which you can take to ensure that we're all

155
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,710
on the same page regarding JavaScript,

156
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,090
because in that refresher section I'm going to

157
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,100
refresh some core modern JavaScript features

158
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,770
which we're going to use in this course as well.

159
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,790
And there will also be a React.js summary module

160
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,550
at the end of this course

161
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,780
about which I'll talk in greater detail

162
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,740
in the next course lecture,

163
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,710
because it turns out that for this course,

164
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,410
you actually have more than one possible way

165
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,540
of taking this course.

166
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,310
But again, I'll dive a bit deeper

167
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,860
into that in the next lecture.

168
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,460
Now, all that content in this course

169
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,920
will be explained in great detail

170
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,944
in theory, and web small demos and examples

171
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:58,180
but then we are also going to have a couple of bigger

172
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,960
more realistic course projects and examples

173
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,720
where you can practice what you learned

174
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,540
and where you see the different concepts come together

175
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,050
and where you see how a React app is built

176
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,630
by using all those React features.

177
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,630
Last but not least,

178
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,520
there also are plenty of challenges and exercises for you,

179
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,090
so that by the end of the course

180
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,693
you can really call yourself a React developer.
