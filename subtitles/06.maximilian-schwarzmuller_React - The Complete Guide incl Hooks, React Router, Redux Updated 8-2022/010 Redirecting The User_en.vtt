00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.060
Now that we saw how we can send a request

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.460
with help of the token to a protected resource,

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.900
let's come back to the front end

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.750
and let's work on the feedback we provide to the user here.

5
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.040
For example, I wanna redirect after we changed the password.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.170
I also want to redirect after we logged in.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.570
And I then also wanna make the log out button

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.500
work and so on.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.150
But we'll get there step-by-step.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.260
Let's work on the log in redirection.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.310
In the AuthForm component, I basically wanna redirect here

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.130
in this case, that we do have a token

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.620
and we do log the user in, in our context API.

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.690
Now redirecting is rather straight forward in the end.

15
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.810
I'm using react router here

16
00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.743
and we can redirect then in this case by importing

17
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.510
something from react router dom.

18
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.210
And that something which we import here

19
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.373
is the used history hook.

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.190
With this hook, we can create a history object

21
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.013
by calling use history.

22
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.453
And we can then use this history object,

23
00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.020
here, to call replace,

24
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.490
which redirects the user to a different page

25
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.170
and replace simply means that the user

26
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.200
can't use the back button thereafter to go back

27
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.110
to the previous page.

28
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.100
And here we could redirect the user to the starting page

29
00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:33.883
with just slash for example.

30
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.100
If I do that, you should see that if I now do log in again

31
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.110
with that user, with that new password,

32
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.980
I'm redirected once that succeeded.

33
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.520
So that's rather straightforward.

34
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.490
Now, I also want to redirect after we changed the password.

35
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.720
And of course that works in exactly the same way.

36
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.930
We can go to the profile form

37
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.160
and also import use history here

38
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.950
from react router dom.

39
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.449
And then also create this history object here

40
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.083
by calling use history.

41
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.860
And then once we know that we succeeded here,

42
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.350
we can call history, replace,

43
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.100
and then go somewhere else

44
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.683
for example, again, to the starting page.

45
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.730
Of course here you also don't have

46
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.010
to redirect the user.

47
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.130
It would be fine to stay on this page

48
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.890
and present some success message with you as state

49
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.340
you could manage some states which you then

50
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.820
use to outputs a message if you want to

51
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.030
but here I'll go for the redirect, but that's of course

52
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.563
totally up to you, whether you want to do that.

53
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.630
And if I quickly test this year

54
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.280
by going back to that original password which I used before,

55
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.033
that seems to work.

56
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.820
So that's all working.

57
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.033
Now let's work on the log out functionality.
