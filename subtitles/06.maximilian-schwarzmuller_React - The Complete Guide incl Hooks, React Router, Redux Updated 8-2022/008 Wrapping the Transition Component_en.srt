1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,520
Now we learn quite a bit about this transition component over the last lectures,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:15,640
now one important thing to of course know is that you can also nest this inside any component you want.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,450
So of course we could move transition from the app.js file into our modal.js file and simply wrap our

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,780
entire modal with this transition component in there.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,940
That of course also requires us to import transition from that package though,

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:43,600
so import transition from react.css or excuse me, from react transition group transition, like that.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,820
And now we just need to update our code and basically say again that modal is always present in our

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,580
app.js file, this component,

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,520
show is therefore again back to this.state.ModalIsOpen and now a show inside the modal has to

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,510
be used differently, now a show is a property

11
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,010
controlling is in property here

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,400
so now this should be bound to props.show which is true or false

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:25,890
now again and therefore, when we control our css classes here we should do that inside a function

14
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,540
between the transition component opening and closing tags where we get the state managed by the transition

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,400
component where we then eventually return our div which holds the modal and where we then of course

16
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:48,510
no longer attach modal open and closed like this here on css classes, instead that's just an array

17
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,270
with modal. Down there instead

18
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,730
in this code we return inside the transition component, there

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:04,230
I instead now need to change my css classes and conditionally animate this. So therefore, let me

20
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:10,710
restructure this to a function with a function body where I don't just return something because before

21
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:22,450
I actually return the jsx which should be entered inside this function here, I of course want to

22
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,800
adjust my css classes, so I will essentially grab my constant from up there and now configure

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,640
it here to be either just the modal or

24
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:47,820
now again checking for state being equal to entering, that's the case then I want to use modal opened,

25
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,030
this one here

26
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:58,570
otherwise if state is equal to exiting and I'm using this entering and exiting classes to move in right

27
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,270
at the point of time we start the animation,

28
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,630
so if it's exiting then I want to have modal closed and in other cases I'll have null, so the same logic

29
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,630
as before but now inside the modal.

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,830
If we try this out, we should still get the same behavior as before though.
