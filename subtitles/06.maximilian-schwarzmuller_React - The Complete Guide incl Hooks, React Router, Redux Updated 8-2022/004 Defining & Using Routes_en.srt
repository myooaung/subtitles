1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,750
Now with React Router installed,

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,939
let's get started using it.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,050
For this, I'll first of all run npm start

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,770
to start my React development server

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,760
in this dummy project

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,450
and with that up and running,

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,930
you should see something like this on the page.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,020
This dummy text.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,010
And now we wanna get started using this React Router.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,970
But what does that mean get started using React Router?

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,450
Well, in the end, the goal is that we're able

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,380
to handle different paths on our page

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,470
and load different components for the different paths

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,050
so that a request for our-domain.com/ nothing,

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,620
for example, loads Component A.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,620
And our-domain.com/products loads Component B,

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,500
which could be a component displaying a list

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
of products, for example.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,830
That's now the goal.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,860
We wanna handle these paths after the domain,

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,340
so this text after the domain

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,690
to then load different components onto the screen.

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,970
And when I say load,

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,220
I really mean render these components.

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,289
So it's basically like conditionally rendering a component.

26
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:21,300
You might recall that often in this course we used state

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,490
to, in the end, conditionally show a certain component.

28
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,700
For example, show some loading text

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,490
whilst we're in a loading state

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,520
and show a different component otherwise.

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,510
Now we, in the end, wanna do the same thing

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,570
but for different paths in the URL.

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,270
And we could write our own code for that

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,330
where we check what's in the URL

35
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,650
and then set our own state

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,690
and where we listen to clicks on links

37
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,900
and prevent the browser default

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,480
of sending a request

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,740
and instead again change some state

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,470
to render something else onto the screen.

41
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,000
We could do all of that

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,350
but we did install that react-router-dom package

43
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,330
so that this is done for us.

44
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,714
And indeed, react-router-dom makes

45
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:12,240
registering different routes,

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,513
so different paths in the URL

47
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,650
and the components that should be loaded

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,900
for these paths very, very easy.

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,310
And we can get started in this App component here.

50
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,310
Here we can import from react-router-dom

51
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,410
and what I wanna import here

52
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,550
is the Route component.

53
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,230
So we import Route from react-router-dom

54
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,053
and Route will actually be a component.

55
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,130
It is a component that allows us to define a certain path

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,230
and then the React component that should be loaded

57
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,663
when that path becomes active in the URL.

58
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,240
So for this, we can get started

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,050
by adding a couple of components.

60
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,610
For example, in the components folder.

61
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,500
Here we could have our Welcome component,

62
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,370
the starting page so to say.

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,240
Welcome.js holds a component function,

64
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,870
just as we learned it

65
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,670
and we, of course, export this component function

66
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,640
so that we can use it outside of this file

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,640
and then here all I'll do is I will render a h1 tag

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,840
where I say The Welcome Page.

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,700
So this is a simple component,

70
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,190
which just outputs this JSX code.

71
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,110
And now I'll copy that page

72
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,560
and create another component,

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,130
let's say the Products component

74
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,900
and in that component file,

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,260
I'll rename the function to Products

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,270
and I'll say The Products Page here.

77
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,390
So now we've got two different components,

78
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,380
which are, of course, very similar

79
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,460
but render different text.

80
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,360
And in reality, of course,

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,600
these components would do more than just output some text.

82
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,650
The Products component, for example,

83
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,470
could fetch and display a list of products

84
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,450
but I just wanna get started with routing for now.

85
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,390
We will later see a more realistic project as well.

86
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,620
But now we've got these two components.

87
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,079
And I wanna load those components as pages

88
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,550
with help of this Route component.

89
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,079
For this and this App component,

90
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,990
we register a route

91
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,850
by using that Route component

92
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,480
like we always use components in JSX.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,900
So we just create a custom Route element based

94
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,330
on this component.

95
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,830
And now, this component wants a special prop.

96
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,020
It wants a path prop

97
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,427
and that should be the path in your URL.

98
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,263
And for example, here we could have /welcome.

99
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,410
With that, we're saying this route

100
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,410
should become active if we have our-domain /welcome.

101
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,643
Then this route should become active.

102
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,980
Now, we also need to tell React Router

103
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,830
what active means,

104
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,560
which component should then be loaded onto the screen?

105
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,440
And for this, we actually add opening

106
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,670
and closing Route tags here

107
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,040
and then between these opening and closing Route tags,

108
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,140
we can render the component

109
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,140
that should eventually be rendered here.

110
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,530
For example here, we can import the Welcome component

111
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,430
from ./components/Welcome

112
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,620
and then just render this here

113
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,520
between those Route tags.

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,970
Now, the interesting thing

115
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,700
is that this Route component will make sure

116
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,870
that this Welcome component is only displayed

117
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,847
on the screen if our URL path is /welcome.

118
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,250
Otherwise, this will not be displayed.

119
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,770
And of course, we can do the same

120
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,120
for the second page we added.

121
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,120
We can import Products from ./components/Products

122
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,623
and then add a second route.

123
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:07,430
We just instantiate our Route component here

124
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,540
and then, for example, set the path to /products.

125
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,420
Totally up to you, of course.

126
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,550
Whatever path you wanna support in your URL.

127
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,550
So now we would also support our-domain.com/products

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,450
and that should then load the Products component,

129
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,360
whereas the first route will load the Welcome component.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,665
And to load the Products component here,

131
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:37,780
we need to use Products between those opening

132
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,093
and closing tags.

133
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,260
Now, that's how we generally do register routes

134
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,280
with React Router.

135
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,400
And React Router will then make sure

136
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,020
that it evaluates the URL

137
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,020
and also renders the correct components based on that URL.

138
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,130
However, to kind of activate React Router,

139
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,450
and to make those Route components

140
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,800
and other React Router features work,

141
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,720
we need to do something else in addition

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,890
to defining those routes.

143
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,890
We need to go to our root file here

144
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,900
where we render App into some document element

145
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,960
and here in this root file,

146
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,960
we also wanna import something from react-router-dom

147
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,920
and that something here is the BrowserRouter component,

148
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:38,960
another component provided by react-router-dom.

149
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,010
And we simply need to wrap the overall App,

150
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,590
so this Route App component

151
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,773
with this BrowserRouter component.

152
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,430
That's all we have to do here

153
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,050
but this will then activate this React Router

154
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,470
and unlock these React Router features

155
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,240
like defining routes.

156
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,090
And if we do all of that,

157
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,870
if we go to our page

158
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,320
and we enter /welcome here,

159
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,520
we see The Welcome Page.

160
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,270
And if we enter /products here,

161
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,170
we see The Products Page.

162
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,160
And if I enter anything else like slash nothing,

163
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,030
I don't see anything.

164
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,930
The same for /else.

165
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,340
So any other path, then the two paths we defined here

166
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,230
will not render anything

167
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,310
because neither of the two routes

168
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,080
becomes active in that case

169
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,070
and hence, we simply don't see anything on the screen.

170
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,710
And that's in a nutshell how routing works.

171
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,470
Now, there are more features related to it

172
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,370
and there are more concepts we're going to explore

173
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,180
but that is the core idea behind routing

174
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,990
and how we make it work with React Router.

175
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,580
Now, before we dive deeper,

176
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,300
one last word about these two components,

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,377
Welcome and Products, which we load

178
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:00,910
for these different routes.

179
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,010
These are regular React components.

180
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,300
But since we use them as different pages

181
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,580
in this application,

182
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,510
since we don't use them like all the other components

183
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,240
we worked with before,

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,340
it is quite common that you store them

185
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,750
in a folder named pages.

186
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,010
Or screens, whatever you prefer.

187
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,030
I'll go with pages.

188
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,530
You don't need to name the folder pages.

189
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,110
You can stick to components.

190
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,440
But having a separate pages folder

191
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,230
with the components that are loaded by the router

192
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,550
makes it clearer which kind of components these are.

193
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,770
And that you do use these components

194
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,240
in conjunction with the router.

195
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,650
Now, you can still have other components

196
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,820
in your application,

197
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,330
which are then not loaded by the router

198
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,110
but which you instead use in other components' JSX code

199
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,630
as we did it all the time in the course.

200
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,730
And indeed, in reality, most of your components

201
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,020
will be regular components.

202
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,000
But these special components

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,980
and special should be in quotes

204
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,610
because these are regular React components

205
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,000
but these regular React components,

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,436
which are used in this special way,

207
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:15,910
so that we use them as routes,

208
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,700
these components can be stored

209
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,580
in a separate folder to make it even clearer

210
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,090
that here we do have components,

211
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,385
which we load through the router.

212
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,610
And with that, we've got basic routing set up.

213
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,133
Now let's dig deeper.
