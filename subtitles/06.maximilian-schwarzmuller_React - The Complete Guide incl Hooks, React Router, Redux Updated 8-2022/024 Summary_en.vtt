00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.560
Now that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.380
We learned a lot about React and TypeScript here.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.730
It was quite a in-depth module,

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.420
with lots of examples and concepts,

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.100
but of course we're only scratching

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.650
the surface of TypeScript in general here,

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010
and of course, we kind of

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.830
went through that entire content rather quickly.

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.580
Because this is just a summary of TypeScript and React.

10
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.510
If you wanna learn more about that,

11
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.960
for React, you got this entire course,

12
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.740
and for TypeScript, I got a couple

13
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.370
of resources that could be useful.

14
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.960
If you search for typescriptlang,

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.340
or actually also just for typescript,

16
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.610
you find the official docs.

17
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.930
And those are of course

18
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.560
a great place to learn more about TypeScript.

19
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.640
There, you can dive into the docs, or the handbook,

20
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.740
and you'll learn about all those core TypeScript features,

21
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.910
and you also find examples there,

22
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.870
and that site, therefore, is really a good resource

23
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.450
for learning all about TypeScript

24
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.750
in the greatest detail possible.

25
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.420
But it can also be overwhelming.

26
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.470
Now, for React and TypeScript,

27
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.610
if you search for create react app and typescript,

28
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.550
you find that set up article from before again,

29
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.530
and in there, you also find more resources

30
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.370
on getting started with TypeScript and React.

31
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.640
You get an example project, for example,

32
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.950
a cheat sheet, and a link to the official docs.

33
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.300
Now, I also got a TypeScript course,

34
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.540
which you could check out as an alternative.

35
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.310
This course does not focus

36
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.480
on React and TypeScript, but just TypeScript.

37
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.430
And of course, taking it is optional.

38
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.720
You get all the knowledge you need,

39
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.400
also with those free resources.

40
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.310
But if you wanna learn all about TypeScript

41
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.660
from me in this course, that course could be very helpful.

42
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.750
It also does have another

43
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.880
React and TypeScript introductory section,

44
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.480
but the core content and focus of that course

45
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.050
is just TypeScript,

46
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.320
and we're going to dive into all the key features there.

47
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.570
And these are possible next steps,

48
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.350
which you could take to build up on the knowledge you gained

49
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.300
in this module to build React apps with TypeScript,

50
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.963
if you prefer that over just JavaScript with React.
