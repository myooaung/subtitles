1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,320
So let's now apply

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,270
what you learned about Redux to a React application.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,200
Attached you find a simple starting React application

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,900
which will bring something like this onto the screen

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,550
once you run the DEV server

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,100
and you simply need to download it,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,121
extracted it, run NPM install,

8
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:23,370
and thereafter NPM starts to bring up that DEV server.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,200
And then in this application, in this simple demo project,

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,380
I prepared a couple of components

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,660
which we will use throughout this module.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,860
And we're going to get started very simple

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,130
by transferring this counter example,

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,600
which we saw outside of React in the last lectures

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,573
to this React application.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,670
Now for this, actually we can quit the DEV server right away

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,960
and install the Redux package

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,010
because we still want to use Redux.

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,000
And I haven't installed it yet in this new project

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,510
but Redux isn't the only thing we'll install.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,070
We will install that.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,840
But as I mentioned, a Redux is not React specific.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,140
Redux can be used in any JavaScript project

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,870
and it doesn't know anything about React

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,720
and doesn't care about React.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,550
Now to make working with Redux in React applications easier.

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,140
There is a second package

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,140
which we should install the react-redux package.

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,167
This is a package which makes connecting react applications

30
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:34,990
to Redux stores and reducers ends on very simple.

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,240
It will, for example, make it very simple to

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,090
subscribe components to the Redux store.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,060
So you should install these two packages

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,120
into this React project.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,290
And once that is done, we can continue.

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,510
So once that's completed,

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,110
I will bring up my DEV server again

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,903
and now it's time to get started with Redux here.
