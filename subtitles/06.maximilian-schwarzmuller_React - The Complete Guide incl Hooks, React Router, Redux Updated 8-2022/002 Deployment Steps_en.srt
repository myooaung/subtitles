1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,150
So how do you deploy our React application?

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,640
How do you push it onto a real server?

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,240
There are a couple of steps involved,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,110
which you can go through whenever you deploy

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,400
or redeploy your application.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,340
It all starts with writing your code, of course,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,840
and then with testing your code.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,820
And this might sound obvious

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,510
but of course you wanna thoroughly test your application

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,230
before you deploy it.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,310
You wanna play around with it,

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,340
test different things,

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,270
see if you handle errors correctly,

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,470
things like that.

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,710
You wanna make sure that you're shipping an application

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,463
which is ready to be used.

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,000
Then, as a next step,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,160
you might wanna explore optimization opportunities.

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,980
There are certain things in your code

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,430
which you can optimize,

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,730
most importantly,

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,400
you might wanna look into a concept called lazy loading.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,840
And we are going to explore this concept

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,140
in this course section.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,400
So that is another important part

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,970
before you actually move your code somewhere,

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,033
optimize it.

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,840
Now once you're happy with your code,

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,960
it's optimized and it's working,

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,970
then it's time to build your app for production.

31
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,650
And with build, I don't mean

32
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,880
that you need to write more code,

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,650
but instead, we will execute a script

34
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,990
which was written for us already,

35
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,260
which is part of this React project we worked with

36
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,100
throughout this course,

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,070
a script which will then output a production ready bundle

38
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,170
of our code,

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,450
which is minified and automatically optimized

40
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,580
to be as small as possible,

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,540
so that we get an output there,

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,520
which we can take like that

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,800
and move on to a server,

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,970
and will then automatically serve our users

45
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,190
a highly optimized code package

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,610
which is as small as possible,

47
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,840
which of course matters,

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,050
because we wanna ship as little code as possible

49
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,360
to our users,

50
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,880
because they will only be able to interact with our website

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,440
once it's fully loaded.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,950
So shipping less code will load the app faster

53
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,750
and therefore is better,

54
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,260
and will be able to automatically generate

55
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,150
such a optimized minified code bundle with a certain script

56
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,130
which we are also going to see in action

57
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,200
in this course section.

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,110
Now, once we got this optimized code package

59
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,230
which is ready for deployment,

60
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,390
we need to deploy that package.

61
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,750
And therefore, the next step is that we take that code

62
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,700
which is produced for us,

63
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,630
which is based on the code we wrote of course,

64
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,620
and uploaded to a server.

65
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,960
Now, there will have different choices,

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,610
different hosting providers which we can use.

67
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,440
And I'll show you an example in this course section.

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,750
But you can really deploy anywhere.

69
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,640
I'll just leave a couple of notes

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,280
on what matters there

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
and what you should keep in mind

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,760
when it comes to deploying your application.

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,610
You will definitely need to configure your server

74
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,740
or your hosting provider's offering.

75
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,160
And I'll dive into this configuration

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,070
together with you in this course section

77
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,840
to make it crystal clear what matters here,

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,640
what you should pay attention to,

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,400
and how you do configure

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,433
and ultimately deploy your code and your server correctly.
