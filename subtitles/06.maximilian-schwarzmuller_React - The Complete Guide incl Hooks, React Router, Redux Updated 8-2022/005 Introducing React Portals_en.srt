1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,090
Fragments allow us to write cleaner code,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,880
to end up with less unnecessary HTML elements

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,870
on the final page.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,853
And that's great.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,740
React portals are another useful feature,

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,580
which do something similar,

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,120
which also help us write cleaner code.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,183
Consider this made up example here.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,130
We got two elements, two components side by side,

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,510
MyModal and MyInputForm, wrapped by a Fragment.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,220
But the Fragment won't matter here.

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,420
We already learned about that.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,050
And the actual content, that ends up

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,223
in the real DOM, might look something like this.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,740
We might have a section and h2 tag,

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,439
coming from some other components,

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,150
because the code on the left,

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,110
is just one of many components

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,650
in our application, let's say.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,690
And then we have that brown content,

21
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,990
which is actually the modal,

22
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,710
which is being rendered to the DOM

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,890
in the end by React.

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,653
And the orange part is our form.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,013
Now what's wrong with that?

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,755
Technically nothing, technically this is fine,

27
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:09,250
but there is something in this code,

28
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,760
which is not ideal.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,943
And that would be that modal.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,980
This modal code, which is being rendered here

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,530
in the DOM, will technically work.

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,990
As long as you apply the correct styling,

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,460
it will look like a modal.

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,393
As you also saw in that demo project we worked on.

35
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,880
But semantically and from a,

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,930
have a clean HTML structure perspective,

37
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,750
this is not ideal.

38
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,750
Why?

39
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,190
Because you have to keep in mind,

40
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,644
that a modal basically is an overlay

41
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,310
on your page.

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,330
It is an overlay to the entire page.

43
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,513
So logically, it's above everything else.

44
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,400
And if it's then nested in some other HTML code,

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,290
it might technically work because of styling,

46
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,030
but it's not good code.

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,320
It's not a good structure.

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,230
And it can even lead to real problems again,

49
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,180
with styling, or with accessibility,

50
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,090
if you have such nested overlay content,

51
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,150
because if, for example, a screen reader

52
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,010
has to interpret your HTML code,

53
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,220
which is being rendered,

54
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,210
it might not see this as a general overlay,

55
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,860
because you are CSS styling won't matter too much there.

56
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,530
And from a semantical perspective,

57
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,860
from the structure it has,

58
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,130
it's deeply structured in our HTML code.

59
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,290
So it's not obvious that this modal

60
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,023
should be an overlay to all the other content.

61
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,100
And that's not just a case for modals,

62
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,870
you would have similar problems for side drawers,

63
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,394
for dialogues, so typically for all kinds

64
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:47,990
of overlays or any related components.

65
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,440
It's a little bit as if you would create a button,

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,870
by simply styling a div like a button

67
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,210
and adding an event listener.

68
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,730
It will work technically, but it's not a good practice.

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,920
It's bad for accessibility.

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,990
It's bad if a fellow developer has to

71
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,380
work with that, it's simply not a good idea.

72
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,650
In web development in general,

73
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,450
with HTML and CSS and Java script,

74
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,260
because it's so forgiving, you can make a lot

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,010
of things work, but that doesn't mean

76
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,704
that just because it works,

77
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:21,070
it's also a good implementation.

78
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,933
It's also a good idea to use it like this.

79
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,950
And that's where we can use another React concept,

80
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,510
to get rid of this problem with this modal,

81
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,080
with this overlay content,

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,562
which shouldn't be deeply nested.

83
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:37,035
We can use a portal to keep

84
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:40,260
the structure we have on the left,

85
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,820
so to keep writing our components the way

86
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,470
we want to write them, so that we have

87
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,830
no friction when we wanna pass data around

88
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,000
and so on.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,020
But to still render this differently

90
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,390
in the real DOM and to, for example,

91
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,266
render the modal HTML content somewhere else,

92
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,623
than it would normally go to.

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,020
So that on the left, the J as X code rewrite

94
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,075
hasn't changed, but the rendered HTML code

95
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:09,260
is a bit different from our J as X code.

96
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,830
So the modal there is not next to the forum.

97
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,110
And you can achieve this with React portals

98
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,723
So let's see how portals work.
