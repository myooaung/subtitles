00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.810
[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] So what is React

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.230
or React.js as it's actually called?

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.620
And why would we use it?

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.740
Well, to answer that first question, what it is,

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.520
we can of course visit reactjs.org,

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.260
the official React.js webpage.

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.880
And there we learn that React is a JavaScript library

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.560
for building user interfaces.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560
That's a nice sentence.

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.490
But what exactly does that mean?

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.810
Consider an example like Netflix Service,

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.950
Netflix website and application.

13
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.850
This application is highly interactive

14
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.070
and runs pretty smoothly when we work with it.

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.100
It's easy to use

16
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.330
and we don't have to wait for anything to load,

17
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.410
we have nice transitions.

18
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.190
If we go to the My List page

19
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.670
that transition happens pretty much instantly.

20
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.019
We don't seem to wait for a new page to load here,

21
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.980
and that's all pretty nice.

22
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.530
And here I'm using Netflix in my browser.

23
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.200
So this is a website here.

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.240
Now, when we use a service like Netflix,

25
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.430
it might almost feel a bit like a mobile app,

26
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120
even though I am using the website here.

27
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.190
Because mobile apps give us this

28
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.280
great highly reactive user experience.

29
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.140
From mobile apps where use that we have smooth transition

30
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.030
that it's fun to use that app

31
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.380
and that things happen instantly.

32
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.810
And at least traditionally,

33
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.370
websites didn't always feel like this.

34
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.770
Traditionally in websites, when we, for example,

35
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.830
clicked a link or a button,

36
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.910
our request was sent to a server

37
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.670
and a new HTML page was sent back to the browser

38
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.150
where it then could be displayed.

39
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.790
And therefore, traditionally, websites could feel

40
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.010
a bit clunky,

41
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.410
we might have that latency where we wait

42
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.393
for this new HTML page to load and so on.

43
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.670
And it's this request and response cycle,

44
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.240
which we can break up with JavaScript.

45
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.010
So at this point we don't even need React,

46
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.460
it's just a JavaScript which can help us here.

47
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.560
Because JavaScript is a programming language

48
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420
that allows us as a developer to run logic in the browser.

49
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.290
And the great thing about that logic in the browser

50
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.290
is that it can do things that manipulate what the user sees.

51
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.930
JavaScript in the browser is able to manipulate

52
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.830
to so-called Dom, the HTML elements

53
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.360
that are rendered onto the screen.

54
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.600
We can manipulate this with JavaScript.

55
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.440
And that allows us to change what the users sees

56
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.730
without fetching a new HTML page.

57
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.870
We don't need to request a new HTML page

58
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.960
just to present something different to the user.

59
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.510
So that's why JavaScript can help us.

60
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.120
And since React is a JavaScript library,

61
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.650
it looks like it can also help us with that.

62
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.360
It might be an extra building block,

63
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.980
and indeed, React.js is a client-side JavaScript library.

64
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.160
It helps us with writing that client-side JavaScript code

65
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.160
and it's all about building modern reactive user interfaces

66
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.120
for websites.

67
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.450
And in this course, you're going to learn

68
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.370
about all the different features and tools React.js has

69
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.400
and gives you that make building complex

70
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.283
user interfaces easy.

71
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.310
But one question remains, why do we need React?

72
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.870
Because at this point we know that JavaScript is helpful,

73
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.460
and I hope I could explain why it is.

74
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.250
But how can React specifically help us,

75
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.060
why might we want React in addition to JavaScript?

76
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.880
For this, I built a simple,

77
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.100
a very simple demo here.

78
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.790
A simple website which has some interactivity,

79
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.769
as you will see in the next lecture.

80
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.959
And in the next lecture, I will show you

81
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.180
how we can build this website

82
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.210
and the interactivity it has with just JavaScript,

83
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.500
and how to code what's then look like with React

84
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.160
in addition to JavaScript.

85
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.530
And that will then make it clear

86
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.513
why using React could be a good idea.
