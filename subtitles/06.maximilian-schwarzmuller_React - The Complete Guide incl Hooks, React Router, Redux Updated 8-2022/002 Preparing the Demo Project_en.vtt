00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.453
So I'm going

2
00:00:01.453 --> 00:00:04.059
to remove my comments here

3
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.450
so that we again

4
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.140
show it all the time

5
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.410
and in the Modal JS file,

6
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.930
I got an on click listener

7
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.100
on the dismiss button

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.860
where I admitted this closed event.

9
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.780
Now let's say,

10
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.150
I want to control

11
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.366
whether the model is displayed or not

12
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.420
inside this modal JavaScript file for now

13
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.600
by simply showing or hiding the modal.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.440
Now that is of course,

15
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.050
something we can do

16
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.570
and we can easily do this

17
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.670
by going into the modal CSS file

18
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.850
where we define a style for this.

19
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.750
I'm by the way

20
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.900
not using CSS modules here

21
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.710
but still this is the only file

22
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.650
I used as modal CSS class.

23
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.680
So there we could control

24
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.820
whether it is modal as visible or not

25
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.540
by adding a modal open class

26
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.180
to it when it should be shown

27
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.390
and a modal closed class

28
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.300
when it should not be shown

29
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.340
and then of course,

30
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.050
one trivial way of

31
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.860
sure controlling this is to set display

32
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.180
to block when we have modal open

33
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.610
and display to none,

34
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.120
if it is should be closed

35
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.650
and we should do the same

36
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.030
for the backdrop.

37
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.130
So when you backdrop CSS file,

38
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.356
I'm also going to add

39
00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:22.356
backdrop open and backdrop closed.

40
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.833
Now with div,

41
00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.310
we just have to add some codes

42
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.860
to both files to make sure

43
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.830
we actually take advantage of that.

44
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.740
So, first of all

45
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.730
I'm going to refactor this

46
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.530
backdrop component function,

47
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.670
you're into a function

48
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.620
with curly braces where I then

49
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.380
will return to JSX eventually

50
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.890
but before I do so

51
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.064
and that's the reason why

52
00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:43.820
I converted this, I want to create

53
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.940
my classes array basically.

54
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.370
So my CSS classes,

55
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.660
I want to attach here

56
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.750
should be an array.

57
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.580
It should always be backdrop

58
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.413
but then it should be

59
00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.770
backdrop open or closed

60
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.290
depending on some prop I receive.

61
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.170
So let's say I check

62
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.570
if props show is true

63
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.920
and only if that is true,

64
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.770
I want to add backdrop open

65
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.630
otherwise I'd add backdrop closed.

66
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.730
Now, finally what I need to do is

67
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.090
I need to attach this class here

68
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.610
so the CSS class is constant

69
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.870
and call join

70
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.673
to join us into a string.

71
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.040
Now with that we can control

72
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040
the displayer of the backdrop

73
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.019
I'm going to copy that code

74
00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.197
into my modal JS file

75
00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:33.000
add there to all refactored is

76
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.350
to take advantage of the fact

77
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.760
that we do have a function

78
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.900
where we don't just return something

79
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.810
but we will return something

80
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.130
before we do so,

81
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.270
I also want to control

82
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.250
my CSS classes here.

83
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.110
So let's make sure

84
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.690
we return the JSX code here too

85
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.110
but then as I just said

86
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.580
we should have CSS classes

87
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.780
where we have modal

88
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.613
and then we have

89
00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:58.190
modal open or modal closed

90
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.814
and I actually used that

91
00:02:59.814 --> 00:03:03.550
as my CSS class name here,

92
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.000
again joining it into one string

93
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.250
with that join method.

94
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.510
Now with that we just need

95
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.930
to pass the show prop

96
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.670
to backdrop and modal.

97
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.503
We can do that

98
00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:15.150
in the app JS file.

99
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.110
There we have a class based component.

100
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.630
Let's now add a state

101
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.260
where we add modal is open

102
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.650
and set this to false.

103
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.350
So let's say at the beginning

104
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.650
and then I will simply

105
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.370
change this state.

106
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.240
So in this class,

107
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.500
I'll add show modal.

108
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.710
That should be a function

109
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.140
where I simply call this set state

110
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.220
and set modal is, open to true

111
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.660
and then I will have

112
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.970
a close modal function

113
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.803
and that of course

114
00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:46.940
is all pretty much straight forward.

115
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.990
Nothing new in the closed modal function

116
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.370
I will set modal is open to false,

117
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.820
just like that.

118
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.410
Show modal and close modal.

119
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.113
Now in the modal component, again

120
00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.170
I do call this closed prop

121
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.190
on a click on the dismiss button.

122
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.290
So that is the close prop

123
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.540
is what I should bind

124
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.832
to my close modal method here.

125
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.830
So closed will be equal

126
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.600
to this close modal

127
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.459
and the backdrop and modal,

128
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.300
now both need to receive the show prop

129
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.132
that should be

130
00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:22.560
this state modal is open

131
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.830
because that will determine

132
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.820
whether we want to show

133
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.300
or hide the modal.

134
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.690
Finally, we need a way

135
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.500
to show the modal and we've got this

136
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.810
open modal button here.

137
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.060
Now, all we have to do is

138
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.380
hookup the on click listener there

139
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.760
to this show modal

140
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.620
and now with all these things,

141
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.290
if we save this

142
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.870
we go back to the application.

143
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.940
I click open modal

144
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.970
we see the modal.

145
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.350
I click dismiss, we dismiss it.

146
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.340
Now that's all nice

147
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.020
but we have no animation.

148
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.270
So again, finally,

149
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.890
let's work on this animation

150
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.223
in the next lecture.
