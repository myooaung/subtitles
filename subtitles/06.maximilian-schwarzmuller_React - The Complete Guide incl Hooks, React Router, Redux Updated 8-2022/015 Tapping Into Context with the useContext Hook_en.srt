1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,540
So lets explore the useContext Hook.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,700
For that here,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,510
I will actually remove

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,520
this code, I will

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,153
remove to Consumer.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,223
Like this.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,000
And therefore I'm back to my

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,330
old navigation Component

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,163
but of course now

10
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,010
I'm referring to that

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,650
CTX object which simply

12
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,063
doesn't exist anymore.

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,993
Now we are still importing

14
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,870
AuthContext, and we can

15
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,980
use it again.

16
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,930
Now by importing a

17
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,110
Hook from React,

18
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,110
and that's the useContext Hook.

19
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,780
Another Hook that's built into React.

20
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,670
And it does what the name implies,

21
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,860
it allows us to use the Context,

22
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,140
it allows us to tap into a Context

23
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,253
and listen to it.

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,115
Using it is simple,

25
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:50,290
you call useContext in your React Component Function,

26
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,740
and you pass the Context appointer at

27
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,470
the Context you want to use to it.

28
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,303
So in our case, I'm pointing to AuthContext.

29
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,170
Now what you get back, is the Context value.

30
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,670
So here...

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,910
I'll store this in a CTX Constant

32
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,063
to make my code down there worth again.

33
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,450
And with that,

34
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,780
we can save this.

35
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,580
And it will again, work just fine.

36
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,420
Simply, because I'm using the useContext Hook.

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,253
Easy like that.

38
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:23,170
Simple like that.

39
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,390
This is all we need to do

40
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,380
and this, of course

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,240
I would say it's a bit more

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,850
elegant and a bit nicer

43
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,080
than using AuthContext Consumer,

44
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,913
which you...

45
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:34,110
However, just to make this clear,

46
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,980
are always allowed to use.

47
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,810
It's not wrong or anything like that.

48
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,620
This is just a bit more elegant

49
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,573
in my opinion.
