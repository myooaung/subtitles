00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.420
Now again, let's practice what we learned.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.140
We have this basic form component here.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.310
Let's go to app JS and swap this simple input here

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.059
for the basic form component.

5
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.520
And of course they we will also add D import here

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.430
to basic form from dot slash components

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.180
basic form so that if we saved that, we got this form.

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.060
Now this is still a form, still, not too fancy

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.430
but it of course now has three inputs instead of two.

10
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.210
And it's a brand new form without any validation at all.

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.210
And I now want you to again, apply what we learned

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.680
if possible, of course, without looking at simple input

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.680
at least not in great detail and use our custom hook here

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.670
or if you're feeling super fancy,

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.050
try building up that custom hook from scratch again,

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.000
to again practice what we did over the last lectures.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.610
So start with the validation here

18
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.180
by using state in the basic forum,

19
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.630
started with validation for the individual inputs,

20
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.260
then build your custom hook

21
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.030
and then start using that hook for the inputs.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.900
If you're getting stuck with that

23
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.630
simply go back to the previous lectures, to see how we built

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.510
up the validation logic and the customer step-by-step there

25
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.690
and then try it on your own again.

26
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.730
Once you're done with that

27
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.560
continue with the next lecture

28
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.900
because there I will wire up this brand new form

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.793
to our custom hook and then take it from there.
