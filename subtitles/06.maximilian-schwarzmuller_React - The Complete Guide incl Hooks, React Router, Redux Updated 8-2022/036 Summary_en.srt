1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,230
Now that's it for this summary of React.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,660
We had a look at all the core features

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,860
that make up react, like State and useEffect,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,650
and Context and Components and Props, of course.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,670
And we built this little demo earlier

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,250
and now this demo project here, which uses more features,

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,810
including features like Routing and Forms.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,550
Of course, React has more to offer

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,110
and you can also dive deeper

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,150
into the concepts I touched on here.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,230
For example, useEffect has more to offer

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,580
than what we're using here,

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,310
but that is why I do have a complete course

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,210
with more than 30 hours on this topic.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,770
However, the idea behind this section here

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,540
was to give you a summary

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,070
of all the core concepts React has to offer.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,820
So that we're all on the same page regarding that.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,550
And with that you are now well-prepared

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,403
to continue with this course.
