1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:08,470
So to use that custom store, let's go to the index, Jaspal, and get rid of the products provider,

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,900
which is our context API in action, can we get rid of that and instead import?

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,260
Configures story from.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,180
Hooks Store Products store and called that here to set up our store.

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,090
Now the cool thing is we don't need to wrap this in a provider component or anything like that.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:41,770
This will make sure that we initialize our store since we import in its store from the store fol these

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,900
things here will all be set up and they will be initialized with the values we're passing in our product

8
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,200
store.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,320
Jaspal, if we had multiple stores, we would simply call Configures store for these different stores.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,450
You would just have to give these functions different names.

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,980
You can, for example, named as Configure Products Store, of course, because it's the default export

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,270
you can name is whatever you want.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
And you would call all these configure store functions for all the different store parts you might have

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,970
in your app.

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,860
And with that, the store is ready to use now to use it.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,570
We can simply go to the place where we need it, like here, the products container file.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:24,520
Instead of importing our context there, we can import use stores are custom hook from.

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,260
Hook store store now, so not from the product store, but just store and you store, it gives us access

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,030
to the global store and the global dispatch function.

20
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,160
So now here we can call use store.

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,760
Don't need to pass anything there.

22
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,610
And when we get back is our.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,790
State and a dispatch function, that's what we get back from use store.

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,730
Now, of course, here I'm not interested in the dispatch function, so I can simply just get my state

25
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,590
here by just accessing the first element returned by the customs to work at a custom hook because the

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,850
custom returns to things local, state and dispatch the only need to state.

27
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,060
We just extract the first element from the array with this syntax, of course.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,550
So that's our state.

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,850
And therefore here we can output state products because we know there will be a product's key in our

30
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,730
state because that's what we're setting up in the products store.

31
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,810
Jaspal, when we initialize our state, then here, the second argument we pass to in its store is our

32
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,170
object.

33
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,810
But we add a product that is.

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,880
What will be initialised, second argument, as our initial statehood will be merged with the global

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,680
state and therefore the global state will have a product's key, and that's what I'm accessing here

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,160
now to test this, let's go to the product item and get rid of our context thing there, because that

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,240
won't work right now.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,670
Get rid of this and comment this out and save that.

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,280
And if you reload this page, you you should still see all your products there.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,030
Now let's make the favorite button work again.

41
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,280
And for this in the product item file, instead of importing use context, we can import.

42
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,730
Use store.

43
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,580
From.

44
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,920
The Hooke's store folder and their disgorges file.

45
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,570
And then here, recall call use store, and now I'm only interested in the dispatch function, which

46
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,900
is our second argument, we'd return in our store here, we return to the rate dispatch is the second

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,510
argument or the second element, I should say.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,790
So I'm extracting that second element here.

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,790
That's the dispatch function.

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:49,310
So I saw it in this dispatch constant, we can call dispatch here and now what I want to dispatch is

51
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:57,770
an actual identifier, which is toggle Faf and will then look for such an identifier in our actions

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,490
map, which I set up in products store there.

53
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,830
This is the actions map, which I use to initialize my store, which will be merged into the global

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,610
action map.

55
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,160
And there I have toggle Faf as an identifier and this needs a payload of product ID, which is good

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,800
to know because that's the second argument we can forward here.

57
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,120
Perhaps ID that should be all with that change.

58
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,400
Now we can mark things as a favorite again.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,610
Now let's make sure the favorites page works again, because right now it's not working.

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,520
Of course, even though I have favorites, because it still tries to get them from the context.

61
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,180
So in the favorites, just fall here.

62
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,100
Let's not import the context anymore.

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,890
But again, import use store from.

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:51,480
The bookstore store folder and there it is, store Jaspal, and then here we got our state, which is

65
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:59,100
use store, and they're the first element and I'm interested in my favorite products, which I get by

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,850
accessing state products.

67
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,180
State products don't filter, and then I search for all products which are.

68
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,830
A favorite like this.

69
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,810
So, yeah, by the way, make sure you, of course, execute your custom hook that's important at parentheses

70
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,860
here, safeness and give it a try.

71
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,760
Got no products yet after the reload.

72
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,580
But now let's add two and we see them here.

73
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,440
So this is now working.

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,170
And I'm totally aware that this is kind of hard to wrap your head around it first.

75
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,550
So let me summed it up by briefly going through that again in the next lecture.
