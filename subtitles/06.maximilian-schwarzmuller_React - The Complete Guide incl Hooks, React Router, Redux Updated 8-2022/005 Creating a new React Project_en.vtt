00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.100
Now to start our work on this course project

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.300
and to finally start writing some React code

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.350
we need a React project.

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.870
And the easiest way of getting started with a React project

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.870
is to use a tool called Create React App.

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.810
You can simply Google for a Create React App

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.910
to find this GitHub repository

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.340
with more information about it.

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.620
You can also visit, create-React-app.dev

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.200
for the full documentation.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.860
Now this is a tool which you can use

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.490
to create React projects.

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.770
Which are basically pre-configured folders

14
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.770
with some basic React code files and most importantly

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.970
a bunch of configuration files which help you build

16
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.320
that React App for production use

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.960
because it turns out that there will be

18
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.850
a couple of transformation and optimization steps

19
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.310
between developing any React App

20
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.840
and running a React App in production

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.590
but more on that later.

22
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.060
And in addition, this project which is created

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.610
with Create React App, will give you

24
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.390
a nice development environment

25
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.830
with a development web server which allows you to preview

26
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.000
the application locally on your machine.

27
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.170
And it will allow you to preview this application

28
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.540
in a way where the browser will automatically update

29
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.080
the page whenever you make changes in your code and so on.

30
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.810
That's why we use a tool like Create React App.

31
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.670
It simply simplifies our development process.

32
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.010
It adds a couple of key transformation steps which we need

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.570
and it will later also help us optimize our React code

34
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.410
before we push it to a production server.

35
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.370
Now getting started with Create React App is simple.

36
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.730
In the end you find all important steps here.

37
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.180
However, to execute these steps

38
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.383
you first of all need to visit nodejs.org.

39
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.580
Node js is a technology which is not directly

40
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.390
related to React.

41
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.530
It isn't the end a runtime for JavaScript

42
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.530
which would allow you to run JavaScript code

43
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350
outside of the browser.

44
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.850
And therefore of course, it's not something we need at all

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.170
for React.

46
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.770
Because React code is JavaScript code

47
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.400
that runs in the browser.

48
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.890
We will need node js however,

49
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.820
for this Create React App tool.

50
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.780
To run this command here we'll need node js installed

51
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.470
on our system, otherwise this will fail.

52
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.630
And behind the scenes the project

53
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.530
which is generated by a Create React App

54
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.300
will use node js for this development preview server

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.550
and for this behind the scenes transformation

56
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.900
and optimization steps which we also need

57
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.370
to build production ready applications.

58
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.140
Therefore you should visit nodejs.org

59
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.520
and simply download that latest version here

60
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.070
whichever version that is when you were visiting this page

61
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.620
the exact version doesn't matter.

62
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.330
Simply download this version here

63
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.600
save it somewhere on your system

64
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.160
and walk through the installer this gives you.

65
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.010
I'm on macOS here but you'll get a similar installer

66
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.613
on windows and you should simply walk through the installer

67
00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:39.210
except all these default settings here

68
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.340
and in the end simply finished as node js installation.

69
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.220
Again, it works in the same way on macOS and Linux

70
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.690
and windows.

71
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.690
Once you've got node js installed, you are ready to execute

72
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.720
these commands to create a new React application

73
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.740
and therefor a new folder, to then navigate into that folder

74
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.260
and to then run a special script, which exists inside

75
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.740
of that project folder to bring up a development server

76
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.940
this preview server I was talking about.

77
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.660
But we are going to do that together.

78
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.790
So simply copy this command and then open

79
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.960
your default terminal or command prompt on windows

80
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.820
and then important, navigate inside of this terminal

81
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.030
into a folder where you want to create your React project.

82
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.600
You can navigate around with this cd command

83
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.920
which stands for change directory

84
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.920
and you then should ultimately go into a path

85
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.880
where you do want to create this new project.

86
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.050
For me I'll just navigate into my desktop folder here

87
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.180
and then simply copy in this NPX command.

88
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.410
However, I'll change the name of the to be created project

89
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.323
to React complete guide, since that is what this course is.

90
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.480
Simply hit entered there after

91
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.630
and this will now create this new React project

92
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.710
in the destination where you execute this command.

93
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.160
It will create a folder with that name you picked here

94
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.400
in my case, react complete guide.

95
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.020
And inside of that folder, it'll set up all the key files

96
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.210
you need to write React code

97
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.550
and build your React application.

98
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.760
Now, as you can see, this might take

99
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.000
a couple of minutes here to finish

100
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.690
and therefore I will be back once it is finished.

101
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.130
If you are facing errors here, definitely also

102
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.413
check the Q and A section, but most importantly make sure

103
00:05:37.413 --> 00:05:41.610
that you don't have a proxy firewall or VPN client

104
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.940
that might be blocking outgoing connections

105
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.750
or might be interfering here.

106
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.513
The same goes for antivirus software.

107
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.520
Now, once this finished, you should see something like this

108
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.870
and you can now cd introduce created folder

109
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.440
simply by running cd and then the folder name.

110
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.443
And then in there run NPM start.

111
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.440
And this will now start this development server

112
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.540
which hosts a preview of this React application.

113
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.040
And it will automatically open up this application

114
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.320
on localhost:3000.

115
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.210
If it doesn't open this page automatically

116
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.130
you can manually visit localhost:3000 in your browser.

117
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.770
Now there, you should see something like this

118
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.030
the exact look and what you see in detail here might change

119
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.070
over time, but you should see some starting page

120
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.750
some dummy React application, which has set up for you.

121
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.700
Now, of course, we're ready to edit this code.

122
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.730
And for this, I already recommended visual studio code

123
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.328
as a code editor in the first code section.

124
00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:53.060
(indistinct) I also explain my visual studio code set up

125
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.020
and how you can make sure that it looks and works for you

126
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.040
as it does for me.

127
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.190
So on code dot visual studio.com

128
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.627
you can download and installed it for all operating systems.

129
00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:06.180
But again, make sure you have a look

130
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.910
at this first core section where I walked

131
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.473
through that in detail.

132
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.890
Therefore, once you did all of that

133
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.230
simply open visual studio code and then opened

134
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.930
this created project folder with visual studio code.

135
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.860
simply with file, open and then pick that folder

136
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.570
which was created, which holds your React project.

137
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.810
And you should see something like this there.

138
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.820
You might not see all these sub folders and files

139
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.980
as this can also change over time

140
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.950
but you should definitely see a source, a SRC folder

141
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.360
and the package.json file.

142
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.650
The package.json file in the end holds all the dependencies

143
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.990
of this project, for example, React, but also a couple

144
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.590
of development dependencies, which are involved

145
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.290
with these transformation and optimization steps

146
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.860
I was talking about.

147
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.420
The SRC folder holds the actual source code

148
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.490
you will be working on.

149
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.390
And you will see more files in there than I have it here

150
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.750
because I already cleaned up that folder.

151
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.630
And speaking of that, I wanted to show you

152
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.210
how you can create new React projects

153
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.970
because ultimately that is what you need once you're done

154
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.820
with that course, but to make sure that we're all starting

155
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.210
on the same page and we're all working

156
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.630
on the same kind of project setup

157
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.580
attached you find this cleaned up starting project

158
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.060
which I created for you.

159
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.929
Simply download it unzip it and then open that

160
00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.490
with visual studio code.

161
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.130
That's the project we should continue on

162
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.169
because here we'll all have the exact same starting state

163
00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.550
and you will learn the latest version

164
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.960
of React with that as well.

165
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.640
So make sure you download unzip and open

166
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.990
that attached starting project, which is this cleaned up

167
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.143
project, originally created with Create React App.

168
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.660
Once you did that

169
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.830
make sure you cancel that running development server

170
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.530
which we started a couple of seconds ago

171
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.510
by going to the terminal where this server is running

172
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.470
and hit control C in there.

173
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.760
Which will cancel it and now, by the way,

174
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.990
if you reload localhost:3000, you'll no longer see

175
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.700
the website therefore.

176
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.690
But we'll restart it in a second.

177
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.620
But now based on this adjusted starting project

178
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.490
I provided to you.

179
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.460
Now here's a nice trick which I recommend that you use.

180
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.380
We again, need to start this development server

181
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.240
to have that automatically updated preview

182
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.616
of the application we're building.

183
00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:38.690
Now the best way of starting that server again

184
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.010
is to go into visual studio code

185
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.120
into that project which you opened up.

186
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.120
And then here in the menu, go to terminal, new terminal

187
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.600
and open a new terminal here

188
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.230
which is now your default system terminal or command prompt

189
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.740
just integrated into visual studio code.

190
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.500
And in there you need to run two commands.

191
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.370
First of all run NPM install, this will look into

192
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.050
the package.json file and download and install

193
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.313
all the required packages and dependencies

194
00:10:12.313 --> 00:10:16.770
into this project folder, simply entered this and hit enter.

195
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.830
We didn't have to do this earlier

196
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.810
because when we ran NPX Create React App

197
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.110
this was already included in the overall setup process.

198
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.060
Now that I shared my starting project with you

199
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.240
you need to run this once to download

200
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.260
and install all the dependencies.

201
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.980
They are not part of the shared zip file

202
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.363
since that would unnecessarily bloat that zip file.

203
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.270
Indeed all course attachments which you find

204
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.610
will be missing these locally downloaded

205
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.430
and installed dependencies

206
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.410
since that would just increase the zip file size

207
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.370
and in the end, you just need to run NPM install

208
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.820
in the downloaded and extracted zip files to recreate

209
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.680
and re-download all the dependencies.

210
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.400
You will now have a node modules folder here

211
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.600
which holds all these dependencies.

212
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.140
That's by the way a folder you should never edit or work in

213
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.820
because that's really just all these third party packages

214
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.053
downloaded onto your local system.

215
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.150
Now, once that's done, you can run NPM start again

216
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.170
and this will again, bring up this development server.

217
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.500
Use it all to keep that development server running as long

218
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.300
as you're working on the code, because if you shut it down

219
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.690
you can't preview your application anymore

220
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.410
though you can always restart it by running NPM start again.

221
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.370
And as long as this process is running here

222
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.320
it will automatically watch your code files.

223
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.580
And whenever you change something in code

224
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.340
it will automatically update the loaded page in the browser.

225
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.550
So keep this process up and running here.

226
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.150
Don't close this terminal.

227
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.360
Don't quit it with control C

228
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.133
unless you're done for the day.

229
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.010
Now on localhost:3000, you should see something like this.

230
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.480
Simply some 'let's get started' text

231
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.870
which isn't particularly easy to read

232
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.380
but that's really just a dummy starting state

233
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.180
on which we're going to build up on.

234
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.680
And that is the starting project we're now

235
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.020
going to work with.

236
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.050
That's now our starting state, where we can now finally dive

237
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.503
into the React source code and start learning React.
