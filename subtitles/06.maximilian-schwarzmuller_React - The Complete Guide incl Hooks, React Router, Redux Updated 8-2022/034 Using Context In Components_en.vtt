1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.850
They should instead be called

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.380
from inside some of our other components and pages.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.820
So actually what we wanna do here is

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.720
we don't just wanna manage values

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.750
which are then accessible by different components,

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.500
but also functions that will change those values

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.980
that are accessible from different components.

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.310
And hence we can expose pointers at these functions

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.250
to our different components as well.

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.040
So in our context here, we don't just have the values

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.490
for our favorites, but we also can add function steer.

12
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.050
We can add add favorite key, for example

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.570
which stores are pointer at the add

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.430
favorite handler as a value.

15
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.240
So we don't execute the function here

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.480
we point at it, and that exposes

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.870
this function defined in this component

18
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.100
to all components in this application that are interested.

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.790
And you will see how to use this context

20
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.223
in our components in just a second.

21
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.380
And we can therefore also add,

22
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.660
remove favorite here and point at

23
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.570
the remove favorite handler

24
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.420
and add the item is favorite key

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
and point at the item is favorite handler function.

26
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100
And now we expose these functions

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.853
to all interested components as well.

28
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.330
Now that that's the case, I will also go

29
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.060
to my initial context and add those keys here as well

30
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.240
and set that to empty functions

31
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.650
that just gets the correct parameters

32
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.210
and I'm only doing this because that

33
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.680
will actually give us better auto completion later.

34
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.540
It doesn't really do anything here

35
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.420
since these are functions that don't do anything

36
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.950
but it will help us with

37
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.357
auto-completion in the IDE later.

38
00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:59.050
And that's why we'll just add them here

39
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.053
to the initial context as well.

40
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.460
Okay, so now with that, we spent a lot

41
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.080
of time in that file and I could imagine

42
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.890
that it's not all 100% clear yet

43
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.600
but we're now done with working in this file.

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.200
Now we need to wrap our context provider around

45
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.170
all the components that want to interact with this context.

46
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.780
And then in the different components

47
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.000
we need to pull out the values we're interested in

48
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
or call the methods, the functions here we defined.

49
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.730
And for that we need to export

50
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.580
this favorites context for wider component here

51
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.880
by adding the export keyword in front of this function

52
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
and also maybe at the bottom of the file export

53
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.110
the context as itself, the favorites context itself

54
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.830
as a default.

55
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.740
So we have two exports this function here,

56
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.430
which we export by its name, and then

57
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.270
this default export, which is

58
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.360
our favorites context itself.

59
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.900
These two things are exported here

60
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.610
because we need to interact with both objects,

61
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.113
with both things from outside this file.

62
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.470
Now let's start with interacting

63
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.400
with this favorites context provider component.

64
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.860
I mentioned multiple times that

65
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.550
we wanna wrap this component around

66
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.310
all the components that are interested

67
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.650
in our context data.

68
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.700
And in this case, the my favorites page

69
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.280
will be interested, the navigation bar will be interested

70
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.460
since I wanna show a batch here

71
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.960
and the all meetups page will also be interested

72
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.470
or to be precise, the meetup item components

73
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.930
will be interested because there I have

74
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.950
this two favorites button which for example,

75
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.470
should trigger the add favorite handler.

76
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.930
So I have various components from all

77
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.480
over the app that are interested

78
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.880
and hence the easiest way of providing

79
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.350
the context is probably to wrap everything with it.

80
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.750
So here in index JS I will import the favorite

81
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.800
favorites context provider wider from

82
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.370
the store folder and there to favorites context file

83
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.910
and actually I'll wrap it in curly braces because

84
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.120
I don't want the default export the context object here

85
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.340
but I want my component functioning stat.

86
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.850
These favorites context provider function

87
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.320
which I export like this under its name

88
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.340
and we import named exports between curly braces.

89
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.883
That is standard Java script.

90
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.513
Now we can wrap this provider component

91
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.940
around the browser router and the app

92
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.170
and with that everything, all components

93
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.750
in this application are able

94
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.823
to interact with this context.

95
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.270
Now, how do we interact though?

96
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.810
Let's maybe start with the meetup item component.

97
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.620
Here we have this two favorites button.

98
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.140
I wanna make sure that when this button is clicked

99
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.990
we add this item to our context.

100
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.710
And I also wanna update the text on the button

101
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.730
depending on whether this item is

102
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.543
already part of my context or not.

103
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.250
And actually, if it is part of the context already

104
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.350
if we already did favorite and meetup item

105
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.320
this button should no longer add this item to the context

106
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.640
but remove it from my favorites array in the context.

107
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.740
Hence first step is to add a function

108
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.240
in this meetup item component

109
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.240
which we could name toggle favorite status handler.

110
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.600
The name is up to you though, and I'll bind

111
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.470
this function to the on click prop of this button.

112
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.290
so that when we click this button,

113
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.220
this function will be executed.

114
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.860
And now in this function,

115
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.430
we will need data from the context.

116
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.980
We need to find out whether this meetup item

117
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.250
is already part of the context or not

118
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.603
and then do different things depending on that information.

119
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.800
Now for that, we now need to tap

120
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.550
into the context and get values from there.

121
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.550
And we do this with help of another hook provided by react.

122
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.270
And that would be the use context hook.

123
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.740
This hook allows us to establish a connection

124
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.200
between this component and the context

125
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.660
simply by calling use context here,

126
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.210
and then by passing the context object

127
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.770
to which we wanna connect as our argument.

128
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.670
And here, I'm not talking about

129
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.720
our favorites context provider component

130
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.580
but about the context object, which we created

131
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.070
with create context, which is why I'm exporting

132
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.263
that as a default as well.

133
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.540
With this in meetup item we can import

134
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.430
the favorites context, whoops, like this

135
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.130
so that default export from going up

136
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.253
going up store favorites context,

137
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.140
and instead the favorites context,

138
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.473
which we pass to use context.

139
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.040
And that now gives us access to

140
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.150
this favorites context object

141
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.150
so to this object here, which we're distributing

142
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.590
through the value prop to all the components.

143
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.040
So to this object to this object

144
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.510
will have access now instead of meetup item.

145
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.720
That's the object which is stored

146
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.723
in this favorites, CTX constant now.

147
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.000
And now we can, for example, find out

148
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.800
if this item this meetup item here

149
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.450
is a favorite by using this favorites

150
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.900
CTX constant and calling item it's favorite.

151
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.530
So this method, which we defined

152
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.780
on our context there as well, this method

153
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.340
which points at the item, it's favorite handler function.

154
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.420
We execute this function now

155
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.340
by executing it here in the component like this.

156
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.700
And we need to pass in the idea of the meetup

157
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.890
for what you wanna check, whether it's favorite or not.

158
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.470
And we get the idea of this meetup through props.

159
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.090
There is this ID prop, which we pass

160
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.750
into our meetup item here when we render it.

161
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.400
So we can use props that ID to pass the ID

162
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.030
off this specific meetup to item as favorite

163
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.560
and add will return true or false

164
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.363
so here we then have that response.

165
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.730
Now here in the toggle favorite status handler

166
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.290
we can check if the item is a favorite

167
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.850
so if this constant has a true value,

168
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.560
and if that's the case we know that

169
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.360
we wanna remove that item from the context now

170
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.710
when that button was clicked.

171
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.610
Because it is a favorite already

172
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.060
which means now we wanna get rid of it.

173
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.260
So then we use our favorites, CTX, constant

174
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.300
this context object, and call remove favorite

175
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.100
and remove favorite alls that wants to meet up ID

176
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.163
So we pass props.id here.

177
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.480
Else if the item is not a favorite yet

178
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.683
we call favorites, CTX.add favorite.

179
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.970
And here we need to pass in a new meetup item now

180
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.250
so I will construct our object on the fly

181
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.170
and simply set my ID to props.id

182
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.070
the title to props.title

183
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.080
the description to props.description

184
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.970
the image to props.image

185
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.593
and the address to props.address.

186
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.250
And that now recreates this meetup item

187
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.400
and passes it as an argument to the add favorite function

188
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.210
which in the end triggers this add favorite handler function

189
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.343
in this favorites context provider component.

190
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.160
And add will then update the state there

191
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.230
add this item to the user favorites array.

192
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.290
And because the state was updated

193
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.110
it will update all child components

194
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.620
because this component here as a whole

195
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.180
will be updated and hence the JSX code

196
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.230
with all the child components will be updated again.

197
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.860
And hence all components will have access

198
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.960
to that latest state now.

199
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.730
So that's how we can now trigger

200
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.970
a state update to this global state,

201
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.150
this favorite state from insight to

202
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.780
meet up item component.

203
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.440
We changed some state, which is not managed

204
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.723
in this component, but on a global level.

205
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.820
And now going down to this button,

206
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.680
we probably wanna change the caption

207
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.660
depending on whether the item is a favorite or not.

208
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.930
So I'll put something dynamic here as a caption

209
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.510
and check if item is favorite.

210
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.130
So I'm using this constant here again,

211
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.040
which has true or false as a value.

212
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.190
And if it's true, then the button should say,

213
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.620
remove from favorites.

214
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.470
If it's false so if the item is not a favorite yet

215
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.810
the button should say to favorites

216
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.370
because then clicking the button

217
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.073
will add the item to the favorites.

218
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.380
And now that was a lot of work.

219
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.380
But if you did all of that, if you save this,

220
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.500
now you should be able to reload and click to favorites

221
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.730
and it should change to remove from favorites

222
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.920
and back and forth.

223
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.300
We don't see the favorites on the my favorites page yet

224
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.530
but adding favorites does work as we can tell

225
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.080
by this button.

226
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.680
Now let's make sure we also render

227
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.290
the favorites on this my favorites page,

228
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.363
and that we have a little batch here.
