00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.270
And therefore, that's it for this course.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.800
My last recommendation is that you stay updated

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.220
and that you never stop learning,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.760
not just when it comes to React,

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.810
but for web development in general.

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.510
But of course, also for React.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.880
Now I will do my best to keep this course updated

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.340
and let you know about major changes to React

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.380
but you definitely also should try

10
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.540
to stay updated on your own.

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.370
You can use Twitter for that

12
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.920
and dive into the Twitter Tech and React Community.

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030
You can use the official ReactJS website for this,

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.030
and have a look at their blog to learn

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.960
about interesting changes, experiments,

16
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.310
initiatives and more.

17
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.950
Staying updated and staying an active learner.

18
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.330
These are super important skills as a developer

19
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.280
and together with practicing,

20
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.030
this is what will ensure that you can master React,

21
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.620
that you can be a React developer today and tomorrow,

22
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.400
and that you really utilize what you learned in this course

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.593
and get 100% out of this course.
