00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,750
So in the last video we learned about classes and we learned about properties and methods.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:14,670
There too. Now next generation javascript also offers a different syntax of initializing properties and methods.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,120
And actually it is this more modern syntax I'll use in this course.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,280
So I want to show it to you here too.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,170
You already learned that properties are like variables you attach to classes and objects, methods are

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,070
like functions attached to classes and objects and you'll learn about this syntax where we set up properties

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,750
in the constructor function.

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:43,400
Now there is a more modern syntax which spares us using this constructor function with next generation

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,380
javascript as we will use it in this course.

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,880
You can assign a property directly inside your class with myProperty equals value.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,680
So you skip the constructor function call.

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,270
Behind the scenes this will still be transformed to use constructor functions.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,010
But you'll have an easier time writing this and for methods, it's pretty similar.

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,140
This is the old way.

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,070
I showed you in the last lecture.

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,880
Now the next generation javascript way is to use the syntax from the left where you set up a property

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,930
and simply think of a method as a property which stores a function as a value and then you end up with

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,580
that.

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,030
My method equals and then an arrow function.

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,950
The great advantage of this syntax is that since you use an arrow function as a property value here you've

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,350
got no problems with the this keyword and that's the exact reason why we will use this syntax here on the

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,080
bottom right corner and the syntax on the bottom left corner throughout this course.

23
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,240
Let me show you the syntaxes to you.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,330
Back to jsbin on the project we already worked on here with the human and the person class.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,310
We can get rid of the constructor in the human class and get rid of the this keyword.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,890
and just set gender equal to male and print.

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,450
Gender can be set equal to an arrow function where we console log.

28
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,430
this.gender still using the this keyword in here when we reach out to the property.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,610
Though you may ignore that arrow for now the same for the person we no longer need the constructor

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,860
and we no longer need to call super for that reason.

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,750
Instead what we do is we call this name without this just name equal to Max and gender equal female

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,840
if you want to and printMyName equals an arrow function too, like this.

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,330
Now if you clear this and run this you will get an error because it doesn't recognize the syntax

34
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,600
you actually need to go to the dropdown where it says javascript and choose ES6.

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,920
Babel here.

36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,230
If you do this and hit clear and run you'll see Max and female.

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,490
You'll still see the arrows on the left but you may ignore them.

38
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:01,490
This is the syntax which is next generation javascript which we will actually use in this course.
