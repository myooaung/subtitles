1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,650
Now we practiced those core basics again.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,570
One very basic feature is missing though

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,010
and that would be links.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,400
At the moment we can only navigate around

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,780
by manually changing the URL.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,600
Now I want to add some navigation

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,950
and whilst you can definitely also do this on your own,

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,880
I would recommend that we do it together,

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,030
because I want to build a brand new component

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,990
with a specific styling.

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,490
And hence, that will be easier if we do it together here.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,060
But definitely feel free to also pause here

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,790
and build your own basic dummy navigation

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,060
which allows you to switch between the quotes,

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,540
and NewQuote page.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,920
We'll work on getting to the Quote-ID page

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,023
a little bit later.

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,700
Now to build it together though,

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,770
I'll dive into that layout folder,

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,130
and here I prepared two CSS files for two components

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,523
which we'll add together.

22
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,060
The first component will be a main navigation component

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,022
which I'll store in the MainNavigation JS file.

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,110
As the name suggests, the job of this component will be,

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,743
to render a main navigation bar.

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,290
So in here, I'll add a regular component

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,010
MainNavigation component function,

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,603
as we did it many times before in this course.

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,713
And then here in this component, I want to return a header.

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,340
And in that header, I want to have a div,

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,470
which holds my logo text

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,240
which could be Great Quotes or anything like this.

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,100
And next to that div, I'll add a nav element

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,190
which will then store an onward list

35
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,290
with a couple of lists items,

36
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,253
where every list item should hold a link.

37
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,170
Now we'll need some styling here,

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,690
and therefore I'll import classes

39
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,320
from ./MainNavigation.module.CSS.

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,793
So from that CSS file, which I already provided to you.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,210
And then on that header,

42
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,230
you should add a className of classes.header,

43
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,230
on that div you can add a className of classes.logo.

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,640
And these are all predefined CSS classes

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,403
which you find in this CSS file, which I provided to you.

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,603
And on the nav element, it's classes.nav.

47
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:28,090
Now for these list items, as I just mentioned

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,860
I want to have links in there.

49
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,630
And you did learn that having an anchor tag is not optimal.

50
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,170
At least not if you add it like this,

51
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,030
because that would then trigger the browser default,

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,720
of sending a new request.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,993
And we don't want that.

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,680
Instead, we learned that React Router,

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,980
gives us specific components

56
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,710
which we can use for rendering links.

57
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,720
And there we have the Link component for a standard link

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,820
and the NavLink component for a standard link

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,780
which also gets a specific CSS class, if it's active.

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,550
And here I'll use that NavLink.

61
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,513
And then in this first list item,

62
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,840
we can add a NavLink,

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,270
with a text off All Quotes between the NavLink components,

64
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,533
which leads to /quotes, for example.

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,090
And I'll also set the activeClassName prop here

66
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,550
to classes.active, so that this link gets

67
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,140
the active CSS class, if it is active.

68
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,063
And of course that is a class which I use in this CSS file.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,050
Now I'll repeat this entire list item

70
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,430
and add a second list item where we could say,

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,183
Add a Quote, and this then leads to /newquote.

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,953
And with that, we should have the finished MainNavigation.

73
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,930
Now we could add this main navigation here

74
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,820
in the App JS file, above to Switch statement

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,850
but I will actually also add another component

76
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,350
the Layout component, which I'll store

77
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,583
in a Layout JS file in that Layout folder.

78
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,220
This will be a very simple component.

79
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,160
I'll again create it as a Functional Component

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,363
and export it like this.

81
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,680
And here I'll also import classes

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
from ./layout.module.css file using

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,363
that existing CSS file, which you find here.

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,500
Now, the goal of this component is,

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,520
to render the MainNavigation side by side

86
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,653
with the actual page content.

87
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,180
And for this I'll return a Fragment

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,080
since I want to have adjacent JSX elements.

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,550
Fragment is imported from React of course

90
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,810
and then here we can render the MainNavigation.

91
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,966
And for that make sure that you import MainNavigation,

92
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:57,010
this MainNavigation component we just worked on,

93
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,293
from that MainNavigation file.

94
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,720
And side by side to it,

95
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,740
I'll add a Main element which gets a class

96
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,910
of classes.main, and here I then want to render

97
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,623
the actual page content.

98
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,420
Now, of course the actual page content is determined

99
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,470
in the App JS file by these Routes still.

100
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,010
But we also learned in this course

101
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,620
what we can do in this case.

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,340
I want to use Layout as a wrapper

103
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,660
around this Switch statement here in the end

104
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,230
so that whatever Route is chosen rendered,

105
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,320
it's wrapped by the Layout.

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,290
And we can create such wrapper components

107
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,290
by using props and to be precise props.children.

108
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,320
And then we can go to App.JS and import, Layout from

109
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:55,270
./components/layout/layout,

110
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,890
and then simply wrap Layout

111
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,863
around this Switch statement here.

112
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,060
And if we do all of that and you save all files

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,080
you should know have this navigation.

114
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,010
And you see that the active link is highlighted.

115
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,350
It's a bit whiter than the inactive link,

116
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,423
so we can switch and that highlighting changes.

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,600
And now if I go to quotes/sum-id,

118
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,670
we also have to quote detail page here.

119
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,500
And if I then add /comments we also have that here.

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,840
And now the form isn't as big anymore.

121
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
Now that's still all not working,

122
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,530
and that's of course it's not the final page

123
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,803
but it's one step closer.
