00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] Now for this course module,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,810
I will again use Firebase.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,030
I used Firebase as a dummy backend before,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,920
for sending Http requests and storing data,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,160
and now I will use it for authentication.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,540
Because if you have a Firebase project

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,180
then you can also use the Firebase Authentication REST API,

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,180
which you can find if you Google for Firebase Auth REST API.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,903
There you should find these Firebase Auth REST API docs.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,900
And here you can learn to which API endpoints

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,900
you need to send requests to create a user, log a user in

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,820
or get access to some protected resource.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,540
And I'm simply using Firebase as a dummy backend here

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,230
because I don't wanna write my own backend code

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,690
because that will have nothing to do with React.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,730
If you wanna see that as well,

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,490
both React and a custom backend

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,239
and writing all that custom backend code,

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,780
you can check out my Mern course,

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,510
where we combine React and MongoDB and Node and Express

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,850
into one big project.

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,130
Then you see both sides built from scratch by us.

23
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,140
Here, this is a React course

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,883
and therefore we will use this dummy backend.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,120
Now here for this Firebase Auth REST API,

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,030
on the right, you will find endpoints for signing up,

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,280
so for creating a user with email and password,

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,930
and you see the URL to which you need to send the request

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,720
and you see which kind of data needs to be added

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,340
to that request.

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,200
And we're going to do that together throughout this module.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,193
You find a endpoint for signing in, so for logging in,

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,880
and you will also find an endpoint

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,820
for changing the password.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,860
And we'll need that for this profile page

36
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,720
where users should be able to change their password.

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,460
And this actually will be a protected resource,

38
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,729
which we're accessing here, because, of course,

39
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,480
you should only be able to change your password

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,233
if you are logged in.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,810
That's why this API endpoint also wants an ID token

42
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,400
as part of the request payload.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,900
So, as part of the request data

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,430
and that will be exactly such a token

45
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,023
as I described it a couple of minutes ago.

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,770
So that's the API with which will work, as a dummy backend,

47
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,660
and that's the dummy project which we'll use

48
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,250
for this section here.

49
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,700
And this project, this project snapshot can now

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,523
also be found attached to this lecture.

51
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,660
There you'll find the starting code which we'll use

52
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,690
and it's a very straightforward React project in the end.

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,460
We got a couple of pages where all those Page Components

54
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,000
are super lean, and in the end,

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,510
just include some other Components.

56
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,030
And those Components also are quite straightforward.

57
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,890
There, I haven't added much logic yet.

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,110
The only logic I did add is

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,340
that we have this navigation here

60
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,460
and that on the login page,

61
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,440
we can switch between sign up and log in

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,270
with help of useState here.

63
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,200
That's this code in the AuthForm Component,

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
but that's about it.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,390
We're not handling form submission,

66
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,430
we're not sending any Http requests yet

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,530
or anything like that.

68
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,730
So you can simply download this starting project,

69
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,200
briefly look through the code I'm providing to you

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,010
to get accustomed to it.

71
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,070
But then in the next lecture,

72
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,810
we're going to start working on this code together

73
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,620
to add, sign up and log in and log out

74
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,010
and to send requests to protected resources

75
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,650
and also to lock down access to certain pages

76
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,740
of this application.

77
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,150
So that, for example,

78
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,100
you're not able to visit this profile page,

79
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,030
if you are not logged in.

80
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,210
We're going to have a look at all of that,

81
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,339
throughout this course section.

82
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,880
For this as a last step

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,560
just make sure you do have a Firebase account

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,180
and make sure you have a project created there.

85
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,990
You don't need to use the Realtime Database.

86
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,910
We don't need to use stats.

87
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,020
You can clear any data which you have in there.

88
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,390
Instead, we will work with the Authentication part here

89
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,220
and I'm going to explain how we use that

90
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,410
in the next lectures.

91
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,810
And we're then going to write the code for that.
