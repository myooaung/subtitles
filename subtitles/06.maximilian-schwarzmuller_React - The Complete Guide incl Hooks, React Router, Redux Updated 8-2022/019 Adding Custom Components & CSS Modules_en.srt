1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,780
So for this MeetupDetail page,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,370
I'll add a new functional component inside

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,410
of that meetupId page,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,750
the MeetupDetails component.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,240
And I'll then export this as a default.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,310
Oops, like this.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,990
Not MeetupList.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,150
Like this and then here we return the content

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,470
for the MeetupDetails page.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,600
Now, here it's, of course, up to you

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,910
how you wanna display the details for a given item.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,930
I will output a fragment,

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,800
which we need to import from react

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,730
so that we can have multiple adjacent JSX elements.

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,520
And I'll then start by outputting the image

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,900
of that meetup item

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,433
with some src and some alt text.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,780
Now, of course, later we will actually get the concrete data

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,010
for a specific meetup item here.

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,300
At the moment, we don't really have any meetup data source.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,910
We have this dummy array in the root index.js file

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,630
but it's only available in there

23
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,580
and whilst we could export this constant

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,440
and then also use it in the MeetupDetail page,

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,930
I will not do this here

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,770
because we're soon going to connect a real backend anyways.

27
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,040
And therefore, for the moment,

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,830
I'll just hard code some data in here

29
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,550
and I'll grab that data from the dummy data though,

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,310
so from this DUMMY_MEETUPS array

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,240
and I'll copy the image link here

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,540
and use that as a source.

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,540
And the alt text could be A First Meetup like this.

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,020
Then below that, I will add a h1 tag

35
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,690
where I say A First Meetup and then below that,

36
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,440
a paragraph with The meetup description.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,290
And we can also add a address element here,

38
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,930
which is a default HTML element

39
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,893
where we have the address.

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,330
Like that.

41
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,210
That could be how we output the MeetupDetails,

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,980
for the moment, with some dummy data.

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,240
And if I add this here in the MeetupDetails component,

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,430
if we reload this MeetupDetails page,

45
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,092
this is what we see.

46
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,820
And that's okay but of course, not the final style

47
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,620
which I'd like to have.

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,300
I'd like to center all the text actually

49
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,020
and I would also like to shrink the image a little bit.

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,540
Now, for that, I haven't prepared any styles,

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,620
so we can just quickly add some styles together here

52
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,220
and for this, I'll actually add a brand new component

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,340
in the component's meetups folder,

54
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,543
which I'll name MeetupDetail,

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,240
like this and you don't have to create this component.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,810
I just like to keep my page component files pretty lean

57
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,930
and outsource as much JSX code as possible

58
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,850
into standalone components.

59
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,730
But that is not something you have to do.

60
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,530
Nonetheless, I will do it here

61
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,000
and I'll copy that fragment

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,210
from the MeetupDetails page component here

63
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,910
and add it to the MeetupDetail single component.

64
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,073
And create that MeetupDetail component here.

65
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,220
And of course, also export MeetupDetail here

66
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,220
and return that JSX code here then like this.

67
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,340
And actually, accept props already

68
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,960
and expect that I get this data through props now

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,140
so that the data will be fetched in the page component later

70
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,650
and will then passed into this component,

71
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,940
which is then responsible

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,400
for actually presenting the content.

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,390
So here we then have props.image.

74
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,500
Here for alt, we could use props.title.

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,490
What we then also use here for the h1 tag, props.title.

76
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,977
And here for the address, that would be props.address

77
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,210
and here we have the description.

78
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,253
Props.description.

79
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,830
And on the MeetupDetails page component,

80
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,290
we can now output this MeetupDetail component

81
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,960
we just worked on.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,970
And for this, of course,

83
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,350
import this MeetupDetail component up there.

84
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,640
And now we just need to pass that data,

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,779
which we expect in that component

86
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,093
through props into that MeetupDetail component.

87
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,150
So here we can then add the image property

88
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,280
and then use our dummy image link

89
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,830
or our dummy image content here for the moment.

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,710
Set the title prop.

91
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,053
First Meetup could be the title.

92
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Set the address prop to Some Street 5, Some City

93
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,630
and last but not least, set the description prop

94
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,633
to this is a first meetup.

95
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,820
And then we can get rid of the fragment

96
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,690
and that JSX content in the page component

97
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,510
and just use the MeetupDetail component here.

98
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, why am I doing that?

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
Again, just to keep the JSX code lean here

100
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,670
and now also for styling reasons.

101
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,490
We could have also imported a CSS file

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,620
in the page component.

103
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,160
This would work, it is a regular component after all.

104
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,770
But I like to keep my pages folder lean

105
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,480
and only have the page JS files in there.

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,650
Now, for the other components on the other hand,

107
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,810
it is quite common that we pair a JavaScript file

108
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,550
with a CSS file

109
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,800
and again, we could have done that

110
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,410
in the pages folder as well

111
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,740
but I wanna keep that folder leaner.

112
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,280
Here for the components folder,

113
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,150
it is more common to include these CSS files

114
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,950
and hence here I'll now also add

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,270
a MeetupDetail.module.css file.

116
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,240
The .module.css is important by the way.

117
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,340
We already used it all the time here silently so to say

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,150
because I provided all these components to you

119
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,350
but this actually unlocks a feature

120
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,350
called CSS modules.

121
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,680
It's a feature which you might know from standard React.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,290
It allows you to scope CSS class styles

123
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,660
to a React component and it is supported out

124
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,730
of the box in NextJS projects.

125
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,710
If you name a CSS file like this,

126
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,530
ending with .module.css

127
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,600
and you then import it into your JavaScript file

128
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,480
in a certain way, which I'll show you in a second,

129
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,220
then the CSS styles defined in the CSS file

130
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,900
will be scoped to this component.

131
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,443
At least if you use CSS classes as selectors.

132
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,300
Now, that special way of importing

133
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,900
can bee seen in the other JavaScript files.

134
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,200
It looks like this.

135
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,100
We import classes or however you wanna name it

136
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,703
from the CSS file.

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,550
And that's a special way of importing,

138
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,930
which will be picked up by NextJS

139
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,940
and behind the scenes,

140
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,010
it will then transform the CSS classes

141
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,180
so that the class names are unique per component.

142
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,470
And that ensures that your styles can't spill over

143
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,240
to other components.

144
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,823
That's why I also wanted to show this approach here.

145
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,720
So now we can import classes from ./MeetupDetail.module.css

146
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,330
like this and now classes is a JavaScript object in the end

147
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,970
where any CSS classes you define in your CSS file

148
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,350
will be available as properties on this object.

149
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,980
And if you access them,

150
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,180
the values will be the transformed CSS files,

151
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,280
which are guaranteed to be unique.

152
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,530
And that allows you to use the same CSS class names

153
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,363
in different components without clashing with the styles.

154
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,510
And now we could replace Fragment here

155
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,270
with section and give that section a className

156
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,640
of classes.detail let's say like this.

157
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,640
And if we do that, we can now add a detail CSS class here

158
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,430
in the MeetupDetail.module.css file.

159
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,050
And the styles we define in there will then be applied

160
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,150
to this section

161
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,770
because it gets this transformed detail class

162
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,230
under the hood.

163
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,970
And that is a nice feature to have,

164
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,693
which is why I also wanted to show it to you.

165
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,100
Now, with that, we can, for example,

166
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,880
select the image, which is inside of that element

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,290
with the detail class, so this image.

168
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,180
We can select this

169
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,049
and then change its look, change its style.

170
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,059
For example, give it a width of 100%,

171
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,210
which ensures that it stays in the box

172
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,033
that is reserved for this page by the layout component.

173
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,203
We can also select the overall detail class again.

174
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,760
So the entire section with that class on it

175
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,430
and set text-align to center

176
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,840
so that all the text elements are centered.

177
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,420
And that could now be our MeetupDetail.

178
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,620
Of course, you can tweak it.

179
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,230
You can add more styles,

180
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,820
you can make sure that it looks the way you want it to look.

181
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,820
I don't wanna turn this into a CSS course.

182
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,880
I just wanted to show you this CSS modules feature

183
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,780
and show you this approach,

184
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,900
which you don't have to use but which I like to use

185
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,370
that I keep my page component files relatively lean,

186
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,790
especially regarding the JSX code

187
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,970
and I instead use embeddable standard React components

188
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,080
for the actual JSX code

189
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,430
and like in this case, for the styling.

190
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,800
And with that, we have our MeetupDetail page in place

191
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,810
and now we've got all these pages here which we need.

192
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,950
Now, with that, we can work

193
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,088
towards replacing that dummy data source,

194
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:54,820
our dummy array here in the root index.js file

195
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,653
with a real backend, with a real data source.
