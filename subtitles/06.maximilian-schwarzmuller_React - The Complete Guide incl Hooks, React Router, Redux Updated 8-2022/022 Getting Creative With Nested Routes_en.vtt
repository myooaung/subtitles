00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.600
Now we are nearing the end of this module.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.360
You might remember that on this quote detail page

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.130
we actually also had this comments feature.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.040
At the moment we don't really have comments

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.250
but we do have does nested route

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.890
but currently we can only reach this route

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.483
by manually adding this comments path here at the end.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.950
Now we might want to give the user a link

9
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.890
that loads to comments or something like this.

10
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.090
And that is something which we can implement indeed.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.940
Something which we did do before already,

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.080
adding a link isn't too difficult.

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.780
And therefore, of course, feel free to try this on your own.

14
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.410
On the quote detail page, add a link

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.060
below the highlighted quote,

16
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.680
which will load the comments

17
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.560
and navigate us to this path here.

18
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.370
Here's a short pause for you to do this on your own.

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.970
Thereafter we'll do it together.

20
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.447
So let's add this link now,

21
00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:01.730
for this we need to import,

22
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.930
link from react-router-DOM

23
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.200
and then here in highlighted quote,

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.070
we can add a link.

25
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.980
And actually I will wrap this in a div

26
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.410
with a class name of centered

27
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.263
using this globally defined centered class here.

28
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.890
And I'll then move my link into that div

29
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190
but that's of course optional.

30
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.350
Then this link could say load comments

31
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.350
and hence leads to the current URL/comments.

32
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.380
Now for this I need to construct the destination dynamically

33
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740
because the quote ideas dynamic

34
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.500
it depends on which quote you loaded.

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
So I actually we can copy this code from down there

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.370
because that's the path we want to navigate to.

37
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.350
We wanna load this route in the end.

38
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.220
Now I will also give this link extra class name.

39
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.770
It's not something we did before

40
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.610
but we can add classes to the anchor tag

41
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.700
which link renders by using the regular class named prop.

42
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.520
And here I'm using a global class again

43
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.370
which is defined in that index CSS file.

44
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.670
With all of that if we saved this,

45
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.263
we got this load comments link here.

46
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.450
And hence now if I go to a quote without /comments

47
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.370
if I click load comments, we see that.

48
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.870
But maybe we also want to make that link disappear

49
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.480
after we load it to comments.

50
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.600
Now we could try to implement this

51
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.640
by looking at the URL and check

52
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.830
whether we are on the comments page or not

53
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.070
but we don't have to do this ourselves.

54
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.990
We can hand that work off to react router.

55
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.860
We can also move this here into a route.

56
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.350
And that might be strange at first,

57
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.880
but it is actually just embracing the functionality,

58
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.120
react router gives us.

59
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.840
We can add a new nested route here

60
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.620
and this nested route should be active

61
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.453
if the path is this path,

62
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.770
but without the comments.

63
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.190
So if we're on the page without slash comments

64
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.850
then this route should become active.

65
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.000
And only then.

66
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.160
So I will add the exact prop here

67
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.740
so that we're not matching the beginning of a path

68
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.820
but the full path.

69
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.100
Then I want to render this div because we can render

70
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.883
any JSX code we want for any route we define.

71
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.173
Now with this change made,

72
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.450
we don't see the load comments text

73
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.740
if we are on slash comments.

74
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.650
But if I am on just the detailed page

75
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.770
I do see load comments, but as soon as I click it

76
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.150
it disappears because we changed to the nested route.

77
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.800
And I'm showing this to you

78
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
because I want you to really play

79
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.580
around with react router and use its features.

80
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.870
You can build something

81
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.260
like this with help of nested routes.

82
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.610
And this is a way

83
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.900
of using those nested routes feature

84
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.630
to conditionally render different content based on the URL

85
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.770
without you having to manage some complex state.

86
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.023
React router does that for you.
