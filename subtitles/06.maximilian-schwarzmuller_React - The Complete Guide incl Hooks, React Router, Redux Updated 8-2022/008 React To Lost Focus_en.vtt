00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.490
Now up to this point

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.260
we're still on the left side

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.410
of this slide.

4
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.189
We are always validating

5
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.450
when a form is submitted.

6
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.750
We're not validating

7
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.150
when an input lost focus

8
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.980
or on every keystroke.

9
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.720
Now, of course, that could be fine.

10
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.920
That could be exactly

11
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.800
the behavior you want

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.010
but let's now explore

13
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.450
why we still might want

14
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.260
to tweak that behavior

15
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.890
in regards to certain aspects.

16
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.510
We have the entered name,

17
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.860
is valid state,

18
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.030
the entered name, value state

19
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.020
so to say

20
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.990
and the entered name, touch state

21
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.280
and still this behavior

22
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.410
isn't fully there

23
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.733
where I want it to be.

24
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.700
It's good that on submission

25
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.530
it now shows us this error

26
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.363
but for example,

27
00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:47.760
it doesn't show as an error

28
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.350
if I click in there,

29
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.050
maybe type something

30
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.430
but then remove everything

31
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.010
and click out of there.

32
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.920
We know that this is invalid

33
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.110
because an empty input is not allowed

34
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.540
but we only show the user

35
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.390
this error message

36
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.250
when submit is clicked

37
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.060
and that might be too late.

38
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.893
That might not be

39
00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:07.230
the best possible user experience.

40
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.280
I think it's better

41
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.330
to show the user this error

42
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.720
when the user had a chance

43
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.020
of working on this.

44
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.090
So if I click in there

45
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.170
and click out of there

46
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.570
and I leave it empty

47
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.130
I wanna see that error

48
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.380
that tells me that this

49
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.850
is then not allowed

50
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.505
because I had a chance of editing it,

51
00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:24.160
I didn't do that.

52
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.690
Now I should probably get that error

53
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.810
that tells me,

54
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.713
hey you need to enter something here.

55
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.790
So therefore we might want to also

56
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.430
validate on blur as it's called,

57
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.400
which means when the input loses focus

58
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.944
and that's not too difficult

59
00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.410
besides the on change handler

60
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.180
we can also add the on blur handler

61
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.770
and that's a built in event

62
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.341
which fires whenever

63
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.433
this input loses focus.

64
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.566
Hence we can add a new function here.

65
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:59.566
Let's say the name input blur handler

66
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.820
where we also get the default event

67
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.210
and then I wanna bind this

68
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.550
name input blur handler

69
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.113
to my input here.

70
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.730
Now in the name input blur handler,

71
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.460
I wanna do two things

72
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.160
for one, I wanna set

73
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.760
entered name touch to true

74
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.090
because if our input loses focus,

75
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.910
it definitely was touched.

76
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.140
The user had a chance of working on it

77
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.080
but in addition,

78
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.730
we might want to start validation here.

79
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.130
So we might wanna run this logic again

80
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.840
so we can copy this code here

81
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.170
and add that in the name

82
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.653
and put blur handler.

83
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.360
So did we check the entered name

84
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.193
which we update

85
00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:44.910
with every keystroke still

86
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.090
and we set entered name

87
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.490
is valid, false

88
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.750
if that name is invalid.

89
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.050
Now we do have code duplication here

90
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.330
and we'll take care about that

91
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.320
in a second

92
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.153
but for the moment

93
00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:57.640
let's take this approach here.

94
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.730
Let's duplicate the code.

95
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.780
It's fine for a second.

96
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.070
So now with that,

97
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.130
if I click in there

98
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.340
and click out of there,

99
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.270
I also get my warning here

100
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.230
which I would say

101
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.950
is a better user experience

102
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.940
but now we maybe want to

103
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.230
give the user a chance

104
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.790
of fixing this error

105
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.300
and if I now start typing here

106
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.170
it would be great

107
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.822
if this error disappears

108
00:03:19.822 --> 00:03:22.710
as soon as I entered a valid value.

109
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.620
So that I as a user know,

110
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.400
once I did reach a valid value,

111
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.210
once I can stop typing for example

112
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.750
and that's why we also

113
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.230
might want to validate

114
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.400
on every keystroke now

115
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.550
but only in combination with

116
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.130
the other validation steps

117
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.240
we integrated before

118
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.580
because just validating

119
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.170
on every keystroke alone

120
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.960
would probably not be good.

121
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.580
We would be (indistinct) errors

122
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.860
at users without them having a chance

123
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.260
of providing something valid first

124
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.970
but now that we do actually

125
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.500
allow the user to provide

126
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.050
a valid value first,

127
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.930
by listening to the lost focus

128
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.260
and the form submission.

129
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.790
Now that we're doing that,

130
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.250
we also wanna give the user

131
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.890
a chance of getting immediate feedback,

132
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.290
direct feedback on every keystroke

133
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.810
when it comes to fixing

134
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.200
that invalid value

135
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.050
so that's what we're going to do now.
