00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,650
Now in the last lecture,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,160
we learned about refs

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,250
and I showed you that

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,560
with refs you have an alternative way

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,560
of getting that user input of accessing those input fields.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,396
And I also showed you this

7
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:18,700
a little bit hacky approach of then

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,720
still manipulating the input fields and resetting them

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,323
if you want to do that.

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,490
Now, this approach of using refs

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,950
to interact with dom elements

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,290
specifically with input elements also has a special name.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,850
We're talking about uncontrolled components

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,740
if we access values with a ref.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,001
So these input components here,

16
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:48,160
would now be uncontrolled components.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,970
Why uncontrolled?

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,560
Because they're internal state,

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,410
so to value which is reflected in them

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,450
is not controlled by react.

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,150
We rely on the default behavior of the input

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,740
where a user of course is able to enter something

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,170
and that entered value is reflected.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,700
And we then just Fetch it, with a react feature

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,450
but we don't feed data back into the input.

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,600
When I set a new value to those inputs here

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,340
with this work around,

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,330
we're absolutely not using react here.

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,780
Sure we're using the ref,

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,613
but in the end we get access

31
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:26,750
to the native dom element with that

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,480
and I then just use the regular dom API

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,240
for setting the value of a dom node of a input dom node.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,440
So that's why this is uncontrolled

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,930
because we're not controlling these state

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,710
off the input element with react.

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,970
Now, you can talk about uncontrolled

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,600
and controlled components.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
All is in the context of other components,

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,016
but most commonly, we have this scenario

41
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:54,180
when we talk about input components

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,730
about form components in general,

43
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,067
because those components

44
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:03,067
tend to have some internal state natively by the browser,

45
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,920
an input element is configured

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,070
to take user input and save and reflect it.

47
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,987
And when we then work with those components in a react app,

48
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:14,420
we wanna connect our react state to that.

49
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,680
That's why we typically have

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,640
this controlled uncontrolled thing

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,130
when we work with input components in react.

52
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,200
And when we use refs, like we're doing it here,

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,550
we have uncontrolled input components.

54
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,290
The approach we had before,

55
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,880
where we manage our state

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,670
and we updated that state on every keystroke

57
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,120
and we feed that state back into the input

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,450
with the value prop,

59
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,400
so that approach we had before we added refs,

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,230
that would be the controlled approach.

61
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,410
Then we would say

62
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,490
that those input fields are controlled components

63
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,030
because their internal state is controlled by react.

64
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,970
These are simply important terms,

65
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,180
which you should keep in mind for potential interviews

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,130
or discussions with other react developers,

67
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,973
because they are typical terms you hear in the react world.
