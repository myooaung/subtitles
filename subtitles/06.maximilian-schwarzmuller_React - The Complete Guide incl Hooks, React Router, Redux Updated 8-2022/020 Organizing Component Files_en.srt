00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,050
So, now, in the last lecture we learned

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,960
about JSX and how it looks like under the hood,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,560
and why we therefore could add all these React imports

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,373
to all these files, which hold JSX code.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,890
Speaking of the files, let's talk about organizing them.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,030
Here, we only got a couple of components

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,030
and therefore we can store them like this,

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,710
but as your project grows and as you have more

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,980
and more components you might want

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,290
to organize them into sub folders

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,743
and not just throw them all into one components folder.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,020
And, indeed, that is something

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,040
we can already get started with.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,800
Here, we could argue that we have some general UI components

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,980
some general user interface elements,

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,340
which are not tied to a specific feature of the app.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,590
And then, we got some features specific components,

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,580
like these components, which are dealing

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,243
with rendering expenses and expense data.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,880
And, therefore, in the components sub folder,

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,630
we could create an Expenses sub folder,

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,630
and next to that a UI sub folder

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,513
for general user interface elements.

24
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,500
And we could move the card files

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,664
into the UI folder and the Expenses, ExpenseItem,

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,783
and ExpenseDate files into the Expenses folder.

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,630
Now, you just want to make sure

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,550
that you update all your imports like in Expenses.js,

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,410
where we import card, we now, first of all,

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,670
need to go up one level with two dots and then a slash

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,870
and then dive into the UI folder

32
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,503
and import card, the card file.

33
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,500
We need to go up one level because Expenses is now

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,770
in the Expenses folder, and we need to get

35
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,240
out of that folder into the next folder above it

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,380
to then dive into the UI folder, which is a sibling folder

37
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,233
to Expenses, to the Expenses folder, I mean.

38
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,580
We don't need to update the other imports

39
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,290
because these files are still in

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,062
the same folder as Expenses.js.

41
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,320
For ExpenseItem, we also need to update

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,270
the card import though, go up one level,

43
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,423
dive into the UI folder and then import card.

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,310
And in App.js, we no longer import Expenses

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,420
from components' Expenses, instead we dive into components

46
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,300
then into the Expenses folder

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,430
and there it's the Expenses file,

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,650
which you want to import from.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,490
So, now, we can adjust these imports.

50
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,323
And if you did that, this again, all works if you load it.

51
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,300
And we're really just doing this to organize our files,

52
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,400
and to keep our components organized,

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,460
and to make sure that they're not all in one big folder.

54
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,400
Ultimately, it's up to you how you want to organize them.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,280
And, of course you, should just organize them,

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,450
such that you and any team members you might be working

57
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,540
with are comfortable working with these files.

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,033
That's the most important thing which matters.
