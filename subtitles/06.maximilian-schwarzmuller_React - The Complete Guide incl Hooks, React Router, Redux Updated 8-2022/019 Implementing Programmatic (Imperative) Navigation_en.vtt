00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:03.540
[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] Now this demo application

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.960
is taking shape.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.450
Let's now take look at this, Add a Quote form.

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.330
Now we will later at the actual logic for adding a quote

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.950
for the moment, If we open the dev tools,

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.460
if I

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.220
enter some data here,

8
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.560
we just see it locked to the console because

9
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.053
that's all we're doing upon a form submission.

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.310
But let's imagine

11
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.290
that this actually would be sent to a server.

12
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.430
What would we typically expect from an application

13
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.520
from a website if we submitted a form.

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.880
We typically expect either some success message,

15
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.950
maybe a modal overlay, which opens up,

16
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.750
or we expect that we navigate somewhere else.

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.840
If I add a new quote

18
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.130
and that request was sent to the server,

19
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.740
I might expect

20
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.700
that I'm automatically navigated away from this page,

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.350
maybe to the All Quotes page.

22
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.370
And that is something which

23
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.623
I do wanna implement here as well.

24
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.150
Now for that of course,

25
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.930
we could convert our submit button here

26
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.810
in the QuoteForm to a link so

27
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.680
that it links to the All Quote page.

28
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.550
But actually here we don't want the link,

29
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.040
we want a button which submits the form.

30
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.180
So using a link is not an option here.

31
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.510
Instead, what we need here

32
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.090
is something called programmatic navigation.

33
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.000
We wanna trigger a navigation action

34
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.840
and navigate the user away programmatically

35
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.560
in our code.

36
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.900
So it's not a link which the user clicks to navigate away,

37
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.870
but it's some action triggered by our code,

38
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.500
when some abreaction sending the

39
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.023
entered data to a server finished.

40
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.510
And in the end we probably wanna trigger

41
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.660
this navigation action from inside,

42
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.550
the NewQuote page component here.

43
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.690
Because here we do have this addQuoteHandler

44
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.000
where we will later send the requests to the server,

45
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.070
and therefore it's here where we also want to navigate away.

46
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.560
But how can we now navigate programmatically?

47
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.483
How can we tell React Router that we wanna switch pages?

48
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.030
Well for this React Router again has a hook,

49
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910
which we can import.

50
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.890
So we can import from react-router-dom,

51
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.900
and we can import the useHistory hook.

52
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.610
The name might be a bit strange,

53
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.910
but it's named like this because it allows us

54
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.730
to change the browser history.

55
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.803
So the history of pages we visited.

56
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.000
We call useHistory like this,

57
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.770
and that gives us a history object,

58
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.020
which we can store in a constant.

59
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.640
And extend this history object,

60
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.770
which we can use

61
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.603
to

62
00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:52.860
trigger certain history changing actions.

63
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.520
And what changes the history of pages,

64
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.870
well, for example if we add a new page,

65
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.220
if we go to a new page.

66
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.800
And we can navigate around

67
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.970
with the push method here,

68
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.440
which pushes a new page on the stack of pages,

69
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.250
so a new page on our history of pages,

70
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.940
or we can navigate with the replace method

71
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.600
that replaces the current page.

72
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.850
The difference is that with push,

73
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.540
we can go back with the back button

74
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.350
to the page we're coming from,

75
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.650
with replace we can't.

76
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.000
So replace is like a redirect

77
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.660
where we changed occurred page, push adds a new page.

78
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.180
And it's up to you what you want.

79
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.580
Do you want to allow your user to go back or not

80
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.090
Here I'll go for push

81
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.500
and I will allow the user to go back,

82
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.930
and then here we could go to /quotes like this.

83
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.120
So now we will navigate away

84
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.830
if we send our data here

85
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.920
at the moment, of course,

86
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.123
we're only logging it to the console.

87
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.160
But with that if we now save this,

88
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.320
if I enter some

89
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.600
data here,

90
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.970
this is a test,

91
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.840
and I click Add Quote,

92
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.480
you see it's locked to the console,

93
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.140
but we're also navigated away.

94
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.490
And that is how we can implement programmatic navigation

95
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.133
with React Router.
