00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.820
Now in the last lecture, we talked about the timings,

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.480
now sometimes you want to execute certain code when the state of the animation finishes and not just

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.150
change what you render to the screen,

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.490
for that you get various callbacks, you can add functions you can execute to a transition,

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.450
I'll go back to the app.js file and do this on this transition component

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.430
we used to wrap this red block. We get six different events

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.870
we can listen to on this transition component,

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.520
the first one is onEnter and there, I'll simply execute a function where I console log onEnter so

9
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.610
that we can see when this happens,

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:54.550
the second one is onEntering so let's print onEntering. The third one is onEntered

11
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.370
and you might of course be able to guess when these methods are executed.

12
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:10.420
We also got onExit which should print onExit here and then you might be able to guess that, we got onExiting

13
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.520
so let's also print this to the log here and then we got onExited, like this.

14
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.070
Now these six different props can be bound to functions as I just did it here

15
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.980
and then you can run any kind of code you want and they execute in this order, onEnter is executed

16
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.940
right before we enter the entering mode, onEntering is then executed once we entered the entering mode

17
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.670
and onEntered is executed once we entered the entered mode,

18
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.180
well that's a lot of entering. Exit and so on behaves the same, onExit is used when we start the exiting

19
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.610
mode right before it to be precise, onExiting is then executed when we are in the exiting mode and exited

20
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.210
once we are in the exited mode. Let me save all of that and let's simply see it in the console log, if I

21
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.070
click toggle here for the red button, you see onEnter, onEntering and after this one second it takes,

22
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.600
onEntered and the same for removing, onExit, onExiting and onExited. This can be nice to create

23
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.150
staggered animations where you want to wait for one animation to finish before you start the next

24
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.900
one.

25
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.570
With these methods, you got all the control you need to find out what happened, what finished, what

26
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.370
started

27
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.200
and then time your animations based on that,

28
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.010
for example.
