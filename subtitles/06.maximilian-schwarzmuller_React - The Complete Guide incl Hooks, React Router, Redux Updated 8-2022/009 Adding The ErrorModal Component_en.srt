1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:05,490
So, we want such an error modal.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,720
Now a modal is simply does overlay box.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,730
And for me that's a UI element,

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,460
we could be using in different parts

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,570
of the app.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,200
This of course is a trivial app

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,170
that has only one part,

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,310
but we're always thinking

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,220
from the perspective

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,660
of potentially bigger apps.

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,860
Therefore I'll add it into UI folder

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,390
because such an error modal,

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,683
it could be a reusable UI element.

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,720
So I'll add my ErrorModal.js file in there.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,670
And in that file,

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,550
we of course import react from react.

17
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,316
We got our error modal here,

18
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,790
which got some props,

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,763
and we export this like that.

20
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,100
Now that's the first step.

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,780
Now the second step,

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,830
is of course to fill

23
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,020
that with some life.

24
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,350
And generally, it's totally up to you,

25
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,770
how you wanna structure your modal.

26
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,720
I actually want

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,580
to reuse that card,

28
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,653
so import card from,

29
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,380
card like this,

30
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,750
and use this as a wrapper

31
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,120
for the entire modal,

32
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,953
because I liked

33
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,000
that rounded corners,

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,833
look hands on,

35
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,090
I wanna use that therefore.

36
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,890
Now inside of that card,

37
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,280
my modal should have different sections.

38
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,030
I wanna have a header,

39
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,350
with the H two tag,

40
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,363
where we actually can output some title.

41
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,770
Now below that,

42
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,990
I wanna have a div,

43
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,560
which holds my main content.

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,860
And in there a paragraph

45
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,900
with DRR message,

46
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,210
I wanna display eventually.

47
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,973
And below that, a footer.

48
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,930
Now in that footer,

49
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,590
I wanna have a button which we can click

50
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,920
to close the modal.

51
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,300
So for that I'll import button

52
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,750
from that slash button

53
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,930
to all the reuse, this component.

54
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,230
And this, shows us this re-usability of components.

55
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,470
We're using the card,

56
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,190
in various places of the app.

57
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,450
We're using the button

58
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,000
in different places of the app.

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,500
And we only defined these components

60
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,980
and their styles once.

61
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,160
And we can build our entire UI

62
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,420
with these reusable building blocks.

63
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,910
That's really the heart

64
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,250
and the core idea

65
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,043
or one of the core ideas of react.

66
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,169
So, we got the button here,

67
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,310
and hence the footer.

68
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,110
We can add such a button

69
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,360
and say, okay,

70
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,180
or something like that on it.

71
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,550
So that this is our closed modal button in the end.

72
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,920
Now, between the H two tags here,

73
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,460
I wanna have some title.

74
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,293
And of course

75
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:28,890
that modal should be configurable from outside.

76
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,460
I don't wanna hard code, the title

77
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,550
and the message into this component.

78
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,530
It should also be reusable.

79
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,550
So that we can use it

80
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,120
in different places of the app,

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,253
to show different error messages.

82
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,120
Hence here, I, I'll put something dynamic,

83
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,500
between curly braces

84
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,123
and use, let's say props.title.

85
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,480
Again, it's your component.

86
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,830
You can use any prop name you want here,

87
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,000
but I expect to get a title prop,

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,836
which holds the text,

89
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,683
which should be output here.

90
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,130
Now between the paragraphs,

91
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,940
I want to output props.message.

92
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,800
So that we also expect a message prop which,

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,715
well, holds the message

94
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,215
that shouldn't be output here.

95
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,480
And I also want some styling.

96
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,313
For data attached

97
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:16,140
to find the errormodal.module.CSS file.

98
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,973
And you can, again,

99
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:19,810
just drag that into your UI folder next

100
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,680
to the error modal JS file,

101
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,550
and then import it here.

102
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,120
Import classes from ./ErrorModal.module.CSS.

103
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,670
Because I'm also using CSS modules here,

104
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,820
to have unique class names.

105
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,810
And there are a couple

106
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,910
of classes that should be attached.

107
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,280
For example here,

108
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
on the card itself,

109
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,593
I wanna add the classes.modal class.

110
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,650
Which is one of the classes

111
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,803
to find here in the CSS file.

112
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,390
In addition on the header,

113
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,163
I want to have the classes.header class.

114
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,360
And on that div

115
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,300
that's surrounds the paragraph,

116
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,423
I will add the classes.content class.

117
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,340
On the footer,

118
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,590
we'll also add a class,

119
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,840
and that's the classes.actions class.

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,829
And these are all CSS classes predefined

121
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,392
in that CSS file.

122
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,520
With that, we'll have a basic modal,

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,670
and we can already see

124
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,130
that in action.

125
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,963
The question is,

126
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:29,080
where do we wanna render it,

127
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,840
as part of which component?

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
And you can actually argue about that.

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,140
You can argue

130
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,200
that it should be rendered

131
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,790
inside of add user,

132
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,660
because ultimately it will be this component

133
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,930
that will trigger the modal.

134
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,390
You could also argue,

135
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,350
that it's a general overlay

136
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,030
over the entire UI

137
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,550
and therefore logically,

138
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,570
it should be rendered as high

139
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,020
as possible in the component tree.

140
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,980
Something like inside

141
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,980
of the app component

142
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,273
or anything like that.

143
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,560
Now, I will go for the place

144
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,100
where it actually is, being cost,

145
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,060
and that would be add user component,

146
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,310
but you can definitely also pick a different place.

147
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,440
You then of course, we'll need

148
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,060
to update your state management appropriately.

149
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,950
I will write state management code,

150
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,960
that ensures that it works here

151
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,763
inside of the add user component.

152
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,760
So here I wanna output my error modal,

153
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,920
and therefore, we have

154
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,350
to import it, of course.

155
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,540
So we go here,

156
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,410
and import error modal

157
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,323
from UI error modal.

158
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,780
Now we also need to configure it.

159
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,700
We need to set a title,

160
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,490
and we'll soon set this dynamically

161
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,250
but now I'll set it to,

162
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,280
an error occurred,

163
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,010
and the message which we can set

164
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,983
to, something went wrong.

165
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,140
But this will not work.

166
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,870
And do you know why?

167
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,600
I briefly touched on it

168
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,513
in the debugging section.

169
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,020
Well, if we try to save this,

170
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,200
we'll get an error.

171
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
We'll get the error

172
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,530
that we got adjacent JSX elements,

173
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,563
and that this is not allowed basically.

174
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,930
Indeed react doesn't allow,

175
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,123
two side by side components being rendered,

176
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,130
directly as a root element

177
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,545
of your return statement.

178
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,280
And you therefore need to wrap this,

179
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,730
for example, in an extra div.

180
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,000
We'll later see a different solution for this,

181
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,030
for now we'll just take extra div,

182
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,610
and put our error modal

183
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,060
and our card, into that div.

184
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,380
So that the div has returned

185
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,710
by the return statement.

186
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,310
And then inside of the div,

187
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,513
we can have adjacent elements.

188
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,810
And with that it compiles,

189
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,380
and if you reload,

190
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,080
hey, this doesn't look too bad.

191
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,383
We got our modal here.

192
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,610
Now, of course it's not dynamic.

193
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,770
Of course we can close it right now.

194
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,580
And of course, one crucial thing is missing,

195
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,520
and that's a backdrop for the modal.

196
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,810
So a overlay between this modal overlay

197
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,710
and the actual main page.

198
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,590
So to be calm,

199
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,760
to interact with the rest

200
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,680
of the main page,

201
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,590
which currently, is possible.

202
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,580
So, to make sure we can't interact

203
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,410
with the rest of the page,

204
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,140
back in the error modal,

205
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,560
I'll add an extra div,

206
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,400
next to the card, not inside of it,

207
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,900
but next to it, and therefore,

208
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
as we just learned,

209
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,460
we need a general div,

210
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,660
that wraps both,

211
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,600
that extra div

212
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,070
and the card.

213
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,540
And on that extra div,

214
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,880
I'll add a class

215
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,403
and that's the classes.backdrop class.

216
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,940
The device itself is empty

217
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,120
but this backdrop CSS class makes sure,

218
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,900
that we have this grayish,

219
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,523
black transparentish background behind the modal.

220
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,283
If we now save everything,

221
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:45,980
you can see the background here,

222
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,350
and now I can't interact

223
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,310
with the form anymore, for example.

224
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,493
So with that,

225
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:52,580
we've got the model in place.

226
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,070
Now, of course, the goal is

227
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,410
to show it only sometimes,

228
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,660
only if we do try

229
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,290
to submit invalid data.

230
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,703
And of course we wanna make sure

231
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:02,423
that we can also dismiss it.
