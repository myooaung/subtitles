00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.440
So, to output the favorites

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.480
on the my favorites page,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
we can go to this favorites page here, in the pages folder.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.890
And again, tap into our context here

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.610
because on this page we now in the end wanna get

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.800
all the favorites from the context.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.800
Now for this we can of course import useContext again

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.530
from

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.520
react

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.360
and also import the FavoritesContext object from

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.743
the store folder and there favorites context.

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.540
And then we connect to the context

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.600
just as we did it before

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.260
we create a constant which then stores this context object

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.420
and we call use context and past as context object

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.520
we created in that context file to use context.

17
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.530
And that gives us the current context snapshot then.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.980
Now we got our context here and that means that now

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.300
from that favorites context

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.453
we can get our favorites array.

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.480
So (indistinct) here, we can now return let's say a section

22
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.070
where we say in h1 tag

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.970
my favorites

24
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.930
and below that I wanna output a list of meetups.

25
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.300
A list of my favorite meetups.

26
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.240
For this we can recycle the meetup list component

27
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.610
because this component does not care

28
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.636
whether it's all meetups or a subset of the meetups.

29
00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:33.380
All it cares about

30
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.023
is that we output items that have these properties.

31
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.700
So we can import

32
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.680
meetup list from

33
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.210
the components folder meetups

34
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.270
meetup list

35
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.420
and then output that below the h1 tag.

36
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.653
Meetup list like this.

37
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.090
And set the meetups prop here

38
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.010
equal to favoritesCtx.favorites

39
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.173
because that is our array of favorites.

40
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.830
Now if we do that, on that favorites page we see

41
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.930
all the favorites we have.

42
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.480
The problem just is that if I remove a favorite

43
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.820
we don't see anything here

44
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.620
which makes sense because I currently have no favorites.

45
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.720
But we might wanna render some fallback message

46
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.780
for this case

47
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.740
And one way of doing this is

48
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.070
that we define a little helper variable here content

49
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.430
and we then check if favorites context total favorites

50
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.733
is equal to zero.

51
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360
TotalFavorites is a never property

52
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.453
we're managing in our context.

53
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.470
And if that is zero, we know we have no favorites.

54
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.450
Then all set content equal to let's say a paragraph

55
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.190
where I simply say you got no favorites

56
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.023
yet.

57
00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:01.737
Start adding some ?

58
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.510
Else if we do have favorites

59
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.500
I set content equal to

60
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.830
my meetup list here.

61
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.960
So in the end to, this line of code.

62
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.760
And this might look strange

63
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.040
storing HTML elements in variables

64
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.010
but it's actually not strange than returning HTML elements.

65
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.880
You can use JSX code anywhere, where a value is needed.

66
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.600
We saw it in arrays

67
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.730
in return statements you can also store JSX in variables.

68
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.380
That is totally fine.

69
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.410
And now we can simply output the value

70
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.570
of that content variable in our returned JSX code

71
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.280
to then have different values here

72
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.833
depending on whether we have favorites or not.

73
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.010
We now save this.

74
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.330
I got no favorites yet here

75
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.120
but if I add an item as a favorite, I see that instead.

76
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.260
And if I remove it, we're back to this (indistinct) text.

77
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.270
So this works.

78
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.920
One important note though,

79
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.790
if I add an item to my favorites and I then reload the page

80
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.500
it will be lost.

81
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.290
The reason for this is that our context

82
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.690
is only stored in memory.

83
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.430
Because we're only working with state

84
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.270
and with constants here, it's not stored permanently.

85
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.930
If you would want to store it permanently

86
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.560
you would need to use some browsers storage here

87
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.900
in the favorites context provider

88
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.460
like local storage, for example,

89
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.840
or store it on a server as well.

90
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.740
I'm not doing that here because I wanna focus on this

91
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.580
core feature of react context

92
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.750
but that is something you could add

93
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.360
if you wanna enhance this application.

94
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.170
For the moment it's simply some temporary storage

95
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.130
which survives as long as we are on this page

96
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.580
but if we ever reload or leave the page

97
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.070
our favorites will be lost.

98
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.300
Our meetups won't because those are stored on a server.

99
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.400
It's just something that is worth knowing.

100
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.690
And now with that, that's almost it.

101
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.960
As a last step I now just wanna make sure that

102
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.170
in the main navigation we also see a batch

103
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.670
next to the my favorites text

104
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.880
that indicates how many favorites we currently have.

105
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.640
And that simply means that in the main navigation JS file

106
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.590
we also wanna connect to context and get values from there.

107
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.590
So I'll again import use context here, from react

108
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.400
and import my context object

109
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.540
the favorites context from going up

110
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.610
going up store favorites context

111
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.117
and in main navigation we then get the favorites context

112
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.440
by using, use context, and connecting that to

113
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.093
the favorites context.

114
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.970
And then here on the favorites link

115
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.460
we can simply add a little extra span

116
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.410
next to this my favorites text

117
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.560
in which we output

118
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.810
favoritesCtx.totalFavorites

119
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.780
because that is a number

120
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.310
managed in our context

121
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.203
with the total number of meetup items in our array.

122
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.560
And I'll give this span a class of classes.badge.

123
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.830
Which is one of the classes prepared in this CSS file

124
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.343
I gave to you earlier.

125
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.740
And with this, we now have this badge here.

126
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.320
And if we add items to the context

127
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.860
that badge does update.

128
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.233
And also if we remove items of course.
