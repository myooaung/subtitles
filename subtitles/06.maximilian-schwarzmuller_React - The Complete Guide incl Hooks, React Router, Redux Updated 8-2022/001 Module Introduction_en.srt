1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,770
Now, this course section is an optional one.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,920
This course section will be a refresher on ReactJS,

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,570
and you can skip it if you already have

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,200
a solid ReactJS foundation,

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,920
for example because you took

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,050
my React - The Complete Guide course.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,730
In this module,

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,270
I'm going to make sure we're all on the same page

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,580
by again exploring what exactly React is and why we use it,

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,729
by diving into some Core React Concepts:

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,550
Components, Props, and State.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,940
And we're going to build a full project

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,223
and explore some advanced concepts like Effects and Context.

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,640
Now, we're going to use functional components only, here.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,440
We're going to use React Hooks,

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,800
and you're going to learn what that is in this module.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,180
And we're going to use these concepts

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,820
throughout the rest of this course.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,150
So don't skip this module,

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,320
if you don't know these concepts yet,

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,150
or if you're not sure about them,

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,760
if it's been some time since you last worked with React.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,350
But absolutely do feel free to skip this module,

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,180
if you do know these concepts,

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,870
because you won't learn anything about NextJS here.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,960
It's really just about React.

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,470
And we're going to start with NextJS,

28
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,263
and its Core Concepts in the section after this section.
