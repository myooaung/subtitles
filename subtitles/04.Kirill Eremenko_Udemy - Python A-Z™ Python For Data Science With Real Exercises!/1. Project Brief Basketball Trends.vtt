00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:10.200
Hello and welcome back to the course in Python programming today we've got a super exciting challenge

2

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:10.830
ahead of us.

3

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:13.470
We're talking about basketball trends.

4

00:00:13.620  -->  00:00:16.240
Yes we're going to have a very interesting data set.

5

00:00:16.250  -->  00:00:21.960
And at the same time we're going to learn a lot about Python we're going to learn about matrices while

6

00:00:22.200  -->  00:00:25.800
getting our hands dirty with this real life and data set.

7

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:27.630
All right so let's get to it.

8

00:00:27.630  -->  00:00:30.940
Basketball Trends Project brief what do we have here.

9

00:00:30.990  -->  00:00:36.660
Well first of all for those of you who don't know what the NBA is I understand a lot of you guys know

10

00:00:36.660  -->  00:00:40.230
what the NBA is but still we have students from all over the world.

11

00:00:40.260  -->  00:00:47.550
So the NBA is the National Basketball Association in America and that is the main basketball league

12

00:00:47.550  -->  00:00:51.360
and most of the players that you've heard of like are Michael Jordan.

13

00:00:51.360  -->  00:00:53.970
They play and played in the NBA.

14

00:00:53.970  -->  00:00:57.420
So we're going to be analyzing the NBA players.

15

00:00:57.450  -->  00:00:57.770
All right.

16

00:00:57.780  -->  00:00:58.840
What are we going to do here.

17

00:00:59.010  -->  00:01:03.530
Well we're going to take the top ten paid players right now.

18

00:01:03.590  -->  00:01:08.220
There they are on your screen the highest paid players of the 2015 2016 season.

19

00:01:08.220  -->  00:01:08.960
And there they are.

20

00:01:08.970  -->  00:01:09.820
Their salaries.

21

00:01:09.840  -->  00:01:15.320
This is all publicly available information and we're going to take all of these 10 players and we're

22

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:20.490
going to analyze how have they been playing over the past 10 years.

23

00:01:20.490  -->  00:01:24.930
Imagine that we're going to take data for the past 10 years and we're going to look at how they've been

24

00:01:25.170  -->  00:01:27.330
playing in those years.

25

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:35.310
So your goal for this challenge is to simply investigate trends and patterns that you see in their performance

26

00:01:35.310  -->  00:01:39.690
over the past 10 years because ultimately they haven't always been the top 10 player.

27

00:01:39.700  -->  00:01:41.160
Right let's see how they got there.

28

00:01:41.160  -->  00:01:47.250
Let's see how they have been improving and what's been changing about their game and so on and don't

29

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:50.290
worry if you don't know anything about basketball.

30

00:01:50.490  -->  00:01:52.310
I was in a very similar situation.

31

00:01:52.350  -->  00:01:55.400
But you will literally understand everything as we go through.

32

00:01:55.410  -->  00:02:00.360
I will make sure to cover off all of the basic knowledge it will need and we will have heaps of fun

33

00:02:00.360  -->  00:02:00.600
.

34

00:02:00.630  -->  00:02:04.370
So let's quickly have a look at the stats that we'll be analyzing here.

35

00:02:04.380  -->  00:02:10.920
We've got stats for one of the players and basketball fans can you guess who this player is.

36

00:02:10.920  -->  00:02:15.190
And here you can see this player stats for his full professional career.

37

00:02:15.420  -->  00:02:17.640
And what I have outlined in red.

38

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:19.730
Other states will be looking at.

39

00:02:19.740  -->  00:02:23.580
All right so going from left to right here we've got the years that we'll be looking at.

40

00:02:23.580  -->  00:02:31.560
2005 2006 is the first season and 2014 15 is a final season we'll be looking at why aren't we looking

41

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:34.190
at the current 2015 16 season.

42

00:02:34.350  -->  00:02:38.930
Well that is because at the time of making this video the season isn't yet finished.

43

00:02:39.030  -->  00:02:42.190
So I didn't want to look at Dora that's for an incomplete season.

44

00:02:42.300  -->  00:02:47.760
If you're a hardcore basketball fan you want to have the most up to date data and when you're watching

45

00:02:47.760  -->  00:02:49.530
this video the season is finished.

46

00:02:49.590  -->  00:02:54.540
Then feel free after we finished this section you can go back and just modify the data and by then you

47

00:02:54.540  -->  00:02:55.940
will know how to do that.

48

00:02:56.070  -->  00:03:01.370
And then you can just be updated and perform the same analysis or whatever analysis you may wish to

49

00:03:01.380  -->  00:03:06.250
with the new data it's all possible after this section you will know how to do it.

50

00:03:06.270  -->  00:03:06.560
All right.

51

00:03:06.570  -->  00:03:09.730
So then we'll be looking at this column.

52

00:03:09.810  -->  00:03:14.100
This is the total games played by this player in each of those seasons.

53

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:20.790
Then here we've got an mpg which stands for minutes per game and we won't be looking at minutes per

54

00:03:20.790  -->  00:03:21.210
game.

55

00:03:21.210  -->  00:03:27.120
That's one of the tables that we'll derive will actually have an input table of the total minutes that

56

00:03:27.120  -->  00:03:29.850
player played in that whole season.

57

00:03:29.850  -->  00:03:32.130
And then here we've got F.G. percentage.

58

00:03:32.130  -->  00:03:35.100
I know this all looks complicated but it really isn't so.

59

00:03:35.280  -->  00:03:42.470
5G stands for field goal so how many basketballs did that person throw into the hoop jeering the game

60

00:03:42.460  -->  00:03:42.520
.

61

00:03:42.520  -->  00:03:47.160
So not when they get penalties but actually while they're playing so either two points or three points

62

00:03:47.760  -->  00:03:49.410
what does the accuracy of that player.

63

00:03:49.410  -->  00:03:52.280
Once again we won't be looking at this exact table.

64

00:03:52.290  -->  00:03:56.050
This is one of the tables we'll derive and that is part of our challenge.

65

00:03:56.130  -->  00:04:02.910
We will have a table on the actual number of field goals and we will have a table on the number of field

66

00:04:02.940  -->  00:04:03.780
goal attempt.

67

00:04:03.780  -->  00:04:07.940
So basically if you divide one number by the other then you'll get this percentage.

68

00:04:07.950  -->  00:04:12.160
And finally here we've got the points per game.

69

00:04:12.180  -->  00:04:18.880
Once again this is the number of points that a player has scored in that whole seasons per game.

70

00:04:18.900  -->  00:04:25.490
But we will have a table of the total number of points that person has scored in that season.

71

00:04:25.500  -->  00:04:28.200
So there we go we'll have lots of input data.

72

00:04:28.200  -->  00:04:33.840
You will see this going to be quite a lot of it is going to be enormous compared to what we've seen

73

00:04:34.140  -->  00:04:36.200
before but nevertheless we'll play through it.

74

00:04:36.210  -->  00:04:38.650
And this is a one of the beauties of this section.

75

00:04:38.670  -->  00:04:44.850
Now we're ready to jump into the world of our end analysis and Dadda because we've done all the foundations

76

00:04:44.850  -->  00:04:46.790
of programming fundamentals of our.

77

00:04:46.890  -->  00:04:53.250
But we will have a table of the total number of points that person has scored in that season.

78

00:04:53.430  -->  00:04:58.530
All right so that's what we're doing and that's what we're analyzing is already pretty exciting and

79

00:04:58.530  -->  00:05:04.380
finally we're at that stage where we can apply the knowledge that we've gained so far in the course

80

00:05:04.380  -->  00:05:08.580
to some real world Dawna's some real world fun and analytics.

81

00:05:08.790  -->  00:05:09.120
All right.

82

00:05:09.120  -->  00:05:11.680
So the question is where do we get this data set.

83

00:05:11.820  -->  00:05:20.940
Well let me show you exit the presentation and if we go to as usual to w w w dot superdog a science

84

00:05:20.940  -->  00:05:27.900
dot com slash python then if you scroll down here in Section for matrices you'll find the basketball

85

00:05:27.900  -->  00:05:28.700
data set.

86

00:05:28.860  -->  00:05:30.240
So go ahead and download that.

87

00:05:30.240  -->  00:05:33.200
You'll see that it's a simple doc X-File.

88

00:05:33.430  -->  00:05:39.920
If you don't have Microsoft Office or you can open doc X Files for some reason just download this Boscobel

89

00:05:39.930  -->  00:05:42.220
data set a plain text file.

90

00:05:42.300  -->  00:05:45.040
It has exactly the same text inside it.

91

00:05:45.240  -->  00:05:48.080
All right so this is what the file looks like inside.

92

00:05:48.150  -->  00:05:51.180
It's quite large it's got four pages of code.

93

00:05:51.210  -->  00:05:57.240
Yes so much code and all you have to do is simply select all of this code.

94

00:05:57.330  -->  00:06:04.220
So press comment a on a macro Quantrell on Windows and copy it just copy all this code and then go to

95

00:06:04.230  -->  00:06:09.590
your notebooks and paste all of that code into one single cell.

96

00:06:09.900  -->  00:06:13.770
That's what it will look like if it looks like this then you're doing the right thing and it's got some

97

00:06:13.770  -->  00:06:17.960
instructions at the top here basically welcome to the world of basketball data.

98

00:06:17.970  -->  00:06:24.180
I'm sure you will enjoy this section of the Python programming course and definitely I'm sure you will

99

00:06:24.180  -->  00:06:24.630
enjoy it.

100

00:06:24.630  -->  00:06:30.450
We've got some very interesting things coming up and here it's got instructions which you'll create

101

00:06:30.450  -->  00:06:32.320
and how this data set works.

102

00:06:32.340  -->  00:06:35.230
Basically all you have to do is now just run the cells.

103

00:06:35.250  -->  00:06:37.800
I'm going to press shift enter and there we go.

104

00:06:37.800  -->  00:06:40.960
I've run this cell and just check that everything is fine.

105

00:06:40.980  -->  00:06:48.030
Let's type in the following word which is going to look at salaries or just type and salary and run

106

00:06:48.030  -->  00:06:52.670
that as you can see what happens is a something has been printed out.

107

00:06:52.680  -->  00:06:59.190
Well the something is actually matrix and if we do print salary it should print in a bit of a better

108

00:06:59.190  -->  00:07:00.270
format.

109

00:07:00.270  -->  00:07:03.790
Nevertheless this is our matrix for salaries.

110

00:07:03.870  -->  00:07:10.110
We won't go into detail right now about what it is and how it works because naturally we haven't yet

111

00:07:10.200  -->  00:07:15.000
understood anything about matrices we haven't learned how to deal with him or how to work with him but

112

00:07:15.030  -->  00:07:21.180
don't worry that is the purpose of this section to understand how to work with matrices in Peifer.

113

00:07:21.180  -->  00:07:26.340
In fact I'm actually going to zoom in a little bit so you can see well so there you go that's that's

114

00:07:26.340  -->  00:07:27.690
how Matrix over there.

115

00:07:27.900  -->  00:07:29.130
And that's the code.

116

00:07:29.310  -->  00:07:35.610
And so the purpose of this section is to learn how to work with matrices and learn all the ins and outs

117

00:07:35.700  -->  00:07:39.870
and at the same time analyze this data set and have some fun along the way.

118

00:07:39.960  -->  00:07:46.350
And the reason why we're loading the data into our Gibara notebook and this way is because we haven't

119

00:07:46.350  -->  00:07:52.950
yet learned how to import data from a CSP file and it's a bit early for us we'll learn that further

120

00:07:52.950  -->  00:07:53.830
down in the course.

121

00:07:53.880  -->  00:07:58.890
For now this method will suffice because in this section we want to focus on learning about matrices

122

00:07:58.890  -->  00:07:59.260
.

123

00:07:59.310  -->  00:08:02.100
So I'm super excited to get out of this section.

124

00:08:02.100  -->  00:08:08.730
Go ahead and download the file and import the data into your Jupiter notebook and I'll see you on the

125

00:08:08.730  -->  00:08:09.660
first tutorial.

126

00:08:09.660  -->  00:08:11.280
Until then happy coding
