00:00:03.900  -->  00:00:05.570
Learn.

2

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:08.170
Welcome back to the course on Python programming.

3

00:00:08.190  -->  00:00:14.340
Today we're finally completed the section on insulation and we're going to recap on what we learned

4

00:00:14.350  -->  00:00:14.530
.

5

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:15.950
Let's get started.

6

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:20.260
In this section we learned number one category data type in Python.

7

00:00:20.400  -->  00:00:26.010
As you recall it was very important for us to separate numeric daughter just even in our minds to separate

8

00:00:26.010  -->  00:00:33.960
numeric data from categorical daughter and a great example of that was the year column which was originally

9

00:00:34.320  -->  00:00:38.420
discovered by Python as a numeric column.

10

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:44.280
But we actually changed it to a category column because we didn't really need to work with the years

11

00:00:44.370  -->  00:00:48.100
as numeric so we didn't need to connect your medic operations with them.

12

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:52.460
For us they were more of a classification type of data data elements.

13

00:00:52.470  -->  00:00:58.200
So always it's always good to remember about these things whether your daughter is or your specific

14

00:00:58.220  -->  00:01:02.680
column is a numeric home or it should be a categorical call.

15

00:01:03.080  -->  00:01:08.580
And we started looking at different types of plots we talked about joint plots and we looked at the

16

00:01:08.580  -->  00:01:12.360
next step or plot specifically that we talked about histograms.

17

00:01:12.360  -->  00:01:19.860
Then we talked about stacked histograms and in the stacked histograms we actually had to perform quite

18

00:01:19.860  -->  00:01:26.430
a bit of coding or some very creative coding in order to get the result that we wanted to create that

19

00:01:26.430  -->  00:01:31.320
list that we passed to the highest function in order to create the solution.

20

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:36.270
So that was a very interesting Tauriel quite a bit of a challenge but we nevertheless powered through

21

00:01:36.270  -->  00:01:39.140
it and create that beautiful visualization.

22

00:01:39.240  -->  00:01:45.390
Then we looked at the Kaytee plot which probably something new because they do have their audience but

23

00:01:45.480  -->  00:01:51.510
not always their use so if it was something new for you then that's totally fine and the Katie blood

24

00:01:51.510  -->  00:01:55.220
was something that we used more throughout this section as well.

25

00:01:55.230  -->  00:02:03.750
They really learn about using the subplots function to create layouts or to create multiple Plaza figure

26

00:02:03.750  -->  00:02:09.360
including multiple plots that was quite a useful tutorial and then we returned to the subplots function

27

00:02:09.360  -->  00:02:11.790
at the end when we're talking about dashboards.

28

00:02:11.860  -->  00:02:17.100
Then we talked about Bollen plots and compared them to box plots and saw how they convey the same insides

29

00:02:17.130  -->  00:02:22.560
but in different ways and when what are the advantages and disadvantages of each and when you would

30

00:02:22.560  -->  00:02:24.930
use either of those approaches.

31

00:02:25.020  -->  00:02:30.530
We talked about creating a facet grid and how to use that effectively to convey insights.

32

00:02:30.540  -->  00:02:33.300
Then we looked at changing coordinates.

33

00:02:33.360  -->  00:02:40.500
So zooming into the Fassett grid into areas so that we wouldn't have the x axis between minus 20 to

34

00:02:40.510  -->  00:02:46.320
160 or to something else we had it only we changed it to 0 to 100 and so on.

35

00:02:46.320  -->  00:02:47.860
So just to tidy things up.

36

00:02:47.880  -->  00:02:54.270
We also talked about adding lines onto our charts and specifically on top Fassett grid and that had

37

00:02:54.270  -->  00:02:56.620
to be done through a loop as you remember.

38

00:02:56.730  -->  00:03:03.260
And that's another illustration of the difference between Python and are that in our we would use loops

39

00:03:03.280  -->  00:03:11.670
very very rarely whereas in python we have to use them quite regularly because I think it's not a vectorized

40

00:03:11.670  -->  00:03:13.850
programming language unlike our.

41

00:03:14.070  -->  00:03:20.070
So they're they're both great and there are advantages to either too each one is just good to know these

42

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:24.540
differences and remember them and that's why I've been trying to point them out as we go through and

43

00:03:24.740  -->  00:03:25.110
.

44

00:03:25.300  -->  00:03:27.430
Then we talked about building dashboards.

45

00:03:27.570  -->  00:03:33.150
Yes this was quite a big section and as you can see we're already up to point 10 were we talked about

46

00:03:33.180  -->  00:03:39.650
building and dashboards and that was a valuable tool in our arsenal so we learnt how to create dashboard

47

00:03:39.660  -->  00:03:40.490
two by two.

48

00:03:40.500  -->  00:03:46.050
And in fact that same approach can be used to create dashboards with any number of plots and you can

49

00:03:46.050  -->  00:03:51.930
even overlay plots on top of each other in those individual segments of the dashboards.

50

00:03:51.960  -->  00:03:56.460
Then we had a tutorial with styling tips and we actually Saldo dashboard.

51

00:03:56.460  -->  00:03:59.040
I'm still very happy how it turned out.

52

00:03:59.070  -->  00:04:05.280
The dashboard looked very very professional and very kind of futuristic with that black background so

53

00:04:05.610  -->  00:04:11.370
that was very exciting to do and hopefully you'll have some time to practice that and look at different

54

00:04:11.550  -->  00:04:15.570
color maps that are available in Python and see which ones you like the most.

55

00:04:15.570  -->  00:04:21.490
And finally we talked about some finishing touches so how to add some thematics to your charts.

56

00:04:21.630  -->  00:04:29.160
And specifically we talked about how to add a title How to add access labels how to change access tick

57

00:04:29.160  -->  00:04:37.550
fonts and sizes and how to change your legend size and how to change the background of each.

58

00:04:37.560  -->  00:04:43.560
So quite a few things were covered there and that was a tutorial to aggregate those bits or scattered

59

00:04:43.560  -->  00:04:47.770
bits of information that you would otherwise have to look for on the Internet.

60

00:04:47.820  -->  00:04:51.220
So hopefully that will save you some time as well.

61

00:04:51.630  -->  00:04:52.080
There we go.

62

00:04:52.080  -->  00:04:54.830
Hope you enjoyed this section of the course.

63

00:04:54.840  -->  00:05:00.680
There is so much more to seaborne there's so much more all in Python and we could go on forever.

64

00:05:00.780  -->  00:05:07.050
But these tutorials do cover off the main basics of Weasel's of Pipelet and Brazil's ocean of seaborne

65

00:05:07.050  -->  00:05:07.320
.

66

00:05:07.320  -->  00:05:12.900
So from here whichever way you like to go you definitely can proceed and pick up new skills as you go

67

00:05:12.960  -->  00:05:13.860
along the way.

68

00:05:13.890  -->  00:05:20.700
I wish you the best of luck with all zation as law as well as with other aspects of coding in Python

69

00:05:20.710  -->  00:05:20.840
.

70

00:05:21.000  -->  00:05:25.200
And if you ever have any difficulties or challenges you can always come back to the course and review

71

00:05:25.200  -->  00:05:29.600
the tutorials that will help you and guide you through those challenges.

72

00:05:29.850  -->  00:05:31.130
Oakford see you next time.

73

00:05:31.140  -->  00:05:32.520
And until then Heppy coding
