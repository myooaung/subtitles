00:00:03,970  -->  00:00:05,530
Hello.

2

00:00:05,940  -->  00:00:09,630
Welcome back to the course in Python programming I hope you enjoyed the previous couple of tutorials

3

00:00:09,630  -->  00:00:09,830
.

4

00:00:09,840  -->  00:00:15,730
We definitely looked at some very interesting styling techniques for dashboards.

5

00:00:15,720  -->  00:00:18,290
We went from a dashboard that looked like this.

6

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:22,940
First of all we created a dashboard that looked like this which is great step already.

7

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:28,850
And then we moved on to a dashboard that looks like this so we learn how to style our dashboards.

8

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:36,050
And it's definitely a very powerful skill to have with styling and with visualization.

9

00:00:36,180  -->  00:00:41,790
Just like with any concept in Python you can keep going on and on and on forever you can always learn

10

00:00:41,790  -->  00:00:47,940
new things along the way and that's kind of the idea behind this course that we cover all of the fundamentals

11

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:50,580
all of the absolutely necessary techniques.

12

00:00:50,580  -->  00:00:56,560
And then when you need something you'll be able to quickly learn it adapt it on the fly pick it up from

13

00:00:56,560  -->  00:00:56,840
it.

14

00:00:56,940  -->  00:01:03,390
In practice while you are applying those techniques so it's it's always a good idea to be open minded

15

00:01:03,390  -->  00:01:05,050
to look hard for new techniques.

16

00:01:05,220  -->  00:01:12,330
And having said that I would still like to throw in a few more techniques just so that you are even

17

00:01:12,330  -->  00:01:14,110
more comfortable with visualizations.

18

00:01:14,130  -->  00:01:19,290
So as mentioned we can keep going forever with the different types of turkeys but it would still be

19

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:25,490
beneficial to cover off I think that I would be very happy if you pick these couple of techniques germane

20

00:01:25,540  -->  00:01:30,330
to kill yourself from this course and took them away with you because it will save you some time searching

21

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:31,350
for them in the future.

22

00:01:31,350  -->  00:01:35,460
So that's hence that's why we have this tutorial another tutorial on missiles.

23

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:37,290
All right so what are we going to be talking about.

24

00:01:37,290  -->  00:01:42,610
Well today we're going to be talking about modifying some thematic of that realization and in fact we

25

00:01:42,610  -->  00:01:47,250
are going to not going to keep working with this dashboard any more we'll just go back to one of the

26

00:01:47,250  -->  00:01:51,890
tools that we had previously because it doesn't really matter which one we take as an example.

27

00:01:51,930  -->  00:01:57,540
We're going to work on this one so this is a powerful resolution but at the same time it can be visually

28

00:01:57,540  -->  00:02:02,730
improved so it can look much better than it is than it looks now and that's what we're going to work

29

00:02:02,730  -->  00:02:08,970
on so we're going to work on adding a title we're going to work on changing the Xs font size adding

30

00:02:08,970  -->  00:02:15,510
an Access title here Access title here working with the legend making it more visible changing the color

31

00:02:15,510  -->  00:02:20,580
so all those things are going to discuss today and those are all kind of semantical edits so we already

32

00:02:20,580  -->  00:02:25,830
have the data on this chart is really telling us a story but at the same time if we want to include

33

00:02:25,830  -->  00:02:31,710
a chart like this in the final report then it definitely should look better and sooner or later if you're

34

00:02:31,710  -->  00:02:39,000
going to be working fine and you'll find yourself needing to find ways of changing these things that

35

00:02:39,010  -->  00:02:45,690
we talked about them takes the labels and titles of the chart so it's just better to put all of it in

36

00:02:45,690  -->  00:02:48,570
this one tutorial so that you can save some time.

37

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:50,070
So we're excited about that.

38

00:02:50,070  -->  00:02:56,520
Let's get started so I'm going to actually copy this whole chart and I'm going to put it over here.

39

00:02:56,520  -->  00:03:02,960
So first let's make this a marker and then let's zoom in of course to 200.

40

00:03:03,420  -->  00:03:09,170
And here will say this is going to be thematic edits.

41

00:03:09,170  -->  00:03:09,660
There you go.

42

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:10,950
So you get a second.

43

00:03:10,980  -->  00:03:11,430
There it is.

44

00:03:11,430  -->  00:03:12,720
So there's our chart.

45

00:03:12,900  -->  00:03:14,490
What can we do about it.

46

00:03:14,490  -->  00:03:16,830
How can we improve its position.

47

00:03:16,860  -->  00:03:19,050
So obviously we're not going to be working with this.

48

00:03:19,050  -->  00:03:21,110
This is the way we create the chart.

49

00:03:21,120  -->  00:03:23,960
And that's a bit of coding exercise that we had.

50

00:03:24,120  -->  00:03:26,450
How can we now improve this chart itself.

51

00:03:26,610  -->  00:03:31,200
So first of all where we can start with is the style of the grid.

52

00:03:31,200  -->  00:03:37,710
So if I say yes and has not said underscore style and don't forget that actually let me and let me type

53

00:03:37,710  -->  00:03:44,670
this out first so let's say we want dark and we run that so you can see that even though we're not using

54

00:03:44,670  -->  00:03:50,630
seaborne to create this char we're using just the Pipelet package and the histogram function from there

55

00:03:50,630  -->  00:03:50,820
.

56

00:03:50,940  -->  00:03:58,140
Seaborn is still affecting the chart so that is why sometimes I say that seaborne is an add on on top

57

00:03:58,140  -->  00:04:03,880
of pipelined because it even affects styles of non-C born exaltations.

58

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:08,390
So in this case what we actually want is we want white grid.

59

00:04:08,580  -->  00:04:08,850
All right.

60

00:04:08,850  -->  00:04:11,540
That just makes it look neater and cleaner.

61

00:04:11,790  -->  00:04:17,340
The next thing that we would like to do is to change the size of this chart and I want to show you a

62

00:04:17,340  -->  00:04:19,690
very useful hack here.

63

00:04:19,740  -->  00:04:26,310
There is a convenient way of changing charts sizes which can be applicable to many many different charts

64

00:04:26,310  -->  00:04:28,860
or many different graphs that you might be creating.

65

00:04:28,860  -->  00:04:34,110
So we really learned that you can sometimes you can specify certain parameter inside the function to

66

00:04:34,110  -->  00:04:39,980
change the size but the key is to actually to create a subplots like we have here.

67

00:04:39,990  -->  00:04:42,030
But we've only one item.

68

00:04:42,030  -->  00:04:51,530
So what we do is would say it say instead of a fig and then don't say X equals fealty to subplots and

69

00:04:51,530  -->  00:04:56,630
we won't specify any parameters of what that will do is it'll create a subplot with one just the one

70

00:04:56,620  -->  00:04:58,520
item so I'm just going to delete this for a second.

71

00:04:58,550  -->  00:05:03,600
If I run this you'll see that we've got the subplots So they've got a plot of one subplot in it.

72

00:05:03,860  -->  00:05:10,450
And now as you remember if we just plot something it'll always go into the last box or the last space

73

00:05:10,460  -->  00:05:14,740
in the subplots like we had previously when we didn't specify where something should go.

74

00:05:14,730  -->  00:05:16,690
It would always go in the last box or here.

75

00:05:16,880  -->  00:05:21,160
So here if we just plot this now it will go into that subplot.

76

00:05:21,350  -->  00:05:28,580
So even though you might not notice it here this chart has been created inside this figure which consists

77

00:05:28,580  -->  00:05:30,440
of one subplot.

78

00:05:30,440  -->  00:05:31,530
I know it's a bit tricky but.

79

00:05:31,550  -->  00:05:34,170
And so why are we doing this what's the whole point of this Carol.

80

00:05:34,280  -->  00:05:40,250
Well that is because now we can easily change the size of this figure because we know how to deal with

81

00:05:40,250  -->  00:05:44,190
them so we can just say fig Daut and say sets.

82

00:05:44,300  -->  00:05:49,870
So in this case we'll set the size in inches so set size inches.

83

00:05:50,330  -->  00:05:51,920
And here you can specify how many inches.

84

00:05:51,920  -->  00:05:58,390
So for instance if you specify eleven point seven and eight point two twenty seven that's going to be

85

00:05:58,460  -->  00:06:00,750
the size of a four paper.

86

00:06:01,070  -->  00:06:05,720
So if you're on this you'll see that we've changed the size you can definitely make it even larger than

87

00:06:05,720  -->  00:06:07,070
natural and smaller.

88

00:06:07,160  -->  00:06:12,610
For us it's already pretty large so in here I'm actually going to get rid of the header and the toolbar

89

00:06:12,620  -->  00:06:14,730
so we have some more space so you can see it.

90

00:06:14,740  -->  00:06:22,070
Now we're controlling the size of a weasel zation by controlling the size of the figure of subplots

91

00:06:22,070  -->  00:06:22,490
.

92

00:06:22,510  -->  00:06:25,760
It's a pretty handy trick to do it that way.

93

00:06:26,060  -->  00:06:27,650
All right so there is opposition.

94

00:06:27,660  -->  00:06:30,280
Now what else can we do it how can we improve it.

95

00:06:30,290  -->  00:06:36,200
Well first thing that pops to mind is that we don't have a title we don't have a title of this nation

96

00:06:36,200  -->  00:06:36,280
.

97

00:06:36,290  -->  00:06:38,740
We don't know what like we know what it's talking about.

98

00:06:38,750  -->  00:06:42,950
But other people that might be looking at it might not have the same information.

99

00:06:42,950  -->  00:06:48,650
So it's a good idea to add a title to a title what we're going to do is so after we've done the subplots

100

00:06:48,680  -->  00:06:54,730
and create the plot what we're going to say is we're just going to say BLT Daut title and here we're

101

00:06:54,740  -->  00:07:02,480
going to give it to Tunnell movie budget distribution so far and that you'll see that the tail appears

102

00:07:02,480  -->  00:07:09,190
here of course is a very small title so let's increase the size here let's say coma and he'll say font

103

00:07:09,290  -->  00:07:11,400
size equals 35.

104

00:07:11,600  -->  00:07:17,210
And by the way for a shift tab you'll you'll notice that the arguments are not listed here because we

105

00:07:17,210  -->  00:07:25,130
are right now parsing these keyword arguments and Pipelet or the function title is able to recognize

106

00:07:25,120  -->  00:07:26,330
them along the way.

107

00:07:26,330  -->  00:07:30,650
So if you encounter a situation where you need to change something about a chart and you don't know

108

00:07:30,640  -->  00:07:35,450
what the argument is the best way to go about it is just look it up just Google.

109

00:07:35,450  -->  00:07:41,380
How do you change the font size of the pipeful a title or how do you add a Pipelet title.

110

00:07:41,540  -->  00:07:46,130
Or if you are looking for more parameters like for instance we're going to change the color of the title

111

00:07:46,120  -->  00:07:46,950
Soehardi to that.

112

00:07:46,950  -->  00:07:51,500
So if you google those things and then after a couple of times you'll get used to them and you'll remember

113

00:07:51,500  -->  00:07:56,000
what the parameter names are and most of the time they're pretty intuitive.

114

00:07:56,000  -->  00:08:02,390
So if I say font size 5 around that you'll see that there it is there's my font size 35.

115

00:08:02,750  -->  00:08:09,060
And what else can I add here I can add things like color that say dark blue.

116

00:08:09,250  -->  00:08:17,040
And then I can add a font name so use things like Times New Roman Aeriel and going to console.

117

00:08:17,050  -->  00:08:18,640
So let's run that.

118

00:08:18,630  -->  00:08:22,450
There you go you can see that that's changed to different font name different color.

119

00:08:22,610  -->  00:08:26,550
So those might be useful for your styling of your charts.

120

00:08:26,570  -->  00:08:29,030
What else can we change about this chart.

121

00:08:29,060  -->  00:08:36,230
Well now that we're talking about titles How about we add labels to the x axis and the y axis and is

122

00:08:36,230  -->  00:08:38,780
done very in a simple matter in a very simple matter.

123

00:08:38,780  -->  00:08:40,310
So same thing Piazzi.

124

00:08:40,310  -->  00:08:43,820
And then you just say white label and then you pass on the parameter.

125

00:08:43,820  -->  00:08:50,380
So while labels are going to be number because this is a distribution white label is going to be a number

126

00:08:50,570  -->  00:09:00,700
of movies and we're going to say font size right away equals 25 and that's a color he calls a red number

127

00:09:00,710  -->  00:09:01,400
of movies.

128

00:09:01,420  -->  00:09:04,450
And now these are the same thing for the X label.

129

00:09:04,820  -->  00:09:14,480
But this time will say X label equals budget font size 25 color let's say green because money is green

130

00:09:14,480  -->  00:09:15,500
.

131

00:09:15,500  -->  00:09:15,930
So there you go.

132

00:09:15,930  -->  00:09:18,300
So you've got number of movies we've got budget.

133

00:09:18,530  -->  00:09:25,850
And now what we want to do is we want to change the size of the font size of these takes right so because

134

00:09:25,850  -->  00:09:27,370
they're quite small right now.

135

00:09:27,560  -->  00:09:32,750
If we increase the size of these ticks then they will definitely be more visible.

136

00:09:32,750  -->  00:09:38,630
They'll be they'll look better so let's do that will say peel T Dot X ticks or say what sort of white

137

00:09:38,630  -->  00:09:40,380
ticks white ticks.

138

00:09:40,630  -->  00:09:45,650
And here we want to say font size equals 20.

139

00:09:45,980  -->  00:09:51,230
And same thing for X-Tex All right so there you go.

140

00:09:51,240  -->  00:09:54,210
Mistake it should be an S not an R.

141

00:09:54,510  -->  00:09:56,580
As you can see the font size has increased.

142

00:09:56,760  -->  00:10:03,300
And you can look up the function more information on Fante on the X ticks and y ticks.

143

00:10:03,360  -->  00:10:08,510
What it can do is you can actually set the ticks itself when going to do that now.

144

00:10:08,520  -->  00:10:12,990
But you can if you research a bit more about these functions and you can actually set the ticks that

145

00:10:12,990  -->  00:10:13,500
you want.

146

00:10:13,510  -->  00:10:18,480
You can change them quite a lot of flexibility that by Plaut provides two.

147

00:10:18,840  -->  00:10:22,790
All right so there we go that's a couple of those actions.

148

00:10:22,800  -->  00:10:25,140
Now what else do we see about this plot.

149

00:10:25,140  -->  00:10:27,920
So if I zoom out what is wrong with this plot right now.

150

00:10:28,050  -->  00:10:30,110
What can we further improve.

151

00:10:30,360  -->  00:10:34,910
Well obviously the legend it's it's quite small.

152

00:10:34,920  -->  00:10:39,620
Let's see if we can increase the size of the legend How would we do that.

153

00:10:39,620  -->  00:10:44,240
How would we go about changing the size or some parameters of the legend.

154

00:10:44,400  -->  00:10:47,280
Well there's another parameter that we have.

155

00:10:47,280  -->  00:10:51,360
So we really are calling the pill teed up a legend function.

156

00:10:51,390  -->  00:10:55,900
All we have to do is now add some parameters into it to monophyly.

157

00:10:56,120  -->  00:11:03,300
So first thing we're going to do is modify the size and the sizes modify using the phone crowd and so

158

00:11:03,560  -->  00:11:04,730
broad equals.

159

00:11:04,770  -->  00:11:13,240
And then you pass the keyword argument size call on 20 for instance that only increase the size of a

160

00:11:13,240  -->  00:11:13,930
legend.

161

00:11:13,940  -->  00:11:17,020
You can see it's now very very visible.

162

00:11:17,080  -->  00:11:21,600
So there's just something that you need to kind of remember that that's how you change the size of a

163

00:11:21,600  -->  00:11:23,710
legend for people.

164

00:11:23,790  -->  00:11:28,220
Then what we want to do as well is we want to change some things about legends for instance it really

165

00:11:28,230  -->  00:11:28,760
looks good.

166

00:11:28,770  -->  00:11:34,980
But at the same time like it's not as steadily pleasing that you can see these this grid going through

167

00:11:34,980  -->  00:11:36,840
the ledge and so let's try to fix that up.

168

00:11:36,840  -->  00:11:43,200
Let's see if we can add the background to the legend and let's start with the parameter which will say

169

00:11:43,580  -->  00:11:47,220
which is called frame or let's say let's press shift tab.

170

00:11:47,220  -->  00:11:52,550
All right so let's have a look through this as you can see it is just args and keyword arguments which

171

00:11:52,560  -->  00:11:57,660
are going to go through them and find the actual arguments that we were interested in.

172

00:11:57,660  -->  00:12:05,800
So we've got this here frame on fancy box shadow frame Alfar those parameters that we want to check

173

00:12:05,800  -->  00:12:05,830
.

174

00:12:05,820  -->  00:12:07,820
So let's see what what they do.

175

00:12:07,830  -->  00:12:10,820
Let's start with frame on equals.

176

00:12:10,860  -->  00:12:11,780
True.

177

00:12:12,240  -->  00:12:15,090
So as you can see frame one has added a frame.

178

00:12:15,120  -->  00:12:15,700
Wonderful.

179

00:12:15,720  -->  00:12:17,130
What else can we do here.

180

00:12:17,280  -->  00:12:23,390
Then we can say fancy walks equals true that will round the edges of all criminals.

181

00:12:23,380  -->  00:12:26,100
Now it's a square frame of we say fancy box.

182

00:12:26,270  -->  00:12:28,300
It'll have a bit rounded edges.

183

00:12:28,320  -->  00:12:30,100
That's considered fancy.

184

00:12:30,150  -->  00:12:31,130
That's awesome.

185

00:12:31,200  -->  00:12:36,490
Then we're going to do now the one is a good one the shadow equals true.

186

00:12:37,150  -->  00:12:40,560
So now drops the shadows so you can see it much better.

187

00:12:40,560  -->  00:12:41,990
And another one.

188

00:12:42,240  -->  00:12:45,420
So frame Alpher Let's put that in.

189

00:12:45,540  -->  00:12:50,430
So it shouldn't really change much because it is not transparent now.

190

00:12:50,470  -->  00:12:55,120
If you want to make it transparent you can try 0.5 something like that.

191

00:12:55,350  -->  00:12:56,950
It's semitransparent.

192

00:12:57,060  -->  00:12:58,240
But personally I don't like it.

193

00:12:58,260  -->  00:13:02,650
It becomes kind of grayish So just from Alpha One is good.

194

00:13:03,030  -->  00:13:10,530
It's also good to keep that in mind because some other packages might might change your frame modified

195

00:13:10,560  -->  00:13:12,510
so it might make a transparent.

196

00:13:12,660  -->  00:13:17,190
So then if you want to regain control of that you can just use for it all.

197

00:13:17,580  -->  00:13:19,730
All right so there it is our charge if I zoom out.

198

00:13:19,740  -->  00:13:22,170
Now let's have a look at it.

199

00:13:22,170  -->  00:13:23,140
What it looks like.

200

00:13:23,280  -->  00:13:30,540
So as you can see there is a final version of the chart and it looks much better than what we had previously

201

00:13:30,540  -->  00:13:31,070
.

202

00:13:31,110  -->  00:13:37,990
And one more final thing that you might want to do is you might want to go to the ultimate HST.

203

00:13:38,160  -->  00:13:42,440
And here you might want to specify the color suits say color equals.

204

00:13:42,450  -->  00:13:48,480
But here you'll need to post a list of colors because we have seven colors so you need to pass a list

205

00:13:48,480  -->  00:13:53,760
of callers you need to say something like red then salmon blue and so on.

206

00:13:53,760  -->  00:13:58,950
So you need to parse a list of colors because it's expecting seven different colors so if you want to

207

00:13:58,980  -->  00:14:04,890
do that go ahead and do that and have a look at how you can add some additional control or some extra

208

00:14:04,920  -->  00:14:05,520
control.

209

00:14:05,610  -->  00:14:10,140
But other than that our chart is finalized this is a chart that you could include in our report.

210

00:14:10,130  -->  00:14:16,490
Of course you wouldn't use green red and blue for your titles you'd make them more subtle but at the

211

00:14:16,500  -->  00:14:22,260
same time this is a proof of concept that we can control our chars and we can control that they're all

212

00:14:22,260  -->  00:14:25,110
visible that the text isn't very tiny.

213

00:14:25,110  -->  00:14:25,820
So there we go.

214

00:14:25,820  -->  00:14:29,420
Hopefully that's going to be useful to you and that'll save you some time.

215

00:14:29,430  -->  00:14:31,990
You don't have to research all these things separately.

216

00:14:32,010  -->  00:14:37,590
You can always come back to this tutorial when you need to edit a chart and just review how it's done

217

00:14:37,600  -->  00:14:37,700
.

218

00:14:37,800  -->  00:14:40,050
And that brings us to the end for today.

219

00:14:40,200  -->  00:14:41,500
I look forward to see you next time.

220

00:14:41,520  -->  00:14:42,990
Until then happy coding

221

00:14:45,260  -->  00:14:48,580
