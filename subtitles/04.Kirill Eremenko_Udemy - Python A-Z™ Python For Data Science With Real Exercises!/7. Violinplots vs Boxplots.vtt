00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.220
Welcome back to the course in Python programming.
1

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.560
In today's tutorial we going to learn how to create violin plots and then we'll compare them to box
2

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.550
plots and understand the pros and cons.
3

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.180
All right let's get started.
4

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.640
So as with something is in Seaborn and Python violin plots are very very straightforward and simple to create
5

6
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:37.650
all we have to do is say sns.violinplot data equals movies X equals genre and y equals
6

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.440
critic rating. Voila,  violin plot is already as quick as that.
7

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.340
And what are you going to do is we just going to copy that.
8

9
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.800
And that's before because we're talking about box or just put it above let's say W and here we're
9

10
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.330
going to replace violin plot with boxplot because the function call is exactly the same.
10

11
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.980
You're on that.
11

12
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.250
There's your boxplot or our boxplot.
12

13
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.740
And if I zoom out a bit let's have a look and try to see what they're telling us.
13

14
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.660
So we've got a genre at the bottom or certain genres we've got action adventure comedy drama horror
14

15
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.120
romance and Thriller.
15

16
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.710
And here we've got the critic rating so how is the critic creating distributed across different
16

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.340
across different genres.
17

18
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.900
What does a boxplot tell you.
18

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.110
boxplot tells you.
19

20
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.060
All right so that's you know this first quarter that's your second quarter middle that's your third
20

21
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.450
quarter that's your top right and outliers are excluded.
21

22
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.220
So here we don't see that those are usually specified as separate dots.
22

23
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.330
And so here for instance you can see that in horror movies the critic ratings are generally low
23

24
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.270
the median here is about 22 and generally so it's the lowest median that you have out of all of them.
24

25
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.960
And the highest median you've got for thrillers somehow thrillers are getting the best critic ratings
25

26
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.100
according to these box plots.
26

27
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.890
Not always but generally speaking the median here is much higher than here.
27

28
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.900
But two similar box plus you've got comedy and drama which is drama is a bit higher than comedy.
28

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.010
So you can kind of tell that.
29

30
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.040
Let's say hypothetically if you're creating a movie and you create an average type of movie so you don't
30

31
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.620
have a very great idea for the movie the plot isn't this kind of everything is about average the budget
31

32
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.680
is average everything is average then.
32

33
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.200
Which is the best type of movie to create if you create a horror movie then you are more likely than
33

34
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.720
not to end up over here with a 25 out of 100 critic rating If on the other hand you create a thriller
34

35
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.380
you are more likely than not to have a 65 or 70 or 100 critic rating.
35

36
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.180
So basically all else being equal if you're creating an average type of movie without anything unique or
36

37
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.000
special about it then it's better to create a thriller than a horror movie.
37

38
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.220
That's kind of like a very quick and rough or rugged inside out of this of a charter of box plots.
38

39
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.370
Just an example how you would use box plots but definitely you can get more insights out of here especially
39

40
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.470
if you want to compare two different genres side by side if you want to compare action versus comedy
40

41
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.040
you can see that their median is quite about the same but the box plot for comedy is a bit more stretched
41

42
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.600
out than for action.
42

43
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.050
And what does that mean it's more likely that you will be further away from the media and in the comedy
43

44
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.660
whereas here it's a bit more compact.
44

45
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.960
So the violinplot tells us pretty much the same thing but it has a bit different characteristics.
45

46
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.940
For example here you can see the width and the width tells you the number of points that fall into that
46

47
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.440
certain area something you can see from the boxplot,  boxplot kind of tries to tell you that through
47

48
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.050
the core tiles so tell you it tries to split up your data into core tiles.
48

49
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.860
So basically looking at box plot you would know that between here the this point and this point there
49

50
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.940
is about a quarter of the observations you'll find a core of observations in between here and here you'll
50

51
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.610
find a quarter of observations here and here another quarter and here and here another quarter.
51

52
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.680
So basically this part is longer but it contains the same observations as this part.
52

53
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.600
Meaning that there's more observations here.
53

54
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.930
Well a violent plot shows you the same thing but it shows it to you in a bit more of a visual manner
54

55
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.260
so instead of trying to remember that when the part is smaller that means more dots fall and they're
55

56
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.540
more observant and you can actually see by the width you can see that the width is telling you that there's
56

57
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.400
more observations that can be found here.
57

58
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.390
Same thing more observations here than in the top part which you can also tell from the box plot.
58

59
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.460
And then here you can see that this is a bit of a tricky one here it's wider it's wider and it's wider
59

60
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.650
again whereas that's something you can really tell from the box plot you can really tell that there is
60

61
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.780
a concentration of points here in the middle so sometimes violin plots do tell you a bit more.
61

62
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.870
And in fact I had a specific example.
62

63
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.580
It took me a while to find it and it will show us that box plots or violin plots can be a bit better than
63

64
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.450
boxplots some time so let's have a look at it.
64

65
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.090
All right.
65

66
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.580
It is.
66

67
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.720
It is in the drama section.
67

68
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.510
So if I'm going to take this and change it a bit so I'm going to say movies but I'm not going to take all
68

69
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.190
of movies I'm just going to filter them out.
69

70
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.060
Also movies with genre equals drama.
70

71
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.140
Same thing here.
71

72
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.180
So basically we're filtering our data set we're subsetting it.
72

73
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.230
But.
73

74
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.750
OK.
74

75
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.710
So here I want to change this by year so we're going to split it by year instead of by genre.
75

76
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.980
Let's copy thats and remove that again here.
76

77
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.780
I'm going to zoom in quickly.
77

78
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.680
So basically what I did is I'm creating a box plot for the subset a data set which only contains movies
78

79
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.650
in drama.
79

80
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.370
And then instead of genre I'm going to have the years on the x axis and still I'm going to look at critic
80

81
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.690
rating just let me quickly check that that's the one I want to be.
81

82
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.680
Yep that's the one we gonna be looking at critic rating so that zoom out the same thing for the violin plot
82

83
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.920
so far on that.
83

84
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.690
And then around that.
84

85
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.250
So what can we see from these two.
85

86
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.180
Comparing these two.
86

87
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.790
Well let's have a look at this box plot and the green box plot.
87

88
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.050
Right.
88

89
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.910
So even though the green boxplot is a bit more stretched out they look very similar.
89

90
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.150
Right.
90

91
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:42.510
So apart from the fact that those shots these two box plots look very similar but when you look at the
91

92
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.520
violin plots you'll see that they're a bit different.
92

93
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.210
So here you can see that it's smooth it goes up and then it goes down there's a bit of a hiccup over
93

94
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.690
here.
94

95
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.820
But generally it's quite smooth, this box this violin plot has is very different it's got two wider areas
95

96
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.970
so wide here and wide here so you can see that there's an evident concentration of points at this part
96

97
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.490
at this critic rating.
97

98
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.750
And at this critic rating whereas here there's one evident concentration of points and that is interesting
98

99
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.410
so that is something that violin plots can show you better than box plots.
99

100
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.560
Is those symmetrical type of concentration so when you have a concentration of points above and below
100

101
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.140
in a box plot it kind of evens out.
101

102
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.280
It kind of if as long as above and below the median it kind of evens out.
102

103
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.620
It doesn't pull the median up or down or anywhere whereas in a violin plot you can actually see it
103

104
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.910
.
104

105
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.700
So this is a very faint example of that phenomenon.
105

106
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:45.180
But you will definitely if you keep practicing with violin plots in your own data sets you will eventually
106

107
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:52.470
come across an example where a violin plot is can potentially give you much more insightful analytics
107

108
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.100
than a box plot.
108

109
00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.450
At the same time what's why aren't violin plots that's used in analytics and it reports well because
109

110
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.720
box plots are a favorite of executive executives really.
110

111
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.560
Like for some reason box plots they're they're quite straightforward to understand it's Court-House
111

112
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.770
So once you get your head around the fact that one is longer that means when it's shorter that means there's
112

113
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.730
more density in there once you get your head around that it is pretty straightforward to use them whereas
113

114
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.880
violin plots they do have these weird shapes and not in all programming languages it's as easy as in
114

115
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.760
Python too or in Seaborn to create the violin plots.
115

116
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.360
So there you go.
116

117
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:38.580
now we've had a bit of a comparison between box plots and violin plots and hopefully you can understand
117

118
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.600
for yourself which ones you like more and which ones you would rather include in your reports and that's
118

119
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.970
all for today's tutorial.
119

120
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.260
I look forward See you next time.
120

121
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.400
Until then happy coding.
