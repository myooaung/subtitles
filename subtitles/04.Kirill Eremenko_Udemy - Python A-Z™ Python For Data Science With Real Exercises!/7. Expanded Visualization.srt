00:00:05,060  -->  00:00:05,600
Hello.

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:10,560
Welcome back to the course and by the programming and the previous tutorial we've finally created our

3

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:13,310
first visit zation So congratulations on that.

4

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:14,420
It's a big step.

5

00:00:14,410  -->  00:00:20,670
I know it doesn't look that too impressive yet but it's already a huge step and you should be proud

6

00:00:20,670  -->  00:00:23,530
of yourself for getting this far in this course.

7

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:29,070
And today we going to add more lines or more players to this realisation so we can compare them side

8

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:30,820
by side on one chart.

9

00:00:30,960  -->  00:00:31,290
All right.

10

00:00:31,290  -->  00:00:32,290
Are you ready for this.

11

00:00:32,340  -->  00:00:34,340
Let's get straight into it.

12

00:00:34,560  -->  00:00:36,600
So more of his Alsation.

13

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:37,270
All right.

14

00:00:37,380  -->  00:00:43,910
So what do we want to do is we're going to take this Plaut and we're going to copy this first line.

15

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:44,970
And so what that does it.

16

00:00:45,030  -->  00:00:47,190
Had a second line to the plot.

17

00:00:47,190  -->  00:00:49,070
So we like building the plot.

18

00:00:49,170  -->  00:00:53,340
We're adding elements to the port until we actually show that plot this one.

19

00:00:53,340  -->  00:00:54,810
Let's say we want to read.

20

00:00:55,050  -->  00:00:57,190
It's going to be a player with index 1.

21

00:00:57,510  -->  00:01:02,800
And here let's change it keep the lines sound like that but it will change the marker too.

22

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:04,170
Well this has been like this for now.

23

00:01:04,190  -->  00:01:08,620
And let's let's just run it so shift and turn so you can see there's a second player.

24

00:01:08,630  -->  00:01:11,390
But this time will change the marker to a circle.

25

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:12,780
So just in all.

26

00:01:12,820  -->  00:01:14,580
So you can see there's our second player.

27

00:01:14,580  -->  00:01:18,600
So a bit more of a consistent trend and ended up in the same spot.

28

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:23,710
Even though Kobe Bryant was earning way more throughout the past 10 years.

29

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:24,240
All right.

30

00:01:24,240  -->  00:01:28,310
So what I wanted to show you here is first of all lines.

31

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:34,320
So if you google matplotlib or Pipelet line styles you can get to this page.

32

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:37,590
So this is matplotlib dot org Web site.

33

00:01:37,590  -->  00:01:42,600
And here they've got the documentation here for lifestyle so you can see all of the different parameters

34

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:44,430
that you're able to specify.

35

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:46,440
We're only using some of them as you could see.

36

00:01:46,440  -->  00:01:50,400
And that's what I meant when I me but are saying that we're not going to learn everything because it's

37

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:53,910
virtually impossible to learn everything we're only going to learn the bits that we need.

38

00:01:53,910  -->  00:01:57,690
And then if you need more things as you go along you can always look them up.

39

00:01:57,750  -->  00:02:00,980
Kind of a lean approach to learning a programming language.

40

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:07,800
So line style here we've got solid dash started you can use words or he can use as we did just symbols

41

00:02:07,860  -->  00:02:09,960
so here I'm just going to zoom in a bit.

42

00:02:09,960  -->  00:02:16,830
We just use that double dash in our line style and then marker's same thing if you google for pi plug

43

00:02:16,830  -->  00:02:22,830
markers you go get to this page eventually you'll get to this page and here you can see the different

44

00:02:22,890  -->  00:02:24,610
markers that you have.

45

00:02:24,750  -->  00:02:26,700
So we're kind of using it right now.

46

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:27,750
What are we using.

47

00:02:27,780  -->  00:02:30,570
We're using the old for the circle.

48

00:02:30,660  -->  00:02:32,760
We're using somewhere here was the s.

49

00:02:32,760  -->  00:02:33,360
There it is.

50

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:39,320
As for the square so we're going to use more different ones but it just helps make the viz. more segregated

51

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:44,290
so you can see the different players separately not just the colors differentiate them but also the

52

00:02:44,490  -->  00:02:47,010
different styles of the markers.

53

00:02:47,010  -->  00:02:48,290
That's two players so far.

54

00:02:48,360  -->  00:02:49,290
Ok going good.

55

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:53,200
So so far we know below this one is Kobe Bryant.

56

00:02:53,370  -->  00:02:57,050
This one his player of index number one action look them up.

57

00:02:57,060  -->  00:02:58,260
Who is that.

58

00:02:58,380  -->  00:02:59,400
Here let's have a look.

59

00:02:59,400  -->  00:03:03,350
Joe Johnson Next up is going to be LeBron James All right so let's add another one.

60

00:03:03,750  -->  00:03:11,880
So just take this all copied here and we'll just go add another one so that will be to be LeBron James

61

00:03:11,890  -->  00:03:12,020
.

62

00:03:12,190  -->  00:03:17,310
Let's say green and we use their hats.

63

00:03:17,660  -->  00:03:18,100
I can.

64

00:03:18,120  -->  00:03:21,320
So if you're on this you'll see that that's for Triangle.

65

00:03:21,330  -->  00:03:24,300
You'll see that we kind of slowly getting more and more right.

66

00:03:24,330  -->  00:03:25,650
What will happen when we have four.

67

00:03:25,650  -->  00:03:26,930
Let's do another one.

68

00:03:26,970  -->  00:03:28,160
I'll just do it on the Simplot.

69

00:03:28,160  -->  00:03:33,650
So what will happen now if we add another one three three and here we're going to say blue.

70

00:03:33,870  -->  00:03:35,590
And here we're going to say.

71

00:03:35,670  -->  00:03:41,130
So actually I had I would say just if you could follow the same colors and markers so that when we perform

72

00:03:41,130  -->  00:03:45,610
the analysis we have the same picture that we're looking at so far on this.

73

00:03:45,720  -->  00:03:48,430
You can see we already have we already have quite a lot on one charge.

74

00:03:48,590  -->  00:03:50,340
And that's we're not even halfway through them.

75

00:03:50,340  -->  00:03:55,800
So how can we add something that will tell us which player we're looking at.

76

00:03:55,800  -->  00:04:01,460
So how can we basically add a legend to our chart that's going to be an interesting step for us so let's

77

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:02,250
go ahead and do that.

78

00:04:02,250  -->  00:04:04,800
I'm going to copy these lines in a new one.

79

00:04:05,130  -->  00:04:07,790
And what I want is I want to add in a legend.

80

00:04:07,800  -->  00:04:12,870
It's not that hard especially that we've been saving these labels as you can see we can see them on

81

00:04:12,870  -->  00:04:18,480
the chart but we've been saving so every char every line on this chart has a label attached to it that's

82

00:04:18,480  -->  00:04:19,150
going to help us.

83

00:04:19,150  -->  00:04:23,030
So now we're going to add a legend which will pick up these labels.

84

00:04:23,340  -->  00:04:25,440
So just say BLT dot legend.

85

00:04:25,650  -->  00:04:32,340
That's how you create a legend in PI plot and then we'll say so loc is location or where you want to

86

00:04:32,340  -->  00:04:33,140
walk.

87

00:04:33,570  -->  00:04:38,190
Either way you can remember it where you want to look at the legend so let's just for now as for now

88

00:04:38,190  -->  00:04:43,370
let's get rid of that and let's just round this like it is so here you can see that we've got the legend

89

00:04:43,380  -->  00:04:46,290
right and it's in the ways on our chart.

90

00:04:46,310  -->  00:04:47,620
How do we fix that up.

91

00:04:47,630  -->  00:04:49,570
How do we change that.

92

00:04:49,760  -->  00:04:53,920
Well the way to do it is we'll say lock equals upper left.

93

00:04:54,170  -->  00:04:58,270
And what that means is that we want to take the upper left corner of all legends.

94

00:04:58,270  -->  00:05:03,400
So not the chart but the legend it has this box we want to take up the upper left corner.

95

00:05:03,560  -->  00:05:05,090
And where do we want to place it.

96

00:05:05,270  -->  00:05:08,050
Well we want to place it the next parameter is.

97

00:05:08,060  -->  00:05:13,520
I know this one is a bit lengthy beatbox underscore to underscore anchor equals.

98

00:05:13,520  -->  00:05:17,940
And then you need to parse a tuple where you want to Lochley and so based on your chart.

99

00:05:17,990  -->  00:05:23,660
So if this is the charts lenth this is one and this is one in terms of x and y where do you want to

100

00:05:23,660  -->  00:05:28,120
place it so if you say 1 1 that means one horizontal length and one vertical then.

101

00:05:28,130  -->  00:05:32,840
So we want to lock this corner of this legend to this corner of the chart.

102

00:05:32,850  -->  00:05:34,010
So let's run that.

103

00:05:34,280  -->  00:05:36,470
You'll see that that's exactly what happened.

104

00:05:36,620  -->  00:05:40,900
So if for instance I say what will happen if I say 0 here right.

105

00:05:40,910  -->  00:05:45,260
Where did the legend go it went to the bottom because we want only one lenth on the x axis and we want

106

00:05:45,260  -->  00:05:47,480
zero lengths on the y axis.

107

00:05:47,780  -->  00:05:49,480
Plays 0 0 here.

108

00:05:49,640  -->  00:05:53,160
Then the top left corner will end up in the bottom there.

109

00:05:53,510  -->  00:05:56,660
So that's how we can move around a legend and you can.

110

00:05:56,690  -->  00:06:00,230
You don't have to lock the corner left corner or you can say upper right.

111

00:06:00,370  -->  00:06:03,080
Then this upper right corner will be locked in over there.

112

00:06:03,080  -->  00:06:04,320
So let's try that.

113

00:06:04,490  -->  00:06:08,960
You see it's ended up over here so you can move this legend around and I highly encourage you to do

114

00:06:08,960  -->  00:06:13,600
that so you can give us a bit of practice to see what's going on so you could say 0.5 sort of point

115

00:06:13,600  -->  00:06:16,990
five the top right corner and up in the middle of the chart.

116

00:06:17,010  -->  00:06:18,760
Right exactly like that.

117

00:06:18,950  -->  00:06:21,860
It's totally up to you where you'd like to play said.

118

00:06:22,100  -->  00:06:26,500
I'm going to put it in over here because we have some space there.

119

00:06:26,540  -->  00:06:28,570
That's right outside the chart looks nice.

120

00:06:28,580  -->  00:06:31,530
And as we get more players it all started growing it won't affect our chart.

121

00:06:31,760  -->  00:06:36,860
But it's always good to know that you have that flexibility and control over where the legend goes.

122

00:06:36,860  -->  00:06:38,210
So that's how we add the legend.

123

00:06:38,300  -->  00:06:40,080
Maybe I'll just add a comment here.

124

00:06:40,280  -->  00:06:42,440
Adding a legend.

125

00:06:42,760  -->  00:06:43,160
All right.

126

00:06:43,160  -->  00:06:46,280
And now we're just going to continue with our players.

127

00:06:46,310  -->  00:06:50,980
There's quite a few to go but nevertheless we're going to go go through them.

128

00:06:50,990  -->  00:06:56,090
So what I wanted to mention is while I'm doing this by the way this is going to be magenta in terms

129

00:06:56,090  -->  00:06:56,530
of color.

130

00:06:56,570  -->  00:07:02,900
What I wanted to mention is that this is not the best approach to creating this is Alsation obviously

131

00:07:02,910  -->  00:07:03,080
.

132

00:07:03,380  -->  00:07:09,200
Obviously there are other approaches which are better but at the same time it's a very good approach

133

00:07:09,230  -->  00:07:12,830
because it allows us to build this chart step by step.

134

00:07:12,830  -->  00:07:18,710
That's the first thing and second thing is as you will see further down in this specific section of

135

00:07:18,710  -->  00:07:23,840
the course this will approach will allow us to actually practice building functions.

136

00:07:23,870  -->  00:07:29,330
So it will prompt us to create our own functional be a very valuable skill to have very valuable tutorials

137

00:07:29,330  -->  00:07:31,090
so bear with me as we create this.

138

00:07:31,090  -->  00:07:35,380
In fact I'm just going to probably cut the video from here too when I'm finished.

139

00:07:35,390  -->  00:07:39,380
And then you'll just have the actual results and then you can just copy along.

140

00:07:39,680  -->  00:07:39,980
All right.

141

00:07:39,980  -->  00:07:43,070
So there we go that's all 10 players as you can see.

142

00:07:43,070  -->  00:07:49,250
We recycled some of the colors and we even recycle some of the markers but because they're going in

143

00:07:49,250  -->  00:07:53,520
a different order we never have the same color with the same marker and that gives us that variety.

144

00:07:53,600  -->  00:07:55,750
So we can still visualize all the players.

145

00:07:55,970  -->  00:07:59,420
So that is how the salaries a matrix looks like.

146

00:07:59,540  -->  00:08:03,770
And that is already a great start for us so you can already compare.

147

00:08:03,770  -->  00:08:08,960
You can see that Kobe Bryant was always at a much higher salary and of get this is in tens of millions

148

00:08:08,960  -->  00:08:12,730
of dollars and then some players you know caught up to him.

149

00:08:12,740  -->  00:08:18,470
And you can explore different players in terms of how their salaries were changing and you can always

150

00:08:18,470  -->  00:08:23,460
take the same desolation and just copy it here and put in a different matrix.

151

00:08:23,480  -->  00:08:27,310
For instance you can look at how many games each one of those players played.

152

00:08:27,590  -->  00:08:34,130
So if we just do that very quickly and so far on this now you'll see that is the game as a matrix.

153

00:08:34,130  -->  00:08:35,470
Very interesting as well.

154

00:08:35,510  -->  00:08:40,220
So you can see how many games on those players played in every single one of those seasons.

155

00:08:40,220  -->  00:08:41,640
You can see the injuries.

156

00:08:41,760  -->  00:08:42,430
Who is that.

157

00:08:42,430  -->  00:08:47,580
That's Derrick Rose injured there and then Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant injured in the 2013 season.

158

00:08:47,840  -->  00:08:48,060
All right.

159

00:08:48,080  -->  00:08:54,250
Some very interesting insights and as you can see this is much more insightful and much easier to read

160

00:08:54,250  -->  00:08:58,340
than just looking at the tables that we're talking about previously.

161

00:08:58,340  -->  00:09:00,350
So hope you're enjoying this.

162

00:09:00,350  -->  00:09:03,200
Hope you're excited about what we're creating so far.

163

00:09:03,290  -->  00:09:06,280
Further down in the section we'll refine it even further.

164

00:09:06,380  -->  00:09:08,870
And for now I encourage you to play around with that.

165

00:09:08,870  -->  00:09:15,590
So just copy this whole code into a new cell and replace the matrix of a different one and try explore

166

00:09:15,590  -->  00:09:18,270
different matrices and even some of the ones that you created.

167

00:09:18,320  -->  00:09:23,660
Some of the matrices that you created through division or other operations and see what insights you

168

00:09:23,660  -->  00:09:31,010
can gather now that you have this powerful tool of viz. in your arsenal and Alcyone the next internal

169

00:09:31,130  -->  00:09:32,550
Until then happy coding
