00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Let us now see how do you resolve views

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.000
through a ResourceBundle file.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.005
The process is pretty much similar

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.009
to the way we have done the XmlViewResolver stuff.

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.004
Let's go through the steps one-by-one.

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.002
The first thing is you will have to configure

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.004
the ResourceBundleViewResolver

8
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.002
in your application configuration.

9
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.005
So let's head back to IDE and let's go down there.

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.007
On line 64, I'm going to instantiate a bean.

11
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.004
And what is that for?

12
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.002
That is for the

13
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:34.007
ResourceBundleViewResolver.

14
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:40.002
Let us also instantiate it.

15
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:48.005
And to this we are going to set the base name.

16
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.008
So base name, let's say is views. That's all.

17
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:56.000
And let's just return this viewResolver.

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.007
So what does this configuration mean?

19
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.004
We are saying that all our views

20
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.007
are now defined in a properties file.

21
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.000
The name of the properties file, the base name is views.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.006
It's going to take up a properties file

23
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.007
because it's ResourceBundleViewResolver.

24
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.009
You do not have to tell it explicitly about the extension.

25
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.002
So that's going to be views.properties, and that's all.

26
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.002
Now we have to create this file.

27
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.003
So the way we created the XML file

28
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.001
under the resources folder.

29
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.001
Let's go, right click the resources folder again

30
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:30.007
to create the views.properties file.

31
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.009
Again please remember when we a trying

32
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.002
to do the ResourceBundleViewResolver or the XMLViewResolver,

33
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.002
these particular files should reside datacally

34
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:40.007
under the resources folder,

35
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.007
which means they should be classed part resources,

36
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.002
otherwise they wouldn't be recognized

37
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.004
by the Spring MVC framework.

38
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:50.004
Okay, so what goes under views.properties?

39
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.001
So this is also now going to define all the views,

40
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.001
but they are going to be defined

41
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.003
through a properties files index,

42
00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.009
which means it is like key and value.

43
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.003
So let's find out how to do that.

44
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.003
So let's say if you want to map the definition

45
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:04.004
for the index view.

46
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:05.006
So we write it like this,

47
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:11.001
index, and then we put a dot of course,

48
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.003
and we have to provide the JstlView class name

49
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:15.009
because that the view class that we're using

50
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.004
to render the JSP content.

51
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.008
So I'm just going to quickly pick it up from the views.xml

52
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:22.002
that we have already written in before.

53
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:24.009
Let's copy line number nine,

54
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.007
fully qualifies class name of JstlView.

55
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:32.000
Let's come back here and paste it there.

56
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.004
The next one will be the view name, dot, the URL property.

57
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.008
So now this will be the part of the JSP

58
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.006
which is, of course we know what it is,

59
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:48.009
WEB-INF/jsp/index.jsp.

60
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.003
For this particular demo,

61
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.007
I'm just going to define one view in this.

62
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:53.009
You can, of course, go ahead

63
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.006
and define all the other file views

64
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.003
that you probably wish to.

65
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.005
For this demo I'm just restricting it

66
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.008
to a single index.jsp view resolution.

67
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.001
So we have configured the ResourceBundleViewResolver.

68
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:05.009
We have added all mappings

69
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.003
for viewing a properties file on classpath.

70
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.007
Last step is to build and run the application.

71
00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:13.002
But before that, let's go to application config

72
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:15.009
and make sure that we comment out XmlViewResolver.

73
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.005
We don't want this now because we want our resolution

74
00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:22.004
to be done by the ResourceBundleViewResolver.

75
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.003
So let's do a build of this.

76
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:28.006
So we are not going to employ InternalResourceViewResolver,

77
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:31.005
neither are we going to employ XmlViewResolver.

78
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:32.005
We are trying to resolve our views

79
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:35.000
using ResourceBundleViewResolver.

80
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.008
Let's check out the application.

81
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.005
Let's go to home.

82
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:41.008
Cool, so we have our index view mapped correctly

83
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:42.009
and it is now picking it up

84
00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.007
from the ResourceBundleViewResolver mechanism.

85
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:47.006
Let's click on search.

86
00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:49.002
And you see, you have a problem

87
00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:52.001
because this view is now mapped right now

88
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.000
on your properties file.

89
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.005
Let's go back to the IDE and observe what the error is.

90
00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:02.000
So it says that it could now resolve view

91
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.002
with the name search

92
00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:05.008
in the servlet with name dispatcherServlet.

93
00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:06.007
So that's perfect.

94
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.009
That's a completely understandable error.

95
00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.009
In your views.properties you do not have

96
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.006
that view defined anymore

97
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.006
which is why it is not able to resolve it,

98
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.000
and hence the error.

99
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.008
So if you define all the remaining views

100
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:19.001
in this properties file,

101
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:21.000
you will be able to resolve everything

102
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
via ResourceBundleViewResolver.
