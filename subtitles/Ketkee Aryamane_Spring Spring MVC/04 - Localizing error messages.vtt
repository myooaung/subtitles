00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] The last bit of the JSR Validations Demo

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.000
is localizing error messages for validations

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.006
from the .properties file.

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.005
If you look in our user java bean, we have specified

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.000
all the messages right there.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Instead of that, you could move these messages

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.009
to a .properties file, so that if you want to reuse them

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.001
for any other purpose, you can do so.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.008
Now for that, what you have to do is

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.006
simply add a file under the resources folder,

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:27.008
and the name of the file

12
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:35.007
should be validationmessages.properties.

13
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.006
And under this validationmessages.properties,

14
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:42.001
you can define the keys and the messages.

15
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.003
And that will be in the form of key and value pair.

16
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.005
So let's go back to the user bean,

17
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.002
and let's say we want to make sure

18
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.001
that this message is localized, so let's copy this,

19
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.002
and go to the properties file,

20
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.007
and let's define a key for that message,

21
00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:03.007
let's say we call it username.not.empty,

22
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.004
and that will be equal to the actual message.

23
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.009
And then, you can go back to your user bean,

24
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.009
and instead of directly embedding this message here,

25
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.007
you can access that message this way.

26
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.008
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the key

27
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:21.001
from the file, come back to user,

28
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.000
and within a pair of curly brackets,

29
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.009
I'm going to access that message.

30
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.004
That's all that you have to do.

31
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.002
Likewise, you can go and put all of these message

32
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.002
inside the .properties file, define appropriate keys

33
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:37.003
for it, and then read those from the user bean.

34
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.001
Now, another thing is the validation that goes

35
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.009
on defining the keys is completely left to the project,

36
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.009
the only thing is that when you read the key,

37
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.006
you should be able to understand what it tries to tell you.

38
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.008
So I'm just going to go ahead and modify this a little bit,

39
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.002
because it is not completely aligned with the message,

40
00:01:53.002 --> 00:02:04.003
so let's say username.cannot.be.less.than.six.characters,

41
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:05.005
something like that.

42
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:07.003
It could be as long as you wish,

43
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.000
could be as short as you want,

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.002
it's completely left to the design that you have decided

45
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:12.000
to go for.

46
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.005
So I'm going to change that key and put in here.

47
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.006
So now what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to read

48
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:20.005
that message from the properties file.

49
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.000
So when you plug in this properties file

50
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.009
under your resources, then Springboard and MVC project,

51
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.002
they're going to pick up those messages

52
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.006
from the properties files by default.

53
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.002
But please note that this properties file

54
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:37.000
has to be directly under the resources folder,

55
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.009
so that it is available on the class spot

56
00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.002
and accessible to the framework.

57
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.007
So let's stop this, run the build again,

58
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:46.004
and then check out whether the username

59
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:49.008
gets displayed through the properties file now

60
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.002
instead from the user bean directly.

61
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.001
So let's go ahead,

62
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.008
and I'm going to run the home again, access login,

63
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:03.006
access register, and let's say I do not follow anything,

64
00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:08.008
so let's submit, and yes, the message is still red,

65
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:10.004
but this time, the message is coming in

66
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.001
from the .properties file.

67
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.008
So this is a standard practice, where you want to localize

68
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:18.003
all your error messages from a properties file

69
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:21.005
instead of hard coding them inside your user bean,

70
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:24.004
so that if there's any other bean that wants to use

71
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.003
the same message, you can pick it up

72
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:29.002
from the properties file instead of duplicating it

73
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.004
at multiple places.

74
00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:34.000
There is one small thing to note here.

75
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.001
If you see when the validations ran and they failed,

76
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.000
of course, they displayed the error messages on the screen,

77
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.009
but the gender drop-down now is empty.

78
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.005
We are going to address this problem in a successive

79
00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:48.009
part of the course, but I just wanted to make sure

80
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.003
that I take a moment and point that problem out,

81
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.004
so that when you build that use case in a later part

82
00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:56.004
of the course, we remember what problem

83
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:58.000
we are trying to solve.
