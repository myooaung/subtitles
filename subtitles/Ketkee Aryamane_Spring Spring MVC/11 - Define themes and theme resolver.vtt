00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Let's look at how do you resolve themes

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.001
inside your Spring MVC application.

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.000
So the first step is you have to define two separate themes.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.009
Let's just come back to IDE and understand one thing.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.005
So under your resources folder, you have a static folder,

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.004
and inside that you have two folders, one for CSS

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.005
and the other is for images.

8
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.003
If you go out the style CSS, this is going to describe

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.000
the entire look and feel of your application.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.002
So this is the one that's enabled by default,

11
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.000
because this is the only one.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.003
Now what we have to do is you have to define

13
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.006
two separate styles, so what I'll do, I'll just copy

14
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:38.002
this file, and paste that on the same CSS folder,

15
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.009
because all the CSS static resources have to be picked up

16
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:47.006
from that file, and let me just name it stylesCSS.

17
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:51.001
And let's change few things here, so maybe I will change

18
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:55.009
the font size for the entire HTML element, let's make it

19
00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:01.006
about 45.5, and let's also have

20
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:06.003
one em tag whose color we can change.

21
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:12.006
So that'll be 800000, all right.

22
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.001
So I haven't changed much, it's just a demo,

23
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.004
so we are just going to alter a few properties

24
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.007
here and there, and we have now two different styles

25
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.004
that are residing at my project.

26
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:25.006
What is next step?

27
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:29.004
Define respective property files for those themes.

28
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:33.004
So what we want to do is under the resources folder,

29
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.006
we're going to create two property files,

30
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.000
which will have an extension of .properties,

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.002
so I want to say, client_theme1.properties,

32
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:52.003
and I will say, client_theme2.properties,

33
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.006
so there are two separate property files

34
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.002
that I'm going to refer.

35
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:58.009
And why is that required?

36
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.007
Because each of them is going to define

37
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.001
a separate style.

38
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.009
That's what it is.

39
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.003
So what goes exactly under this?

40
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.000
Now since it is a properties file,

41
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.008
of course it will have data in the form of key and value.

42
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.004
And the key that we are going to specify

43
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:20.006
is the code through which this particular theme

44
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.007
will be picked up on your JSP pages.

45
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.009
So let's go ahead and define that key value pair,

46
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.001
so I'm going to say stylesheet is equal to,

47
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.003
and let's give a part of that CSS,

48
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:38.001
so that'll be /css/style.css.

49
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.008
This is for the first theme that we have.

50
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.003
The first theme is going to be represented

51
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.000
by the style.css file,

52
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.007
the code for that is stylesheet, and that's the bot.

53
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:50.000
And in the second one, we're going to specify

54
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the same thing, but that'll be styles.css,

55
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.007
so I'm just going to copy this line,

56
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.001
go to client_theme2.properties, paste it there

57
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.009
and just change the name of the style file.

58
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.008
So that's the beauty of this, that the code

59
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:06.005
is going to remain same in both of the properties file,

60
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:10.005
the code is going to be used to pick up the style.css file,

61
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.000
and it is going to be resolved with the help

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.001
of these two property files.

63
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.001
So that's the step number two.

64
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.006
Next is we have to resolve the themes

65
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:23.001
using one of the ThemeResolver classes.

66
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:25.006
Now in our special bean types introduction

67
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.007
that we had in one of our previous videos,

68
00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:30.007
we've already talked about the ThemeResolver bean type.

69
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:33.005
And we had said that this is specifically used

70
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:36.003
to resolve all the themes of your application.

71
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:38.006
Of course, that's a bean type, and there are many

72
00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:41.009
implementations of that bean type in Spring MVC.

73
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.006
One of them is CookieThemeResolver.

74
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:47.000
So CookieThemeResolver is something that will help you

75
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.003
to store the value of the current theme

76
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:52.001
inside a cookie in your browser.

77
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.001
SessionThemeResolver, on the other hand,

78
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.004
is going to help you evaluate the theme value

79
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.008
from the HTTP session that the user is trying to establish

80
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:00.007
on the browser.

81
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.006
Of course, when the session gets terminated,

82
00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.009
then that theme value is going to be destroyed.

83
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.000
And FixedThemeResolver, as the name suggests,

84
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.009
is going to work with a fixed theme,

85
00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.005
so there's a property that it expects

86
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:13.001
called default theme name,

87
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.001
and once that is provided a value,

88
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.000
it'll just pick that up every single time.
