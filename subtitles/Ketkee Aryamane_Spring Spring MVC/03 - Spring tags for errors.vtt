00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- The next step will be to plug in the Spring's form tag

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.000
on JSP to display those error messages.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.007
So, yes, if validations fail,

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.007
then those error messages

5
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.007
that we have defined in the user bin,

6
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.007
are going to be populated in a list

7
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.006
and it can be displayed on JSP

8
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.008
with the Spring's tagged list form tag.

9
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.008
Let's come to the JSP again.

10
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.006
Let's open the JSP here.

11
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.007
Which is register JSP.

12
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.007
And this is your form,

13
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.004
starting from line number 43.

14
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.001
So what we're going to do is

15
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.002
we are just going to make sure that before this break line,

16
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.000
we insert another tag from the Spring tag list,

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.003
which is for errors.

18
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.003
So it's as simple as form;errors

19
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.001
and you have to provide the attribute

20
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:54.001
for which there could be possibly an error message.

21
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.007
Also, let's attach a cssClass

22
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.009
so the error message will look red in color,

23
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:04.000
so that'll be cssClass"error"

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.008
so that's all.

25
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.009
You have to make sure that the form errors

26
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.002
is defined on your JSP

27
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.002
with the particular attribute name

28
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.002
so that the error message for username

29
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:17.000
gets displayed right next to the username text box.

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.007
So we'll do this for the other fields as well.

31
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.006
You have username for which we're running a validation.

32
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.009
You also have the password for which there's a validation.

33
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.004
Let's change the part for it

34
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:33.004
and then we also had one for the activity,

35
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:37.009
which is going to be checking for non null values.

36
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.000
So let's also go and do that

37
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.002
and then we can also do it for firstName.

38
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:47.004
So that will be right here.

39
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.000
So on line 52,

40
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.005
I'm going to say form;errors

41
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:55.009
and say path="activity"

42
00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.004
because that's the error message that we want to grab.

43
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.003
Once we are done with that,

44
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:06.004
we can also go ahead and attach the errors to the firstName,

45
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.000
because that's another validation that we're carrying out.

46
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.004
So I'm just going to copy this, line 46,

47
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.007
come down for firstName

48
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.008
and make sure that you change the property name.

49
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.000
Also, let's pick up the cssClass="error"

50
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.006
and go to that activity form;errors tag on line 52

51
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:29.009
and attach it there.

52
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.007
So there we go.

53
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.004
We have made sure that all the error messages

54
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.002
are attached to the respective fields

55
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.004
for which we are carrying out the validation.

56
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.000
So let's go ahead and build this now

57
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.001
and check out if our validations work correctly.

58
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.005
So let's open our application.

59
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:53.007
localhost8080/home, let's go home first

60
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:57.002
and let's go to login, let's go to register.

61
00:02:57.002 --> 00:03:01.001
Let's say I'm going to put a username which is less than six

62
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.006
then I'm going to forcibly make sure that

63
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.006
this password does not comply

64
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:10.006
and then I'm going to leave the first name like that

65
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.009
and I'm not going to enter any value for activity.

66
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.001
Let's submit this form

67
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.000
and find out if validations run.

68
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.001
Perfect.

69
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:21.000
So we have those validations running absolutely right.

70
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.006
We got all the error messages right there on the screen.

71
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.006
So the username cannot be less than six characters.

72
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.009
The password does not comply.

73
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.006
The first name cannot be empty.

74
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:31.003
Activity cannot be empty.

75
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:33.003
So the way we have done these validations

76
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:34.002
for these four fields,

77
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.006
you can do it for the rest of the fields as well

78
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.009
and feel free to explore any other java validations,

79
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.005
annotations that you could possibly attach

80
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:45.000
on your java attributes.
