00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] So, now let's do some exception handling

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.004
in out Hplus application.

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.007
We are going to make the login flow work.

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.001
What I mean is if you go to the browser,

5
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.002
this is our homepage,

6
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.002
and when I click on login then I get the login page display.

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.001
So, I can enter the username and password here

8
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.001
and click on login,

9
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.000
and this flow is something that we're going to

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.004
set up as a part of this demo.

11
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.005
So, once we set up that login flow,

12
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.000
then we are going to make sure

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.008
that we transact against the database,

14
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.004
find out if the user is present in the database.

15
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.003
If not, then we will throw in exception.

16
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.005
So, that's how we're going to simulate the exception,

17
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.007
and that exception then has to be managed

18
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.005
by the exception handler that we're trying to implement

19
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.002
as a part of this demo.

20
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.006
What's the first step?

21
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:47.001
Add the "error.jsp" in the JSP folder for /error mapping.

22
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.002
What this means is by default,

23
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.001
Spring Boot provides you a /error handler mapping

24
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.001
enabling your application.

25
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.009
If you remember in one of our previous videos,

26
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.003
we did a small mistake in the form in COTAX

27
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.006
and a white page which was the error page

28
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:02.009
was displayed to us.

29
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.002
That is called the whitelabel error page,

30
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:06.006
and that is the one that

31
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.004
is mapped through this /error mapping,

32
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:10.007
but we do not want to see that page.

33
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.007
We want to see our customized error JSP.

34
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.004
So, we're going to add the one in our project.

35
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.006
So, if you go to your resources folder

36
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.008
you have it available under chapter four.

37
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.003
Let's just copy that,

38
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:28.004
come back to the IDE and paste it here.

39
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:29.007
So, error page is ready.

40
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.002
It doesn't have much content as it in error folder,

41
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.000
and there's a small error message saying

42
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.005
that sorry there's something that has gone wrong.

43
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:41.007
Next, we have to disable the default whitelabel error page.

44
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.004
So, as we said before that /error mapping

45
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.002
is going to correspond to that whitelabel error page.

46
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.001
We do not want that.

47
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.001
We want error.jsp to be taken into consideration.

48
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.003
So, to make sure that happens we have to disable that page,

49
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.001
and that is done by a property

50
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.004
that you have to configure in application.properties file.

51
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.005
Now, that's already available

52
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.004
under your resources folder again.

53
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.001
So, if you go to the dependencies

54
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.003
for Spring MVC of Spring Boot.

55
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:12.003
We have that property listed out on line number 20.

56
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.009
I'm just going to copy that,

57
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.001
come to our IDE,

58
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.008
open application properties,

59
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:22.003
and just paste that value bit. Right.

60
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:25.006
So, the property that we have pasted right now

61
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:28.004
is saying spring.autoconfigure.excluded.

62
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.002
And what is it supposed to exclude?

63
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:33.003
It is supposed to exclude the autoconfigure websublet

64
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:37.000
error page for all.springframework.boot.

65
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.002
So, that's what we are trying to do by this property

66
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.004
and treat in the properties file.

67
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.001
Okay, what is the next step?

68
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:44.006
Now, we have to make the login flow work.

69
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.009
So, let's create a login LoginContoller java for login,

70
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.008
and map it to the login.jsp.

71
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.007
So, let's come back to IDE.

72
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.001
Go back to the controllers folder.

73
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:57.001
Right click, say new javaplus,

74
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.007
and then say LoginController.

75
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:01.008
Of course this is the controller,

76
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:03.009
so business as usual,

77
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.008
annotate it properly with all the respective annotations.

78
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.003
Let's add a PostMapping,

79
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:10.001
it's going to have the password

80
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.002
so you cannot make a get request.

81
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.002
So, it'll be a Post request,

82
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:19.007
and provide a URL pattern for this handle.

83
00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:26.006
Let it return a string and just say login.

84
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:29.005
Just for now, we will just go back to the search page,

85
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:31.005
but we're going to amend this flow when we plug in

86
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:34.000
the session management in the later part of this course.

87
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.003
So, right now let's just return search from here,

88
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:40.003
and let's take this login URL.

89
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:43.009
Let's go to our login JSP,

90
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.004
and if you scroll down you have a form on line number 36.

91
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.009
We just specifically for the login use case.

92
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.008
So, there under the action attribute,

93
00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:55.007
I am now going to put this as a mapping.

94
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.007
The method is post,

95
00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:01.000
and then you have the username and password feeds.
