00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] So let's get into a demo

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:05.001
of finding out how automatic locale resolution will work

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.005
for your application.

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.003
In the previous slide,

5
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:10.002
we quickly discussed that accept header locale resolver

6
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.003
is the default implementation that's provided to you

7
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.001
by the spring MVC framework.

8
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.002
So let's go ahead in the project.

9
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.000
And the first step is to add message property files

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.002
for different locales on class path.

11
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.006
So let's go under Resources.

12
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.001
And inside this I'm going to create a new file.

13
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.006
Let's call this messages.property.

14
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:35.004
So that's the default name that spring MVC expects.

15
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.003
And I'm going to create another file

16
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:41.000
which will be called like this.

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.004
Messages_ S3.

18
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:47.001
Now S3 is for the Swedish language.

19
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.008
The file that I created earlier

20
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.008
is for the default language which is English.

21
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.004
So this will be named,

22
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.005
messages_SV.properties.

23
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.000
So tomorrow, let's say you have to enable French language

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in your application.

25
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.001
You will have to create one more properties file,

26
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.008
which will be labeled as messages_ FR.properties.

27
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:09.005
So where am I getting these codes from,

28
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.006
S3, FR, etcetera.

29
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:12.006
So it's very easy,

30
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.006
you just have to Google for those.

31
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.002
If you just say,

32
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:20.002
teen, i18n codes.

33
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.007
And if you go on this link,

34
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:27.001
which tells you i18n languages countries character sets.

35
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.000
There you go,

36
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.008
this is the official Worldwide Web Consortium URL.

37
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.008
And it has got all of these codes that's present

38
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:37.006
for all the languages you have.

39
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:41.004
So I am trying to enable Swedish in my project,

40
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.003
the code for it is SV,

41
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.002
and you can look for any other language code

42
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.002
that you wish to enable in your application.

43
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:49.000
Okay?

44
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.006
So we have messages properties

45
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.004
and messages_SV properties.

46
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:54.005
What we're going to do is,

47
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:59.001
we are going to have a key value property set defined

48
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.004
for the labels

49
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.006
and error messages.

50
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.007
Right now for this demo,

51
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.004
I'm going to restrict it only for the labels on the page,

52
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.009
and then you can expand the demo

53
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.007
and explore further

54
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:10.001
and bring in all your error messages also

55
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.008
to tag along with it.

56
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.007
So let's go ahead and define them.

57
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.005
Under my messages.properties.

58
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.007
So what am I going to first of all internationalize

59
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.004
or what am I going to localize?

60
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.002
So on index.gsp,

61
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.004
you see these navbar links that we have,

62
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.006
home, login, search,

63
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:29.005
and LinkedIn.

64
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:32.001
So these are the four things that I'm going to put

65
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.001
the localization for.

66
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.005
So let's go to messages.properties.

67
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:39.003
And again, this data is going to be in the form of key

68
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:40.003
and value.

69
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.008
The keys are always decided according to the convention

70
00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.003
that the application wants to follow.

71
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.008
So let's say this is label

72
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.001
because it's a label value,

73
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.003
and this is for the home hyperlink

74
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.009
and let that be set to home.

75
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.005
Similarly, label.search

76
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:00.009
will be search.

77
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:05.005
Then label.login

78
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.007
will be called login,

79
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:11.000
label.linkedin

80
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.005
will be called linkedin.

81
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.001
So key value pairs,

82
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.000
again, this convention is of your choice

83
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.007
as per your design that you will decide.

84
00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:21.005
Okay?

85
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:22.006
And now what I did is

86
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:27.004
I tried to pull those labels into a central file.

87
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:29.005
This is that resource bundle

88
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:32.008
that web MVC framework keep referring to.

89
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:34.002
Remember, whenever anybody talks

90
00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.009
about a web MVC framework resource bundle,

91
00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.004
that actually means that we are trying to bundle everything

92
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:42.006
into a common resources file,

93
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:45.006
which has an extension of.properties.

94
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:46.006
Simple as that.

95
00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:50.009
Now, we have to make sure that all of these keys

96
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.002
labelel.home, label.search,

97
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:53.002
label.login

98
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:54.008
and label.linkedin,

99
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:56.008
they are exactly the same

100
00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.005
in the other file.

101
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.003
So I'm going to copy this,

102
00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:02.000
go to SV.properties,

103
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
paste them,

104
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but now these values will change.

105
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.006
So home in Swedish is called (foreign language)

106
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:13.002
login in Swedish is called (foreign language)

107
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.004
LinkedIn will not change that will still be the same.

108
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:17.001
Search is called (foreign language).

109
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:18.007
But now that has got

110
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:20.005
an accented character,

111
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:22.007
let's pick that up from the internet.

112
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:27.003
I'm going to open translate google.

113
00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:31.007
And let's enter search,

114
00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:34.009
and let's select Swedish.

115
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.009
Yeah, so that's how it is,

116
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.004
and if you see there's an accented character,

117
00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:40.006
which is called (foreign language) in Swedish,

118
00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:43.006
so let's copy that,

119
00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:44.006
come back,

120
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.004
and paste that,

121
00:04:46.004 --> 00:04:50.004
under your label.search.

122
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:52.000
So that will be the value.

123
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So basically,

124
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
when you pull everything in your default properties file,

125
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.003
you are localizing,

126
00:04:58.003 --> 00:04:59.009
putting them at a central place.

127
00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.004
But when you carry the same keys

128
00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:04.009
and go in another bundle file

129
00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.001
with different values,

130
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:09.002
you're trying to now support internationalization

131
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:10.008
in your project.

132
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:12.008
There's one very important thing here,

133
00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:15.003
you have to remember about this,

134
00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:17.009
because they could be problems that you may face.

135
00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.000
So what you have to do is,

136
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.009
there is a setting of file

137
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.005
and coding,

138
00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:24.009
in (mumbles)

139
00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.001
So let's go there.

140
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.009
And always make sure

141
00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.000
that the project encoding

142
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and if you look down the properties file section,

143
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.002
the default encoding,

144
00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:37.004
everything should be set to UTF-8.

145
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.008
Otherwise, these accented characters

146
00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:42.002
that I just now refer to,

147
00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:44.002
they wouldn't be displayed correctly.

148
00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:47.003
So please make sure that this is set to UTF-8.

149
00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:49.004
If you are working in Eclipse,

150
00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:51.009
that also will have a similar setting,

151
00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.008
make sure this is set to the correct encoding format,

152
00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:58.004
otherwise, it often poses problems on the GSB pages.

153
00:05:58.004 --> 00:06:01.004
So say, okay.

154
00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:02.002
And there we are,

155
00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:04.004
we have our labels ready,

156
00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.009
what is the next step?

157
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.005
Use springs tags,

158
00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:09.000
to resolve those keys,

159
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.005
And that is what we have to do on GSP.

160
00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:11.008
So let's come back,

161
00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.007
let's open index GSP.

162
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:17.006
And instead of hard coding that home label now,

163
00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:19.009
I am going to use spring tag

164
00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.005
on line number 18.

165
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:24.006
And that tag is spring message.

166
00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:27.000
And there's an attribute

167
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.006
called code for it.

168
00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:31.005
And that code is basically this key.

169
00:06:31.005 --> 00:06:33.003
So let's copy that from line one,

170
00:06:33.003 --> 00:06:37.006
and base that on line 18

171
00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:40.000
And then of course, end this tag.

172
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.008
So we have to do a similar thing

173
00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:43.008
for the rest of the labels.

174
00:06:43.008 --> 00:06:45.006
So I'm going to quickly do that,

175
00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:49.001
based it online 19 2021

176
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:51.004
and change these labels.

177
00:06:51.004 --> 00:06:54.005
So this is for login.

178
00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:56.007
This is for search.

179
00:06:56.007 --> 00:07:00.004
And this is for linkedin.

180
00:07:00.004 --> 00:07:03.002
So we have R spring framework

181
00:07:03.002 --> 00:07:04.003
that live declared right there,

182
00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:05.008
which was already done before.

183
00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:07.007
And then we have a full labels

184
00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:09.004
that we are trying to pick up

185
00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:11.008
from the properties file.

186
00:07:11.008 --> 00:07:12.006
What is the next step?

187
00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.004
You have to just build and run the application.

188
00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:17.001
So let's understand how will that work

189
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:20.005
after the build.

190
00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:21.003
Okay?

191
00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:22.001
The application is started,

192
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.006
let's open our browser window,

193
00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:26.003
let's go to home.

194
00:07:26.003 --> 00:07:28.001
So did you see what happened?

195
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:31.001
It says (foreign language) LinkedIn.

196
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:32.007
And why did it do that?

197
00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:34.007
Now this is the entire magic

198
00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:36.002
that localization

199
00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:37.009
and internationalization concept is going to do

200
00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.007
for you in spring MVC.

201
00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:40.006
In the previous slide,

202
00:07:40.006 --> 00:07:44.003
we mentioned that there's an abstract header locale resolve,

203
00:07:44.003 --> 00:07:46.006
which will be the default implementation

204
00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:48.009
for your locale resolution.

205
00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.005
So where do you think

206
00:07:50.005 --> 00:07:53.002
it picked up the Swedish locale from?

207
00:07:53.002 --> 00:07:57.000
It picked up from the client settings.

208
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.001
So if you go to settings,

209
00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:01.002
I'm going to click here on Chrome settings.

210
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:05.004
And let's go to the language option.

211
00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:09.003
And you see Swedish right now is at the top.

212
00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:11.007
If you see the Swedish language is at the top,

213
00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:14.006
If however you do not find your language in the list,

214
00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:15.005
please add that

215
00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:18.004
by clicking on the add languages button (mumbles)

216
00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:20.005
Now Swedish is already added in my browser,

217
00:08:20.005 --> 00:08:21.007
and it is right at the top,

218
00:08:21.007 --> 00:08:24.005
which is why it is taking that as the preference language

219
00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:28.001
and trying to resolve my properties.

220
00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:30.000
However, if I say,

221
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.006
let's go ahead and say move this to the top,

222
00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:34.001
which is English to the top,

223
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:35.008
and then refresh this,

224
00:08:35.008 --> 00:08:38.005
do you see now it change to English?

225
00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:42.001
So this default implementation of locale resolver

226
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:43.005
is trying to pick up the settings

227
00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:45.008
from the Google Chrome browser.

228
00:08:45.008 --> 00:08:48.002
This will be true for any other browsers

229
00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:49.008
that you're making use of.

230
00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:51.009
So if you change the language in those,

231
00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:54.004
then basically you're changing the client settings

232
00:08:54.004 --> 00:08:56.002
and your local resolver,

233
00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:58.003
from spring MVC is going to pick that up

234
00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:01.004
and display the corresponding labels and messages

235
00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:03.006
from the respective properties file.

236
00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:06.007
So many got a code of SV,

237
00:09:06.007 --> 00:09:07.007
it actually went

238
00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:11.005
and resolved everything from messages_SV.properties.

239
00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:13.000
But when the code was EN,

240
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.008
then it did so from the messages.properties file.

241
00:09:15.008 --> 00:09:17.004
So it is as simple

242
00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:21.000
as just plugging in these two files in your spring MVC app

243
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.006
and you're ready to go.

244
00:09:22.006 --> 00:09:27.002
Let's go back and change the language again to Swedish.

245
00:09:27.002 --> 00:09:28.006
Is trying to confirm,

246
00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:30.006
choose option of languages.

247
00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:31.008
Make sure this is enable.

248
00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:33.009
Move to the top.

249
00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:35.004
And now if I refresh,

250
00:09:35.004 --> 00:09:36.006
I should get it.

251
00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:37.004
So there we go.

252
00:09:37.004 --> 00:09:40.005
We have this entire website displayed in Swedish,

253
00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:41.009
not the entire website particularly

254
00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:43.002
but just those four labels.

255
00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:44.008
So if I want to say this in Swedish,

256
00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:45.006
I will say

257
00:09:45.006 --> 00:09:48.005
(foreign language)

258
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:51.004
That means it is displayed in Swedish.

259
00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:52.005
So that's how you can plug in

260
00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:55.000
the localization internationalization capability.
