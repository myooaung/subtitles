00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Ketkee] Thank you very much for joining me

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.005
on my Spring MVC course.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.002
Now that you have got a good start

4
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.001
with the fundamentals of Spring MVC,

5
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.004
you can explore and start migrating

6
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.003
your legacy applications to this framework.

7
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.005
We have developed GSPs as a part of this course,

8
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.003
but you can also look at options of integrating

9
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.008
with other view technologies like Thymeleaf

10
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.003
because it's got a solid integration

11
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.001
with the framework already.

12
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.007
It will also be easier to understand

13
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:31.005
any other web MVC frameworks that you may wish to work with.

14
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.004
Additionally, you can look up the Spring MVC documentation,

15
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.007
look up on Github for many interesting projects on Spring,

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.001
and also post your questions on Stack Overflow

17
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.000
to get some easy answers.
