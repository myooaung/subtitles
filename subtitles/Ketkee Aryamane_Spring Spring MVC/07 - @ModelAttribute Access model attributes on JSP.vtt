00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] The next step in this registration use case

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.007
will be to add a user.java bean

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.000
to the project structure.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So let's come back to IDE.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And under beans,

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.008
I'm going to create a class,

7
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.008
call it user.

8
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.000
This again is going to follow the spring data,

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.003
spring GPA standards.

10
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.000
So I'm going to annotate it with @entity.

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.001
And let's now define the fields for user.

12
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.000
So there will be an ID,

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.008
there will be a string,

14
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.008
which is username,

15
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:38.002
then a password.

16
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:43.004
Then we can have the agenda of the user.

17
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.001
We can have the activity that user is interested in,

18
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.001
maybe playing a sport,

19
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.003
going to the gym, etcetera.

20
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:55.005
Then we can also have a first name of course,

21
00:00:55.005 --> 00:01:00.007
and we have a last name to go with it.

22
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.004
And finally,

23
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:07.006
we are going to tap the users date of birth.

24
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.008
There we go all of those fields,

25
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:13.000
I am going to annotate the ID field,

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on line eight

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
with the ID annotation.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.008
Same again,

29
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.009
Java Persistence API annotation.

30
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.004
And once we're done with that on line 19,

31
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:24.004
I'm just going to right click

32
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:29.003
and generate the go to settings.

33
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.004
So a user model is ready.

34
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.005
This is the information that we want to collect

35
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.002
from the registration page

36
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.000
and save it to the database.

37
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.001
The next step is add @modelattribute

38
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.002
to the method signature

39
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.009
in registration controller,

40
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.001
and then to the register JSP.

41
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.003
Now this is the bit,

42
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.006
this is the crucial bit

43
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:50.005
that we have to come to.

44
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.004
Let's go to IDE,

45
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:55.001
and if you see the registration controller

46
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.005
on the method signature,

47
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.001
I'm now going to add

48
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.003
the at model attribute annotation.

49
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.005
So let's do that,

50
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.003
and we're also going to give it a name.

51
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.007
Let's say this is called New User

52
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.002
because we are registering a new user

53
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.003
into the H plus application.

54
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.003
Now this model attribute

55
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:17.007
is supposed to be bound to this user object.

56
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.008
Let's import the user class.

57
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.005
And the other thing that we have to do is

58
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.002
we also have to attach this

59
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.002
on the JSP.

60
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:28.009
So I'm just going to take this copy,

61
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.009
go to the register JSP,

62
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.005
and if you look down,

63
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:35.000
so you have a registration form

64
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.003
you're on line 42

65
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.007
that begins and gives you all of those fields,

66
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.000
the username, password,

67
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.002
the first name,

68
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:43.002
the last name,

69
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.005
the activity that the user wants to engage into,

70
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:47.009
the date of birth,

71
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.009
the gender,

72
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.006
all of those fields of the form

73
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.004
are available to you right there.

74
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.007
So on this form,

75
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.005
on line number 43,

76
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:58.004
we are going to attach another attribute now

77
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:02.000
which is model attribute,

78
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.001
and the value will be the same name

79
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.000
that we mapped into the method signature

80
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.002
of the registration controller.

81
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:12.005
So when you attach this model attribute on your JSP page

82
00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:13.009
on the form tag,

83
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.006
and you have it in your method signature

84
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.005
in the respective controller,

85
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:19.001
that exactly means

86
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.002
that you are enabling data binding

87
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.005
through spring MVC.

88
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.006
Next is we also have to add model attribute

89
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.002
in home controller

90
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:33.004
for default values on register JSP for new user

91
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.003
and gender items dropdown.

92
00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:38.002
So let's understand what this point is about.

93
00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.003
This model attribute that we have attached

94
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:43.004
whenever this register JSP gets rendered,

95
00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:46.000
it needs to find an object

96
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.008
corresponding to this model attribute.

97
00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:48.006
If it doesn't find it,

98
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:52.000
then it will not be able to render the page correctly.

99
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.001
Another thing is

100
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.000
we have an HTML drop down here

101
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.008
which has the gender options,

102
00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:58.009
and there's list of options,

103
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.007
We are going to pull from the controller.

104
00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.004
So whenever you have these kind of requirements

105
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:06.002
where you're displaying pages,

106
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:10.001
and you have model attributes attached to those elements,

107
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:11.004
we have to make sure

108
00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.000
that a default object

109
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.004
with maybe the default values is provided to the page

110
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:18.004
so that it gets rendered correctly.

111
00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:20.003
Otherwise, it will become a problem

112
00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:22.002
and you will get a certain exception.

113
00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:23.009
So let's do that.

114
00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.007
Let's go to home controller.

115
00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:27.007
And this time,

116
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:30.003
I'm going to use the model attribute

117
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.003
on the method level,

118
00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:33.007
like this.

119
00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:35.009
So I'm going to say model attribute,

120
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.009
give it that same key

121
00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.008
that we have mapped on the JSP,

122
00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:43.001
and let it accompany with a method

123
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.000
and what kind of object are we expecting?

124
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.008
A user bean object?

125
00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:48.006
So let's call this

126
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:52.003
get default user.

127
00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:54.008
And we're just going to say return new users,

128
00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:56.007
we'll call the default constructor

129
00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:58.000
and have an empty object

130
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.003
so that the JSP is rendered correctly.

131
00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:02.007
We will do a very similar thing.

132
00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:05.000
For the gender drop down items,

133
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.002
we intend to pull

134
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:08.001
all the gender options

135
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:09.009
as model attribute list.

136
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.001
So I'm just going to copy this line 35 to 38.

137
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.000
Come down,

138
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.004
let's base it on (mumbles)

139
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:17.007
And what are we going to do?

140
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.009
Another model attribute this time

141
00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.006
for gender items.

142
00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:23.008
And what is it going to be?

143
00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:28.002
It's going to be a list of strings.

144
00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:29.002
We want to keep it simple,

145
00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:30.004
and let's say,

146
00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:33.001
get gender items.

147
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.006
That's the name of the method.

148
00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:37.000
And what are we going to return?

149
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.003
You're going to return a list obviously.

150
00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:41.007
So that will be very simple to do it

151
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:46.003
via the arrays as list method.

152
00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:48.001
And how do we define that array?

153
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:51.008
We say new string array

154
00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:59.009
and then we provide all the options.

155
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.009
So we have some default objects

156
00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.005
that we are attaching to R JSP pages

157
00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:05.006
ready out there

158
00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:07.000
in the home controller.
