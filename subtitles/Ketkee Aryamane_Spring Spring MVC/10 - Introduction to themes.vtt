00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.008
- [Instructor] Now let us talk about themes in Spring MVC.

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:04.006
What is a theme?

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.003
A theme in general is a collection of static resources.

4
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.008
Your cascading style sheets which help you to define

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.001
the look and feel by defining many properties

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.005
like fonts, font sizes, background colors,

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.004
the positioning of elements, et cetera.

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.009
And to accompany that you have a lot of images

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.004
that you tend to render in your HTML pages.

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.001
Why is a theme required?

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.006
This is basically to provide an enhanced look and feel

12
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:30.009
to your end customers.

13
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.007
People who use your application

14
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:35.009
often ask for many kinds of look and feel

15
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:39.001
and that's exactly why you want those kinds of developments

16
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.007
done for a website.

17
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.009
Now in general themes is not strictly tied up to Spring MVC.

18
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.008
Themes can be implemented with any other web MVC framework.

19
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.005
But when it comes to Spring MVC in particular

20
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.000
how do you define a theme?

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.009
So if you want a theme to be enabled or defined

22
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.009
in your application then you need an instance of that type.

23
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.008
ThemeSource and of course a default implementation

24
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:08.002
for this type is already provided to you by Spring MVC.

25
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.009
That is ResourceBundleThemeSource.

26
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.005
What this means is that if you want separate themes

27
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.004
to reside in your application then you need to define them

28
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.006
in a .properties file.

29
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:26.002
And your ThemeResolver being tied

30
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.009
is going to facilitate the resolution of those themes.

31
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.004
Which means depending on whatever you ask it to pickup

32
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:37.002
it will pickup the relevant theme from that .properties file

33
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:42.005
and display your entire website on the basis of that theme.

34
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.003
So we are going to do a small Spring MVC themes demo

35
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.000
in our HPlus application in the next video.
