00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] I am going to use

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.005
a fictitious web application for developing all

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.008
of the features of Spring MVC as a part of this course.

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.000
So this website allows you to log in,

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.002
to register yourself as a new user,

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.001
to search health products, et cetera.

7
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.005
I have provided all of the code used

8
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.002
in the demos for reference.

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.009
You can find a start state and an end state

10
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.000
for each movie in your exercise folders.
