00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- Let's start implementing the search use case now,

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.006
but before that, I'm going to make a few changes

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.005
on com.test.hplus

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.005
I'm going to create another package.

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.003
Let's label it config

6
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.009
and let's drag application config onto that folder.

7
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.009
This is just so that everything looks neat

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.008
and we know which class goes into which folder.

9
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.002
Right, so that's config.

10
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.003
And another thing to note,

11
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.008
if you look under external libraries,

12
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.008
you will be able to see all the dependencies,

13
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.007
all the jar files that your project is dependent on.

14
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:34.003
So that'll include Spring boot, Spring MVC, everything.

15
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:38.005
We're going with 5.1.9 release for this course.

16
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.007
So let's go ahead

17
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.003
and execute steps for the search use case now.

18
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.006
We have to create a SearchController

19
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.009
and provide a GetMapping for it.

20
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.002
So let's do that.

21
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.006
Let's go to hplus app

22
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:50.007
and under controller,

23
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.001
I'll create a class

24
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:57.007
called SearchController

25
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:01.008
and let's annotate it with the controller annotation

26
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.007
and put a GetMapping inside it.

27
00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.008
Let's define URL pattern.

28
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:09.002
Let's say it looks like /search

29
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.001
and it is going to be accompanied by a method,

30
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:18.000
which is public String search, let's call it search.

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.004
Let's put a small sys out there,

32
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.002
saying I am in search controller.

33
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.005
You could also use any login API if you wish to,

34
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.003
I'm just going with simple sys out.

35
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:31.000
Let me correct the spelling, s-e-a-r-c-h, yes

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then let us just return

37
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.002
the search view name from here.

38
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.001
Now, another thing to note here is,

39
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.005
instead of doing String as a return type on line number 10,

40
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:46.009
you could have used the ModelAndView as a return type.

41
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.006
So I'm just going to tell you how to do that.

42
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:52.005
Let's copy lines 9-13.

43
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:53.004
Come down there

44
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.006
and let's see how it'll look with ModelAndView object.

45
00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:57.006
So had that been the case,

46
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:01.002
then this return type would have been ModelAndView

47
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:02.003
and for that,

48
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:09.003
you will have to create a ModelAndView object like this.

49
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:13.000
And then if you see you have a lot of APIs on this,

50
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.004
ModelAndView can allow you to set a view name, like that

51
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.001
and it'll also help you to add data

52
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:21.008
in the form of key and values.

53
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.007
So data and the view,

54
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.002
everything can be returned in a single return type.

55
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:27.007
You can definitely do that

56
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:31.000
and make all your controller methods return ModelAndView.

57
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.007
I'm just going to keep it simple and consistent.

58
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.004
I'm going to return a String from all my controller methods.

59
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:37.002
So I'll delete this.

60
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:38.002
We don't need this for now.

61
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.007
This is just to show you the usage of ModelAndView.

62
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.001
So we have the SearchController ready with us.

63
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:45.003
What's the next step?

64
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:49.003
Insert the search.jsp and add the URL of SearchController

65
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:51.003
to the action of the JSP.

66
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.005
Now this search.jsp is already available to you

67
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.002
in your resources folder.

68
00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.003
So if you go to chapter two resources,

69
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.000
then you have search.jsp there.

70
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.001
Let's copy that

71
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.006
and put it under the jsp folder of our project.

72
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.005
This should make a small note here.

73
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.002
All the jsps that we have provided you

74
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:11.007
in the resources folder,

75
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.006
they're nothing but HTMLs.

76
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:15.003
It's just called HTML content,

77
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:18.004
but I have changed the extension of those pages to jsp,

78
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.006
so that it becomes easy for you to just paste it directly

79
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:23.000
to your project structure.

80
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.008
Okay.

81
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:26.009
So we have that search.jsp open right here

82
00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:28.005
and what does it have?

83
00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:31.003
It has few links as part of the menu bar

84
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:34.004
and then it has got a form on line 36,

85
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:37.006
which is going to help you input the search criteria

86
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:38.006
and after that,

87
00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:41.002
there's section that is going to display the

88
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:42.004
products for you.

89
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:43.009
So what we want to do is

90
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:47.002
we want to take this URL pattern of SearchController,

91
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:48.007
go to search.jsp,

92
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:53.008
and make sure that the action is set on the action attribute

93
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.003
of that form, like that.

94
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:57.004
The method is get of course,

95
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.000
because we created a GetMapping.
