00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Let us now find out

2
00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.009
how do you resolve your views

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.004
through an XML file.

4
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.007
The first step to do that is ,

5
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.009
configure the XML view resolve bean

6
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.006
in your application configuration.

7
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.005
So this is talking about the spring context configuration.

8
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.003
Let's go to the IDE

9
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:20.003
and grab our configuration file,

10
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.007
which is this one.

11
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:23.001
And inside this,

12
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.006
we are going to instantiate a bean.

13
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:29.009
That bean is going to be the XML view resolver.

14
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.002
So let's provide a method for this.

15
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.000
Let the return type be XML view resolver,

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.004
give the same name.

17
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.008
And what is this going to do?

18
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.009
It's going to say XML view resolver

19
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.006
distantiate that,

20
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.003
and this XML view resolver

21
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.003
is supposed to pick out the definitions from an XML file.

22
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.005
So we will have to tell this resolver

23
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:55.000
that the XML file resides at a particular location

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.002
on the class path.

25
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.001
How do we do that?

26
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.002
you can invoke an API. So let's go to the next slide

27
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:05.002
and save view resolver.set location,

28
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.003
and this location will be a class path resource,

29
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.004
so you can instantiate the class path resource

30
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.002
and provide the name

31
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.003
of that XML file.

32
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.004
And once you do that,

33
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.003
let's just return this view resolver.

34
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.003
Now if you see

35
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.009
this view stored XML,

36
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.005
is a class path resource.

37
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's see if there is a class path resource like that.

38
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.003
There is no class but resource right now.

39
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.002
So Fine,

40
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:33.004
we'll have to create one.

41
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.000
So let's go to the resources folder,

42
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.002
right click,

43
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.002
new file,

44
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:44.001
and name that as views.XML.

45
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.004
So this is the view.XML file,

46
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.008
where we are going to define our views.

47
00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:51.002
Each view name

48
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:52.007
is going to be mapped

49
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.006
to its corresponding JSP path.

50
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.006
Now all the views that you define in this XML file

51
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:02.005
are going to be registered as Spring beans.

52
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.004
So let's find out how to first register spring beans.

53
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.009
So I'm going to open a window

54
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.000
and find out about that.

55
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.002
So I'll say spring beans XSD declaration.

56
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:13.003
And if you go here,

57
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.006
this is docs.spring.io,

58
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.000
which is like the official documentation.

59
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.003
If you go right down,

60
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:22.001
it should somewhere give you the syntax

61
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.007
for that XML declaration for bean.

62
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:24.006
So here you go,

63
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.004
this is the one.

64
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.005
So I'm just going to pick this up,

65
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:28.006
copy,

66
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.000
come back to the IDE,

67
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.008
and paste it here.

68
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.003
Now whatever you see in front of you right here

69
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:37.003
is basically the beans declaration XSD,

70
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:40.004
that is a part of the spring framework.

71
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.003
So all the beans that you register

72
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:43.007
as a part of the spring context container

73
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:47.009
are generally defined with this existing.

74
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.003
We have been doing Java configuration all this while,

75
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.001
so we have never used XML.

76
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.004
But now we're going to do this explicitly

77
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:56.001
for a view resolution.

78
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.009
So let's go ahead

79
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.004
and define some views here.

80
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.001
In our XML file.

81
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.002
That will be done like this.

82
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:05.009
So you have a bean bag,

83
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.009
give it an ID.

84
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:11.000
Now this ID will be exactly the same as the view name

85
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.006
that you have defined as a return type

86
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:15.009
in your controller. If you wish to see that,

87
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.006
let's quickly go there.

88
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:21.006
So let's say this is your home controller.

89
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:25.008
And we know that you always specify the view name like that

90
00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:27.001
in the return statement.

91
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:29.001
So whenever you define the ID

92
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.007
for that bean in the XML,

93
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:33.008
this is what you should exactly map.

94
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:36.004
So I'm going to let's say, take this copy,

95
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:37.007
go to use XML

96
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:40.000
and put that value in the ID.

97
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.004
So now what we're trying to do is,

98
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.003
we're saying that there is a view by the name index,

99
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:47.002
and it is supposed to be displayed as a JSP.

100
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:50.003
Yes, and the GSB template is supposed to be picked up

101
00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:51.008
from certain part.

102
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.001
So all that configuration

103
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.002
is a part of this being done.

104
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.000
So let's go further

105
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.005
and define more things.

106
00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.003
There's a class attribute on it,

107
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:02.001
and that class attribute is exactly same

108
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.009
as your JSDL view glass.

109
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.001
So I'm just going to open the application config

110
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:08.007
in order to do a quick recap

111
00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:10.006
so that we don't get confused.

112
00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:14.005
If you look at internal resource view resolver on line 29,

113
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:17.002
we had set the view class to JSTL view

114
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:19.008
so that the rendering of the JSP is easy.

115
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.002
The same view class

116
00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:23.008
has to be set in the XML now.

117
00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:25.008
So if you just go to this class,

118
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:28.008
and you can pick up the fully qualified class name

119
00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:30.002
of JSTL view,

120
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:32.001
copy that from line six,

121
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:33.009
come to view strat XML

122
00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.004
and paste that all.

123
00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:36.003
And of course,

124
00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:40.000
give the JSDL view class name.

125
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.001
So we're saying that

126
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:43.005
there is a view by the name index,

127
00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:47.001
which we are supposed to be rendering with JSTL view.

128
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:50.002
Let's go ahead and define a property.

129
00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:53.002
This property name is URL,

130
00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:54.006
and what is this going to signify?

131
00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:55.009
This is going to provide the part

132
00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.002
of that index GSP.

133
00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:00.003
So that we will be,

134
00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:02.007
let's get the value attribute for it.

135
00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:12.009
And that will be webinf/gsp/index.jsp.

136
00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.001
And then let's close it up.

137
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.007
So they (mumbles) great,

138
00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:17.003
we have already defined

139
00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:20.000
a view inside an XML file.

140
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Similarly, we can do this definition

141
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.009
for all the other views.

142
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.000
So I'm just going to plug in three other views

143
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.002
in this XML file.

144
00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:29.004
Let's copy lines number nine to 11.

145
00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:31.001
Let's come down

146
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.002
and paste this at least four times

147
00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:35.005
and then do the changes for the other view.

148
00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:37.009
So let's say we have the search view,

149
00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.007
what will change everything is the same,

150
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:44.003
just a name of the JSP under the property tag on line 14

151
00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:46.000
is something that's going to be different.

152
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.001
So that is going to be search.jsp.

153
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:50.000
Similarly, you can define that

154
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for registered.JSP.

155
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.001
Let me make that change on line 18 to,

156
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.007
for the name of the JSP

157
00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:57.002
and line Number 21.

158
00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:59.005
Let's define a view for the login page

159
00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:02.004
which will point to the login JSP.

160
00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:03.007
As simple as that.

161
00:06:03.007 --> 00:06:04.009
So what we have done is,

162
00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.006
we have defined an XML,

163
00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:08.002
which is very conventionally picking up

164
00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:11.006
the spring, frameworks, beans, XSD.

165
00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:13.007
And we are defining all the views

166
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.004
in the form of being DAX.

167
00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:17.005
They just registration of the views here.

168
00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:19.005
And now inside this application config,

169
00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:22.008
we have already spawned an XML view resolver.

170
00:06:22.008 --> 00:06:24.004
So this XML view resolver

171
00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:27.000
is going to take a look at your views XML,

172
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.003
and then it will find out the name of the view,

173
00:06:29.003 --> 00:06:30.006
find out its part

174
00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:31.007
and resolve the view

175
00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:34.000
and display the content in the browser.

176
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.008
That is what it is going to do.

177
00:06:35.008 --> 00:06:37.005
So the last step will be of course to,

178
00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:39.004
build and run the application.

179
00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:42.001
However, there's one last thing that we have to do.

180
00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.005
Let's go to config.

181
00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:47.000
And now let's come in this out.

182
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.008
We do not want to resolve the views

183
00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:52.004
using internal resource view resolver,

184
00:06:52.004 --> 00:06:55.003
because we are employing an XML view resolver

185
00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:56.003
for the same job.

186
00:06:56.003 --> 00:06:57.009
So I'm going to come in this out,

187
00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.007
like that,

188
00:06:58.007 --> 00:07:01.003
and then let's do the build.

189
00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:03.002
The build is gone well.

190
00:07:03.002 --> 00:07:05.007
So now when we run the application,

191
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.007
all four pages,

192
00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:10.004
which is index, search,

193
00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:11.002
register,

194
00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:12.003
and login.

195
00:07:12.003 --> 00:07:14.001
Everything has to be resolved correctly,

196
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.004
we do not have the internal resource view resolver anymore.

197
00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:18.008
So this should work fine,

198
00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:22.001
the XML view resolver is now into action.

199
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.005
Let's go check it out.

200
00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:24.007
So I'm just going to go ahead

201
00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:27.005
and search home first.

202
00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:28.007
Yay, we got there

203
00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:30.005
That's the index.JSP.

204
00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:32.000
Let's check login.

205
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.002
That works too.

206
00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:34.003
Let's go back home.

207
00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:35.007
Let's go to search.

208
00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:36.009
That works Well.

209
00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:38.002
Let's go to login again.

210
00:07:38.002 --> 00:07:40.002
Let's go to register, Yes.

211
00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:41.007
So all our views

212
00:07:41.007 --> 00:07:46.002
are now being referenced by this XML file.

213
00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:47.000
That is it.

214
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.003
This is how you can resolve views

215
00:07:48.003 --> 00:07:50.003
using an XML file.

216
00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:54.000
And of course with the XML view resolver bean.
