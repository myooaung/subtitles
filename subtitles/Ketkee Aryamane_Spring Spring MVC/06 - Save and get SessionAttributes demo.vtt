00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- Let's find out, how do we use SessionAttribute

2
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.008
or SessionAttributes,

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.004
inside our H+ application.

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.002
The first step is the set up those SessionAttributes

5
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.006
for the login form.

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.000
So what we want to do is, if you look at our application,

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.009
let's go home, and when we come to the login page,

8
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.006
that is our login form,

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.009
which is going to be bound to the login model.

10
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.000
So we're going to store that login model inside the session,

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.009
using the annotation of @sessionattributes.

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.006
So let's go to IDE.

13
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.003
Let's open the LoginController.

14
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.006
So when the request from the login GSB is submitted,

15
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.004
it is of course going to come to this controller.

16
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:41.005
We know that.

17
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.009
Inside this, we are going to use @sessionattributes

18
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:50.006
to store that login model inside the http session object.

19
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:55.003
So just for a recap, let's open the GSB of login

20
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:59.002
and remind ourselves that the model attribute name

21
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:04.004
that was attached to the login form on line 37 is "login".

22
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.007
So this is the model name

23
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.005
that we want to store in the session.

24
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.008
So let's go to LoginController now.

25
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.007
And let's come on line 13.

26
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.001
So @sessionattributes annotation

27
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.000
is always applicable at the type level, at the class level.

28
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.002
So I'm going to say @sessionattributes,

29
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.007
and I will say that you store the information in the session

30
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.005
by the same name, login,

31
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.005
that we have referred to inside the GSB.

32
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.007
Now, a very important thing to note here is,

33
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:36.008
when you mention @sessionattributes and provide a key,

34
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.001
you also have to make sure

35
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.008
that the model attribute by the same name

36
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.005
already exists inside the controller.

37
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.001
It needs to make sure that a model is ready by the same name

38
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.005
before it tries to store the model information

39
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:56.000
by the same name inside the http session object.

40
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.005
So just be careful with this,

41
00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:02.003
and we have to make sure that on line 21,

42
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:05.002
let's say, we do this thing.

43
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.008
We say that there is a model attribute login,

44
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:14.003
and let's just have some kind of method...

45
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:17.007
where you return...

46
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.000
the login model.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.001
So I'm just going to institute this.

48
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.005
However, I don't think we need to do this right now.

49
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.009
In our previous videos, we had fixed an issue

50
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
where we said that all the model attributes

51
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:37.005
can be pulled and applied across all the controllers

52
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:42.007
by the default model controller advice that we applied.

53
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.006
Let's recap that on our project structure.

54
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:49.000
If we go to the default model attribute controller,

55
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.008
if you remember,

56
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:53.000
we had annotated this controller with controlleradvice

57
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.004
so that whatever model attributes

58
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.009
that we initialize as a part of this class

59
00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.004
get applied to all the controller classes.

60
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:04.000
So, in that, on line 24,

61
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we already have a model attribute by that same name,

62
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.008
and hence, there is no need to explicitly do that again

63
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:13.003
inside the LoginController.

64
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:17.004
So I'm just going to eliminate lines 20 to 24.

65
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:19.005
I coded this so that we understand

66
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.000
what are we supposed to do,

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.004
but we have already done this

68
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.003
as a part of the controlleradvice annotation,

69
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:26.007
so we are good, we are safe,

70
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:29.001
and we do not need to do that again.

71
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.008
Okay, so now what is this going to do?

72
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.008
It is going to make sure that it stores the information

73
00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:37.004
in the session object by the name login.

74
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:38.009
The next thing to do is,

75
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.003
we have to retrieve this session attribute.

76
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:45.004
So, when the control from the GSB

77
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:47.009
from this form is submitted,

78
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.006
it will come to LoginController,

79
00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:52.009
and that is the place where the login information model

80
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.007
is going to be stored in SessionAttributes.

81
00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.004
So now what we will do is,

82
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.005
from the LoginController's login method,

83
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.008
we are going to move to another controller,

84
00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:07.002
where we will be able to access that SessionAttribute.

85
00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:08.001
Because we said, right,

86
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.006
that session encompasses multiple requests,

87
00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:12.007
so when you go from one controller to the other,

88
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:14.006
that session information should be available

89
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.006
until the session terminates.

90
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.005
So now, what we have to do, we have to come to login,

91
00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.007
and forward the control to another controller,

92
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:25.008
and that is what we will set up.

93
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:29.002
So we have to create the UserProfileController now,

94
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.004
so that we can forward the control loop.

95
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.006
So under the controller's package,

96
00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:38.004
let's create a class and say,

97
00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:43.001
UserProfileController.

98
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.007
This is, again, going to be our controller.

99
00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:49.003
So let's annotate that,

100
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:53.009
and let's say this is going to hold a PostMapping.

101
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.009
Let's identify it by a URL pattern.

102
00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.009
Okay, and then let's follow it with a method.

103
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.008
So we'll put it on a string,

104
00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:09.008
and let's say it gets UserProfile.

105
00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:12.004
And I'm just going to put a simple sysout

106
00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:18.003
saying, "in user profile controller,"

107
00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:21.007
and we have to return to, let's say, a new GSB now.

108
00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:22.009
Let's call it "profile GSB."

109
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.002
We will put this GSB in our project structure

110
00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:27.002
in the next video.

111
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.007
So there we go, we have the simple user profile

112
00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:32.001
controller return with a URL pattern.

113
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.006
And what it is trying to do,

114
00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:36.003
it is supposed to get the user profile.

115
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:39.002
But the sole purpose of this profile controller

116
00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:42.001
is to fetch that attribute from session.

117
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:43.002
So how do we do that?

118
00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:47.008
The second annotation that we know of, @SessionAttribute.

119
00:05:47.008 --> 00:05:49.007
So, that's what we are going to tag

120
00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:52.001
to the method signature argument.

121
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:53.000
There we go.

122
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.004
Let's give that name.

123
00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.007
The name has to be same as the one

124
00:05:56.007 --> 00:05:59.001
that you use to store the session attribute.

125
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.001
And this is going to be bound to the login bean.

126
00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:04.004
That's login model for us.

127
00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:07.005
So let's import that.

128
00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:11.003
And we can also grab the model argument,

129
00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:12.005
just in case we want to store any

130
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:15.000
other information as a part of this controller.

131
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.001
There we go.

132
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.000
So, just to have a quick recap,

133
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.002
on the login controller on the class level,

134
00:06:20.002 --> 00:06:22.005
we store the session attribute with this name.

135
00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:26.001
Please definitely make sure that the model attribute

136
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.006
by the same name exists in our controller.

137
00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.009
We have done that using the controlleradvice.

138
00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.009
If you're not going to follow that approach,

139
00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:36.004
you can institute the model attribute as a short wiffle.

140
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:38.000
And the other thing that we did is,

141
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.009
to retrieve the session attribute,

142
00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.006
we set up a new controller,

143
00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:44.006
and we have annotated that method signature argument

144
00:06:44.006 --> 00:06:47.000
with @SessionAttribute.
