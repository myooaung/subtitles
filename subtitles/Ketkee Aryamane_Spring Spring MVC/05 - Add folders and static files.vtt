00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] The next step will be to

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.006
create the source and the resources folders.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.001
So lets go to the IDE again.

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.007
And if you see, in this project structure,

5
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.002
lets expand it,

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.005
under the source folder

7
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.009
you have the main folder

8
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.005
and then you have the Webapp folder.

9
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:16.006
There's nothing else.

10
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.000
So lets first create the folders

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.007
that we want to be a part of this project.

12
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.002
So under the main folder,

13
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.009
I'm going to create a directory.

14
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.006
Lets name it Java.

15
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.002
So this is the place where our source code will reside.

16
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:29.007
Quickly right-click on the Project

17
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.007
and say Mark Directory yes, Sources Root.

18
00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:36.001
Similarly, another folder on the main directory,

19
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.008
which will have the name as Resources.

20
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.006
Right-click on this,

21
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.004
and mark this as Resources Root.

22
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.007
Now, this folder is going to have

23
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.000
all the static resources for your application.

24
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.006
Which means your CSS files, your images, any java script

25
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.007
files that you may want to insert, et cetera.

26
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.000
So, that is the one.

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And, what does the PPD say?

28
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.008
We have created the Source and the Resources folders,

29
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.000
marked them as Sources and Resources Directory

30
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.001
by the folder.

31
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.008
Next step is to add the static resources.

32
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.009
Which is CCS, images, and possibly one of the JSP's

33
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.005
that we want to work with.

34
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.008
So, if you go back to your Resources folder,

35
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.002
You have the CSS and images

36
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.006
that has already been put there for you.

37
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:23.003
You just have to take those folders, copy them,

38
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:29.004
go to your IDE, and paste them under resources.

39
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.005
So, we have all the CSS and the images ready for you,

40
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.008
inside the project.

41
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.005
We also have to add the JSP file.

42
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:42.006
So, the JSP file is again available in the Resources folder,

43
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.008
right-click, copy, come back to the project,

44
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.006
and you're going to place the JSP

45
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.008
inside a folder by the name JSP.

46
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.006
So, under WEB-INF, let's right-click there,

47
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:54.003
and create a directory.

48
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.007
Name it as JSP, and under this,

49
00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:01.004
we'll finally paste our index JSP.

50
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.000
The Index JSP you see directly under WEB-INF,

51
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.001
we do not need that,

52
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.006
we can just get rid of it by deleting it.

53
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:08.008
So, there we go.

54
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:12.004
We have WEB-INF, under that we have JSP, and index JSP.

55
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:14.000
Now, the reason we are trying to maintain

56
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.009
this kind of structure

57
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.001
is because when you deploy the .WAR file

58
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.009
of this project on Tomcat,

59
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.002
Tomcat will expect a structure like that,

60
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.000
so it displays the JSPs correctly for you.

61
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That's why that structure has been made.
