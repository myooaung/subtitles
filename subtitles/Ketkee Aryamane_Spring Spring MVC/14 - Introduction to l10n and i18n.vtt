00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at l10n

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:05.008
and i18n and support with the Spring MVC.

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.001
l10N is localization.

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.006
There are 10 characters between l and n.

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.005
I18n is internationalization.

6
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:15.001
18 characters between i and n.

7
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.005
And what are these concepts?

8
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.004
This process is basically used

9
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.002
to localize or externalize messages and labels

10
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.008
for an application.

11
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.005
All your GSP forms have a huge set of labels

12
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.008
that you wish to display.

13
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.009
Also the success or the validations that you carry out

14
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.000
the error messages corresponding to that,

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.004
the information messages that you want to display,

16
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:38.006
all of those are basically supposed to be localized

17
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.001
or externalized

18
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.008
and that is what we mean by providing localization

19
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.000
and internationalization support.

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.006
Why do you need that?

21
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.009
Let's say you have a lot of GSP pages

22
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.000
and you have a lot of controls on those GSP pages

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.003
in your forms,

24
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.004
which more or less have the same labels.

25
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:59.005
A username could be shown on a login page

26
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.005
and a username could also be shown

27
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.001
on a registration page.

28
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.007
This success messages may be common to many screens.

29
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.007
The error validation messages that you have,

30
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.006
those also could be common.

31
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.002
So there are two parts here.

32
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.000
When you say localization

33
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.004
you mean that you're localizing those error messages,

34
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.000
trying to pick them up from a central place

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.001
in your project

36
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.008
instead of duplicating it across pages

37
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.007
or across your classes.

38
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.004
Let us not hard code the messages anywhere.

39
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.002
Instead let's pick them up from a common file.

40
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.000
That is localization.

41
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When you expand that concept,

42
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.004
there is another level for internationalization.

43
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:38.009
What's that about?

44
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.003
Often in your web application,

45
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.001
you have this very common requirement

46
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.000
to expose your website in different languages.

47
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So when I am in US or when I am in the UK

48
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.002
or any other European country,

49
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:51.008
the entire website has to be displayed

50
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:53.005
in the respective locale

51
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.000
or the respective regional language.

52
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.002
So your website, if it needs to do this,

53
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:03.000
then it needs to plug in the internationalization support

54
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.009
in your application.

55
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.009
Now with Spring MVC you have an Automatic Locale Resolution.

56
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.007
What that means is we already have talked

57
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.005
about LocaleResolver type.

58
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.009
We have known that this is the one that will help you

59
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.005
to pick your locale according to a particular region

60
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.001
and then help display your entire website

61
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.003
for internationalized views.

62
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:30.009
So this is the one that is the official type registered

63
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.004
inside Spring MVC to do the job for you.

64
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:36.009
And of course there are many implementations of it.

65
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:41.008
Default implementation is AccepHeaderLocaleResolver

66
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.000
This is configured for you by default

67
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.008
within the framework

68
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.000
so if you want to inject the capability

69
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.007
of localization and internationalization,

70
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:50.001
you can quickly do it.

71
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.000
In the next video we'll see automatic locale resolution

72
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.008
and then we'll also see locale resolution

73
00:02:55.008 --> 00:03:00.000
with one of the other LocaleResolver implementations.
