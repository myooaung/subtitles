00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] Now let's implement a use case

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.000
using the @ModelAttribute annotation.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.001
And what is the use case that we're going to implement,

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:07.009
let's look at that.

5
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's say you are on the home page

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.008
you're going to click on the login link,

7
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:16.000
that log in link should take the user to the login page.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And that login page will have a register user link.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When we click on that

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.006
then we will display the registration page for the user

11
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.003
and then we can do the rest of the flow

12
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:26.008
from the registration page.

13
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:30.007
So for that the steps begin with adding login.jsp

14
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.009
and register.jsp to the project.

15
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.005
So in your resources folder,

16
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.006
you already have those available with you.

17
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.005
So let's go to the resources folder.

18
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.005
So register.jsp and login.jsp, both of them let's copy

19
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:50.003
and come back to IDE and paste them under the jsp folder.

20
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:54.002
So we have the login and the register.jsp both available

21
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:55.009
now as a part of the project.

22
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.004
Next is you have to add a route in HomeController

23
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.006
to go to login.jsp and register.jsp

24
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.004
and map them to respective pages.

25
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.003
What this means is if you see h plus application

26
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.008
we have a link to login here.

27
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:12.006
So the way we added a url mapping for the search hyperlink

28
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:16.000
similarly we're going to add one for login.

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Once we go to the login page,

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.009
we will want to add one more for the registration page.

31
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.005
So let's do all of that, let's come back to our IDE,

32
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:28.009
HomeController and let's add another mapping.

33
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.000
So I'm just going to copy lines 15 to 19.

34
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.006
Paste them on line 21 and this time let's say go to login.

35
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.009
Let's get the same name to the method

36
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.000
and this time it is going to be the login page

37
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.009
that we're going to go to.

38
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.005
Similarly, let's also grab this method again,

39
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:57.009
lines 21 to 25 and put that on line 27.

40
00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.002
This is another one which is going

41
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.003
to take us to the registration page.

42
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:07.003
So let's amend that, give the same name to the method

43
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.000
and this time it is to register page

44
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.001
and the name of the view is register

45
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.004
because the jsp template is register on jsp.

46
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:19.007
So we have added two handler mappings,

47
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:24.004
one for the login page, the other one for the register.

48
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.000
We also have to make sure

49
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.004
that we map them to respective pages,

50
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:29.006
that is very important.

51
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.001
So let's grab this url pattern,

52
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:36.006
go to login and go to our index page,

53
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.008
and if you see on line 18 there is a hyperlink

54
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.007
that we have provided for the login link.

55
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:46.000
So I'm just going to paste that pattern there.

56
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.003
In addition to that if you go on login jsp,

57
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:54.001
if you look there, you have on line number 41,

58
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.003
a hyperlink which will take you to the registration page.

59
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:00.007
So this href that we have to modify

60
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:04.003
is basically trying to grab the route from HomeController

61
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.008
which is this on line number 27, copy that.

62
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:14.000
Come back to login and make sure that you paste this here.

63
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.009
So now we have linked the pages,

64
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.000
from home we went to login

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.004
from login we went to registration.

66
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:22.005
So that's the basic thing that we set up.

67
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:26.005
The next one is create a RegistrationController

68
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.004
and add mapping for registering user.

69
00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:32.006
So once the user is on the registration page,

70
00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.000
the user will enter a lot of criteria, a lot of form fields.

71
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And then we will hit a request to a controller

72
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.009
to save that data.

73
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.000
So let's add a controller,

74
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.005
let's go to the controller's package.

75
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:48.006
Say new java class and label this as RegistrationController

76
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:52.006
let me spell that correctly, registration.

77
00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:56.005
So this is a controller again so we have to make sure

78
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.005
that we annotate it correctly.

79
00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.001
And this time this is going

80
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:03.005
to register the user information.

81
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:07.000
So I do not want to have a get mapping

82
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.001
because the form is going

83
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.000
to be submitted to the server site

84
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.005
which means it has to be a post mapping

85
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:14.004
because it's user sensitive information coming in that form.

86
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.009
So we don't want to get,

87
00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.000
this time we'll have a post mapping.

88
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.009
Define a url pattern, register user and as usual say public.

89
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.000
String register user, this will be camel case,

90
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.003
make sure that you follow the conventions right.

91
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:42.006
Let's put a sys out say in registration controller

92
00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:45.008
and for now let's return to login.

93
00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:47.007
So what this means is that once the user

94
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:49.001
completes the registration,

95
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.008
you can take him or her back to the login page

96
00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:55.000
so that if she wishes to login she can.
