00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- Now in our application,

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.008
we are going to use the CookieThemeResolver.

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.008
So let's see how to utilize that.

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:11.002
You have to go in your ApplicationConfig.

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.004
So let's grab that ApplicationConfig file,

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.001
let's come down there

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.001
and in this,

8
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.008
we're going to define the theme resolver Bean.

9
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.005
So that'll be instantiated for us

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.006
and I have annotated it with Bean for that purpose.

11
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:30.009
So ThemeResolver

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
and let's write inside it

13
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:35.007
the actual object,

14
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.002
the actual implementation that we need to pick up.

15
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:44.002
So I'm going to instantiate CookieThemeResolver

16
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.007
and to this CookieThemeResolver,

17
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.006
I will set the cookie name.

18
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.000
What this means is,

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.007
we said that the CookieThemeResolver

20
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.005
is going to pick up the name of the theme

21
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.006
from the cookie from your browser.

22
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.004
So how is that cookie going to be stored?

23
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.002
How is it going to be identified?

24
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.008
That is the name that I'm trying to configure here.

25
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:12.003
So let's say it is called just theme.

26
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.002
And another thing that we can set on this is

27
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:19.002
we can set the default theme name,

28
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.002
which means if you're not trying to

29
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.005
pick up the theme, specifically,

30
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.005
then what is the one that it'll always should default to?

31
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:31.003
So I'm going to say that client-theme,

32
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.002
right there on the left pane on the screen,

33
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:35.002
client-theme1,

34
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.004
let that be the default theme,

35
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.004
because that was the one pointing to style.css,

36
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:43.002
which is the default theme that we have been playing with

37
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.006
in the entire application.

38
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.007
So let's set that.

39
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:52.005
We'll say client-theme1.

40
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.006
So once we set that,

41
00:01:54.006 --> 00:02:00.001
we just have to return this theme resolver object.

42
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.006
That is all.

43
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:03.004
So we are choosing CookieThemeResolver,

44
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.003
however, you can also choose the

45
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.003
session theme resolver, as we say,

46
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.007
which is going to help you pick up the theme value

47
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.000
from your http session object.

48
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.009
Okay.

49
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.004
Once we are done with that,

50
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.001
the next step will be to configure

51
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.001
the ThemeChangeInterceptor.

52
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.004
Now, we already know what interceptors are

53
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.009
and we have to configure the ThemeChangeinterceptor

54
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.008
so that we're able to trap

55
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.006
the change in the name of the theme

56
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:32.004
for every request that is hit on the browser.

57
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.007
So how do we do that?

58
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:37.001
Let's come back to the IDE

59
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:38.006
and if you see,

60
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.008
you have the ApplicationConfig,

61
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.004
which is opened right there

62
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:46.008
and we did add interceptors on line 81,

63
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.007
where we configured our own interceptor.

64
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:49.008
So now do that,

65
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:54.007
we're going to say registry.addInterceptor

66
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.005
and instantiate the ThemeChangeInterceptor.

67
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.000
Understand that this is the in-built interceptor

68
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.003
that's already provided to you by the Spring framework

69
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:05.001
and it's purpose is to trap that value,

70
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:09.000
which is coming as a query param in your URL pattern.

71
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.007
So I'm going to show you how to access this.

72
00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:13.004
I'm going to show you how do you actually provide value,

73
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.006
do not worry about that,

74
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.000
but right now, just understand that it is helping you

75
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.004
to catch that value

76
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:20.000
and according to that value,

77
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.002
CookieThemeResolver and the entire theme source API of the

78
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:25.009
framework will work for you

79
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.008
and it'll resolve the themes for us.

80
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.006
Okay, now this is very important.

81
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.005
Once you've configured the resolver and the interceptor,

82
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.005
then you have to use a tag

83
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:40.002
on your JSP pages, spring:theme

84
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:44.000
and this is going to point to that key

85
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that you have defined in the .properties file.

86
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.005
What I mean is, let's recap that,

87
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:50.009
in case we do not remember.

88
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.004
On the .properties file,

89
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:53.004
we defined the code,

90
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:54.005
which is this one,

91
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:55.005
in both of them,

92
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.004
client one theme properties, client theme two properties.

93
00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:01.006
This is the code that has to be referred on your JSP

94
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:07.000
and that reference will be done by the Spring tag lib.

95
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.004
So let's do that.

96
00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:13.002
Let's go to index.jsp

97
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.005
and if you see right at the top,

98
00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:16.009
we don't have that tag lib enabled right now.

99
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.008
So in order to get the Spring tag library on our index.jsp,

100
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.005
we can just go to login.jsp,

101
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.001
copy this,

102
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:25.007
go to index.jsp again

103
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:28.000
and let's paste that.

104
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.003
We don't want the form tag lib,

105
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.002
you want the Spring tag lib,

106
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:35.001
so that's how it is going to be like.

107
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:41.003
springframework.org/tags and the prefix is spring.

108
00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:44.000
So that should suffice whatever we want to do with it.

109
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.007
So how do you now make use of this tag lib

110
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.009
in order to reference that code

111
00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
that we have defined in the properties file for the themes.

112
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.000
So let's come on line seven, which is this

113
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and I'm just going to write the link tag again

114
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.009
with the Spring tag lib tag

115
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.008
so let's do that first

116
00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:06.003
and then we'll rub off the line seven.

117
00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:08.003
So it will look like this:

118
00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:11.004
link, of course the rel will remain the same,

119
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:16.001
because it is a stylesheet at the end of the day

120
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.001
and now inside your href,

121
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:20.007
you're going to do something different,

122
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:21.005
what is that?

123
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:25.008
You're going to reference the spring:theme tag

124
00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:28.001
and this one will have an attribute,

125
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.006
which is called code

126
00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.006
and that code, be very careful,

127
00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:34.008
you can actually copy it from theme properties file.

128
00:05:34.008 --> 00:05:35.009
That's always better.

129
00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.004
So let's copy this,

130
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.002
come back to index.jsp,

131
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:42.000
and paste it here.

132
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.005
So that is the code that you're providing.

133
00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:45.007
So based on this code,

134
00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:47.006
it is going to pick up the respective value

135
00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:51.002
from the properties file for the css file

136
00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:54.000
and then it will display the theme for you.

137
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.001
So let's go ahead and close this tag,

138
00:05:58.001 --> 00:06:01.002
which will be like this.

139
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:03.003
Let's close this tag, yes.

140
00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:06.001
And it's an entire tag in the href attribute,

141
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:08.003
so do not get confused with this index there.

142
00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:11.004
And then let's of course also say,

143
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:17.002
type="text/css"

144
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.008
and then let's close the link rel.

145
00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:20.004
So the difference was that

146
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:22.000
whatever you provide in the href

147
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.003
is now going to be a little different,

148
00:06:23.003 --> 00:06:25.006
because Spring is supposed to resolve those themes

149
00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:28.001
so you're referencing the code of that

150
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:30.005
through the spring:theme tag.

151
00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:34.004
So now I'm going to take the line seven of this file.

152
00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:35.007
We don't need that anymore,

153
00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:38.000
because we did it with the spring:theme tag.
