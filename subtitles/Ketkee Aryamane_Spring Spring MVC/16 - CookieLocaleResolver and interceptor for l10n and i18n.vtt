00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Tutor] If you do not want to do

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.004
automatic locale resolution

3
00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.008
you can also do it with interceptors.

4
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:08.005
When it comes to locale resolvers in Spring MVC

5
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.000
there are many implementations.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.009
A cookie locale resolver, a session locale resolver,

7
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.004
a fixed locale resolver, et cetera,

8
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.002
so when you talk about session locale resolver

9
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.006
it'll use a locale attribute

10
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.008
in the user's HTTP session for a custom setting.

11
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.006
In case of a cookie locale resolver

12
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.005
it is going to use a cookie which will send back

13
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.001
to the user in case of the custom setting.

14
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
So in this demo we are going to use a cookie locale resolver

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.006
coupled with the locale change interceptor,

16
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.008
which will help us to pass that query param.

17
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:39.002
So the first step is to add

18
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.001
the cookie locale resolver into our application,

19
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.002
so let's go back to the IDE and grab our application config,

20
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.005
and inside that let's register

21
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.009
the bean for the cookie locale resolver.

22
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:58.001
So I'm going to say public, locale resolver,

23
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.005
and give it a name,

24
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:08.007
and let's instantiate the cookie locale resolver.

25
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:15.009
Let's also set the default locale on it to US locale.

26
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.000
You can pick the locale from Java route UTL, that's the one,

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.007
and then we just return the cookie locale resolver.

28
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.003
Also you can, after you set the default locale,

29
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:32.000
set the name of the cookie the way we did for team two.

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.009
So that will be set cookie name,

31
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.000
and let's just call it locale,

32
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then just let's return

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.006
that cookie locale resolver object.

34
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.006
The next step will be to add the locale change interceptor

35
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.001
to intercept that language param passed as a query param,

36
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.007
so let's go back to the R interceptors method on line 86.

37
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.006
Let's come down on line 89

38
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.006
and say registry dot add interceptor,

39
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:01.005
new locale change interceptor this time.

40
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.005
Now when we worked out the teams demo

41
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.008
we had used a query parameter by the name team,

42
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.002
and that is something that's default

43
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.007
when you register this interceptor.

44
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.005
Similarly, when you have the local change interceptor,

45
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:18.003
that also comes in with a default query parameter name,

46
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.009
and that is locale, so that's all.

47
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.007
Now the only thing that we have to do

48
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.007
is we have to build and run this application,

49
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:29.008
and then we will use this query param to pass our locale.

50
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:34.005
So let's build this and observe the changes.

51
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:35.009
So the build has gone well.

52
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.009
Let's open a window and say home,

53
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:46.005
and then say question mark locale equal to SV.

54
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:50.002
So you see those labels are now displayed in Swedish.

55
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.005
Again, if you pass EN as the locale,

56
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:56.003
then everything becomes English again.

57
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:58.004
So if you inspect your browser

58
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:01.008
and go to your application cookie storage

59
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:05.005
and you can see that that locale has been set as a cookie,

60
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:08.007
so it is going to extract this cookie locale

61
00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.004
and resolve the locale for you.

62
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.005
Just a couple of points to note,

63
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.009
we have set a default locale,

64
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.001
so if it doesn't find a cookie setting like that

65
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:21.000
then it'll just fall back to the US locale,

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.008
and the other thing is you can also

67
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:27.001
customize this query parameter name.

68
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:34.006
For example, you could say locale change interceptor,

69
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:38.000
and then on this you can actually set the parameter name

70
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.006
to something different if you wish to.

71
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.005
Here in this application we have just gone ahead

72
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.008
with the default one, so I'm not going to do this,

73
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:48.002
and I'm going to cut these lines off.

74
00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.009
So if the cookie is missing it'll pick 34 locale,

75
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.006
otherwise it'll just keep picking up that value

76
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:56.000
from the cookie that it gets in your browser,

77
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.007
and we have ensured that it is storing the browser

78
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.002
by means of this locale param

79
00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:03.002
that we are sending for every request.

80
00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:05.005
So that interceptor is going to help us

81
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:07.007
tap that locale value every time

82
00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:10.002
with the user's request and store it,

83
00:04:10.002 --> 00:04:11.009
so then the locale will be resolved

84
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.000
according to that cookie.

85
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.006
Let's open an incognito window

86
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.009
and let's inspect this browser,

87
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.002
and if you look under application

88
00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:22.006
you have nothing under cookies right now.

89
00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:27.005
So if I go ahead and just access the home URL

90
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:28.005
there is no cookie right now,

91
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:31.003
so it'll just fall back to the default locale,

92
00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.002
and that has already been set to US

93
00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:35.005
in our application configuration.

94
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:40.000
Now let's say you access it by the query param.

95
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.008
Let's open the locale equal to SV for this request.

96
00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:47.006
So now that cookie is going to be stored

97
00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:49.005
in your browser by the name SV.

98
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.002
So now even if you don't pass the locale

99
00:04:51.002 --> 00:04:52.007
in all the subsequent requests,

100
00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:55.007
it will keep resolving it to Swedish language

101
00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:58.002
because that's the cookie that it is getting.

102
00:04:58.002 --> 00:04:59.006
That's the way it works.

103
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:03.004
Now let's say you want to go back to the English language,

104
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:06.007
then you say locale equal to EN,

105
00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:09.005
and now the value of that locale cookie changes again,

106
00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:11.005
so now all subsequent requests

107
00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:13.005
that you hit for the application

108
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:16.001
will pick up the locale value as EN

109
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.005
and keep displaying everything in English.

110
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:22.005
So here we can see that the default line setting

111
00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:25.004
that we had in the Chrome browser for the language

112
00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:28.001
has got nothing to do with the locale resolution.

113
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.001
Now the locale is being picked up from this cookie

114
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:34.000
and result every time for the subsequent requests

115
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that you do for your HPlus application.
