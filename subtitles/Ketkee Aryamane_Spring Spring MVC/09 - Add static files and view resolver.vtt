00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- Now the next step will be

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.009
to add a couple of more dependencies,

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.005
so that the Spring Boot project that we created

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.009
can run well with Java Server Pages.

5
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.003
We're going to work with JSPs as the part of this course,

6
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:12.003
so let's do that.

7
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.008
Under your Resources folder

8
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:18.002
you already have a file which says,

9
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.007
Dependencies for Spring mvc with Spring boot.

10
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.006
So just open that file, and if you see at the top,

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.001
you have a couple of dependencies

12
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.009
which is for the javax.servlet API

13
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.002
and the Tomcat Embed Jasper API.

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.009
And this is what you need in order to work with JSPs.

15
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.001
So let's copy them,

16
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.008
come back to IDE,

17
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.002
and paste them in the pom.xml.

18
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.009
So, I'll go right down there

19
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.003
and if you see on line 47,

20
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll paste both of them.

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Also, make sure that this Enable Auto-Imported

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.002
at the right-hand side bottom part of your screen

23
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:52.000
is clicked,

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.008
so that anymore dependencies that you add in pom.xml

25
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.009
are picked up by the Maven build.

26
00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.005
Next is to add the JSPs to the web app folder.

27
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.009
So we've already inspected the folder structure

28
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.005
for the hplus web app in the previous video.

29
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.001
If you see, there is no web app folder right now.

30
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.002
It only has java and the resources folder.

31
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.002
So we're going to add a web app folder,

32
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.002
so that the structure can be mirrored

33
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:19.000
that is expected to work with Tomcat container.

34
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.003
So let's go ahead and save web app as a directory.

35
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.000
Under that, let's create another one,

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.006
which is WEB-INF

37
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.007
and another one again for the JSPs.

38
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.006
So now we can just go ahead,

39
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.003
grab the index.jsp file from resources,

40
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.000
copy,

41
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.005
go back to IDE,

42
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.002
and paste it on the JSP folder.

43
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.002
Once that is done,

44
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:50.008
the next step will be to add the static resources.

45
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.001
So hplus comes with a look and feel

46
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.009
that has already been designed in HTML, CSS, et cetera

47
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.004
and those CSS and images have to be added to the project.

48
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.003
So let's go back to resources folder

49
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.004
and you already have those folders there.

50
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:04.009
Right click on them,

51
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.000
copy,

52
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.006
let's go to IDE,

53
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.008
and paste them under the static folder.

54
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.005
So we've already discussed that your static resources

55
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.005
will reside under the static folder.

56
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:20.007
Okay, so there we have all the static resources ready.

57
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.000
The next step will be

58
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.006
to add context configuration class for Spring.

59
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:26.008
So what this means is,

60
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.004
I'm just going to go to the java folder

61
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:30.007
and inside that,

62
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:32.005
I'm going to create a class.

63
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:36.009
Let's call this ApplicationConfig

64
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.007
and this is going to be configuration class

65
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:42.000
for our Spring context.

66
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.007
So I'm going to annotate it with @Configuration

67
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:49.001
and another thing that I have to do

68
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.002
is the ComponentScan.

69
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.005
So if you remember, this is the same thing

70
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.009
that we've already done

71
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.005
when we tried to set up a simple Spring MVC project

72
00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:57.007
with Maven only.

73
00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:58.006
So it's the same thing.

74
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:02.006
I'm just going to provide the scan base packages

75
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:09.006
and that will be com.test.hplus.

76
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:10.006
So if you see,

77
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.007
this is the same package that we have under our java folder

78
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.008
and this is the package that the entire application

79
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.003
is going to scan for all Spring related beans

80
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.006
and they're going to instantiated for you,

81
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.005
ready for your usage whenever you want them.

82
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.009
Additionally, this ApplicationConfig is also supposed to

83
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.007
extend WebMvcConfigurationSupport.

84
00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:35.009
It's the same thing that we've done before also.

85
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.008
So now of course,

86
00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.000
we have to add the context configuration class

87
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.002
and we have to add that entire configuration,

88
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:43.007
so I'm just pick it up from the previous project.

89
00:03:43.007 --> 00:03:45.007
If you go to springmvcmaven,

90
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:47.008
we've already written that configuration before.

91
00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:53.000
So I'm just going to copy line number 15 to line number 28,

92
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.001
copy this,

93
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.006
let's go to hplus app,

94
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:59.007
and let's paste it here on line 11.

95
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:02.003
Make sure the classes are imported.

96
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:03.002
Okay.

97
00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:04.006
So we have add resource handlers,

98
00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:06.004
which is to tell this project

99
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:09.000
where it is supposed to pick up the static resources from

100
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.002
and there is an InternalResourceViewResolver,

101
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:13.006
which is going to resolve the JSPs for us.

102
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.001
There's a small tweak that we have to do here.

103
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.003
In addResourceHandlers,

104
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:20.008
now the location of the static resources

105
00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:23.005
is a little different for this structure.

106
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:27.001
So if you see, the resources reside under the static folder

107
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:29.005
and that is the change that we have to make here.

108
00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:33.004
So on line 18, for addResourceLocations,

109
00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:34.004
I'm going to say,

110
00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:37.002
pick this up from the static folder,

111
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:38.008
which is on the class path.

112
00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:42.007
Same goes for the images.

113
00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:44.006
So we are saying that if on any JSPs,

114
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.002
you find these kind of paths,

115
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.002
they're supposed to be mapped to these locations.

116
00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:52.009
So this ensures that your static resources

117
00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.009
are served correctly.

118
00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.001
There will be no change in the bean instantiation

119
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.007
that we have for InternalResourceViewResolver.

120
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:03.000
That is still going to be the same.
