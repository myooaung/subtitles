00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] The next step will be to add a

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.004
Mapping and Home Controller to go to the

3
00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.007
search page and then add that link on index JSP.

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.004
What I mean by this is if you look at the Hplus application

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.003
you have a search hyperlink here.

6
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.004
If you click you should first take the user

7
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.000
to the search page and that search page is going

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.009
to provide a form where the user

9
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.002
can input the search criteria.

10
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.005
So all of these kind of mappings where you're just

11
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.003
clicking on hyperlinks and getting

12
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:28.001
to certain pages we will try to put all

13
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.006
of them together inside our Home Controller,

14
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.004
that's the common place to serve them.

15
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.007
So let's go back to IDE and in the Home Controller

16
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.008
I'm going to add a simple Get Mapping.

17
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.007
Let's call it Go To Search so it becomes

18
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:46.009
very evident from the name of URL button and say public.

19
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:50.000
Again, return as String and let me keep the name

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.009
of the method exactly the same as the URL button.

21
00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:02.004
Let's put a small Sys Out, going to search page.

22
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.002
This is just so that we're able to track the

23
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.006
entire flow that's all and then we can

24
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.008
just return the search view from here.

25
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:14.000
Let me spell that correctly, yes.

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.009
So this is a very basic implementation of

27
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.001
handler mapping or the Controller mapping

28
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.007
which will just take you to a particular page.

29
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.006
Let's copy this URL button and go to our Index JSP

30
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.000
and make sure it is attached there.

31
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.004
So if you look under your hyperlinks on the main bar

32
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:34.008
that's what it looks like and that is the search hyperlink.

33
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:37.007
So here I'm going to attach that URL button

34
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.003
so that when you click you should

35
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.008
be able to go to the search page.

36
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.003
Let's go to the next step now.

37
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.003
Next is we add @RequestParam and

38
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.005
more Model parameters on the method.

39
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:52.001
So this is talking about the search Controller class.

40
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.005
So let's go to the IDE and we have a search Controller here.

41
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:57.006
So now we're going to attach

42
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.004
few method arguments on line 11.

43
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.004
What are those?

44
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.006
The first one is RequestParam.

45
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:10.001
And let us give it a name, let's say search and this

46
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:14.003
will be mapped to a basic String type of a value.

47
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.008
In addition to that let's also make sure

48
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:21.002
that we have the Model object ready as a method argument.

49
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.002
So if you remember in the previous videos

50
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:28.003
we saw RequestParam, Model, ModelMap, ModelAndView,

51
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.000
and ModelAttribute and each of those annotations

52
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.006
is being used right now.

53
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.009
So if you have attached @RequestParam which

54
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.003
means we expect a parameter in the incoming request,

55
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:41.002
which is of this name and we should be

56
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.006
able to extract this in the Controller.

57
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:46.008
So let's quickly also put a Sys Out on line 15

58
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.000
which will trap that for us to make sure

59
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.004
that we got the correct text from them, request.

60
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:58.006
So search criteria.

61
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.008
So instead of doing the conventional way of

62
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.005
request or get parameter, RequestParam is going to

63
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:07.007
help us quickly extract that map it to the String

64
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:10.002
and that will be available inside the Controller.

65
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.003
Additionally, we're also going to have

66
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:15.001
the model as a parameters so that any information

67
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.009
that we need to display on search page after we

68
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.009
return from here can be put inside it.

69
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.004
Then the next step is map the same

70
00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.006
request parameter on the form in search JSP.

71
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:31.003
Yes, so what that means is this search name

72
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:33.002
that I have given to the request parameter,

73
00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:37.009
this has to be exactly the same in your search JSP form.

74
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.003
So this is already the same,

75
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:40.005
you really don't need to change it,

76
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:42.006
the basic HTML content gave you that itself

77
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:45.002
so don't have to worry about it, that's already done.

78
00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:48.009
Next step will be to add Product.javabean.

79
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.000
Right, so now we're going to start

80
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.001
creating models in our project.

81
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.002
So I'm going to add a package on Com.S.HPlus

82
00:03:55.002 --> 00:04:02.008
by the name Beans and let's create a product Bean Day.

83
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.008
Now what's this for?

84
00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.002
Whenever you search anything you need to

85
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:08.003
display products right, so we are going to create

86
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:11.001
a bean and it's going to be a list of such beans

87
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:15.001
that we tape to the JSP and display them for the user.

88
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:16.005
The first thing that we have to do here is

89
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:19.005
we have to mark this as entity.

90
00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:21.009
Now this is for the Java Persistence API,

91
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.004
the Spring JPA API that we are using.

92
00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:26.004
You probably do not need to do this if

93
00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:29.004
you're using any other database integration code.

94
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:33.000
Let's come inside and let's define few attributes.

95
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.006
So there will be one which is the ID.

96
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:41.002
Another one which is the name of the product and another one

97
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:46.002
which is the image file for the product.

98
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:48.001
So we are going to retrieve these images

99
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.004
from the database data and then

100
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:52.004
we're going to display them on the page.

101
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:57.002
Let me just right click and generate data sets for it.

102
00:04:57.002 --> 00:05:00.005
There we go, so our bean is ready and I'm going to also

103
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:04.003
annotate the ID property with the ID annotation

104
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.003
to indicate that it's the

105
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:10.003
primary key for this product entity.

106
00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:12.001
So the entire fundamental concept here is

107
00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:15.008
that this product bean that we have is now

108
00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:18.000
going to correspond to the product table

109
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.005
in our MY SQL Server, that is what this is about.

110
00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:24.001
I'm just saying, we are telling Spring JPA

111
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:27.003
that this ID is the primary key inside

112
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:29.003
the table that corresponds to this bean.

113
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:32.007
So this is all a part of the Spring JPA mechanics.

114
00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:34.005
If you really do not wish to use this

115
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:37.000
you can really ignore this, no problem.
