00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- Let's take a look at the differences between

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.000
MVC Controllers that we have used in our

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.007
H Plus application versus the Rest

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.006
Controllers that we used as part of

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.000
the demos in this module.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.008
When we talk about MVC Controller,

7
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.009
it works with @Controller notation

8
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.001
and always the details of the view.

9
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.008
When you talk about Rest Controller,

10
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.003
it works with @Rest Controller and returns

11
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.004
a Response Entity which helps you carry the

12
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.005
correct information back to the client.

13
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:31.003
MVC Controller will need a view as a return type.

14
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.001
Because it needs to understand where it's

15
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.007
supposed to carry the data and display inside

16
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.000
the browser.

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.001
It could be Java server pages or any other

18
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.009
view technology that you are trying to work with.

19
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.002
When you talk about Rest Controllers it definitely

20
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.005
needs JSON or XML as the response payload.

21
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.005
Because Rest Controllers is essentially

22
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.001
are trying to return data for you.

23
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.005
Lastly when you talk about MVC Controllers

24
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.008
Spring gets to decide the HTTP error codes

25
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.000
against which it can map the exceptions occurring

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.004
in you application.

27
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.003
We have seen the exception-handling mechanism that

28
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:07.002
has occurred in Spring MVC that are for implementations

29
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.006
of exception-handling and we've seen how Spring

30
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.004
resolves the exceptions for you.

31
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.008
But when it's a Rest Controller your

32
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:14.005
service class itself can decide what

33
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.007
HTTP status codes you're going to map

34
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.007
as a part of the response.

35
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.000
And we've done that as a part of this module.
