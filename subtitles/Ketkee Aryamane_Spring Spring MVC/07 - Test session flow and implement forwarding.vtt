00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Now that we have set up

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.001
both the controllers to log in and the user profile

3
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.006
for the session attributes,

4
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.006
let's grab the profile jsp.

5
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.000
That's something that we have to add in our jsp folder.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.004
So I'm going to go back to your chapter seven resources,

7
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.002
and that is already provided to you

8
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.003
and that chapter folder.

9
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.009
Let's copy that.

10
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.001
And paste it on the jsp folder.

11
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.007
Right, so we have the view ready with us.

12
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.008
The profile controller is also ready with us.

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.008
And the last step of this is

14
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:34.002
to forward the control to UserProfileController

15
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.008
from the LoginController.

16
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.004
So the flow that we have is like this:

17
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.005
the user will submit the login form,

18
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.004
we will enter the LoginController.

19
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.000
The LoginController is going to

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.008
store the session attributes,

21
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:50.003
and from here, we are going to move the control

22
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.007
to the UserProfileController.

23
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.004
Now that can be done with a concept of forwarding,

24
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.005
which is basically borrowed

25
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.002
from the servlets jsp api.

26
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.002
If you want to transfer the control offer request

27
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:05.004
to another resource inside the same context,

28
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.000
which is your web application,

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.001
then you can employ the concept of forwarding.

30
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.009
And how do you do the forwarding in case of springmvc?

31
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.005
Very simple, on line 27,

32
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:18.004
instead of returning the search view on line 27,

33
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.008
let's just eliminate this and return something else.

34
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.002
And the something else is going to look like this.

35
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.005
You're saying forward,

36
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.000
you have to use the keyword of forward,

37
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.001
and where do you want to go?

38
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.007
You want to go to the UserProfileController.

39
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.004
So let's grab the URL pattern from that controller.

40
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:37.008
Let's go there.

41
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.007
It's there on line 12.

42
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.001
Copy that.

43
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:46.000
Come back to LoginController and then embed that here.

44
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.009
So what we've done is we have forwarded the control

45
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.008
from this login, to user profile,

46
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:54.004
which means it'll now enter the UserProfileController,

47
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.007
getUserProfile method.

48
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.004
On line 13, I'm just going to quickly

49
00:01:58.004 --> 00:01:59.008
correct this method name.

50
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.007
It should be getUserProfile, not getsUserProfile.

51
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:05.000
Okay, we're good.

52
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.006
So now let's just build this,

53
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.001
and observe what happens.

54
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.000
Let's add a few quick sysouts,

55
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.004
so that we will be able to track the information,

56
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:15.002
and let's do the build again.

57
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.009
So I'm just going to stop this.

58
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.006
Let's come inside UserProfileController

59
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.003
and now that we have retrieved

60
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:22.009
the session attribute of login,

61
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.003
it is going to be bound to the login model.

62
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:27.005
Let's also make sure that we get the information.

63
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:31.005
So I'm going to go to sysout, saying, username

64
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.003
from session object.

65
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:39.008
So, let's call the getUsername

66
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.000
method of the login bean.

67
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.009
Yeah.

68
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.004
So this is one thing,

69
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.009
and once we get the username information,

70
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.000
the next part is to display that username

71
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.008
on the profile jsp.

72
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:55.003
So now I'm going to open the profile jsp, let's go there.

73
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.002
Of course it's a simple HTML file that you have,

74
00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:00.001
so what we could do is,

75
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:05.004
we could add that username somewhere on this page,

76
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:08.002
and let's see where we could possibly

77
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:09.002
add it.

78
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:10.000
Okay

79
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.008
so under the

80
00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.000
let's say the section,

81
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.006
you can add it in any section, basically,

82
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.009
it's up to the design of this UI that you wish to have.

83
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.003
You can add it as per to where your convenience is.

84
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.004
After the h1 class headline,

85
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.005
let's just add that here.

86
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.005
So I'm going to put that into an em tag,

87
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:31.009
and what I'm going to say is, "Welcome, comma,"

88
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:38.001
and let's access that username here.

89
00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:39.004
Now understand one thing.

90
00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:40.006
We are supposed to access that

91
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.009
using spring expression language, yes,

92
00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:47.004
but that username is from the session scope.

93
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:49.004
So let's go back to the UserProfileController

94
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.004
to ensure that we understand what we're doing.

95
00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:55.002
We got the information from the login bean,

96
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:58.003
and that login bean was retrieved from the session.

97
00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.005
So additionally, I could also do one more thing here.

98
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:04.004
I could say model.addAttribute,

99
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:08.001
and then I could say username,

100
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.008
and fetch it from the session, and put it in the model

101
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:11.006
as an attribute.

102
00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:13.005
You can do that as well.

103
00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:17.007
So you can, actually, now access this key on your jsp

104
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.002
directly.

105
00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:20.008
If, however, you do not want to

106
00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:22.007
store this in model attribute,

107
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:27.002
then you can also access this in this fashion.

108
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:28.009
Session scope is an implicit object

109
00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.004
in the expression language of jsp and it holds true

110
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.001
even when you come to the springmvc jsp pages.

111
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.001
So you can access it like that, too.

112
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:37.007
Now since I've already added it in the model,

113
00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:39.008
I'm going to access it only using

114
00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:43.003
expression language ones, spring jsp.

115
00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:45.007
So there we go, we have embedded the username

116
00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.006
on the profile jsp, so

117
00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:49.002
the flow will execute like this:

118
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:50.005
it will come to login,

119
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:52.008
it will be forwarded to profile,

120
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:55.004
it will retrieve the session information,

121
00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:56.004
set it to model,

122
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.003
and then return to profile.

123
00:04:58.003 --> 00:05:00.007
So now I think we're okay to build this.

124
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:03.003
Let's go ahead and do that.

125
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.008
Okay, the build has gone well.

126
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:08.004
Let's go ahead and execute this flow.

127
00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:11.004
Let's go to the home page first.

128
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:12.008
Login.

129
00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:16.005
I'm going to do a successful login this time.

130
00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:17.008
There we go.

131
00:05:17.008 --> 00:05:20.001
So we have welcome, and admin.

132
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:22.001
So let's go back to the IDE,

133
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.009
and if you see, for all the requests that we invoked,

134
00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.001
the interceptor definitely got called.

135
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.006
And we came to the LoginController,

136
00:05:29.006 --> 00:05:31.008
we went to the UserProfileController,

137
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:35.003
and we were successfully able to retrieve the information

138
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:36.009
from the session.

139
00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.004
So session attributes helped us store,

140
00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:42.002
session attribute helped us retrieve.

141
00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:43.009
And finally, the post handle

142
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.007
of the interceptor was called, too,

143
00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:47.007
so that the post processing can happen.

144
00:05:47.007 --> 00:05:50.008
So this is that basic flow that we were trying to implement

145
00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:52.007
with the Interceptors Demo.

146
00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:54.008
So if you want to recap that, let's go there.

147
00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:56.006
We have done this entire stuff now.

148
00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:58.001
We had an interceptor plugged in.

149
00:05:58.001 --> 00:05:59.007
We had a login controller.

150
00:05:59.007 --> 00:06:02.001
We forwarded from login to the profile controller,

151
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.008
and finally to the jsp.

152
00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:06.002
Now if you look on your page,

153
00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:09.007
we have just tried to print the username.

154
00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:12.005
If you wish, you can definitely go ahead

155
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:17.004
and make a call to user repository

156
00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:21.007
to get all the user information and then display that

157
00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:25.001
on your jsp, in a table, or in a div container,

158
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:25.009
whatever suits.

159
00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.000
So you can also do that,

160
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.009
because this method was primarily designed

161
00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.006
to get the user profile information from the database.

162
00:06:31.006 --> 00:06:34.001
Of course it did read the username from this session,

163
00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:37.002
and the rest of the information can be pulled from the db.

164
00:06:37.002 --> 00:06:38.005
So you can do this.

165
00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:40.007
Additionally, we also saw another annotation

166
00:06:40.007 --> 00:06:42.005
on one of our slides in the previous demos

167
00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:44.008
by the name at request attribute.

168
00:06:44.008 --> 00:06:46.007
That also will work in a similar fashion,

169
00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:49.003
so if you have any request attributes that you have set

170
00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:51.002
elsewhere in LoginController,

171
00:06:51.002 --> 00:06:55.001
then you can retrieve them using this annotation,

172
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:59.007
requestAttribute, give it a name,

173
00:06:59.007 --> 00:07:03.004
and then you can bind it to whatever type you want

174
00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:05.005
and retrieve that in your controller.

175
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:09.001
So it can be done very simply by just plugging in

176
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:12.001
those annotations on your method signature arguments.

177
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:14.005
It is that simple to set up everything.

178
00:07:14.005 --> 00:07:17.005
So let's go ahead and delete this,

179
00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:20.001
we don't have that attribute right now in our flow.

180
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:22.000
We just have session attributes.

181
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.008
So that's all.

182
00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:25.002
We have completed the basic interceptor's flow.

183
00:07:25.002 --> 00:07:28.002
We have also used the concept of forwarding.

184
00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:30.001
If you recap from the LoginController,

185
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:32.008
we forwarded the control to another controller

186
00:07:32.008 --> 00:07:34.008
inside the same application.

187
00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:37.000
So we have exposed that concept also.
