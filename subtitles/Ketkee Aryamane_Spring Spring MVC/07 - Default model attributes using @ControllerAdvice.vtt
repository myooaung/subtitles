00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] This video is for a problem

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.008
that we have already seen in one of our videos before.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.002
I'm just going to run through their problem again for you

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.006
and then you will fix that problem and then move ahead.

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.009
So, let's go to our application this is H+

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.004
and if you click on login, click on Register.

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.006
Let's say you enter some faulty data,

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:22.005
so that the validations fail and say Submit.

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.006
And if you remember,

10
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.000
after the validation messages were displayed,

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.006
the gender drop-down was empty.

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.007
And we had mentioned about this problem

13
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.009
in that particular video of validations

14
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.000
and we said that we will fix this or address this problem

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.007
at a later part of the course.

16
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:40.002
So now is the time to fix it.

17
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.008
What has happened is that when the error messages

18
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.001
were displayed on the form again,

19
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.005
then the model attribute for this gender fill

20
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.000
was not available.

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.001
If you go back to IDE and if you go to a Home Controller,

22
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.003
if you remember, this gender items on line 44,

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.006
this model attribute that we have defined

24
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:04.005
is the one which is bound to the HTML control.

25
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.001
Let's go and look at that, too.

26
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:12.003
So, if you open the register.jsp

27
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:13.009
and if you go right down there,

28
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.002
on line number 58 where we have the gender drop-down,

29
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.006
does an item's attribute

30
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:22.002
that is available on the form taglib of Spring

31
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:26.000
which is bound with the gender items are released.

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.006
Now, that list unfortunately was not available

33
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.001
after the validations run,

34
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:36.007
because of which on the HTML you do not see those values.

35
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.001
So, you're going to fix this problem. How?

36
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.005
Let's go to the IDE.

37
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.005
As a part of the exception handling

38
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.002
that we did in this module,

39
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:48.001
we came to know of this @ControllerAdvice annotation.

40
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.009
This is basically advice, a piece of functionality

41
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.004
that can be applied across all controllers.

42
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.003
So, no matter which flow is getting executed.

43
00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.005
Whatever you put in this class

44
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.008
annotated with controller advice

45
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.002
will apply to all controllers.

46
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.001
That is what we are going to do now.

47
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.007
So, let's go to the project structure

48
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:12.006
and inside our controllers let's create a class.

49
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:19.002
Let's say DefaultModelAttributeController.

50
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:20.007
The name could be of your choice.

51
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.008
That is something that comes to my mind right now.

52
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.004
So, I'm just going to create that class

53
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:28.008
and let's annotate it with ControllerAdvice.

54
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.008
And what we are going to do here is

55
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.009
if you remember the Home Controller,

56
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.005
we had these model attributes instantiated

57
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:40.001
on line 39, 44 and 49.

58
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.005
So, we're going to take this entire code

59
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:44.006
from line 39 to line 52,

60
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:48.007
copy it, come to your default model attribute controller

61
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:51.009
and paste it there.

62
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.004
Once we do that, let's go to Home Controller

63
00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:56.009
and comment this code out.

64
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.008
We do not want this to be in the Home Controller

65
00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.005
instead we will write a ControllerAdvice,

66
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.009
so that which ever controller flow execute

67
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.005
all of them will definitely

68
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.004
have these default model attributes available.

69
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:15.000
And once that is done, let's just go ahead

70
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.005
and build this application.

71
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.007
So, now since it is annotated like this,

72
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.004
it make sure that be in login controller,

73
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.001
home controller, registration controller

74
00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.004
or a such controller

75
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:28.009
anything goes wrong, anywhere

76
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.005
and any of the flows get executed

77
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:33.009
these model attributes will be available by default.

78
00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.000
So, let's run the application now.

79
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.009
Let me go to Home,

80
00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.004
let's go to login.

81
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:43.002
Yah, so you see, the login page got displayed

82
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:45.003
which means a login being as perfectly picked up.

83
00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.001
Let's go to Register new user that is also picked up.

84
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:51.002
And now, I'm going to make some mistake in the inputs,

85
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.008
so that the validations run, they fail

86
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.009
and then we have error messages, right.

87
00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.002
Now, if you see, yes the error messages have displayed

88
00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:02.008
and now you see that the gender drop-down

89
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.007
has got its values.

90
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:06.005
So, basically what happened is

91
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.002
inside the registration controller

92
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:10.004
when these validations run,

93
00:04:10.004 --> 00:04:14.000
there was no model attribute made again

94
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.002
to incorporate the gender items.

95
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:18.008
So, now, in our IDE we did it,

96
00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:21.002
so that it applies to all the controllers

97
00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:23.005
no matter where are you running the flow from.

98
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.008
So, that is one problem that you needed to fix

99
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:27.000
and we have done that now.
