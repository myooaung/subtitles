00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] Spring is one of the most popular frameworks

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.007
in the industry today, and its project, Spring MVC,

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:10.006
is being widely adopted to develop web applications.

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.009
Spring MVC follows the basic conventions of Java and Spring,

5
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.006
and can help you to develop applications quickly and easily,

6
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.004
because it does a lot of work for you already,

7
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.002
and allows you to focus on the business logic

8
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.002
of your application.

9
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.008
In this course I'll demonstrate how to set up

10
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.001
a basic Spring MVC application with Spring Boot,

11
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.007
and cover features like writing controllers,

12
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.003
views, and model components.

13
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll also cover validations, exception handling,

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.008
and will help you resolve themes, views, and locales.

15
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.005
We will look at the asynchronous processing capability

16
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.007
in web applications with Spring MVC,

17
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.002
and also learn how to open up

18
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.001
restful endpoints for your clients.

19
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.004
