00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Teacher] Now, the next step is

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:06.007
to add the Spring form tag library to the project's GSPs.

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:10.003
Now, Spring provides a comprehensive tag library

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.009
for all the data binding of our tags

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.005
that we need to embed as a part of HTML.

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:20.003
So we can just go and Google that, "spring form taglib,"

7
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.008
and if you see on the official documentation,

8
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.004
you should be able to get the taglibs in text

9
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.003
in order to put it on GSP.

10
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:29.002
There we go.

11
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.004
So I'm just going to copy this.

12
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.006
Come back to IDE.

13
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.007
Let's go to the register page.

14
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:41.000
And let's put it at the top there.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.004
So, we have the form tag library embedded on the GSP page,

16
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.005
and now, we are basically going to derive

17
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.008
all the tags for the form that we have

18
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:53.002
on this register.GSP from this taglib.

19
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.008
So let's go down there and start

20
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.006
putting in all the attributes,

21
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.004
and that, I believe, is the next step,

22
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.008
so you have to convert all the HTML form elements

23
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.008
to the Spring form tags.

24
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.002
So let's do that.

25
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.006
So the first is the prefix for the

26
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.004
Spring tag library for form is form itself,

27
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.001
so it will look like this.

28
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.008
The rest of it doesn't change,

29
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.002
and then these input tags that you saw on line 45,

30
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:22.001
let's go and transform them to Spring tags.

31
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.001
So it'll be forminput, and instead of the name,

32
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.005
you can provide a path.

33
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.007
So that path attribute on the form input tag

34
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.003
is basically going to map it to

35
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:37.003
the username property of the user object.

36
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.005
That's exactly the process of data binding.

37
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.007
So these parts now that you define

38
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.005
on each of your elements in the form

39
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.006
are supposed to be exactly the same

40
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.009
as you have defined on your user object.

41
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.004
Let's remember that, because we are trying to

42
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:57.002
make sure that Spring MBC does the data binding for us,

43
00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:00.003
which means those property names have to be identical.

44
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:01.006
So let's transform the rest of them.

45
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:05.009
Let's also copy form_input_path.

46
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.007
Let's copy this portion.

47
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.002
And then we can just quickly paste it

48
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.001
on the successive lines.

49
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:15.002
For a password, we are going to say, "form_input."

50
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.004
The path will be password.

51
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:21.009
Similarly, on line 47, form_input_path for first name,

52
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.000
and I'm going to do it for the last name as well.

53
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.008
Similarly, now for input drive radio,

54
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:29.007
of course it's not going to be form_input.

55
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:31.001
It's a radio button.

56
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.006
So in that case, it is going to change like this.

57
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:38.002
Se we are going to save form radiobutton.

58
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:42.003
You can get rid of type=radio.

59
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:46.002
And instead of name, we are going to say path.

60
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:49.005
Also, let's just change these values to a simple value.

61
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:53.006
Just say sport, and then do the same thing

62
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:59.000
for the next radio button that you have on the page.

63
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.001
And instead of "exercise in gym,"

64
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.006
we'll keep it simple and just say, "gym."

65
00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.009
So you have two radio buttons on the page

66
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.002
asking the user what activity she wants to engage in,

67
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:11.006
play a sport or hit the gym.

68
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:14.008
And then, again, on line 53 for date of birth,

69
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:15.008
it's going to be the same,

70
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:19.009
so form:input and the path attribute.

71
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:24.007
Now, if you look at the gender, it is a drop-down.

72
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:26.003
It's an HTML drop-down element

73
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.000
that we have to convert to the form element

74
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.005
from the Spring taglib.

75
00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, for that, the control is form:select.

76
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.004
So I'm just going to come down here on line 55.

77
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:40.008
Say form dot select.

78
00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:44.001
Path will be gender.

79
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:46.006
And now, if you remember in the previous video,

80
00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:49.003
we went and registered gender items.

81
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:51.008
Let's recall that, let's go to home controller,

82
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:54.000
and we had added a model attribute,

83
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
which was supposed to pull in

84
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.003
all the gender values as a list.

85
00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.005
So we are going to attach this

86
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.007
model attribute of gender items now

87
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:03.009
to that drop-down on the register GSP.

88
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.009
And how do you do it?

89
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:10.001
Through the items attribute on that form tag of taglib.

90
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:13.006
You can use the expression language,

91
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.005
spring expression language, with the dollar sign,

92
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.003
and you just have to make sure that you...

93
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:20.009
Spell it right out here.

94
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.005
So I'm going to say "genderItems".

95
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.000
And then close this tag.

96
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.008
So now we can get rid of the select tag,

97
00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:30.002
which is the HTML code.

98
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.009
We don't need that, because we have already done it

99
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.004
with the Springs form taglib.

100
00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:36.007
Right, and once we are done with this,

101
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:38.002
we have to close the form tag,

102
00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:40.005
but it is supposed to be the form tag of spring tag lib,

103
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:43.002
so it'll be like that.

104
00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:46.002
Right, so if we have the form tag closed correctly here,

105
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.001
and then we have used form tags from the taglib of Spring

106
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:52.008
to define all our input controls.

107
00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:56.004
If you quickly look at this documentation and go back,

108
00:04:56.004 --> 00:05:00.006
you also have Spring form GSP taglib,

109
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:02.009
and this is an exhaustive documentation

110
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.004
of how you can define many elements on your form.

111
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:09.001
So if you refer this, you might as well go ahead

112
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.001
and even introduce a lot more feeds on your forms

113
00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:15.000
and play around with all those tags.
