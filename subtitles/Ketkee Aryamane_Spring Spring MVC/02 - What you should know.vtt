00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- In order to make the most out of this course,

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.002
it would be really good if you're comfortable

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.004
with the Java programming language.

4
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.007
Our hands on experience on object orientation features,

5
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:14.004
exception handling, collections, multi-threading, etc.

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.008
will really be good to have.

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.000
It would be great if you're experienced

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.002
with the Servlet JSP API.

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.008
So, concepts like Servlet request,

10
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:27.008
Servlet response, sessions, thinkers, listeners,

11
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.002
Servlet config, Servlet context, Java Servlet pages,

12
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:35.008
Java Servlet pages stad leverly are nice to know.

13
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:39.004
If you would like a refresher on the Servlet JSP API,

14
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.000
then check out my link that goes

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.007
on the same topic right here.

16
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.000
It would be know if you would know Spring Core fundamentals.

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.002
For example, what are beans and spring?

18
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.007
How are they auto wired?

19
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:51.007
What as an annotation?

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.008
What is XML and what is Java configuration and spring?

21
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.001
And all those fundamentals will really help.

22
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.006
Next is Spring Boot.

23
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.009
In this course, we are going to build an application

24
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.006
on Spring NBC using Spring Boot.

25
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.000
Spring Boot is the de factor standard today in the industry

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.001
for developing foster and efficient

27
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.009
applications and services.

28
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.003
It will be nice if you have

29
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.000
some knowledge about it beforehand.

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.005
This course is going to interact with the database,

31
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:22.007
and for that, we have picked up Spring Java Assistance API.

32
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.005
How will we know this is an optional thing?

33
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.008
If you are comfortable with Java JSP API or

34
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:29.007
maybe some other free like hybernate,

35
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.007
you are free to choose that.

36
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.004
Basics of RESTful services will definitely

37
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.002
be nice to know because we are going to see how to

38
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.008
open restful in coins in Spring NBC.

39
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:45.001
Lastly, primary knowledge of HTML and CSS is good

40
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.004
because in our application we are going to

41
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.009
the double up GSP pages which will have a

42
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.009
HTML and CSS content that gets displayed in the browser.

43
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.001
If you would like to follow along with me for

44
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.005
the demo portions of this course, this is the list

45
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:01.005
of softwares that you need to install on your laptop

46
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.008
or your desktop or maybe on any environment

47
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.003
that you're working with.

48
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.007
First is, Java Development Kit, which is the Java language.

49
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:12.009
You can pick up any version starting One.Eight and higher.

50
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.005
The next two are Spring Framework Five.One

51
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.004
and Spring Boot Two.One.

52
00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.005
You really don't have to install anything there,

53
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.001
this is just to give you an idea about

54
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.009
the versions used in the course.

55
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.009
These are the ones that we will inject anyway

56
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.004
when we get started with the development of our project.

57
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:32.003
Next is, we need an integrated development environment

58
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:34.007
to do all the coding at a common place.

59
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:37.006
We have picked up Intellij Community Edition.

60
00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.000
And you can pick up the lastest version for it.

61
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.009
If you wish to work with Aclipsonic Beans,

62
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.007
feel free to do so.

63
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:46.000
This course is going to interact with a database

64
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.002
and I have chosen MySQL server.

65
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.005
You can pick up any other database server

66
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:52.004
of your choice.

67
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.007
We have a web application being developed as a part

68
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.007
of this course, which means we will need

69
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.006
to access that web app inside the browser.

70
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:02.004
For that, we require Google Chrome and we have picked

71
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:03.005
up the latest version.

72
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:07.007
You can work with any other browser of your choice.

73
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:10.001
Lastly, this course is going to look over

74
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.001
RESTful web services development.

75
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:13.008
In order to test them out, we need

76
00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:16.003
the ultimate tool which is very popular

77
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:19.000
for the testing of REST services.
