00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.003
- [Instructor] We are ready now,

2
00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:03.009
and we can now do the build, run the application,

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.006
and find out how different themes will be displayed.

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.005
So, let's go to the IDE,

5
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:12.000
and let's run this.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Okay, so now, let's go to the browser.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.007
Say localhost home.

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, now, if you remember,

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.006
we configured the theme change interceptor

10
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.008
so that every request that you make,

11
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.007
you can send the value of the theme that you want,

12
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:35.004
and it will then help you display that particular theme.

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:36.003
So, how do we do that?

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.006
Let's go back to the IDE once.

15
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:42.009
And if you see your config inside the interceptor part,

16
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.006
where we registered the interceptors,

17
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.003
we just instantiated ThemeChangeInterceptor.

18
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:49.008
Now, because of this,

19
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:54.005
what happens is that the query param key that you give,

20
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.004
the default name of that key is theme.

21
00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:58.007
So, how is it going to look like?

22
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.009
You will just have to go on the URL,

23
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.001
put a question mark there, and set theme equal to,

24
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.000
now, what is the theme that you need?

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you look in your properties file,

26
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.002
client hyphen theme1.

27
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.006
That is the name of the theme

28
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.008
that you should provide in the query parameter,

29
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.003
so that it is going to resolve that for you

30
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.009
and then display that theme accordingly.

31
00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.007
So, let's go back and say client-theme1.

32
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.008
There we go.

33
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.001
So, that's the default theme.

34
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.005
And now, let me go ahead and say theme2.

35
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:32.003
So, did you see?

36
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.004
That the font size now decreased,

37
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.002
and that look and feel is a little different.

38
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.001
And I also had change this color

39
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.002
to maroon instead of yellow.

40
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.001
So, these are just a couple of properties

41
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.006
that I have changed in the CSS file.

42
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.000
And there's a host of properties that you can configure

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.005
so that you have a drastically different theme

44
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:52.006
for your application.

45
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:53.009
But this is just for the demo purpose,

46
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.006
so we just reduced the font size

47
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.002
and changed few colors here and there.

48
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:58.000
So that is how it is.

49
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.002
Another thing to note here is,

50
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:03.005
I'm going to right click on this browser and say Inspect.

51
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.003
And if you go on the Application tab,

52
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.002
let me just first modify the appearance of this dock.

53
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.009
Yeah, let it dock at the bottom.

54
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.005
So, if you go to the Application,

55
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:17.005
and if you look in the Cookies section under Storage,

56
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:18.003
you see?

57
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.005
That is the cookie that it is storing for you.

58
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.008
So, the theme change interceptor is going to be able to

59
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:27.007
tap this query param from the URL,

60
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.007
and using the cookie resolver,

61
00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:33.003
it is going to store that as a cookie inside your browser.

62
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:37.000
That's what we had configured in our application config.
