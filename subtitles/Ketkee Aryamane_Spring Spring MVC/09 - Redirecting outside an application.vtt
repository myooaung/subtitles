00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] When we did the complete interceptors flow,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.002
we had employed the concept of forwarding.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.000
In this quick video, we are going to also explore

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.009
the concept of redirection.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.008
So forwarding is trying to forward the control

6
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.008
to a resource within your context.

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.008
But if you want to go outside your application,

8
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:20.003
let's say you are in HPlus right now,

9
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.008
and you want to go to LinkedIn, or some other website,

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.008
then how do you redirect your control

11
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.003
to those other websites?

12
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:27.005
That's what we'll do now.

13
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.004
Basically, in the application, let's build this again,

14
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.006
and find out where we are going to do redirection in HPlus.

15
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.000
So I'm just going to open the home,

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.008
and this link that you see, the one that is pointing

17
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:44.001
to the LinkedIn hyperlink, that's the link

18
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.003
we want to work out.

19
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.006
When we click here, we should be able to go to LinkedIn.

20
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.001
That is called redirection.

21
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.001
You're leaving your application

22
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.003
and going to a completely different context,

23
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.008
completely different application.

24
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.007
So let's work that out.

25
00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:00.004
Let's come back to IDE, and on the controllers,

26
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:06.001
let's write another Class, let's say redirection controller,

27
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:11.006
and needless to say, annotated with controller,

28
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.004
let's say GetMapping.

29
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.000
(keyboard clicking)

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.003
I'm going to provide it a URL pattern followed by a method.

31
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.007
Can name this method anything, I have chosen

32
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.008
the redirect out, let's put a sys out if needed.

33
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.006
We really don't need this now, but nevertheless.

34
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.005
And then, how we are going to redirect.

35
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:40.001
So when we did forwarding, we wrote the forward

36
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.004
keyword first, and then the URL mapping next to it.

37
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.000
So in the redirect also, there's a similar approach,

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.007
you have to write out the redirect keyword,

39
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:53.009
and now this one is going to demand an absolute URL,

40
00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.000
so this will be http://www.linkedin.com.

41
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.009
So this is the absolute URL,

42
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's what you absolutely need

43
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.003
in order to do this redirection.

44
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.002
When you were forwarding, let's just go back to

45
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.002
login control and recap that,

46
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.006
we just made sure that the URL pattern was inputted,

47
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:16.002
and it just moved in to profile controller

48
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.002
because it was within the same context.

49
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.008
Redirection, however, will demand from you

50
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.004
a complete absolute URL.

51
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.008
So let's run the build again.

52
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.009
Oh, but before that, we also need to make a change,

53
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.005
let's grab this URL pattern,

54
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:34.008
go to the index page, index JSP,

55
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:39.003
and let's now put it right there.

56
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:42.004
Similarly, we are also going to make all the pages working,

57
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:45.009
so let's go to login pages, and embed

58
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.004
that URL pattern there too.

59
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:52.008
Similarly, let's do for profile,

60
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:56.002
for the register,

61
00:02:56.002 --> 00:03:02.004
and for the search, so on all the a href links

62
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.005
that we had, which were supposed to link us

63
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:09.002
to the LinkedIn application, have now been completed.

64
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:14.000
So now let's run the build, and let's see if it works well.

65
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.009
So let's go to the application again,

66
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:22.005
open a new window, and let's click on LinkedIn.

67
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:25.009
There we go, so now, we are on LinkedIn.com,

68
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:29.006
and we have left our HPlus context.

69
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:30.007
That's what has happened.

70
00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:33.005
So we have been redirected out of HPlus,

71
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.001
and we have landed on LinkedIn.

72
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.009
So that's as simple as you can do redirection

73
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.000
in the Spring MVC.
