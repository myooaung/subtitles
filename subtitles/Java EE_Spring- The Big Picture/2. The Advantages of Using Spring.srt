00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:05,982
Let's go ahead and start off with some of the advantages of using Spring.

2
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:09,394
One of the first ones is that almost everything from Spring,

3
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:13,646
especially the core projects, is rock solid and well engineered.

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:16,386
Spring has strict engineering practices and is backed

5
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:21,528
by a company that invests time, money, and resources into the project.

6
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:23,421
Spring has also stood the test of time.

7
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:26,908
It's been around for many years, and it's continued to evolve,

8
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:33,022
it's not a stale project, and it's also not the next shiny or new framework,

9
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:34,699
it's here to stay.

10
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,096
Spring has a huge community.

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,562
You can be pretty sure that if you run into a problem,

12
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:43,101
somebody else out there has probably already ran into the same problem.

13
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,019
And if they haven't,

14
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,151
you can be pretty sure that there's someone out there that can help.

15
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:50,907
Spring is very well-liked by many developers,

16
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,969
and in a recent survey from a popular

17
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,879
developer-oriented website called Stack Overflow,

18
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,563
Spring was part of the top most loved development frameworks,

19
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:05,451
and Spring also made the list as one of the most widely used frameworks.

20
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,080
With Spring,

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,391
there's a sufficiently large talent pool and hundreds of open

22
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,762
positions asking for engineers with Spring skills.

23
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:16,431
So whether you're a hiring manager looking to fill a position,

24
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:19,326
or a developer looking to learn a new skill,

25
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,983
Spring is very well used in the industry.

26
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:26,055
As I mentioned before, Spring has been around for a long time,

27
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:29,507
and the other benefit of that is that there's a wealth of

28
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,836
knowledge that already exists out there,

29
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:34,239
from books, to articles, to videos,

30
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,339
you can be sure that there are available resources to learn Spring.

31
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,208
Spring is still very actively developed,

32
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,089
and since it's an open-source project,

33
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:46,646
you can look online and see how active the project is,

34
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:48,427
and it's very much alive.

35
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:51,716
Again, since Spring has been around for so long,

36
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:55,227
it has a lot of built-in IDE support.

37
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:59,227
Many of the popular IDEs, such as IntelliJ and Eclipse,

38
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:03,316
already have built-in support and plugins available for Spring.

39
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:06,054
And just in case you're not sure what an IDE is,

40
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:08,306
it stands for integrated development environment,

41
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:12,351
and it's the development environment in which you develop

42
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:16,242
the code and having support for different technologies makes

43
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:19,131
it easier to develop that code.

44
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,269
Spring also scales,

45
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:27,163
and what I mean by that is that Spring is responsible for powering many of the

46
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:29,978
large and highly-trafficked applications that exist today.

47
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:33,612
It's proven that it can handle load and it can scale.

48
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:38,951
Now this is by no means a comprehensive list of all of the advantages of Spring,

49
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,373
but it should give you a good sense of why you might want to use Spring.

50
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,965
Now that we've seen the advantages,

51
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:51,000
next let's take a look at some of the disadvantages, or drawbacks.
