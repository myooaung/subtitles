00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.267
In this module, we looked at answering the question, is Spring a good fit?

2
00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:08.629
And we talked about the advantages of Spring,

3
00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.181
like how most Spring projects are very stable and well engineered,

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.670
or how Spring has been around for a long time,

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.542
and it's easy to find learning resources on.

6
00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:21.489
And we also discussed the disadvantages of using Spring,

7
00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:26.313
like how it's hard to debug, or how sometimes it can be too magical,

8
00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:31.313
and it's not always intuitive why something worked or why something happened.

9
00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:34.194
And we finished out the module by discussing that there

10
00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:38.009
really isn't a clear-cut answer to our question and that

11
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.628
every situation is different.

12
00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:42.682
We saw that we really have to weigh the pros and cons of our

13
00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:51.000
scenario because not every pro is a pro and not every con is a con depending on the situation.
