1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,728
Since this is a very high-level course that doesn't go into any of the details,

2
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:10,530
it's helpful to know where you can go to actually get those details.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,556
There's two highly-rated courses on Spring Boot at Pluralsight.

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,687
The first one, Creating Your First Spring Boot Application,

5
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:19,432
by Dan Bunker,

6
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,921
is an introductory-to-intermediary course for someone

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:27,762
who's already familiar with Java, but it's their first venture into Spring Boot.

8
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,534
The second course is by myself,

9
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:32,221
and it's called Spring Boot: Efficient Development,

10
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:34,035
Configuration, and Deployment.

11
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,766
It's an intermediate course that's a followup to creating

12
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,688
your first Spring Boot application.

13
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:44,213
It goes beyond the basics of Spring Boot and teaches the learner

14
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:46,705
how to write their own auto-configurations.

15
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:50,237
It also uncovers the technology behind auto-configurations,

16
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:53,407
teaches the learner how to make use of Spring Boot's

17
00:00:53,407 --> 00:01:01,000
external configuration management, and gets them started deploying their Spring Boot applications to the cloud.
