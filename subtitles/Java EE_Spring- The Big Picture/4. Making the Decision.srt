00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:06,007
So now that we've see the advantages and disadvantages of using Spring,

2
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:11,444
we're back to our original question, is Spring a good fit for my project,

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:15,049
my team, my company, etc.? Well, unfortunately,

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,423
I'm not going to directly answer that question for you

5
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:22,757
because every scenario is different, and no matter how I answer it,

6
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,482
I'll probably be wrong.

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,144
And likewise,

8
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:28,451
coming to that conclusion on your own will be much

9
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:29,971
more meaningful and thoughtful.

10
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,215
When it's your decision and someone asks you why you chose

11
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:37,520
Spring for your project or your team or company,

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,533
you'll be in a great position to be able to back it up

13
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,268
with well thought-out reasoning.

14
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:47,458
I will say consider the pros and cons against your situation,

15
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,772
as pros may not always be pros in different situations,

16
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:52,621
and the same goes for cons.

17
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,833
I would love to hear your comments in the discussion section

18
00:00:55,833 --> 00:01:07,000
on what conclusion you came to and why, or why you're considering using Spring. I try my best to read and reply to all of the comments.
