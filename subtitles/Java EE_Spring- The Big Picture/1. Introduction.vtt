Hi.

2
00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:05.822
I'm Dustin Schultz, and welcome to Spring: The Big Picture.

3
00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:10.482
Spring is one of the most popular, if not the most popular,

4
00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:12.226
technologies for Java development.

5
00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:17.924
It's used by thousands and thousands of developers and companies worldwide,

6
00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:22.289
and the goal of this course is to provide you with a

7
00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.663
high‑level overview of Spring.

8
00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:26.284
A ten‑thousand‑foot view if you will.

9
00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:29.125
So what can you expect from this course?

10
00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:30.546
Let's talk about expectations.

11
00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:31.228
Where possible,

12
00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:35.615
we're going to avoid the details and really try to keep things simple.

13
00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:40.979
I'll give you just enough detail to help you learn and understand the content,

14
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.417
but really nothing beyond that.

15
00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.341
And this course is particularly short and is probably the exact

16
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.975
opposite of what you would call a technology deep dive.

17
00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:54.221
Our goal here is to cover breadth and not depth,

18
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.327
and that means we're going to cover a range of topics,

19
00:00:57.327 --> 00:01:01.533
but we'll really only scratch the surface on each of the particular topics.

20
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.846
We will be seeing small, but easy code snippets,

21
00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:08.387
and don't worry, it's not that big of a deal,

22
00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:12.046
but it would practically be impossible to describe the

23
00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:14.665
benefits and usefulness of Spring without them.

24
00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:18.812
Again, if you don't know Java, or you don't regularly code,

25
00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.000
seriously don't worry.

26
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.047
I'll keep things very simple and walk you through

27
00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:25.416
step by step each of the examples.

28
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:28.219
Lastly, don't be surprised to see some hand waving.

29
00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.557
And by that I mean, don't be surprised if I gloss over some details,

30
00:01:32.557 --> 00:01:35.888
or I'm intentionally vague in certain areas.

31
00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:40.090
Remember, the goal of this course is to provide you with an overview of Spring.

32
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.960
We want to see the whole forest and not each of the individual trees.

33
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.656
The intended audience of this course is particularly large and broad,

34
00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:52.121
but generally falls into two categories,

35
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:55.810
individuals working in a technical, but non‑development role,

36
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.945
and individuals working in a development role who are unfamiliar with Spring.

37
00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.928
So maybe you've heard of Spring or you've heard others talking

38
00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:08.406
about it and you've always wondered what it is,

39
00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:12.610
or maybe you're a developer and you're currently using a different

40
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.541
technology stack and you need to learn Spring,

41
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.470
or you're just generally curious what it is.

42
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.000
If any of those sound like you, then this course is for you. Alright, enough with the introductions, let's get started.
