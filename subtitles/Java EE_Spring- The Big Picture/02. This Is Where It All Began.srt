1
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:05,666
The Spring Framework is what started everything that is Spring today.

2
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,306
It's where it all began.

3
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,603
And remember that when we say Spring,

4
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:14,598
we're usually referring to the Spring family or the Spring ecosystem.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:19,339
Enterprise Java development at the time was a rigid and complex process,

6
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,337
this was around 2003, and the creator of the Spring Framework,

7
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:24,189
Rod Johnson,

8
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,480
set out to fix that by creating a framework that applications could

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,595
build upon to really simplify the development process.

10
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:37,317
The Spring Framework ended up being very successful in this aspect,

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:42,659
and over time it sort of grew and evolved into what it is today,

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,757
and what it is today is actually quite different

13
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:48,167
than what it was when it started.

14
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,464
In addition to simplifying Java development,

15
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:55,558
it also became the foundation for which all Spring projects were built upon.

16
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,688
For instance, like Spring Boot.

17
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,981
Applications could then in turn utilize these projects,

18
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:05,771
along with the Spring Framework, to even further simplify their development.

19
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:06,083
Next,

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:14,000
let's take a deeper look at what the Spring Framework consists of and what it provides.
