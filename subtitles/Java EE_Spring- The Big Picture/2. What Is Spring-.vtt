00:00:01.907 --> 00:00:04.913
Surely you're wondering what exactly is Spring,

2
00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:09.015
and to be honest, the answer is a bit confusing.

3
00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.016
In a technology context when someone says Spring,

4
00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:15.909
you can be sure that they're definitely not talking about the season,

5
00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:21.160
but they could be referring to one of a number of different things.

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.090
Spring could mean the Spring Framework, Spring Boot,

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.715
Spring Data, Spring Cloud, Spring Batch,

8
00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:31.741
and a whole lot more; however, most often when people say Spring,

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.971
they're actually referring to the entire family of projects,

10
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.031
or the Spring ecosystem.

11
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's take a closer look at what the Spring family, or Spring ecosystem, consists of.
