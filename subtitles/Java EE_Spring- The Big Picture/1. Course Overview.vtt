Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.603 --> 00:00:10.133
My name's Dustin Schultz, and welcome to the course, Spring: The Big Picture.

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.597
I've been writing and developing applications with

4
00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.058
Spring for more than 10 years.

5
00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:17.865
It's a great and fun technology to work with.

6
00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.315
This course is a short introduction to Spring and provides a high-level,

7
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:24.992
ten-thousand-foot view of all things that are Spring.

8
00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:28.088
Some of the major topics we'll cover in this course are,

9
00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:31.366
what is Spring, what is the Spring Framework,

10
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.922
what is Spring Boot, and why would I want to use Spring?

11
00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:38.578
By the end of this course, you'll have a broad understanding of Spring,

12
00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:40.796
what it provides, and what it's used for.

13
00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:52.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey at Pluralsight to learn Spring with the course, Spring: The Big Picture.
