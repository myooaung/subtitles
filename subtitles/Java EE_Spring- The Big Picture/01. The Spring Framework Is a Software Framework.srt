00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,457
Hi.

2
00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:06,804
My name is Dustin Schultz, and in this module of Spring: The Big Picture course,

3
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:11,004
we'll get a high-level understanding of the foundations of Spring by

4
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,319
getting more familiar with the Spring Framework.

5
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:18,573
As the name suggests, the Spring Framework is a software framework,

6
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:23,074
and fundamentally, a software framework is a universal,

7
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:26,970
reusable software environment that provides particular

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,098
functionality as part of a larger software platform to

9
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,817
facilitate development of software applications,

10
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,937
products, and solutions.

11
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:37,688
Wow, that was a bit of a mouthful.

12
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:41,389
Let's take a minute to break that down piece by piece and

13
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:44,859
understand how it applies to the Spring Framework.

14
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:49,845
First, a software framework is a universal, reusable software environment.

15
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,052
So in other words,

16
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,575
a software framework is a piece of software that can be

17
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,603
universally used and reused and serves as the support upon

18
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:00,373
which applications are built,

19
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:04,357
and the Spring Framework very much meets this definition.

20
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:08,115
Second, a software framework provides particular functionality,

21
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,557
and as this would suggest, it's pretty straightforward.

22
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:12,722
So for instance, in the case of the Spring Framework,

23
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:15,415
the Spring Framework provides functionality for things

24
00:01:15,415 --> 00:01:17,782
like web development and data access.

25
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:22,421
Third, a software framework is part of a larger software platform.

26
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,185
Again, this is also pretty straightforward.

27
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:29,882
It's just saying that a software framework doesn't exist entirely on its own.

28
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,945
It's usually part of something else.

29
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:32,977
So for instance,

30
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:38,307
like this Spring Framework is part of the larger software platform called Java.

31
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,102
And last,

32
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:42,746
a software framework facilitates the development of software applications,

33
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:44,134
products, and solutions.

34
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:48,821
In other words, it makes the development of applications easier,

35
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:54,082
just like the Spring Framework makes the development of applications easier.

36
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,942
Now that we understand the purpose of the Spring Framework,

37
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:05,000
let's take a moment to understand how it began and where it fits in to the larger picture that is Spring.
