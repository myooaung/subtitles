1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,738
Remember that Spring Boot is a project within the larger Spring family,

2
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:11,920
and it can be used to build both web applications and non-web applications.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,027
And also remember that Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework.

4
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:23,478
It has a number of key features that make it unique and easy to use.

5
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:27,356
I'm going to briefly mention each of the most important features,

6
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:30,686
and then we'll go into each in a bit more detail.

7
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:34,839
First, and definitely one of the most notable features in Spring Boot,

8
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:36,157
is auto-configurations.

9
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:41,075
Spring Boot will automatically configure and set up an

10
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:46,896
application based on its surrounding, as well as hints provided by the developer.

11
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,723
Second, Spring Boot is standalone.

12
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:53,195
You don't need to deploy the application into a web server,

13
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,842
or a special environment, or anything like that.

14
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:00,077
You literally just run the application with one command,

15
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:03,680
just like you would any other application.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,467
And third, Spring Boot is opinionated,

17
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:12,782
meaning that Spring Boot has a chosen way of doing things by default.

18
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:15,117
And you're probably thinking, whoa, whoa,

19
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:19,136
whoa, hold on, that doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in.

20
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, hold your judgment for now, as being opinionated can actually be a good thing.
