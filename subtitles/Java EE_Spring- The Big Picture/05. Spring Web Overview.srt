00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,563
In this section and the following sections,

2
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:07,898
we'll focus on how the Spring Framework makes it easier to develop

3
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:11,171
services and applications that interact with the web.

4
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:15,838
Web support within the Spring Framework is provided via the web module.

5
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,949
And simply put, the web module, or Spring Web,

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,356
is a framework for handling web requests.

7
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:25,348
Web requests can be handled in one of two different ways,

8
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:35,000
either via Spring Web MVC or via Spring Webflux. In the next sections, we'll take a slightly deeper look at each of these methods.
