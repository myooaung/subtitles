00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
deleting an entity is very easy on your to do is tow it through the object from the DP and

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.210
then called the session Don't delete function.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.390
However permanently deleting record is not a general practice.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.220
Instead,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.180
we use something called soft delete where that a card exists but with a flag off something

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.730
like non existent.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.280
For example,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.040
if an employee quits the job,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.970
you don't want to delete his record.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.240
But instead you'll mark there as an inactive employees.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.670
But to show you how the village works,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.940
let's go create a new job class here with a package name off the exit.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.180
All four class them is me and I also are this main function and I'm gonna scream the same.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.450
Also,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.380
I'm no fish.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.800
This snippet which creates a session factory session begins the transaction,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.530
commits the transaction,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.450
closes the fishing in close the factory.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.660
So in order for me to import it,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.190
I'm gonna press command shift.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.190
Hold on,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.240
make sure that I select from our hibernate session and everything is ok now.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.290
So this is where I'm forced to do the object sensation Don't get category dart classed on

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.450
the I d happens to be one.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.520
I'm also important this category from my own entity package Assange industry available will

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.840
see one cleared the variable called semen.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.890
Now,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.760
in case if this idea doesn't exist,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.460
for example,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.530
if I already deleted this and try to run this program again,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.590
deleting a non existing entity will cause an exception.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.780
So it is better to check if C one knot equals toe.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.850
Know there is a station dot delete and then supplies the one and I love to give a message

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:55.730
saying that deleted successfully save this around the same.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.600
You'll see that it's going to send an obscure delete statement on it also gave me a message

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.060
here that believes successfully,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.300
if you're wondering why I got this message later because the actual collision happens when

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.000
you do a commit not when you call the village.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.480
When you call the station are believed Stephen Hybrid simply reports that and marks this C

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.650
one to be deleted and then it actually sends the ask your billing statement over here.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.340
If there even this once more,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.500
you will see that there is no error as well s.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.620
There is no message card deleted successfully.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.320
There is also no SQL billing statement.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.750
Fire
