00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.650
as you might have observed that the session proverbs operations based on primary kids,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.530
if I want to quite in my database table with the different quietest like,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.090
for example,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.840
if I want to get the products by price range are something else,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.710
then I cannot use session directly off course Session represents there.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.780
D be connection without decision,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.050
we will not be able to do any data atop.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.840
But in order for quiet is that in one's multiple objects,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.660
we use something called hybrid query language.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.540
For example,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.290
if I want to get all the categories in my database table,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.270
we can use this hedge your so to demonstrate the same,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.850
I'm gonna take up a new program here,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.590
Call this as egg 08 and then called it says mean class.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.940
I forgot to add the main function I'm gonna at the main function by typing Main Control

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.740
Space Center.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.550
This time,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.190
I cleared a session object as a static variable because I want to write multiple functions

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.140
to test multiple hits.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.570
Your options for that We need to declare this outside,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.460
so I'm gonna die.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.300
Pierre Static session session.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.350
It's not initialized yet.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.970
This is where I'm gonna say Factory equals toe hibernate.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.530
Util,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.670
get session Sector V create the variable by Racine Command One are controlled one on

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.340
windows And then I'm gonna say your session it puts toe factory dark.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.060
Open session somewhere.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.170
We have to close this.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.150
I'm gonna say sessions are close.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.830
Make sure that we import decision from hibernate accidentally came from hedge to someone

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.370
Delete this press command shift or and make sure to choose from auto hibernate session.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.990
Now let's say we want to get the list off all the categories.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.150
We have someone read a function here card static.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:00.450
Why get all categories and my quality would look something like this.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.340
We say you select,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.310
see from category C.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.230
As you may see,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.220
that this looks very similar to that off SQL structured query language.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.150
But this is not structured query language because we do not quietly the tables here.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.750
What you see here is actually a class called category,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.750
which is our own category class.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.580
You can also take the fully qualified class name along with the package which we don't need

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.950
to do.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.760
So here it looks like as if we created a variable call see off type category and were

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.820
simply selecting the entire category object without giving any very condition,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.040
which means that every possible category object will now buried here from the TV.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.190
Ultimately,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.240
if you are not going to use this variable called C for anything else,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.960
you can remove this from here and then simply say from category.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.350
In order for me to execute this hedge,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.730
your quieting we first need to create a quiet,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:09.630
valuable by typing session dot create quality And then we specified what is the it's cure,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.640
which is this and then the result.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.040
That type happens to be category dark.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.620
Plus,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.570
we haven't created this variable cure one surks giving me an error.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.470
I press command one or controlled one on windows and you can see that we get a quiet e type

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.750
which can give me a result off category objects.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860
All I have to do now is to pay your way,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.660
dot get result list,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.810
which is going to return me a list off category objects.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.520
I can present the your variable port list press command one or controlled one toe get their

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.010
automatically created.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.330
And now I have a list off all category objects if I want back.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.920
And also sensations are close here and then literate over this.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.260
But I'm doing the fishing dark clothes in the main function to bring the names off all the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.040
categories.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.170
We can simply looked through this category C in list and then type your C don't get

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.080
category name.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.480
Let us also call this function from the main here so that we can test this.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.560
I saved this and run the program,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.450
and I should see the list off all the categories in our database table.
