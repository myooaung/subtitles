00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
So let's not clear the new program toe.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.910
Retrieve the same category based on the I d.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.670
So let's right click New class and then angle changes toe you zero to I call the classes

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.030
main enter.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.550
I forgot to selector had made function 70 years mean controlled space and selector Main

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.020
method Over here I'm gonna say your factory equals toe I've been a util dot get station

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.220
factory Let's control one or command one on Mac And then I get the station factory and also

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.380
are here trying finally block And inside this finally blood I'm gonna say factory dot tools

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.160
and then I also like to save your session equals toe factory dart open session We haven't

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.720
created decision Variable Let's create that bypassing command one And then I got that

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.840
somewhere in the end,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.060
I also have to say stations are close.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.770
Unlike the previous example,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.760
we're be inserted in your car which is qualified as Deimel,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.010
which is supposed to be given in a transactional boundary.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.150
Select statements,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.000
on the other hand,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.260
do not require transactions now,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.200
in orderto get a data from the DB,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200
all you need is the primary key value off the table that we have,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.750
which is categories on the idea here is one.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.900
We can just come down here and then say Session don't get and we can say What is the object

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.040
that we want High Benetto?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.620
Give us that's going to be category dot class and that from our in TV package.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.320
And the idea here is one which is the primary key value.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.650
This returns a new category object.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.150
At this point in time,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.310
hybrid is going toe.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.210
Read the meta data from this category.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.260
Dark Java Such a stable names column names,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.610
etcetera and generate an SQL Select statement based on the primary key value compared with

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.680
this one here and then introduced the data.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.810
Gets a present,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.060
said converts that presents it into a category object returns the category.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.800
Object to me here again.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.330
I have to create this variable.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.760
I press command one mental.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.450
I got the new category object.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.680
Once the fission is closed,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.850
I can still access their C one by typing Stephen over here.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.190
So if I save this and run the program,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.310
I should be able to see a select statement as well as the values from the DB so There's the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.050
select statement that got generated and this is the category object that we have returned

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.790
from the TV.
