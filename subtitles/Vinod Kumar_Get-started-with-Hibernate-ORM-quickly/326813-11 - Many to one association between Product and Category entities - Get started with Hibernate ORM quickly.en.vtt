X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to understand many to one and one too many associations between entities.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.120
Let's go first,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.100
create a new entity class card product.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.690
So I'm gonna right click on the entity Package New class here.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.860
Call it s Product.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.300
That's ender.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.880
This is also a plain ordinary job object.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.700
I'm gonna have some variables here for my rage.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.270
Indeed.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.360
Your product I d Breivik String product need.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.390
It also would have some kind of a quantity for unit.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.170
Let's give it a price.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.970
Double unit price.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.130
A product also belongs to a category.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.740
So the association between a product and category here would be like many products belong

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.020
toe one category.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.500
Hence the association is many to one as a general rule of thumb.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.380
If you have a foreign key in a table that is represented using a many to one association to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.330
say that the product has association with a category,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.030
it's created a variable here or can legally off type category.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.960
It's also add a constructor here and then generate Get doesn't set us by going toe source.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.910
Manu generate getters and centers select on say okay.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.230
And let's also add a to stream by going to source generate to stream and then say OK,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.330
because the two string representing even the category also,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.550
in order to map this your table called products that first are very entity and then at

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.910
their table name equals two products.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.530
Since we don't have this particular table call product because of H B M toe medial dark

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.060
arto equals to update Ivan,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.050
it will automatically at this table that's important.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.410
It's also at this as a very Heidi at the river generated value.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.990
Once again,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.160
like in the previous case,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.710
will our the same strategy,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.250
which is identity,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.760
which means they'll be an auto increment added to this particular field.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.640
We'll also say that this is Map trick column whose name is product underscore 80.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.360
This is gonna be a product name.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.210
We can underscore.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.200
This is gonna be a quantity underscored for Underscore Unit unit.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.750
Underscore Price.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.080
And this one is not a column.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.390
Matthew.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.760
If you just leave the category without any column mapping Hi bill.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.350
It will automatically assumes that this is a column in your table and it tries to clear

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830
such a column because we have given hitch bientot video.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.470
Otto.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.410
But this is not a scale or by which means there is no data tight called category in an RV.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.010
GMs.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.660
So we have to say that this is not a column by itself,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.850
but this corresponds to foreign key called category underscore 80.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:13.140
So we're gonna say here after many toe one and then we say a very join column.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.140
We say our name because toe category underscore idea.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.950
What it does is it's gonna create a new column called Category on disk.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.690
Already in product stable makes it to the foreign key to the primary key off the table

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.200
corresponding to this category,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.780
which is category stable.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.180
Now that we have this product class,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.130
we also have to tell in hibernate Do till that there is another class their hypertension

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.680
manage by adding this C of g your ad annotated class in three.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.660
So CFTR annotated class off class now high ability is aware that there is another entity

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.290
class.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.700
Now,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.040
if you run any of the previous programs I've been,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.750
it will automatically synchronized the entity classes and the papers.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.260
Hence it's gonna create the products table as well.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.760
But to see if this association works,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.380
let's go and clear a new job class under the programs package.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.130
I'm gonna call this as Exito five Package called the Class Azmin also are the main function

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.030
over here.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.990
Let's full screen this dealing the Tulu.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.390
And then I'm gonna face the snippets which we used Ugly wrestle.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.360
I'm gonna import the packages.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.280
So we got decision and we have begun the transaction.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.560
So I'm gonna create a new,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.460
broader topic here and then associate that with our existing category card beverages.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.130
So first I'll get the category for beverages by B C one equals toe decision Don't get.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.110
And then I take your category Dark class.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.780
Islay is one.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.490
And then the C one has to be treated like a degree object that also create a new product

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.160
object by taping product.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.750
B one equals toe new product.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.890
Let's give some values to that.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.390
The one not set for a knee off.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.550
Let's save child.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.860
He went door set one too deep for unit.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.950
Let's a 10 boxes into 28 bags.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.640
Let's give it a price off the tip.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.290
For example.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.170
Eating time.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.450
$0.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.660
Ideas automatically generated.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.520
But I'm gonna save people.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.370
Don't set category off,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.050
see one.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.150
And now if I come down here is a session dart persist.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.500
Even people will now be inserted with the primary key value off.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.550
See one as its Category 80.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.630
Someone like your system that other Prindle in new product state with Heidi And then I hear

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.570
people don't get product idea.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.560
Save this,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:05.200
run the same and you will see that there is a new clear to table command with altar table.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.190
Also here because there's a foreign keeping,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.060
added Aurea.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.530
This is to return the category object and then we haven't inserting toe products with all

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.530
these values and say you are upset with anyone It's going Have a look at the same.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.500
So first I go here and refresh this.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.600
You'll see that there is a products table.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.680
I'm gonna click on the products here,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.010
so select star from products,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.510
appears a kick on a run and you will see that there is a new product idea.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.480
Our pretender to I d.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.870
Here.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.430
The values help come,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.750
but importantly category underscore idea is one,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.550
and that's because we didn't association.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.790
Mapping over here,

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.890
many to one,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.890
also brings us other features.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.600
For example,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.910
if I retrieve a product object based on the I.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.350
D.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.920
The corresponding category also will be true to the monster.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.460
The same.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.140
Let's take another program.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.280
So I goto this package New class and then I take your package Name six.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.050
The program name is Maine.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.330
That's also have the main function from screen this.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.070
Get it off this.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.470
I would also add the basic course different that we have been using.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.980
And now we don't need a transaction this time because we're only going to retire the later

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.030
someone type your P one equals tow session don't get in NZ product.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.110
Dark class.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.850
I'd be off one that the newly added product and B one is going to be a part of object.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.280
Be close decision and then I'm gonna type your sis out.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.090
P one.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.640
You'll see that the product object comes with not only the data from the product stable,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.210
but also from the corresponding category table.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.430
So if I save this and run the same,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.990
you should see that the product along with the category has been deterred over here.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.730
And it says here category ideas.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.010
One name is beverages.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.140
Description is sort.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.400
You can see that it has achieved that by using the joint statement here.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.310
So it has joined the products table with the category stable.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:10.120
This kind of retrieval of one entity based on another is called as eager fetch because we

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.850
only ask for a product object.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.440
But hibernating went ahead and brought the corresponding category.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.000
Also,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.020
there is also another concept called lazy Fetch where you ask for one entity,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.640
even though there are other entities that this interred Air Force Two.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.590
Hi been it will only fetch the ask.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.490
The entity,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.520
which is called Lazy Fitch by default,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.440
many to one,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.820
is an eager Fitch on day one.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.850
Too many is lazy Fitch.
