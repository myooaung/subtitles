00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.430
all right,

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.250
Fire off your fig.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.790
My time for another typography assignment.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.460
We're going,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.990
Teoh.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.560
Put everything you have learned so far about Ty faces into practice.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.010
Just like in the previous assignment,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.340
I have arranged three text blocks.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.450
This time they are all in single typeface.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.950
Your task is to peek to form pairings for each text block.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.440
Plus,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.600
just like you did in the previous exercise,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.380
set the tie for each tax to achieve.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.270
Want good hierarchy and second,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.460
good readability.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.270
Just like you've done the last time,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.020
you will pick a total off.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.210
Six different funds.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.250
+34 headlines and +34 paragraph text.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.620
When you choose your tie faces,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.250
I want you to use what you have learned about type personality rewatched the video about

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.990
personalities if you need to.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.810
I want you to think about the contacts that you are choosing for,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.450
and pig a one off the typefaces that shows the personality that is good for that context.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.760
As you read the headlines,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.180
you'll notice the first act is about travel and why.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.890
2nd 1 is about cooking and barbecue,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.020
and the 3rd 1 is about technology.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.080
Now here's a hint.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.910
The type where the personality should before the headline for the paragraph,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.480
you should choose something a bit more neutral with high readability.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.940
By the way,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.880
if you're wondering why the tax doesn't and proper,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.440
I just didn't put the entire Arctic going there.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.950
It just been exert from some random blogger articles that I picked.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.420
Let me do a demo for the first month,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.900
so the taxes about traveled to the islands of Hawaii.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.880
Now I'm going to think about what sort of typeface can display that feeling of travel to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.140
beautiful sandy beaches to get a batter feel off style off such theme.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.990
I'm going to go some images of Hawaii and see if there is some sort of style off a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.750
typographer that he's used locally in Hawaii.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.210
With a quick search,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.660
I can see that there are sexually certain typefaces that are used in Hawaiian theme.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.980
This,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.810
for example,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.450
not also search for things like postcards and signs and Ally.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:23.970
Look at that.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.190
Now.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.740
I have authentic examples of topography that is actually in use on the islands,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.670
and that will remind people of Hawaii.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.030
It seems like the script 100 typefaces the way to go.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.000
Let's see what I can find on Google phones that matches thes theme.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.040
I'm going to filter only handwriting phones and well paced in our tax to give me the exact

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.850
demonstration.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:55.190
You can see that there are several phones that can be quite suitable.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.010
Thes dancing scraped,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.550
for example,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.420
looks good.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.070
Pay attention to the front name.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.200
A lot of times they will give you the hint on what's the theme off the front?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.110
Because I googled some images and Rio examples before and I was able to get the right field

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.850
for Hawaii.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.280
Now picking the phone is much easier because I can recognise similarities in the postcards

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.300
and signs is a browse phones?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.440
I'm also looking for those that have high irritability.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.210
It doesn't matter that it's a headline.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.330
I still wanted to be reasonable,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.430
difficult to read.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.900
Phones like these are going to be a bad choice,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.340
no matter how good they look.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.710
Okay,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.490
I think I have enough to choose from.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.450
Now I'm going to read the manual off these phones that have selected to see what where they

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.310
intended for First is dancing star already see a problem with this phone on capitalize

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.320
sentence like in my headline.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.810
The readability was better.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.540
But in lower case wars,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.130
the readability significantly decreased.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.540
Yes,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.430
I'm going to use upper case for my headline,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.190
but what if I change?

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.810
My mind very much limits my options.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.520
The second is Kao Shan script caution.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.520
Not sure the description of the phone is quite neutral.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.600
It doesn't look like it was intended for a very limited to him.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.870
It looks quite fun and laid back just the way I would imagine being in Hawaii,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.050
So I'm going to go with it.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.050
-

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:45.410
One

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.950
thing you'll notice here is that headline isn't really aligned with the paragraph.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.170
This happens a lot with large display tax.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.520
They have extra space,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.940
and you'll need to fix this manually.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.050
Otherwise the design will look on aligned.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.590
Remember our lesson about optical illusions.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.980
Ruler isn't what matters in design.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.820
It's the I.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.750
If something looks not align than its not aligned Done.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.560
Now it looks on the dot But the paragraph I'm gonna go with something neutral.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.250
The obvious choice would be a sense serif font.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:30.850
I'm going to change the textile to paragraph from here and apply to all specimens.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:42.860
This way I can clearly see how they look in paragraph Open senses.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.130
An obvious choice is very popular in an excellent phoned robot.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.100
Tory's another very popular phoned.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.240
I quite like Plateau.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.480
It's a very good fun that I use frequently.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.590
It has a very nice style,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.750
even on headlines.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.000
And look at this latter means summer and polish.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.710
That's certainly a perfect phone for our lifetime.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.040
This was a lucky shot with neutral paragraph tax.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.250
You don't have to go on a crazy search for the right on that was designed with exactly the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.950
same feeling.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:28.890
I'm going to make the paragraph more like a dark grey rather than a full contrast black.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.390
This is a great way to add airiness to paragraph tax without using a thinner font weight,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.650
avoiding styles for body tax because they're not very good on roll low resolution screens.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.580
There we have it to phone parents for our ally theme Taxed block.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.670
It looks exciting,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.960
yet it's stylish,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.490
and it's easy to read.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.870
Now it's your turn.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.370
One more thing on top of each tax book.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.030
I want you to write down your reasoning behind your phone choices,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.490
as you've already done in the type personality assignment.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.680
Remember writing down your thought process is going to get you used to thinking like a

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.340
designer.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.270
You'll start seeing things on deeper and more detailed battle on.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.600
Also,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.080
you'll realize often that you made a choice for a phone without thinking about it,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.640
because maybe just look pretty.
