00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
As for the hourly rate proposal,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.380
same time played in most part,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.560
the first differences in the price table.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.080
Of course,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.920
much simpler.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.960
Just one rate.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.070
Sometimes you might want to have different rates for different tasks.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
Then you can add an extra role and put a different rate for that service.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.150
I once did that with my first Wetklo client.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.850
At the time,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.980
I didn't have a lot of experience in developing and wept flow I just had done to practice

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.610
projects.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.860
But I had solid design experience,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.740
and I knew I wouldn't be very fast and wept flow.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.710
So I gave a discounted rate for the development phase.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.180
To be fair with my client,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.410
have ended a paragraph here to explain how things will work,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.000
for example,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.380
saying that you will build them every two weeks for the time log during that period.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
That's up to you and your client.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.540
How you arrange it if you want.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.910
You can build once a week or once a month.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.970
I've made a few changes under terms to like payment structure and the cancellation policy.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.910
Don't use these terms as a legal adviser,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.540
not a lawyer,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.050
and neither have created this turns paged on any legal framework.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610
It's for you in your client to have clear understanding on some important things.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.050
We'll talk about contracts in the later video when working with hourly rates and outside of

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.670
platforms,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730
you will have to use the time tracker Tool,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.900
the one that I use his top trekker.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.690
I've tried many,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.100
and this one seems to be the best,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.990
especially since it's completely frayed.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.020
At least for now.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.580
It is.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.980
It has a desktop app.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.290
Once I open it on my own,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.890
going projects are there.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550
Then I select the project and start tracking.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.730
Simple as that I track everything about the project doesn't have to be just design and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.020
development meetings,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.430
communications and so on.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.860
That's all part of the project.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.780
Put the link to top tracker in the resources under Productive ity section.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.740
More for lancing tools to be found there.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.400
For example,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.920
Wave.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.050
That's what I use for invoicing again free.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.120
They're also online proposal tools.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.710
For example,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.050
bonsai here has a proposal future.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.350
I don't use these online proposal tools because in fig Maiken design my proposal,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.580
as I wish making it fit my brand and overall have more flexibility But with these tools,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.120
I have to stick to their templates in case you want to give them a try.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.020
Here they are,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.910
the one next to it and co.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.540
Has the proposal future to,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.290
and that's your proposal template.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.330
Use it adopted as you wish.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.780
I'll put things here that I use myself and what I've learned.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.310
Throughout the years of making some mistakes with clients and getting into some

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.350
misunderstandings,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.350
you can use my experience as you're starting ground.
