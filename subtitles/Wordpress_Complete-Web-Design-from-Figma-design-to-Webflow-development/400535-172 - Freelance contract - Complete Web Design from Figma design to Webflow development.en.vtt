00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
this might be surprising,

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.850
but I actually don't do contracts with my clients.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.740
I can't be bothered with it.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.400
It makes things too serious.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.970
And even if things go wrong,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.780
I'm probably never gonna seek any legal action.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.480
So there is really no point for me because of that.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.360
I make sure things don't go wrong.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.770
Here are few precautions that I take to make sure project goes smoothly and I end up

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.550
getting paid.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.500
This mainly applies working outside of platform on the platforms,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.320
like up work.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.190
That contract is taking care of their.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.790
It's in their interests that you get paid and if something goes wrong,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.190
then they're going to mediate and decide who is right or wrong.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.790
Regardless,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.550
if you're working with a contract or not working with the contract,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.950
here are some precautions to take to make sure things don't go wrong.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.910
First,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.310
you have to make sure that you're clear with your client,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.820
and then no surprises come up any time in the project.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.820
For this.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.710
I use my proposal document and make sure everything is stated there that could potentially

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.840
come up in the future.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.970
And if some disagreement comes up,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.180
then we can always go back to the proposal and see what saying that when working with

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.380
clients across the continents,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.740
it's often easier to break a contract,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.630
but not as easy to break and screw up a human to human relationship.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.200
So when I work with GYNs and usually I do work with clients abroad and across continents,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.980
I tried toe have face to face on Skype,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.950
mainly because having a face to face,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.600
ah,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.040
interaction with people and having this face to face relationship established creates a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.280
different sort of bond between clients and me.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.980
And breaking this relationship is much more difficult if they're already seen me.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.690
And if we had to some interaction over the coal versus if I was just a some guy with a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.790
profile picture and a user name or just on email address.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.200
Plus,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.920
I can gain a lot of information on my clients by seeing them and talking to them.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.840
I use my bullshit sensors that Mother Nature gave it to me,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.030
and I can sense if there is anything dodgy and fishy about them with new clients,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.940
I always invoice them step by step.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.910
Throughout the project,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.270
I don't wait for the entire project to be done with and then finally send the entire value

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.580
and then,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.810
you know,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.100
hope that they're gonna pay.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.270
If I'm working with complete strangers that I haven't worked with and it's outside off the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.990
platform,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.550
then I'm going to ask for 25% upfront payment.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.240
This way I can balance the risk between me and the client because if I asked them 100%

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.080
upfront payment and they are taking the full risk and I don't want to put my clients in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.160
that situation,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.120
neither there will be willing to do.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.180
Or if I'm charging at the end of the project 100% and I am taking the full risk by asking

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.060
only 25% up thrown.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.520
Yes,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.350
they are taking small race actually themselves.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.340
But at least I have 75% remaining payments to motivate me to do the rest of the job with

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.200
existing clients that I've already worked with and I trust and they have already paid me

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.960
for previous projects than always paid on time.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.050
Then I can relax and I can easily invoice them at the end of the project 100%.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.280
But that's what I do that doesn't mean that you bought.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.240
That's what you should do as well a judge for yourself and see the relationship that you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.300
have with your clients.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.910
I also I often like to be trustful off my clients and kind of when I when I see that we

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.980
have a good relationship.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.660
I do like to show them that I trust them in that I'm not suspicious off them because that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.490
source off,

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.600
if I trust them,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.400
then they know that they can trust me.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.840
It's sort of it's a mutual thing.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.850
If you trust them,

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.600
then they feel this obligation that they have to trust you back and just creates a very

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.680
good relationship.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.470
But if I'm always suspicious about them,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.920
then in a relationship is going to call going to be a bit more cold.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.740
When you have a bad experience,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.700
adjust your strategy when someone violates yours,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000
trust and they don't pay you on time.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.070
Then make sure to change your strategy,

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.900
no excuses,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.060
nor second chances and ask for upfront payments.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.290
Only had a payment issue.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.600
One side was working with the startup.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.890
I did the website for them,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.260
and,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.650
uh,

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.040
they were waiting for an investment to come in and they couldn't pay me on time.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.190
And I have to chase them.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.850
And it was unclear when they're gonna pay me.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.080
I call them and email them on older stuff.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.700
They did end up paying me eventually,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.680
and the delay wasn't that big.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.750
But after that moment,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.590
once they violated my trust,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.660
that said for me And then after the moment,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.530
everything that I had to do about the website,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.190
I was just building them up front.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.050
They were saying,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.470
you know,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.910
Oh,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.960
can you have that this I was like,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.360
Sure,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.800
here.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.010
Is that from payment?

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.670
You pay me,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.310
I do the job.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.000
If you don't pay me,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.030
I don't touch it at all.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.620
If someone shows you that they're not trustworthy,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.250
believe them and take according measures.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.940
If you would feel safer to sign contracts,

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.930
our maybe your client is asking for one directly.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.200
Then you can generate a contract on bonsai.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.710
Bonsai is this freelancer solution,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.240
which has invoicing proposals and things like that.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.210
And they also have this contract that you can generate for specific design or in Web design

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.650
work.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.900
It's a really nice customizable contract.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.710
All there highlighted parts are what you added and put your information in the rest you can

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.860
keep intact because it's been generated by their lawyers.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.160
Editing highlighted parts are very easy,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.520
and they give you an option and ask you straightforward questions so you can answer those

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.850
questions and you will easily kind also feel in a language that is suitable for contracts.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.630
They've done a great job,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.580
so if you needed just sign up with bonsai and generate a contract that I've played with it

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.580
.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.600
But I've never used it on a real project.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.950
But if I ever need to all certainly use it.
