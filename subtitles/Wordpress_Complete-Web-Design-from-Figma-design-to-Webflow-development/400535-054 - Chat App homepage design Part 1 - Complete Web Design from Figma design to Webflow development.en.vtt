00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
In these, in upcoming videos, we'll practice remixing.

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:06.780
And this is going to be your first sort of full project from design to development.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.925
French will design a homepage.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.065
And then we'll take that homepage and we'll build it and develop it inside web thought.

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.530
We're going to take an inspiration and instead of copying good,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.525
just like we did with Figma as homepage,

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:22.080
we're going to remix it and we're going to use our own content,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.550
our own photos and our own colors and change some things if we want to end.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.680
If again, I found this really nice designed by

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.725
Filippo stitch in Balkan brothers on Drupal.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:34.125
Think you feel it for sharing outstanding work.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.455
But we're going to use Phillips designs as our inspiration,

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:40.825
remix it at a little and design a new homepage based on it.

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:43.700
This time I'm going to demonstrate the full process or I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.760
can show you new things that you will need to learn in Figma,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.050
it's going to be interesting.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.170
This demonstration is long and it's split in four parts.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.430
It's best to follow along.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.644
So fire up your Figma is always the Figma file is in the resources.

00:00:56.644 --> 00:00:58.745
First, let's set up our frame.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:02.225
You'll see that the width of the screenshot is 1442 pixels.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.910
This is the same size as a desktop framing Figma.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.770
Now let's add our grit to the frame.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.350
I'm not sure of what exact greed they are using on it,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.445
but we're going to use our own 12-point grid with our usual settings.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:19.535
Although let's match their margins on the edges.

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:21.350
Not the margin on the top now bar,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.170
but the one on the content to measure anything

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.860
and draw a rectangle and then check the dimensions of that rectangle.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.220
Is a 140 pixels wide.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.830
So we will use this as our margin for the grid.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.545
There are now It's a close match to their layout.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.390
There are some differences in their layout,

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.790
like the navbar sits outside of the grid and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
some other elements seem to have different logic to.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.675
But for us, we're going to stick to our Greet as much as possible.

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.450
Good, We're going to start designing the hero First,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.180
the background, pulling in our own custom colors.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.415
It's a great way to remain a work.

00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:30.970
Let's find some color inspiration on Dribble for your designs.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.255
I want you to source your own colors just like I'm about to do.

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:35.995
I'm going to grab a couple of options.

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:40.270
Just screenshot your inspiration or save the images by right-clicking

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.470
and save as well place them into Figma later, I really like this.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.370
Blue, yellow or blue orange combinations are exciting color pairs.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.830
Now I'll just place your screenshots into Figma so we can sample colors from there.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.380
You can place multiple images like this.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.855
What I like to do is to put one color as a background and another is a button on it,

00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:29.450
and then see how the combo works together.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.580
Some colors might work well and next to each other,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.530
but if you put one on top of the other,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.420
they might have a very low contrast.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.130
They're both quite nice,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.600
but I'm gonna go with a blue option.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.850
You can lock the background layer from the layers panel so it doesn't

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.345
get in the way when designing other objects on top of it.

00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:45.890
Now let's add the content.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.510
First, we have to choose our fonts.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.005
The fonts like colors are a good place to do an easy remix.

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:54.185
But sometimes we might really like the typography that they are using.

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:57.650
And we might want to use the same or similar fonts.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.005
If we know the font they're using rate,

00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:03.305
but if we don't or if it's paid phone and we don't want to pay,

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.050
then we have to find a similar alternative.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.850
That's what I'm going to do here.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.790
So you can learn how to look for a font alternatives.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.700
I don't know exactly what they're using in their designs,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.765
but let's head to Google Fonts and see if we can find something similar looking.

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:20.210
So I'm going to narrow down the results is clearly

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.050
a sans serif font and a little on the thicker side, at least bald.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.790
And I'm going to use the same tax as a sample because

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.310
that's going to make it easier to find similar fonts.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.710
Notice how symmetric are the letters.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.955
The letter O is a perfect circle instead of a usual oval.

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:44.470
And that's a good hint.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.660
The biggest tell is the letter a.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.525
It's not that usual a that you get in most fonts.

00:05:49.525 --> 00:05:51.985
It's a handwritten sort of style.

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:55.210
Those are enough hints to find similar fonts.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.685
Look, Montserrat is quite similar.

00:05:57.685 --> 00:05:59.620
The OH is circle as well,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.435
but the a's are different.

00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:04.850
I can use this if I don't find something closer.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.205
But there are Poppins is a really close match.

00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:12.940
That is a circle and a is the same style as well.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.130
There are some differences, but this is good enough.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.235
In your case, you can either use the same phone, pick your own,

00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:22.310
or source the phone from another inspiration up to you.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.660
Let's match the style.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.210
It seems like the weight is something like semi bold.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.855
The line height is tighter than a default value and that's a great design decision.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.460
On big headlines like these,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.500
you need a tighter line-height.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.755
Remember what we learned about their gravity of font weights.

00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:10.330
Also, if you look closer,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.255
you will see that letters stand closer to each other.

00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:16.870
This might be the default value for their particular typeface,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.245
but it's highly likely they decrease letter spacing.

00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:25.270
This again, is a good idea to have a big font like this looks best with a tighter space.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.340
We can decrease letter spacing from here.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.215
Let's for the body tags.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:36.345
If you zoom in, you'll see that they're not using the same typeface as the headline.

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:38.720
And that's probably a good idea because

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.305
the same phone might not be the best choice for paragraph text.

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:43.970
It is too symmetrical.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.060
The paragraph tags looks more neutral and generic,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.970
sort of like Roboto might even be the same.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.990
So we can use that.
