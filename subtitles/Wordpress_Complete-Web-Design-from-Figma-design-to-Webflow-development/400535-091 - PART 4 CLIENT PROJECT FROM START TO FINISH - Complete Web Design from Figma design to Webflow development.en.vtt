00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
in this part of the course,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.460
we're going to design and build a full project like we were doing it for the client.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.530
I'll take you exactly through the same process that I go myself.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.900
We now have a new project.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.850
You'll practice exactly what's involved in the rial project and take each step from Project

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.640
Brave tow,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.500
wire framing,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.970
gathering inspiration,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.490
design and then building and delivering the full enchilada to the client.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.960
We're going to use everything that we have learned so far.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.530
Plus,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.210
we're gonna learn much more concept that we haven't covered yet,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.590
especially in wet flow.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.210
For example,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.830
CMS,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.400
which is stands for content management system in its basically wept,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.850
flows powerhouse on how to make dynamic website and dynamic content.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.470
For example,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.850
blawg,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.940
where we can pull information from the database instead of just building a static page for

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.260
every single article.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.210
We can just have the database with content inside this database like a headline,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.820
the sub her,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.300
the name off,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.510
the author and everything and then just design and build one template for the article page

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.610
and then have the database pull the content for different pages as we as the poor page

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.750
loads and as the user interacts with a Web site,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260
the second big topic that we're going to cover his interactions.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.580
This is how you build interactive elements and objects inside workflow that can animate,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.220
move around,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.200
disappear things like pop art forms,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.700
drop Tom's animated buttons or scroll animations that something happens,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.350
hides,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.850
reveals or just changes form on a scroll and much mark.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.190
All right,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.560
so let's dive right in.
