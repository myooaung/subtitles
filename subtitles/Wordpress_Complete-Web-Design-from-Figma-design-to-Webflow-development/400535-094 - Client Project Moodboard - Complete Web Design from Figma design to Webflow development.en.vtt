00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
the mood board is something I always did,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.690
but I wouldn't share it with a client.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.550
I kept it a semi internal design process.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.290
In the beginning,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.800
I thought of design as an artistic process where you lock yourself in the room and week

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.900
later come up with amazing designs that completely wants your clients.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.750
But that's far from reality.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.900
Often your clients have certain websites and style in their mind.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.110
And if you just go without agreeing on this common ground and come up with something out of

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.710
nowhere,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.960
chances are you're gonna miss their expectations and you might come up with something

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.580
better.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.770
But if you're missing their expectations than you are,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.670
disappointing them,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.780
and if you agree on the mood board than the designs that you create,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.650
chances are are going to look like what your clients expected,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.500
keeping them happy and coming for more.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.330
You have already practiced creating above board,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.820
so we're going to skip that part where you gather inspiration instead,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.380
will use them,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.950
would board that I've already created for that team collaboration product I've just removed

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.630
and add a couple more shots in the fig mal file.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.400
You'll find this mood board If you want a little more challenge,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.450
you can use them would board that you have created in the same assignment,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.440
although I would recommend using this one and following along.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.650
And let's imagine that we have already agreed that Mood board with the client.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.070
Let's take a look at this example so we can start noticing sections and elements that we

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.550
like these were going to use as a hero section.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.930
I like how the green contrast with the image in the background also like this card layouts

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.370
similar to this from here,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.650
I really like this section similar to what we've already done in the remix exercise.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.250
I also quite like this testimonial cars,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800
and I love that blue color,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.350
so maybe we'll use that one.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.170
It's a nice,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.840
vibrant blue and looks great on a picture.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.230
Plus,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.940
it really fits the team collaboration theme cos especially bigger ones like Blue Blue is an

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.760
excellent color because it demonstrates cleanest transparency,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.150
improper conduct.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.890
But of course,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.040
they have to be good bullets because there are some that suck here.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.590
I like the split sections,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.930
and also I like how interface elements are incorporated with the photography brings more

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.150
life to the photos.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.910
I've also added this food,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.570
her shot.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.440
I lied to this dark style.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.850
So I'm going to do a dark footer like this.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.300
Sharing a mood board using Fig Mayes Very easy figure is a great tool for collaborating.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.820
Unlike other tools like Sketch or Photoshopped will require the use of third party APS in

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.070
FIG.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.220
My collaboration is integrated inside.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160
Here is how on top right corner,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.550
you have the share button,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.010
make sure to enable publicly access.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.400
Otherwise,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.410
they won't be able to see the file and then click compelling.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.020
And then just share this file with your clients.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.620
There won't be able to add it or do anything with it except commenting.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.400
But this is a good way to share the mood board that you are wanted to show to them,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.750
and you can ask them to comment on certain things that they like and certain things they

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.250
don't.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.150
Here's a little trick.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.180
Open a browser in incognito window and paste are Ling's.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.410
There you'll be able to make sure they can access the file and see what they can do with it

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.410
.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.860
I hated when I share something with someone,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.560
and they tell me they can't say it.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.550
That's just bad user experience and makes me feel ashamed when that happens.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.510
As Web designers,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.220
goodies or experience has to become the way of our lives,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.980
We should try our best to make sure that clients,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.730
teammates and,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.570
obviously users have a goody experience with everything that we share or create.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.430
Because if not asking who by checking it inside the incognito browser,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.350
you're able to see it exactly the way they would see it.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.660
Because if you just pasted inside your regular browser where you are logged in inside fig

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.100
MMA,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.660
then you're just seeing your own personal view.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.230
Okay,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.350
they can see the board,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.890
and from this menu they can access other pages on the file.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.430
However,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.250
they cannot comment unless they signing or sign up,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.760
and if they are signed in,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.320
they will get this sort of you.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.140
This looks just like a regular view.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.780
They can see all the pages and layers on the laughed,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.930
but on the right,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.650
there's only the code tab.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.060
These code tab is when we're collaborating with developers,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.630
For example,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.750
if we were designing website or an app,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.030
but instead of building it ourselves who are working with developers.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.090
Then we would share our designs with them,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.060
and they would be able to see the details for each element.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.310
The commenting future is very handy when you work with projects to comment.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.110
We have to click on this ad show comment option.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.350
You'll see the mouse cursor changes to this little balloon.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.650
We can drop a comment anywhere on a page.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.840
So when you share a mood board with your clients,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.050
instruct them on how to make comments and get their feedback on the examples,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.820
they can tell you what stars they like,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.350
commenting on specific parts instead of entire screenshots.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.740
Inside your view,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.050
you'll see this comments reflect instantly.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.180
Just enable the comment option.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.950
They will even show on the right side.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.180
There's no assignment following this video since you'll be using the same exact mood board

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.180
.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.730
You can find this in the same file where the project brief Waas is just on a different page

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.970
Up.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.220
Next,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.670
we're going to create wire frames,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.350
stick around
