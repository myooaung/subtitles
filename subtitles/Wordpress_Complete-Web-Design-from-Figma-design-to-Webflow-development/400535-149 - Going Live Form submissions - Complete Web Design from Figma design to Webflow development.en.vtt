00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Now let's give our forms a test.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.180
We have made a pretty simple form this time just a email address.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.390
We can go pretty crazy with forms on Web flow,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.140
but beat single filled or multi step 10 field form.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.360
They all work the same.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.040
Submission went quite well.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.460
This is a default behavior.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.650
The submission happens right on the page when you refresh the page than this message is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.450
gone and we can submit the form again.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.090
We're not limited to this version.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.280
We can also redirect users to a different page after the submission,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.310
like to a thank you page or a confirmation page.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.510
Whatever all we have to do for that is built that page and Web slow and add the Ural in the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.500
form settings you can either at a full Ural where the domain and https and all that stuff.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.470
Or you can just use that slash and the final slug slug is basically this ending that we get

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.520
inside the barrel.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.820
Like,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.350
for example,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.280
in the blocks in the blood we had slash block.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.190
So that's a slug.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.840
So you can create a page and then create that slot,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.960
which is slash thank you something like that.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.890
And they had that inside your l inside the red director.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.350
You're ill,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.310
and the browser understands that that means on our own website and not some other website.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.700
Okay,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.130
now let's see what happened to our form submission.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.050
Go to project settings and click on the form stap.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.770
If you scroll to the bottom,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.400
that's where you'll see the submission.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.450
There is a lot we can do with the submissions we can delayed.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.410
We can export it into CS V.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.290
We can said submissions automatically by email.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.320
We can provide an email address off a person who is going to receive submissions.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.220
Usually your clients email address,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.270
and they will get an email like this.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.360
I love that weapon,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.600
also takes care of face,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.370
and I don't have to get plug in or,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.840
you know,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.150
install some third party application to manage If notifications and all that stuff,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.750
we're also able to customize this email notifications when our side has a hosting plan.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.210
Another thing we can do is integrate form submissions with other APS,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.110
for example,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.640
to email marketing tools like mail chimp.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.360
New submissions can be sent to this email marketing platforms where your clients can do

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.140
their thing with it,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.490
you know,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.970
blast,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.880
new email,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.730
newsletters and promotional material and all that stuff,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.400
and that's all there is to foreign submissions.
