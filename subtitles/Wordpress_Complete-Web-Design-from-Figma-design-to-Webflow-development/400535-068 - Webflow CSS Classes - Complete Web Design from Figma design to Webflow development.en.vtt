00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
Let's now add our second button.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.510
To save time on styling,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.950
we can duplicate our existing white button.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.320
You can right click and then duplicate or use a control.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.950
C Control the A regular shortcut or command C Command V for the Mac.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.830
When you do,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.170
these two funny things will happen that you don't expect first,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.990
instead of pasting it underneath,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.980
like most other elements behave,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.250
it is placed next to it.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.140
This behavior is happening because often default display style that is supplied.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.920
Two buttons.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.560
We'll cover this in ah,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.550
upcoming lesson in this lesson.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.770
We're going to cover the second funding behavior when we try to make any edits to our

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.430
second button.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.580
Everything is being applied to the original.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.790
But,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.990
um,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.240
this is not a bug.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.000
On the contrary,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.870
it is probably the most powerful future of CSS and one of the reasons why CSS was created

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.800
in the first place.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040
This future is called class.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
We can have this button on 100 different places on our website and by changing,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.730
wanting stirs,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.330
we can change everybody with the same class inside wet flow.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.330
These classes manage from here a place called selector selector means what it says it

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.950
selects a specific class.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.570
There are other things we can select besides classes like Attack.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.880
But more about that later,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.550
when we need it.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.560
The Blue Square saying button is our class.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.280
If you select original button,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.840
you'll see that it has the same class.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.810
This is why the same CSS properties apply to both.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.260
But if we remove this class from the button,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.040
then we're going to lose all the changes that we made to it and go back to the default

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.200
settings or defile it with default properties.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.980
But don't worry.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.250
We can select the class back again and instantly all the properties will come back.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.440
When you're looking for an existing class,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.910
just start typing and Web flow will filter the search results.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.080
If the class already exists,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.630
then you'll see it here and you can select it.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.890
If it doesn't exist,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.450
then you can create a new class yourself and may meet whatever you want.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.530
Applying newly created class will do nothing to our button because that class has no CSS

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.850
properties applied to them.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.420
On a newly created class,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.700
we can apply new styles,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.350
and it won't affect original button.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.410
Classes are removable and can be applied to anything.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.170
For example,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.250
we take my pretty button glass and applied to the original button.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:23.300
Eyeglasses can also be duplicated or renamed.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.650
You can do that from these tiny drop down,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.350
just rename and heat enter.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.920
Duplicating a class is a good way to save time.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.670
Our Ghost button has a lot of same properties,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.450
is our primary abundant so we can duplicate those properties and create a new class from it

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.450
?

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.350
And now we can name it whatever we want.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.540
We have two buttons with the same properties,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.690
but different classes.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.300
So when we added one,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.310
the changes one affect the other in science CSS.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.700
We can see how these classes are presented.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.840
It starts with a period followed by a name we wrote web,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.040
so will generate code in lower case letters,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.890
regardless off the way where you write it inside the designer so you can use upper case if

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.350
you like.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.890
Spaces are not accepted in an actual CSS class naming but inside weapon,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.050
or you can use them with local than change that space into dashes.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.470
For any change,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.280
we need to make to the element we have to give it a class.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.410
We haven't been doing this so far because,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.590
well,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.570
flow actually does it automatically for us.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.590
If you select any element that we have already edited it,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.150
you'll see it has some sort of class apply to it.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.020
If you drop a new element,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.610
they don't.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.960
The selectors empty the moment.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.940
You style an element.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.270
Rep.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.410
Lois automatically generate a class name for us.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.350
You cannot style an element without having a class applied to it.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.320
When you look at the Navigator,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.250
you'll see that elements are named according to their classes.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.890
Let's change the name of our dear Block that holds all our content.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.500
Let's call it a container because that's what it does.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.300
We have applied very specific rules to this container,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.100
making its center in the middle,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.560
not stretching more than 1000 and 160 pixels and so on.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.320
This is a very useful content,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.050
and we will reuse it elsewhere on our page.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.200
And let's do the same thing with the blue box.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.890
Our Blue Boxes Realities,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.700
a hero section that holds everything inside the section.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.030
So let's give it some respect than name.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.720
Even more appropriate name like hero section all right back to our ghost button now that we

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.940
have a different class weekend,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.220
stolid as we want goes bottom is made of same material,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.960
but the background feel is transparent,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.620
and instead it has borders.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.400
We can change these in a similar way,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.430
as we did in Fig MMA under background.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.230
Open up the color picker and select the first value,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.250
which is transparent.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.250
You can also do this by decreasing the opacity slider.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.110
Same result has completely ghosted out of the page,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.950
but taxes still that it's invisible because it's the same color as our background.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.850
Let's change the tax to white.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.340
And now let's at borders.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.850
This we can do directly under border section it zero pixels.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.510
If we increase it to one pixel,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.550
the border will show,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.060
and then we can change color.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.390
Toe white looks complicated in the beginning,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.580
but it's quite simple.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.990
Style shows what sort of border we want to use solid line anxious or dots,

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.850
and those squares show on which side are re adding the border.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.800
Right now,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.160
the middle square is selected,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.650
which means we are adding all four sites.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.390
If we select the top square,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.450
we can add it to the top border only.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.610
Finally,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.460
we need to add some space between two buttons.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.760
What do you think we should use?

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.950
Margins or padding?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.180
Trick question.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.110
We can use patting,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.540
patting only ad space inside the box.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.560
Measure the space in Fig MMA.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.240
We use 30 pixel space,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.810
so we need to add 30 pixel left margin on the ghost button or the 30 pixel right margin on

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.150
the bill in the first button.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.030
All right,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.180
things are looking neat.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.620
So to recap in this lesson,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.920
we learn how to use CSS classes reaching West Floyd's managed through the Styles panel,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.020
we learn how to create new classes,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.300
how wet flow automatically creates classes for us and how to duplicate classes so we can

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.450
reuse existing elements on our page.
