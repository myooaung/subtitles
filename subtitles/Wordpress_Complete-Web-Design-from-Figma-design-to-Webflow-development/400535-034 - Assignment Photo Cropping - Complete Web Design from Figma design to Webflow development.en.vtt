00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
This assignment you will practice cropping techniques that you have learned so far.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.445
Inside the assignment file,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:06.960
you will see three frames.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.585
Each one has its own content and an image.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.510
I want you to apply different crop for each frame.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.150
I'll demonstrate how to apply this image cropping sin

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.715
a bit on the first frame named extreme crop.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:20.355
I want you to apply exactly that extreme crop

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.175
to the image of the boy in terms of the layout,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.405
you can do this in a split-screen Liao are just like you did in previous assignments.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.879
As usual style the content accordingly,

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.410
choose your font sizes,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.610
colors, and align elements to the grid.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.740
Second frame, I want you to apply a wide soft crop.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.620
I'll explain how this is done in the last frame.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.065
I want you to apply a color soft crop,

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:43.370
same as the white version,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.000
but using the color from the image to create that smooth transition.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560
I'll show you how to do this to.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.255
All right, let's start with an extreme crop.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:54.980
Extreme crop is very simple.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.185
You can pretty much guess how this is going to work.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:58.970
Instead of actually cropping the image,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.280
we're going to use masking inside Figma.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.140
This is an destructive method.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.395
The original image will still be there if we change our mind later,

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:10.055
I'm going to create a split screen and crop this image directly inside it.

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:12.320
Remember what we need to mask our image.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.690
We need a shape, in this case a rectangle.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.590
Now let's make this rectangle exactly half of the spring.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.630
We can have Figma do the math for us.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.750
The frame is 11152 pixels wide.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.150
Type 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.020
152 divided by two,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.420
align it to the right edge like this.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.385
Do you remember how to create the mask?

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:36.790
Select both of the layers and in the toolbar above,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.060
the masking option will appear after you have them selected,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
click on the mask where it's something odd has happened.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.510
Our image has disappeared and it seems like the rectangle is being maxed.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.520
Instead, if you look at the layers panel,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.540
you'll see that the photo is actually being used as a mask instead of the rectangle.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.790
But we actually needed to be the opposite.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.175
This happened because we had the rectangle on the top.

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:59.780
Figma will use their bottom layer as mask.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.135
So we need to move that rectangle on the bottom.

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:06.390
We can do this either by directly dragging the layer or using a shortcut.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.575
Now when we hit this mask,

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:11.720
we evolve, have it mask correctly.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.015
Here's another thing to watch out for when masking.

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:16.985
If you are applying masks to all objects on the frame,

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:20.075
then Figma doesn't create a mask group in the layers panel.

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:23.510
What this means is that after you add more elements of the frame,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.700
they will be living under that mask.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.310
So you'll encounter an odd behavior where you

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.490
try to look for something but it has disappeared for no apparent reason.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.720
In moments like this, always,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.175
always check your layers panel.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:38.135
It usually holds the clues for any weird behavior you experience.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:41.540
If you look here, you'll see that mask isn't part of a group.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.085
It just sitting on the frame.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:45.950
That means it will mask everything that goes on the frame.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.320
That arrow clearly indicates that to fix it,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.125
just select the mask and the image that you're masking.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:55.260
Right-click and click Group Selection.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.650
This way mask only worse to within the group and not outside of it.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.255
Now that we've got that figured out,

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:04.430
select the image inside the mass group,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.960
not the entire group though.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.340
If you click directly on it,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.455
the entire mass group will be selected.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.150
To select just the image.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.620
You can do that either from the layers panel or my personal favorite ways

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.510
by holding Control or Command and clicking on the object directly.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.170
Now find the handles of the image and resize it to create

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.355
an extreme crop effect and drag the image around to find your spot.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:30.590
Here are a few tips when doing this crop.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.395
You don't necessarily have to crop all sides him only you can hide

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:36.605
only one side of her face or of an object.

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:42.125
Goal of the extreme crop is to create mystery by hiding parts of the subject or

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:47.510
picking a small slice of the entire image and tell the story only through that slice.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.480
In this case, I prefer centering the lion's face.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.735
This works better with split screen layouts like this.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:57.905
If I was using a full-width layout than me beside crop would suit better.

00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:01.520
Another tip when you're cropping out a person or an image,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.650
this has to happen on the edges of the frame.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.060
If you crop image and place it away from the edges,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.575
then this trick doesn't work.

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:11.630
You actually get a very odd result.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.005
This is just an oddly cropped image that is placed on the Canvas.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.310
Remember what I said before?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.820
An audience has to wonder what's beyond the borders there fact,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.625
we are going for his actual like looking through a window.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:24.830
So it's not that image is cropped up,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.930
but that's all we can see through the window.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.880
When image is cropped on the edges,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.630
then audience can feel that image is going beyond its borders.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.630
And this is exactly the visual curiosity you are creating

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.790
here for different shapes of extreme cropping like we did in our horizontal example,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.725
you just need to resize your mask.

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:44.885
Select the mask layer in the layers panel,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:49.415
the control command click isn't going to work here because the image is, is on the top.

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:52.055
So you have to directly selected in the panel.

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:57.120
Now just resize it to your shape and position your image wherever you want it.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.330
Okay, Now for the soft crop,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.770
this is quite simple as well.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.470
What we need to do is to put a white fading rectangle on the edge of the image.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.905
So it smoothens out that final edge,

00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:17.600
left edge of the photo.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.480
This is done using a gradient fill, draw a rectangle.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.540
Go to the fill of this rectangle and on the strap down Option change solid to Linear,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.300
Linear, Radial, angular and Diamond.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.460
These are all gradient fields for some reason,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.895
Figma decided to save space and dropped the word gradient from it.

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:39.890
After you change it to linear,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.860
you'll notice that the fill of the rectangle starts from

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.190
one color on top and feeds to transparent color on the bottom.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.810
We want this to be white color.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.980
Inside the color picker,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.480
we have two colors,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.205
start and the end color.

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:55.894
We want start color to be white with 100 opacity,

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:58.070
and the end to be white again,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.905
but with 0% opacity, meaning transparent.

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:03.320
This will then create that fading effect.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.735
This here is the start color on the color map.

00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:09.560
Drag the dot to that top left corner because that's where the white is.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.825
If you accidentally click on this gradient line,

00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:15.140
it will change the location of where colors start and end.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.285
Just drag them back to their corners.

00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:20.030
Okay, do the same thing on the end color.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.850
Now we have a gradient filled with fading white,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.290
but this is a wrong direction.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.120
We want it to start from left and fade on the right to change the direction.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.130
Grab this handle here.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.690
Be careful not the box.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.830
You want to grab the line and then drag to anywhere on the left edge.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.130
What happened here is that we are telling you to start this color from this point

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.790
and then slowly radiated towards the end color.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.610
Okay, Let's do the same thing for the end color.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.790
These red lines are guides and indicate the position.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.895
Vertical red line shows that we are exactly on the border.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:55.070
And then middle horizontal line

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.920
indicates that we are right in the center of the rectangle.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.350
That's exactly where we want to position it.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.270
Now we position this field.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.640
Right at the edge of the image where it meets with a white background.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.205
In there we have our soft crop.

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:14.570
You can also stretch this gradient fill to make the fade more smooth.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.450
As you can see, the transition here is a little sharp.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.370
If you extend the gradient field,

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.140
then it spreads more evenly and makes a transition smoother and more natural.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.280
Now depending on the image,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.510
sometimes this will be not,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.560
but sometimes you will still have a little abrupt transition like this one.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.880
In cases like this,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.520
I duplicate the gradient fell two more times.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.845
Do I have a total of three fields?

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:38.720
You can see how it already improved,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.640
but we can still do a little more.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.105
You can take each rectangle and shrink or extend them,

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:47.225
basically creating three fields with three different widths.

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:51.215
This gives you a bit more control on fixing any sharp transitions.

00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:52.460
There is no exact rule here.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.910
You basically play with their positioning and sizes until you find

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.360
that sweet spot of the transition and the choice of an image matters to her.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.000
Some images work better than others with white soft crop,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.490
you want to go for an image that has a lighter background.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.110
For instance, daylight sky in the background makes a good transition on dark backgrounds.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.165
The white fade isn't as effective.

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.025
You see here it feels unnatural.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:17.045
And black background and black fade does much better job here as you can see.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:20.870
But the ideal solution on a background like this would be to pick a color from

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:26.070
the edge of the image and use that as a background for that fade.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.015
Let's do that on this example.

00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:32.210
Here's a cool Figma trick that can come in handy in the future.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.900
Right-click on the image and click flip horizontally.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.565
It basically mirrors the image.

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:39.830
This comes in very handy often, for example,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.750
when I wanted to put that content on the left side,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.245
but the image has a model on the left and empty space on the right.

00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:47.270
I can reverse it and done first,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.910
we have to sample a color from the sand and

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.700
use it as our color for the background and the fate.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.925
So select the frame, click Background,

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:59.765
and then sample the very last color pixel of the image.

00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:04.130
Zoom in real close to get a better handle and pay attention to the pixels from here,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.760
this shows which pixel will be sampled exactly simple,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.995
that lighter pixel that is next to the edge.

00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:13.340
The reason why we are selecting the last pixel is to create

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.950
a smooth transition as possible between

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.055
the image and the background without the gradient fill.

00:09:19.055 --> 00:09:23.510
Okay, now we're going to use this same exact color to create a gradient fill.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.125
Copy the hex code of the color from the background in

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:32.010
inserted as a start and end color in the gradient field.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.860
If your color picker shows HSB or other system,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.620
just change the drop-down to hex so you can paste the code.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:06.380
One thing to note, in case you sample the color from the background like these,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.155
which is an alternative to doing this,

00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:11.510
pasting the color code on the end color,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.055
you will get this a,

00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:14.300
not really a gradient,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.940
but it's just a 100 percent solid background.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.605
This is because it copied all the parameters of that color, including the opacity.

00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:23.510
It's using a 100 percent.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.090
That's why the fading effect disappeared.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.529
To fix this, just grab this opacity handle right here and decrease it to 0%.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.160
Now go ahead and apply those crops accordingly to each of

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.240
the frames and then submit your results in the assignment after this.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.920
And I will have a look at that.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.535
As you noticed, probably I haven't included the stretch crop and

00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:51.200
stretch photo tutorial in this video,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.250
but I have put a Photoshop tutorial in the advanced part of this section,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.010
which you can learn how to do and practice once you

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.280
sort of finish this course because you don't really need it right now.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.500
It's not that necessary to know it.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.695
But once you've finished the course and you kind of go through this main material,

00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:09.990
then definitely have a look at it and give it a go.
