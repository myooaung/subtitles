00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
before the Times of Responsive Design,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.260
the websites would shrink down on mobile devices.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.140
Many websites are still made like this.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.150
Until today.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.310
Just very recently,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.380
I was looking for some information about pain ears payment system and got to their help for

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.270
article or the Support article page,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.730
which looked like this.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.650
It's a shrink down version off their desktop site.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.540
Using this sort of website on the mobile phone is just super annoying.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.550
You have to zooming and move around and you know the drill.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.120
Luckily,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.780
with Web flow,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.830
we can use the power of responsive design in several of users,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.170
different layouts and very specific responsively out for their specific phones and specific

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.680
devices that they are looking at.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.170
This way,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.160
everybody's going to have an optimal experience with our website in the section.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.530
We're going to do exactly that,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.550
make our home page responsive and optimize it for different screen sizes.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.440
First,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.570
let's understand how wet floors with responsiveness inside the designer on the top,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.330
we can see the switches for different devices.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.790
1st 1 is best up.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.770
That's where we are.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.160
Then it's tablet mobile landscape in mobile portrait in technical wards.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.850
Recall this break points or media queries.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.880
They work like checkpoints,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.490
instructing browser to change styles off elements if a browser with is in certain size in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.230
pixels.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.030
For example,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.620
if we make a style change on a tablet view,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.450
then this change won't be affected on a desktop.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.600
This is basically adding an extra CIA says Rule that says it browser renos is a certain

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.750
size than show black background instead.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.980
And if we decide to change the background color on the desktop version,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.020
this change won't take place on the tablet view because we're overriding the background

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.490
color.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.570
This uses the same inheritance rule as everything else.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.050
Remember how combo classes carries all the style information from the base class,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.170
But moment we change a particular star on the combo class,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.310
then we are permanently overriding it.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
So no future changes on the base class will affect for the particular style.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.130
I say a particular style because that's an important cure here,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.500
just like classes saying with great points,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.880
we haven't touched any other style besides background color,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.100
so everything else will be inherited from the desktop version.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000
Every time we make the change like this border,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.750
for example,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.350
the changes that we make two different views on Lee apply to styles.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.670
If you change the structure off the page or add new elements that will be reflected

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.350
everywhere.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.430
Why?

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.000
Because those break points are CIA,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.830
SAS future,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.640
not part of HTML and in CSS with style things.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.810
We can't change the skeleton off the page.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.410
We can only change the looks,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.370
although we have an ability to hide and show elements using CSS.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.080
So if we want something on tablet,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.950
but we don't want it on desktop weaken,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.950
just hide it.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:02.680
This image is hidden on desktop version,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.330
but it's still part of HTML and still inside the Navigator.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.150
As you can see,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.880
another thing to note about style changes when you make a change on a tablet.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.600
Old changes for Cascade down to the smallest screen in other wards.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.580
Mobile landscape and mobile portrayed Will and Harry.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.650
Changes from the tablet and mobile portrayed Will and Harry changes from mobile landscape.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.420
You can override styles on smaller devices,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.280
but any changes on smaller devices,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.500
one effect or bigger devices These users Same inheritance hieratic you like classes,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.930
mobile portrait in harat styles from mobile landscape,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.000
which in turn inherits it stars from Tablet,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.150
which inherit styles from desktop.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.730
Each device break point has arranged to it.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.150
We can see this range using this canvas rece Isar,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.610
The tablet expands to the maximum off 991 pixels and shrinks to 768 pixels he considers on

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.010
the ruler.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.880
Below this means 1992 pixels is where desktop Against and 7 67 is,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.460
where it turns into mobile.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.070
The changes that we make to each break point applies to the range.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.170
That's why we have to check by re sizing the campus.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.120
Each of you to make sure it responds well by the full Web flow shows the most common sizes

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.020
in each view.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.920
On the bottom.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.710
When you re size that slider,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.750
you'll see that what floor shows common devices for that specific picture with?

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.250
This is a good way for us to see how many devices are being affected by our changes and to

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.230
make sure that we achieve optimal designs and optimal versions for the most popular device

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.710
is one thing to note were not able to apply specific staff for independent devices like

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.050
pink background on iPhone six.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.840
When we apply styles on the mobile portrait than that style is set for the entire range of

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.850
all the wits and devices who screen resolution false in that range.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.920
There's one more thing going to show you before we move on to optimizing.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.740
We can reset any style changes we make by clicking on the blue style and clicking reset,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.070
just like we would do with classes that resenting would remove,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.730
overrides and inherit value from the first higher level size.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.140
It even says here.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.840
Where will the style be inherited after resetting in this case hero section class for a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.750
tablet version that I couldn't in front shows that it's a tablet version is a shortcut.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.010
Hold out or option when clicking,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.370
and it will reset right away.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.520
And for the tablet,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.560
it shows that it will revert to desktop version,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.490
and you can see that with a small laptop.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.850
Aiken.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.690
So to recap,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.350
we're able to change style so far.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.140
Elements for four different sizes desktop tablet,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.780
mobile landscape and mobile portrait for each of this device times we also have an ability

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.000
to shrink and expand browser within,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.270
so we can clearly see how our Web page will look like for any number of devices.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.950
For example,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.220
iPhone six or seven styles are being inherited from top to bottom,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.760
from bigger devices to the smaller ones and not in opposite directions.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.850
So the changes on mobile are not going to affect tablet or desktop.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.500
But change on tablet will affect the mobile.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.120
All right,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.600
up next,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.750
we'll get down and optimize our page for these devices starting from hero section.
