00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
This is the opening title off the movie Gravity.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.080
Pay attention to how the type is set.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.210
Here's another one from the Dark Knight rises or this one from interstellar.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.950
Do you notice the similarity?

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.040
All three have a very wide letter spacing.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.690
Other spacing is one off the attributes that can change about the phone and customize it to

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.350
your needs.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.090
You can make it very tight and snug,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.780
or you can make it nice and airy.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.330
These sort of extra white spacing is called Panorama.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120
It's a really cool design trick,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.030
and it kind of creates is nice,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.620
finished and refined.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.620
Look and adds an extra importance to the tax and makes it feel like it's saying something

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.090
very important.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.090
If you're ever stuck with a very boring and bland design,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.970
you can set your type in Panorama and will instantly going Teoh.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.780
Give it a nice and refined look.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.290
For instance,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.760
if I need to add an extra title to a block off tax that already has a title,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.300
I can take that secondary title and set it in Panorama.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.540
Their secondary title now is very interesting compared to what we had before.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.040
This feels more deliberate it's secondary hands not competing with the original headline.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.010
It has its own specific style,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.580
so I'll be able to repeat these on other similar blocks of tax and be very identifiable.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.800
One big benefit off the Panorama typesetting is that it lets you shrink your phone to very

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.050
small sizes without losing readability.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.980
I've removed the panoramic effect here,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.460
and the tax has become much less readable.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.610
This means I would have to increase the size of the front,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.740
but this now competes too much with the main headline.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.550
I wanted to be the secondary information,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.720
but it has almost become the primary title.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.630
One thing to note.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.710
When setting type in this way most of time,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.230
you should use upper case.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.050
This effect doesn't really work while in lower case letters.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.450
Okay,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.850
so that's about white space.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880
But how about tighter spacing?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.920
When would we want to use that?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.180
One?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.950
Such cases,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.350
when dealing with large,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.940
heavy text on large text spaces between letters,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.800
are proportionately large.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.320
For instance,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.110
I was working on a website for a scooter sharing company,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.390
As you can see,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.650
amusing an enormous fun size that is quite bold and happy.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.800
The default letter spacing for these felt a little too spaced out for me,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.290
so I added a negative letters basic.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.930
If I'm using a very bold and large headline,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.230
I want to create a tax that looks bold,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.840
heavy and concentrating in one tight space.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.950
A refree letter Spacing is the opposite of what I want to achieve,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.490
so I tightened things up.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.250
In this case.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.580
Most of the time,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.570
you want to keep the default ladder spacing for your taxed.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.080
But in specific cases,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.780
you haven't ability to customize the phone to your needs to the rule of thumb.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.240
If you're ever adjusting the letter,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.540
spacing that increased spacing as phoned gets smaller or lighter and decrease basing,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.350
winning gets bigger and bolder.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.370
Let's compare these two identical tax blocks.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.370
It's same phone size,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.850
and the text is exactly the same.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.550
Their difference is in their line spacing or line height.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.630
The type is sat in aerial 25 pixel size.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.690
The left paragraph has a default line high,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.610
but on the right,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.090
one have increased it.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.370
The default line high value off area is very tight.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.960
This makes the tax harder to read and follow the increased line spacing on the second

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.270
blocks.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.210
Mixed text mawr Airy.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.640
It feels less heavy,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.600
easier to read.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.590
And even though it's longer in size,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.400
it still feels less intimidating than the original.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.200
Intimidating taxes something to actually Wolcott for.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.350
People don't usually read text on websites.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.110
They scan.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.820
They're frantically scanning for keywords and phrases to find what they're looking for or

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.650
to decide if the website it's relevant for them altogether.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.850
The text on the ride will help them scan tax easier and find what they are looking for.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.620
You can try it yourself positivity and try to read each tax as fast as you can't.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.300
You'll notice that you will have much is your and faster speed on the text on the right,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.250
The original line spacing will feel like running on a sandy bitch,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.010
a little draggy and slow.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.650
This issue gets extremely evident when we deal with wide text blocks.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.450
When you finish reading one line of tax in this block,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.890
jumping on the left to the find following line is a challenge.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.330
It's very easy to get lost,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.270
and you have to rely on connecting links with context or ah,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.650
finger or ruler.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.810
Old phones come with their own default lines facing and it changes based on the phone size

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.810
.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.770
Some phones that are very well made and well balance will have better line spacing than

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.350
others.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.790
This,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.360
for example,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.010
is one of my favorite typefaces,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.030
called Avenir.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.960
The default line Heidi's 34 pixels on the specific phone size.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.880
As you can see,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.930
it's not very different from the adjustment that I made for aerial.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.780
So in this case,

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.950
I might even leave the line spacing as its default value.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.050
Now there are times when you need to shrink the lines facing instead of increasing it.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.310
And that's usually when dealing with large and very bold tax,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.900
especially in upper case the default line.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.650
Hide on these taxes a little area for me.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.590
I chose all capitals and heavy phone to make the headlines purples heavy and strong,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.310
concentrated in one place.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.320
So in this case,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.500
I am going to decrease the line high just a little bit.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.810
Now.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.950
This version is exactly what I was looking for.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.330
We can think of this as a gravity have your objects have stronger gravity,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.080
so they push bother closer and lighter objects?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.730
Not as much,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.400
so they're floating in space and Fillmore Airy,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.780
speaking of phone points,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.930
lie regular,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.880
semi bold,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.140
bold extra bolt having black skinny hairline and so on.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.490
This that was called phone weights or styles or thickness.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.060
Every typeface will have their own set of weights,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.820
some more than others.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.010
Things,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.850
for example,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.790
are phone weights off.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.910
A very popular Google phone called Open Sense has five different weights.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.480
Area,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.190
on the other hand,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.450
has only two regular and bold.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.630
The typeface that has this little weights is very difficult to work with.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.020
On a modern website,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.930
you have so many different places that you need to protect on paragraphs on buttons,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.940
navigation bar,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.040
drop down menus,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.810
headlines,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.950
secondary headlines,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.490
footer links and more.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.100
If you pick one high face that has only two weights regular and pull,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.920
you will struggle a lot when you need to create a hierarchy and contrast between a headline

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.920
,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.560
an ESOP had you're basically left with the tax size to duel the heavy lifting regular white

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.080
tax on dark background sometimes looks boulder To compensate for this optical illusion,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.320
you may want to use the lighter weight.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.950
The tax on these two cars now looks like their same weight But on the previous example,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.270
the right taxed looked heavier.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.530
Let me show you that one more time,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.050
light and regular,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:04.590
another situation where we might need to adjust the weight off the phone is on large text

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.470
has increased the size off the phone.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.200
It becomes heavier both of this irregular weight in this case.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.700
But because the first is much larger,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.000
it's bodies thicker and heavier.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.030
Sometimes we wanted to look similar weight,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.310
just different sizes.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.390
In such scenario,

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.190
we will have to pair the light and regular styles.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.290
Now the large tax and smaller text feel more like they are off same weight.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.350
You can do this in the other direction to by making the smaller attacks a little bolder,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.350
you'll need something like semi bald.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.050
In this case,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.370
if you're typeface doesn't have enough weights,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.890
then your hands are tight and you won't be able to achieve optimal results.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.070
Pick typefaces that are versatile and have sufficient number of weights.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.370
Most motor and general used tie faces today will have at least four ways,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.940
which is decent enough.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.250
Some complete tie faces will have nine different weights,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.740
like this typeface called Montserrat.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.550
You're not going to run out off waits here are you So we have letter spacing,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.800
line hide and phone waits.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.650
These attributes help us with two things mainly want is to make tax easy to read,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.740
especially on the body and big tax.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.080
And second,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.560
to achieve a really good visual hierarchy between different elements,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.630
text elements,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.480
obviously on the page and in the upcoming lesson,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.630
we're going to practice this exact type setting between line heights where you send all

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.350
that stuff,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.070
stick around.
