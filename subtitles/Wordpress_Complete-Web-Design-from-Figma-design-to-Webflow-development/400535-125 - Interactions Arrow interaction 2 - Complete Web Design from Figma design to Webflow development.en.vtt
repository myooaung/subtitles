00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
So in this video we're going to build the arrow interaction.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.400
It goes like this.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.660
When mobs hovers over the entire link block,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.600
the arrow will move about eight pixels to the right,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.970
and when mouse's out,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.250
the arrow returns to its original position.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.130
First,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.270
we need to choose the trigger,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.000
select a ling,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.400
block the entire thing,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.840
not just the tax or there.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.230
Oh,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.950
then go to Interactions Panel and Click Plus Choose Mouse hover.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.390
We'll get to the screen,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.920
and the link block will have this icon on top to represent that there is some sort of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.560
trigger apply to this block or this element.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.550
The same Aiken will show inside the Navigator as well.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.150
It's a good way to keep track of elements that have interaction applied to them.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.500
Note.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.020
One thing.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.780
This icon shows up on the trigger,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.650
not what's actually being animated.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.690
All right,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.600
under own hover,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
we're going to select action,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.500
which is start an animation to create a custom animation click This plus icon and let's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.650
name this animation as something like a row move right.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.930
This animation is going to do just that for it to return to its original position.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.710
We're going to build a different animation.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560
So these place here is a timeline.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.520
Here we can create a sequence of different things happening that,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.890
put together creates wonderful animation.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.740
This time,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.380
as this is a simple animation,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.320
we're just going to have two items here.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.150
You see this message on the bottom?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.860
When we are inside animation mode,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.850
we are able to select different elements on the canvas that we want to animate.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.160
So we're going to select the arrow and create a new action for that arrow.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.910
Under these,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.440
we have several different options to what we can do with this object and how we can animate

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.710
it.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.600
In our case,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.950
we already done this and we need to move.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.940
We'll get this new a little more intimidating timeline.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.840
But don't worry,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.000
it's quite straightforward.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.440
First,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.790
we need to apply some value in the move field under X access so we can move it horizontally

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.790
.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.250
Positive values will move it to the right and negative values will move to the left.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.670
Put eight pixels in case you didn't select the arrow properly.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.350
No problem.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.910
For instance,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.700
if Link block appears here,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.780
you can change it just right.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.560
Click on the element and choose change target.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.600
Once you get this new pink message on the bottom,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.050
you can select the new element,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.570
and the target element for this animation will change if it's still not working for you.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.230
Just delayed this item and select arrow from Start Press play.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.750
I come to see your animation inaction interactions inside the designer work on Lee by

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.460
pressing this play button to see them in action.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.850
Either you have to check the preview mode or the live published site.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.490
Timing and transition can be edited from here.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.220
Right now,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.220
we have 500 millisecond animation,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.530
which is way too slow in linear easing,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.990
which is no easing at all,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.640
So the line will move from start point to the endpoint with constant speed.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.130
This doesn't create a nice and smooth transition,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.140
so we're going to choose the values that we already played with ease and 200 milliseconds.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.210
0.2 is same as 200 milliseconds.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.190
There are 1000 milliseconds in one second played animation again there.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.680
Now it's faster and smoother.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.190
Alright,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.050
we connected animation mode and check this in the preview mode.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.380
Excellent.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.040
That removes nicely on hover,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.040
but it stays there doesn't move back.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.760
That's because with interactions,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.350
we need to specify what happens on the hover out.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.890
Okay,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.160
now,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.050
how do we get back to our interaction?

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.960
We need to select the trigger element because that's where the interaction is linked to,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.110
not the arrow.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.440
If you select a row,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.300
you'll see nothing.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.090
If you select the Link block now,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.740
you'll see all interactions that are set on it.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.250
This shows that you can have multiple interactions set on each element.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.470
Click on the interaction to go inside for editing.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.700
Now under Harper,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.000
it shows the selected animation that we created.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.410
But under hover out,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.980
it's empty.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.050
So we need to create an animation for that to the same way.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.370
Is the last time select Start an animation?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.540
At least now we'll show the animation that we have already created,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.190
meaning to create another animation,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.400
and they meet something like Aero returned just like last time.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.080
Select the arrow and click the plus.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.750
I come to add a new action.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.950
The last animation was moving Aero eight pixels on the X axis.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.950
What do you think should be this time to return to its original position?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.280
Zero pixels because you're pixels on the X axis is the original position.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.540
If you play this animation,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.990
nothing will happen right now because it's already in its original position.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.520
Let's not forget to change the timing.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.150
Settings were going to use the same 200 milliseconds and ease with the transition.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.960
Plead down to exit animation mode.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.050
Now you can see we have to animations one for the hover,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.000
another one for the hover out.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.370
Let's check the preview mode.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.050
If that's working as expected,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.150
it's working perfectly.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.580
Now,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.140
how about the rest of the arrows?

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.570
Do we have to go and do this again for every single arrow?

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.110
Luckily,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.400
we don't you see this trigger settings,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.650
the one that says element and class.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.420
That's an option to either trigger this interaction on Lee on the selected element or on

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.210
the all elements that have the same class apply to them.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.850
So we're gonna choose the class and let's see what happens in the preview moat.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:34.220
Amazing.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.320
It applied to all the links we don't have to created for each one.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.150
And if in the future we want to make adults,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.520
we just have to change it in one place all right,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.440
so those are the basics of interactions.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.580
There is infinite possibilities off what can be done with interactions and weapon low.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.970
You can go and out advice to do that,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.700
to go to the showcase and you'll see some people you know make very crazy animations and

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.590
interactions,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.140
and we'll give you a good idea.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.540
Some what can be done inside well floor and give you some sort off inspiration for the

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.550
future of projects.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.950
Interactions in the beginning might look a little daunting,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.770
but in reality,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.600
once you get over that little hartal,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.440
you'll see how simple they can be and how much fun and how many different options you have

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.770
to creating something very interactive,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.660
something very beautiful and fun.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.360
And you'll be able to create complex interactions with just a few clicks,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.960
something that would take your probably months off JavaScript practice in order to achieve

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.050
that without willful,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.940
there are more videos about interactions in the advanced part of this course,

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.110
something for you to deepen your knowledge and kind of gain a bit more practice.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.990
Although what we have already learned is quite sufficient for you to stop working on riel

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.410
projects in the next section.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.180
We're going to take care of the mobile version off our website.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.540
Well,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.850
home page in this case,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.980
and then in the section.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.490
After that,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.040
we're gonna learn all about CMS and blawg and how to bed block to our website stick around

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.040
.
