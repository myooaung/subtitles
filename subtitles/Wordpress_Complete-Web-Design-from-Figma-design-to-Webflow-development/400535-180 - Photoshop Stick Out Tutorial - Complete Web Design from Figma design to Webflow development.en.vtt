00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
Now I'm going to demonstrate how to cut out on Lee.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.650
A small part of an image is always the important part is choosing the right image.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.070
You can do this with any photo you can stick out,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.510
ends off the object like table corners.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.250
Hands,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.300
legs had branches.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.330
And so any object that has a prominent tip first up in this process to define the container

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.050
of the image.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.450
The frame in which it sits because you're sticking something out off that frame.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.940
If you're going to use the photo as a full background photo than address off your frame,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.470
are actually not visible.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.230
You can't stick anything out.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.700
I'm going to work on this image.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.710
In this tutorial.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.250
I have linked the same image so you can follow along.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.890
We can easily stick out that year off the dock.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.600
That means our frame has to have a top border if he stretches from top to bottom off the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.650
screen than this image won't work at all.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.760
But if I use a frame like a circle,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.710
for example,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
then I can stick the year out without a problem.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.550
So let's frame the photo first,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.820
just like we're doing fig Now we're going to create a mask.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.950
We're going to use the same asking to as we did previously in the cutout method.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.700
But this time,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.080
instead of selecting the dark from the background,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.680
we're going to select a circle part of that dog in the market.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680
All right,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.450
Click on it and select the elliptical market hall.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.690
This is another word.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.080
Select.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.200
Oh,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.850
I don't even know what Marquis means.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.910
Not by dragging.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.350
Select the face off the dock.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.030
Hold shift while you do this so you can draw a perfect circle to get a better handle.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.170
You can press on space bar to move the selection around.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140
You don't need to get this perfectly right now.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.950
We can always resize and reposition the image off the dog.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.440
Later,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.700
as we did last time.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.940
Click,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.550
select and mask up here.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.050
You're already familiar with this mask editor,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.030
but we're not going to add a hear anything.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.530
Actually,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.610
because we need a perfect circle mask.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.580
So right away go to output options and select new layer with a layer mask like we did last

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.380
time There.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.250
Now we have the same arrangement as in the cutout method.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.660
If you need to reposition or re scale the image inside.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.220
We can do that similarly,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.590
like we do in Fig MMA.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.550
Select the move tool first.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.590
By default,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.740
Mass group is locked so you can move the image separately.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.540
It's moving an entire group to move just the image or just a mass quick on this link.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300
I can hear it will,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.910
unlike the image from the mask,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.770
and now you can move them separately by selecting either the image or the mask from the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.550
layers list.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.850
You'll notice that mask in Photoshop is a defined space,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.900
as it was defined originally.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.560
That's why we have this extra bits showing here.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.690
If you end up with this extra bits after moving your image around,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.050
you can just crop this out with a crop toe.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:57.300
By the way,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.540
Photoshopped has this very handed toe called History Panel.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.170
Instead of undoing on and on,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.700
you can go directly to the staff that you want to undergo.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.870
I love this history tool,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050
and Photoshopped makes undoing much easier.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.770
Okay,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.140
so repositioning image inside is easy.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.360
Just track damage around but to re scale the image so like the image layer and then goto

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.350
adit and free transform.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.600
Now you can grab the handles and resize it as you wish.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.060
Hold,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.480
shift,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.080
toe lock the ratio here in my head.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.550
I'm imagining what part I'm going to stick out so I can position the image properly.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:53.370
Now that we have prepared our mainframe in which our image sits,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.450
we can now stick that year out of it.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.540
To do this,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.340
we're going to basically cut out a piece off the dogs here as a separate layer and place it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.280
on top off this existing layer.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.550
So the right click on this mass group and duplicate the layer.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.920
Now right,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.330
click on the mask itself.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.400
Not the entire layer,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.850
but just a mask and click dilate layer mask.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.950
Now we have the full image on top of it.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.160
If we cut out a chunk off the year from this full image and remove the rest,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.980
we will get the exact stick out effect would want.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.130
So to do so,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.110
we do the usual cut out method,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.970
just like we did in the previous lesson.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.750
Grab a quick selection tool.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.480
Set the right brush from the options from here,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.120
make sure you have selected the brush with the plus sign,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.090
not the minus.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:05:00.190
Set the hardness to 100% and set the right side so you can select that year easily turn.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.150
They'll pass it down to see the edge of the frame and select accordingly.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:19.380
You can select more off the image on the bottom because it's not going to do us harm.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.540
It's just going to be sitting on top of the existing photo.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.230
Anyways.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.220
That looks good.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.690
Now click,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.750
select and mask.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:35.080
We're seeing both of the layers.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.690
Here are frame layer,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.030
and just a year later,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.450
let's change the background toe white for now so we can refine the edge of the year.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.390
Remember how to refine badges,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.250
Select the refine edge to and go over the address.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.940
Or it adds,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.050
in any missing hair or any other missing pixels.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.600
As I mentioned before with this story,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.260
we are telling Photoshopped to look beyond our selection and detect any missing pixels.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.530
You don't have to refine the base off the year.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.050
It will merge perfectly with the background image,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:19.150
Now go to output settings and select new layer with a layer mask and hit OK,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.350
there.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.950
That's our year sticking out.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.910
Let's put a white background on this so we can see the results better.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.580
Create new layer and click the new feel.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.050
I can hear select solid color and choose white.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.950
Now drag that layer below everything.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:07:07.530
If you're going to use a different collar in your actual designs,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.790
you can double quick on the field and change the caller so you can visualize this right

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.800
here in a photo show before you export the final result.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.600
For example,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.310
when I put this on a dark color,

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.380
we can notice that there's some extra glare behind the ear.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.310
Too bad I didn't check this one refining the selection,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.390
but we can still do some work on this.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.350
Even after the mask has been applied,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.090
the mask is still edit herbal.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.360
If we zoom in on the Mask lair,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.030
you'll see we have black and white parts.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.330
The white parts are visible part of the mask,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.070
and black parts are hidden part.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.880
That's why the white part has a shape off the air.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.010
If we paint wide on this mass,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.960
we will show more off the image.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.920
Let me demonstrate if I select a regular brush tool and draw on it with white paint.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.750
It's going to show more of the image,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:04.360
and if I drove with a black paint on it,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:15.060
it will hide whatever is already visible to switch between white and black brush.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.610
Click on this arrow icon on top of these black and white boxes.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.240
Whatever is on top is the current color of the brush.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:27.240
There's also a shortcut.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.080
You can hit X on your keyboard,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.850
and then we'll switch between the two.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.320
Okay,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.290
now we can remove the extra glare from behind the ear.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.390
I'm going to adjust the brush to make it smooth and feathery,

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.670
so I dont create any hard edges.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:43.410
In this case,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.990
I'm going to decrease the hardness completely and even decrease their passage to 50%.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.350
This way I will brush over the parts and in a smooth and controlled manner,

00:08:52.350 --> 00:09:21.330
and that's a better result.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.600
It might not be ideal on a black background,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.170
but works quite well fast to refine this during the masking face.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.660
And don't forget to check the view on the black background.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.450
If you plan on using it on dark backgrounds,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:39.150
the last step is to export damage we're going to export in PNG with the transparent

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.530
background that where you have more freedom to choose backgrounds directly in fig mongering

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.950
actual design process.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.080
Hide the background,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:10:01.260
crop out any extra space and under file export,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.050
click quick exporters PNG.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:08.330
And there you have it.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.940
This can be now important inside Sigma and use on different backgrounds.
