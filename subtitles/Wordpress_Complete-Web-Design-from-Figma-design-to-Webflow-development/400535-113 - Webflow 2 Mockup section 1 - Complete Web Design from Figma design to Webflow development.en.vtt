00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
and we're back in this video.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.540
We're going to do a small part of the following section.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.890
Just the content.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.940
Remember what we did in the previous website.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.390
We have created a generic section block.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.620
We gave it some default petting zoos,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.150
and that was it just like we did with the container element.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.750
Having such an eric section gives us a nice control over the Web site layout,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.550
so let's drop a new section.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.250
Give it a class,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.400
give it some padding both vertically and horizontally.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.130
We need six of pixels on the sides on the now bar,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.080
so let's repeat that for the vertical padding.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.080
Let's use 80 because in our designs were often using 160 pixels facing between sections and

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.670
80 pixels on top and bottom will add up to 160.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.180
I don't have a strict rule on what sort of patting to use,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.280
depending on a website.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.040
This can change,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.350
and most the time I'm just eyeing the thing.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.780
And now let's drop another day,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:08.120
block inside and apply the existing class container in the designs we have off white,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.580
a little blue grays Khanum background color on the page.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.220
We've done that so we could have better contrast on white cards that we put on the page.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.910
Let's apply that background to the genetic section.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:40.460
The headline is already in the right style because we're style the H one tack.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.340
Previously,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.330
we haven't done that for the paragraph,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.080
so let's do the same meaning Let Styler paragraph tech.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.850
So all our generic paragraph texts are stalled without adding any classes to it.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.650
To do these first,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.540
like the paragraph,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.950
then go to the selector field and select old paragraphs.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.800
All right now we're just salad as usual,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.050
18 pixels in size 26 picks else in line hide and grabbed the color code from there.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.050
Excellent.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.710
Now for the learn More link.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.890
There are two elements here.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.620
Attacks and the era I can.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.200
There is a way to actually insert an aero is attacks like a symbol,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.880
But I'm planning to animate this arrow in the future,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.500
and in that case we'll meet an arrow to be a separate object.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.200
So we have a taxed and an image element.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:50.080
Lights that attacks link that just like with heading and paragraphs were also able to style

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.310
the old links tag.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.330
So instead of the generic blue,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.050
we're going to change it to our own blue,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.150
and all the links now will have that particular color.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.790
Now,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.860
if we hyperlink text anywhere else,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.140
it will inherit the color from that links tack.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.110
But we cannot change too much on links tack like text size,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.800
for example,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.120
because links live in other places like paragraphs,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.400
buttons and so on.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.450
So if we style it and if we give it all links to be like 16 picks else,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.340
then you feeling something inside the headline or inside a caption or a different type of

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.850
tax,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.460
then all of them are gonna become 16.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.060
For example,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.850
like this.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.110
So everything else that we need to style with the link let's style that class and not the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.120
tack to remove the underlying from doing.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.450
Just go to the tax decoration and press on none.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.430
Okay,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.580
now we need an arrow,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.370
which is just an image element.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.620
Let's export the arrow image from Sigma and inserted here.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.650
Export this SPG that's best for such images.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:09.460
Uh,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:30.070
there's a four pixel space before the arrow,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.670
and also it's not exactly a line with the tax,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:41.840
so let's end a negative margin on top minus two pixels seems enough.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:05:05.840
Okay,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.630
that's all good.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.640
But there is one issue.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.960
If you check in the preview,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.650
you'll see that taxes a link.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.810
You can see this by cursor changing from a pointer arrow into a hand.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.800
But the Arrow icon is not part of that link.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.250
Its separate object.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.970
This is not the best arrangement.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.500
Ideally,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.980
we want the arrow to be clickable and part off the link to There is a very simple solution

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.600
for this.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.610
We just need to place both of these elements inside a link block.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.910
To refresh your memory,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.850
we have tooling elements inside the panel.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.420
One is a regular tax link,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.150
and another one is a link book.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.450
A link block is like did block,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.150
but it's a link,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.140
so anything we put inside will be part of that one link.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.050
So we at the Ling block and then dragged those elements inside that block.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.410
But we can't actually dragged the link element inside because that's not allowed.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.170
Instead,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.350
we need to end a regular tax block.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.020
As you can see,

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.080
the moment we put tax inside the ling block,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.150
it becomes blow.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.160
That's because that link Block is part of that old links tack that we just styled.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.800
And let's add that class to that taxed.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:23.650
Uh,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:31.650
if the underlying is supposed to disappear,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.400
but it doesn't.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.150
We have to remove the underlying from the link block itself.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.600
I took a very weird route to demonstrate this implementation off the link,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.640
But the reason I did this way is because it would have been a natural way for you to think

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.640
.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.830
And it's going to be natural way for you to go through this process because when you want

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.640
to add a new link,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.170
you're gonna go,

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.440
OK,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.670
let me at the tax link,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.990
right.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.290
And then you're gonna have Teoh add maybe an icon to the button or whatever it is,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.930
and you're gonna think always How do I do that?

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.040
Now this I can isn't clickable,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.510
and you might get stuck because you know you need to figure it out.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.380
So that's why I wanted to take that sort of mistaken router than we can understand exactly

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.950
how to get come back and redo everything in a way that we actually want Teoh because you

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.250
will come across to the sort off scenarios.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.810
When you want to build something,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.410
you go with the natural way that you assume it's gonna work and then it doesn't and you get

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.680
stuck and kind of go back and reduce.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.600
Something's a little the sort of trial and error and going through the bumpy roads of

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.970
learning.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.770
This is going to be the best way for you to understand this concept.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.980
Now,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.190
whenever you're doing this on your own and building websites on their own,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.240
there is one place you can always go to find find answers.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.060
And that's rep Low Forum and their community.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.740
They're excellent community.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.000
People respond there.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.780
Even Weapon has people who work for that community and for the forum,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.580
and they give answers there as well.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.760
But also other workflow designers like me and everyone else.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.040
They're kind of contributing and answering questions.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.030
So if you are stock somewhere,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:09.490
Google it and look on my flow forums because often other people and other Web designers had

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.690
the same question as you,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.550
so you might find answers there already.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.530
If not,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.090
ask yourself and you will definitely get somebody helping you out and guiding you through

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.370
and giving you answers and you will find the link to the weapon.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.400
04 ohm inside the resources page.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.600
So go check it out.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.020
All right.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.580
Lastly,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.710
we need to place this two elements side by side.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.610
We have two options.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.120
One is to use the flex box,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.590
but second and easier options to change the display property of the text.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.090
Right now,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.660
it's block block means it will stretch and occupy the entire line off the parent.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.690
That's why Arrow is forced to jump to the second line.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.990
But if we change it to in line,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.450
block or in line than era will come back up.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.490
The arrow is an image element and image elements by default already set to in line block.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.020
So that's why we don't need to change it.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.750
Let's at the space on top of this.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.950
Learn more link.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:01.410
All right,

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:01.650
now,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.870
if we check the privy mode,

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.050
the aero is going to be part of the link to,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.430
and that's exactly what we need.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.030
Finally,

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.490
we need to give this content and maximum with so it's not stretching through the entire

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.150
container.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:21.660
We're not going to touch The container,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.220
of course,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.050
will drop another day block and move all the content inside that.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:41.720
Let's give it a maximum with off 464 pixels,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.750
which is just like in our designs.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.350
And there you go.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.300
That's much better,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:46.840
That's all.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.260
For now,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.550
we'll add the image in the next video of stick around.
