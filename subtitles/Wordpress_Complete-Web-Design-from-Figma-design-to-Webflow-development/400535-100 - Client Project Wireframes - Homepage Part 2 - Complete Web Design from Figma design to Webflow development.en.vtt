00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
and we're back continuing with our wife ran below the fold.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.780
Let's see which one of the inspirations could work for our next section.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.220
It will be a good idea to demonstrate the product by showing some screens.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.390
A section like this could work.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:25.580
Have the screens on one side and the tax next to it we could.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.390
Still some content from slack.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.210
Using content from the competitors is a valid option.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.070
This is how your clients will try to get ideas anyways.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.780
But make sure to put a comment on intern telling where you grabbed the content from.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.300
You don't want them to think that you came up with this content and then at some point,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.280
find out that you know it was scrapped from the competitors because they're just gonna

00:00:44.280 --> 00:01:09.560
think that you just stole it right that the here we can add,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.630
learn more link to the other potential pages that will explain the specific features in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.470
more detail,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.980
like they have done it here.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.000
It's a good way to direct visitors on different pages off the website,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.950
and also it brings a little more detail to the tax block.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.150
We already have a link in style just changed their color to your primary color.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:39.100
We can also add a little arrow to this link.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.060
Inside the competence,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:52.180
we can search for a Nikon and grab that and put it next to it that the,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:16.250
uh and that's all for this section.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.520
Now let's create rest of the sections in the body.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:35.650
I was thinking off split section like this content is the same style as to what we just did

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.650
.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.950
So we can just copy that.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:47.160
And for the graphic,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.810
we're just going to put the image placeholder for now,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.700
although for our clients will explain,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.750
our vision about this image is that we're going to create a sort off an augmented reality

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.210
view,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.050
adding more cops from the platform onto real photos.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:12.430
Let's say some content for simple task management.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.330
I'm going to write this on my own.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.150
Don't judge me.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.050
Not so shabby.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:29.850
Let's have one more of the same layout with the photo.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.250
Let's just duplicate this.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.540
I'm holding on out option key here,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.040
so it duplicates when I dragged the whole thing.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.750
But you should know that by now.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.050
Wanna see a call fig metric to reverse the layout off the section group the content first,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.010
then select everything.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.270
And these two pink circles should appear in the middle.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.150
Just hold it and move the content on the other side,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.650
so simple and baby could do it.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:16.530
What's now?

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.130
I had a testimonial section.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.830
I really like this one here.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.730
I'm going to re created nearly as is from a marketing standpoint,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.470
Having testimonials from product or service swept sides is a great idea.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.390
It increases trust in the brand,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.550
and audience gets a better feel for the product by reading real people experiences.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:05:04.420
One great

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.130
way to design testimonials is by ending five stars,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.660
just like they've done here.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.090
People love to see how someone has rated the product.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.560
It's more powerful.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.460
And simply saying five stars on the page instantly brings people positive feelings about

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.050
the product.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.050
Because there is a strong association in people's brings linked to those five little icons

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.050
.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.100
It's a little psychological technique.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.250
Your employers will appreciate your understanding of such things.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:51.620
Uh uh

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:14.250
uh uh.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.250
-

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:49.070
So

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.750
I just tried to match it roughly to the inspiration.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.470
Not using any specific colors or anything in real designs will use Golden stars and the

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.080
white car.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.690
But here.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.840
We got to keep the great card.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.540
So we don't want to worry about the shadows to make the white car visible on a white

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.600
background now just group the whole thing and duplicated in a similar way as our

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:16.450
inspiration and the last one to go off the frame.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.570
One thing to note here.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.270
We don't want this whole card visible.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.180
We want it clipped like it's in the inspiration.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.360
So how do we do that?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.600
The reason it's not clipping is because it's not part of the frame anymore.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.550
You can see that in the layers panel.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.770
When you move something off the frame,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.000
a little signal looks at your cursor and decides if you want it on the frame or off the

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.430
frame.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.280
Based on that,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.480
you see how that group gets clipped when the cursor moves inside the frame or becomes full

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.650
of visible when moves outside of the frame.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.880
So to move it back,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.530
just make sure your cursor is inside the frame.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.090
Then position with narrow case or in a way,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.910
that you don't move the cursor outside.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:58.750
Fantastic.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:04.200
We can keep the dummy tax inside testimonials.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.030
Those are something our clients would need to ask their users and produce it that way.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.800
And let's add those slider arrows,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.950
just like in the design

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:52.750
that

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.750
,

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.450
uh,

00:08:53.450 --> 00:09:02.200
lastly,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.340
let's at footer and be done with it.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.840
Is I often doing my projects?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.160
I'm going to copy the foot your content from our previous exercise.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.130
Since we use the same 12 point greed and columns fit just right.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:18.100
These reusing different competence from between different projects come from a little bit

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.050
from laziness,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.890
but works out really well.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.850
At the end of the day,

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.260
you start to master thesis common elements,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.030
as you see,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.350
use it in different projects and start understanding,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.460
benefits and limitations of the layout.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.250
And at some point you refine it until you have a near perfect personal template.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.250
-

00:09:34.250 --> 00:10:10.740
Now

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.130
let's update their colors and textiles.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:38.550
Uh uh uh,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:48.330
they turn the design stage.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.700
I'm thinking to use a dark footer like this,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.560
and since we know from our project brief that we need a newsletter sign up form,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.150
we can add a similar email form right here in the footer.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.150
-

00:10:59.150 --> 00:12:23.650
Uh uh uh.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:31.530
And there that's our footer.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.060
All right,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.350
Y friends for the home pages.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.740
Done.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.110
Next,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.250
we're going to wire frame the article page for the block
