00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
to get jobs,

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.030
you usually have to send cover letters with their proposals.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.270
These are just a,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:04.520
you know,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.300
small email or a message that you send to a client when you're kind of sending them a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.660
proposal on up work and freelancing platforms.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.950
There's usually a failed that you feel out and you send that own outside of the platforms.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.610
That's usually an email that you send to them with your proposal.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.030
That's it.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.970
Freelancing didn't teach me how to write good cover letters.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.680
Hiring,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.050
feeling,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.750
stressed it.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.430
I've had a decline.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.710
I've had experience of receiving cover letters that were great because they were working

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.950
well on me as a client in there was a lot off pile of crap that I was receiving that made a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.410
lot of really says completely on High Ripple.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.050
Here are some tips on writing Damn good cover letters.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.930
A cover letter that puts me to sleep instantly is where the free ones there is talking

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.040
about themselves.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.810
I post a job describe my problem and the solution that I'm looking for and you respond with

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.060
how amazing you are.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.330
Nearly all of these real answers are talking about themselves.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.230
I am thes.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.550
And I have that.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.050
I have this amount of experience and I've done base in the past.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.530
Frankly,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.790
dear,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.640
I don't care.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.870
Tell me how you're going to solve my problem.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.670
Talk to me about the project.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.770
How can you help me?

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.070
Show me that you're amazing.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.150
Don't brag about it.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.070
Okay?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.430
If you can talk about yourself than what do you say?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.050
Very easy.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.330
Started giving ideas.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.320
Imagine that Already hired you and start brainstorming.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.000
They're project.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.340
How are you going to design it?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.470
What would be some fun things to do?

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.640
Sand links to example Websites and say you could do the sort of interactions or the sort of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.450
hero section.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.480
Nobody does this.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.880
If I saw a proposal with ideas and examples,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.950
I'd be like Thank you.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.270
Those are great ideas.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.070
You get me?

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.030
That's what I want.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.300
Don,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.610
Your heart One rial examples Here is an actual cover letter that I've sent on our pork

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.160
which got me a job right away without an interview.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.510
I start by linking example pages.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.050
I took lending page templates,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.550
not even my work and showed him as examples.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.870
I showed him what I was going to do.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.070
Now he can see with his own eyes,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.840
and I made his life easier.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.730
Then I give him a quick run down off the process.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.640
How I was going to do all that.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.740
Told him it will look good and will convert effectively.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.470
That's his goal,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.980
isn't it?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.070
Now he knows I understand his goal.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.190
Then I ask some meaningful questions that shows that I'm not painting the picture pink,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.950
and I've considered the specifics off the project.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.650
Notice how I only start talking about myself after all of that,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.620
in the very and where it says about me.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.600
There's a little more Blobel apply about me.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.040
But I've cropped that out because today I wouldn't even do that.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.900
I would just keep it without that paragraph.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.150
Here's another example of a good cover letter that I received on one of my job bats.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.010
This person has more than 50 care.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.830
Ning's on our pork,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.950
and it shows why he's straight to the point.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.880
He's helpful.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.750
He's even going to show me out to get visitors for my page.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.560
He understands my goals and asks me meaningful questions.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.350
The message is short and sweet,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.950
not wasting my time with bunch of can fluff.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.180
Don't try to save time by sending template cover letters and can cover letters.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.280
I hate Ken letter.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.580
Screw them and screw people who send them to me.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.700
Saving your time but wasting mine?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.360
No thanks.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.800
Good clients notice Ken letters miles away,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.850
and they're not even going to bother reading them.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.530
Sometimes inside cover letters Do you want to give examples off your passport?

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.900
Right.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.900
So,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.100
you know,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.810
a lot of freelance is what they're going to do is they're going to,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.100
you know,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.550
refer Teoh and link their portfolio.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.540
Work within that for but what you can do and because you haven't website,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.770
you can send them links to your website because perform your pieces on up work.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.080
They're not,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.750
despite in the most flattering way,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.960
our on the website.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.170
They look very attractive because it's your website.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.900
It's your star,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.220
right?

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.160
Everything is gonna organize nicely,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.090
and you have a bit more content.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.900
And it's your opportunity to use it that,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.240
you know,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.520
to show that you're actually not just up work.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.390
But you're kind of very professional,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.750
have your own website and kind of impressed them with the whole presentation that you have

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.750
,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.320
but only if you're going to publish that website on your personal custom domain,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:12.310
because my portfolio slash 123 dot wet floor dot io doesn't look very professional.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.160
Looks amateur.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.170
And I don't take anybody any feelings or seriously,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.750
who sends me their portfolio,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.250
which is on ah dot Web floor something or dog webley or weeks dot com,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.790
because that doesn't look like you're taking your profession seriously.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.130
So cough up 15 bucks per month for ah,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.590
what clothes?

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.200
First month of subscription,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.550
and you're gonna look miles ahead off other freelancers who are on up work,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.270
and you just need to pay for the first month.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.950
Once you start making money is just gonna pay for itself.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.640
Almost half of the proposals that you submit will have an extra field called additional

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.490
questions.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.440
First field is cover letter.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.930
That's where you write your main message to the client.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.390
Then,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.840
if Klein added an extra questions to the job,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.280
you'll get those fields below.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.170
When I posted a job on Outpouring and I got proposals,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.210
I noticed something very strange on the client side.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.350
The order off this fields was reversed.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.990
I was seeing answers to the question first and then answers to the cover letter.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.740
Second,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.060
most freelancers had no idea about this.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.770
So there were writing things like,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.850
as I mentioned above in my cover letter,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.400
what's evolve?

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.330
Embarrassing.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.100
And I was like,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.550
Oh my God,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.700
that's what I've been doing to writing cover letter first and then questions.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.650
So here's a hidden deep that most for answers don't know about when they're ihsaa field for

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.420
additional questions.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.140
And sometimes there isn't right sometimes just a cover letter,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.180
but sometimes there are.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.250
So whenever there are additional questions filled,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.580
write them upside down because that's what the person.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.000
That's what the client is going to see.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.380
First,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.710
additional questions answer at first and then cover letter later on the page where a client

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.120
receives all proposals,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.360
they can already see a few beginning lines off the cover letter from the freelancer.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.760
Many freelancers start by something like Dear sir,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.940
slash matter.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.440
Is that how people connect?

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.740
Dear sir slash madam Sound so impersonal and just plain weird,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.550
I often say this one dear hiring manager,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.730
What the hell hiring manager who meet a Why are you calling me random names and who talks

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.430
like that this one is actually up works fault because in one of their block post,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.520
they advised to use that dear hiring manager which was probably returned by one of their

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.510
employees who has never been a freelancer and or a client.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.010
Because that's the stupidest advice I've ever heard.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.220
So be careful when reading advisers from up work itself.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.270
So if you can say that,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.130
then what do you say?

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.400
Well,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.270
let me solve a big mystery.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.130
One.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.380
What do you say when you greet somebody in Europe?

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.200
Work environment?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.730
Do you say dear sir slash Madam.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.360
Or you say hi.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.240
Hello.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.080
Good morning.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.850
Hi there.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.370
Simple is that Why complicate this?

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.350
All of those are professional and polite too.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.440
Don't be weird.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.950
Just be natural and friendly,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.430
that's all.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.640
Now,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.810
some of you probably come from the countries and cultures where users ward,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.140
sir is sort of required to be polite.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.940
This is,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.640
for example,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.980
a case in India and were not work from when I work with freelancers from India.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.060
They always call me sir.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.550
They go.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.800
Hi,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.290
sir.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.710
Yes,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.190
sir.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.650
Thank you,

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.150
sir.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.060
I get a little weirded out when this when they do that,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.620
don't use sir with everybody around the world because it's not part of everybody's culture

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.620
.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.300
For example,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.670
in North America,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.380
Britain and Australia,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.620
the word sir is used in very impersonal situations.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.130
For example,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.260
when you want Teoh grab a stranger's attention like Oh,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.740
excuse me,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.160
sir,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.280
you dropped something.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.960
But work environment in this country's is more friendly.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.120
There is no honorific status distance between people because of their age or job position.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.380
So never an employee would call their boss,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.000
sir.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.370
Even if that bus was Bill Gates,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.670
there would probably say something like Bill or Mr Gates,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.850
but not sir.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.520
So you're gonna come across a little strange and impersonal if you use these with people

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.980
who are not used to this sort of courtesy check where they're from and Yusor only if it's

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.280
expected in that country
