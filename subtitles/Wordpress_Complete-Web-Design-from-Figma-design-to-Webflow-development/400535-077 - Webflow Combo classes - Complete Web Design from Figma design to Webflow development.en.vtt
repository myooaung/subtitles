00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
So the middle section just has three elements heading paragraph and one image.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.850
So we need the recording elements in Web slow.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:15.150
Now let's put our content inside and see where does that take us?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:26.950
Next?

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.350
Let's export the image.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:38.530
This time we can export J Pack instead of PNG because the background is white so we won't

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:51.160
get any color of mismatches We're going to do to acts for retain optimization and off

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.640
course.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.110
Run the image through optimizing allowed to compress the file.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.550
PNG's and J packs.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.150
You should always compress SP.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.920
Edges can be compressed to,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.150
but most of the time it's not necessary.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:18.880
They're small enough since we exported to acts,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.350
we need to enable the high DP I option.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.690
Okay,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.300
it almost looks like our design.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.720
We need to center everything.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.390
Somehow we could set tax the line to center on the container did block.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.060
But we can't do that on Arjun every container,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
because it's going to center elements everywhere and mess up our content elsewhere.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.550
Like on our hero section.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.880
We could,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.240
of course,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.100
duplicate this container class and create a new one with a center layout.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.980
But that sort of beats the purpose of having this default generic container that we're

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.270
going to use across the website.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.110
Luckily,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.740
CSS has a super smart solution for these.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.650
The combo classes let me demonstrate,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.750
have got a generic button here.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.850
Let's apply our existing button class from the hero section.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.900
Once we reach this section from the design instead of wide,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.850
we will need to use blue version.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.640
But instead of duplicating the button class,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.280
we're going to keep the same base class in add a combo class to it.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.370
There are two classes now in the selector button,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.570
which is the base class,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.210
and blue,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.720
which is a combo class.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.150
Any changes we make to this new button from this point want a fact original white button,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.860
But the beauty off the combo classes that every other property that we didn't touch is

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.890
still being inherited from the base button class.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.580
This means if we at some point decide to change the style off our buttons like make them

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.560
square or decrease padding or change the phone style,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.260
all of those changes will be reflected on the blue button as well.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.940
However,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.550
all those properties that we have applied to the blue combo class won't be affected at all

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.550
.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.510
In this case,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.180
the background and text colors not really cry if you don't use combo classes.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.090
Regular people visiting your website are not gonna no difference if you're using combo

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.940
classes or not,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.800
and frankly,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.770
they don't really care.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.340
But this is what pros do to save time producing cleaner code and have a better control over

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.100
the website.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.440
And,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.990
of course,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.700
I want you to become a pro,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.700
create websites efficiently and make more money by saving time.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.850
During the development,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.520
the's combo classes fit the inheritance tree at the bottom of the hierarchy.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.000
They inherit stars from the base class who in turn inherit styles from the related tag.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.850
Related is an important word here because a paragraph one in Harry any stars from H one tag

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.390
or heading tack on Lee from paragraph tack and all of those tax inherit some styles from

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.050
the body attack and when we override styles were overriding from the bottom.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.640
More specific style wins,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.450
so the comeback class can override everything above it,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.370
the base class that relate to tag and the body attack.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.570
Similarly,

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.190
a base class can override everything above it,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.300
but it won't affect the combat class if that combat class is in charge of that specific

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.260
type of style,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.450
like phone color or background color and so on.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.510
That's exactly what CSN stands for cascading style sheets if you're dying to know.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.760
So the styles cascade from the top to the bottom,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.170
sort of like a waterfall.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.950
You can see how combo clients has been added to the inheritance menu,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.100
and these many gifts has an ability to select any stage of this hierarchy and added exactly

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.680
that stage,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.260
for example,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.250
the base class.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.060
By the way,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.680
this inheritance menu can also show what specific tack and control your element.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.390
The second pink box says old links.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.000
Why?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.330
Because buttons are regular links were just all them to make them look like buttons.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.540
So if we set some styles on old wings tack,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.370
then you will notice those styles on your bottoms until you overwrite them.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.220
Okay,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.390
back to our container.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:22.070
We can add a combo class cult centre and then change the text alignment off the front.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.880
They should center all our content as we want it from this point,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.460
if we ever need another container with center alignment,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.040
we can apply this combat class just like we would apply a regular base class.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.240
Well,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.800
flow even displays combo classes that are linked to that base class so you can choose an

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.990
existing combo class and voila!

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.650
We get a centered container,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.780
a couple of things we need to style in our section,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.960
the width of the paragraph and the spacing.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.150
We can grab the spacing from our designs,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.250
their two picks on top and 60 on the bottom.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:08.240
And of course,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.310
we can grab that with off the paragraph two,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.250
which is 566 pixels.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.780
But oops,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.650
this happens.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.420
I know you might be thinking here,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.050
How come it doesn't center?

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.750
Didn't we set the center alignment on our container,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.560
but have a closer look?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.310
The text itself is centered inside the box,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.690
but the box isn't so.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.150
Why isn't the box in the middle?

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.560
Because the paragraph taxes set to display block and tax alignment option doesn't affect

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.070
block level elements.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.830
It only affect actual taxed in line,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.290
block and in line elements.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:55.250
So one way to center that entire paragraph block is to change the display to in line block

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.250
.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.590
This might seem a little strange wars only in line blawg but doesn't work on a regular

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.180
block.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.930
But that's OK.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.960
You'll get the hang of it.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.680
Another way to center it is by setting autumn margins like we did with that container.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.320
Remember what autumn margins do They act like springs that feel any remaining space and

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.590
push the box in the middle?

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.150
Both of these are valid solutions on a margin or in line block.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.620
But I'm leaning towards using all the margin,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.980
because if I'm facing some sort of a Bach and I'm trying to fix something and I forget what

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.770
I've done here,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:34.070
I'm more likely to assume that the paragraph is set to default bloc rather than to in line

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.550
block.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.220
And that's it.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.150
We're looking good.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.130
So to recap,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.040
we learned about combo classes and how they can save us.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.950
A lot of time.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.810
Combo classes are on the bottom off the hierarchy tree,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.810
so they inherit stars from everything above them.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.180
But they can override any off those inherited styles,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.790
and their changes want a fact anything above their level
