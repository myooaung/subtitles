00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.160
well,

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.750
we know that picking good colors is a very important thing to do in designs.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.250
But how do we know what's a good color?

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.500
And what's a bad collar?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.250
You might be thinking?

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.810
Oh no,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.210
I have terrible taste in colors.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.640
Don't worry,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.010
and I have a good taste either.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.660
But there is a trick to picking collars,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.750
and the trick is to not to pick the colors from your hat or directly inside sigma,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.010
but to still colors from some sort of inspiration.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.340
This can be other design work,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.650
like websites or illustrations or posters,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.180
whatever,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.720
or even from re award like photos.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.300
In this lesson,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.060
I'm going to teach you how to use the world around us as our inspiration for our colors

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.760
simply colors from the real world.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.510
Like people,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.130
nature,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.240
animals well,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.550
almost always give you create results.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.570
Why?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.820
Because most of us already agree that an orchid looks beautiful,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.820
but a cockroach,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.720
not as much.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.960
Picking good colorist is only half off the job.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.820
The second half is actually matching the right colors together.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.990
Using real world is our inspiration solves this problem,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.210
too,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.350
of because most of the time natural world provides great color combinations.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.450
These photo of the line looks beautiful.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.040
If we find a color palette that is already on this image,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.080
we can be sure that most of the time these colors will really go together.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.960
Otherwise,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560
we wouldn't find a photo of this line as appealing.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.300
Weaken simple.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.550
A few dominant colors from the image.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.650
And now we have a color palette that is natural and harmonious.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.040
Here's where it gets interesting.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.740
Let's say we are designing a section that looks something like this.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.100
If we get this photo and use it in our design together with our new color palette,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.120
we're going to get some really good looking results because we're not just matching cars

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.510
together,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.450
but we are actually matching colors with our image.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.750
We can then play around and use these colors for text or backgrounds,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.540
or create very interesting color combinations.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.430
Look at that.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.580
It's like a magic.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.070
And I was in the one who came up with this colors.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.230
Mother Nature did
