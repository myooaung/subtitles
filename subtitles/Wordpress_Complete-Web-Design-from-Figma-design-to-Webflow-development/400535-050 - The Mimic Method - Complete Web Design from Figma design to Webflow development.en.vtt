00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.910
I want to share with you a dirty little secret off all creative people.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.800
Every designer,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.790
every artist,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.830
every inventor.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.080
Every musician that has ever lived has used this method to achieve mastering their skill.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.350
This method is called the mimic method.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.950
You see the beginning steps off.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.410
Learning any new craft is mimicking the experts in that field.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.130
So if you want to learn how to cook,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.440
you grab Gordon Ramses or John Oliver's cookbook,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.990
and you start practicing some recipes.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.520
You don't start by inventing food from scratch.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.950
You start mimicking those recipes and then practicing them.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.490
And once you gain a little bit of experience and a little bit more confidence in whatever

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.800
recipes have been cooking,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.910
then you start tweaking them a little bit.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.150
And then at some point,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.670
you start re inventing and creating your new recipes.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.320
If you're learning how to play guitar,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.150
you don't start by writing new songs,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.120
Nor you start by mimicking other musicians,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.980
meaning you start playing their songs.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.220
And like every other beginner guitar player,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.950
you start by learning wonderful.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.680
Many beginner designers get themselves trapped because they think the moment they start

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.140
designing,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.600
they need to start creating new or an original work,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.810
and they get discouraged when this doesn't happen.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.550
They think that they don't have talent for it,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.860
but they skip the most important stab,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.330
mimicking the experts by mimicking experts.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.850
Not only you get experience and confidence,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.120
but you also practice very good habits because every good design work is full.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.540
With all the good design habits that we discuss in this ah course,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.210
be typography and layout consistency and all the tricks of white space and tension and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.610
overlapping all that thing is in good.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.850
I good design work,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.390
and you're basically practicing all that while you're mimicking somebody in sort of copying

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.340
and replicating their work and inspire using their work is an inspiration.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.950
And once you start creating your own original work,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.100
you already have very good design habits ingrained in you.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.850
Mimicking has three stages.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.100
Stage one is coping.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.740
It's taking someone else's working,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.380
just copying.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.940
Get pixel by pixel it sort off like playing somebody else's song or you cooking lasagna

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.200
using a recipe.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.090
This is done for practice rather than for real projects.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.380
When you're learning by copying your learning a lot of human design decisions that were

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.550
made by a pro.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.460
This is where every creative person begins.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.930
Be pulled McCartney or Picasso In stage two,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.720
you're remixing.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.890
It's taking somebody else s work in giving your own twist to it.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.010
Just like food recipes.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.440
You start tweaking ingredients.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.340
Little by little.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.910
You change that phones,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.540
you use your colors,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.150
tweak the shapes a little bit.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.550
Now you've created something different.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.040
However,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.610
if you put two works together,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.510
the inspiration is clearly visible.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.260
In this stage,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.890
you can already practice working with real projects in the final stage three.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180
Now you are drawing inspiration not from one particular work,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.300
but more like several different works or different styles and maybe even like trends.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.700
And here you add even more personal touch.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.050
So the final result doesn't resemble any one particular work anymore.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.430
And you want couldn't say that it's a remix off this particular website or this particular

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.050
design,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.820
although sometimes you could say that there is clearly an influence or some specific style

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.810
or some specific trend in design,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.130
there is no level beyond.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.290
There's something like truly original work,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.800
because if things aren't really based on reality and influence by reality and existing

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.490
styles,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.510
then it just becomes irrelevant and quite confusing for regular audience.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.690
Sort of like the bizarre high end fashion items.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.670
Too much originality will lead to products that people don't understand and don't want to

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.250
use.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.450
That doesn't mean that people don't like new things.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.990
They dio.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.490
People do little enjoying your websites that look fresh and your fashion stylist technical

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.040
crash.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.890
But they enjoy these things because most of the time they've resemble something from the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.050
past and something existing,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.660
but looking at it from a very new perspective and new outlook.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.710
So it's refreshed look of something familiar.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.790
So the taste of the audience really matters for a particular work to be appreciated or

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.420
rejected.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.940
This strange looking jackets,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.610
sweater or sponge ball spans is and familiar to you and me.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.620
But it might be drawing inspiration from some other Warrick and particular audience off.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.070
That show might be familiar with that inspiration,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.470
so they might easily understand it and appreciate it.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.970
You today start to say that with a straight face.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.600
Also,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.540
the stages are like a volume knob,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.460
not clear cut transition from one to another,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.180
but more like smooth increase off intensity,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.560
with different levels within each stage.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.620
We're going to practice all these three stages.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.040
But before we do that first we need to learn how to find the right inspiration and based

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.840
our work on that.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.040
And make that instead off Trecia once.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.720
So let's do that up next.
