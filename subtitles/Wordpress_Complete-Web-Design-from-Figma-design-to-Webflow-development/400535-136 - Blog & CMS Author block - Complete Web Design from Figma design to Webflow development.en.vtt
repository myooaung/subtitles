00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
in this video,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.730
we're going to build that author and date row below the headline.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.940
I think the simplest approach would be to use the Flex books for this.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.950
Let's add a new empty did block and give it a class author and date.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:42.080
Then let's at an image next we need to name for the author and a regular attacks block.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.260
Given a new class stolid,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:01:13.280
just like fig MMA Uh uh

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.650
uh,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.450
way need to change the justify property to something like center.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.530
Next we have this divider we could use,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.730
like a line bracket for this or just style it a block with within a background color.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.070
But I think line bracket is easier.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.140
I think that's what we're doing inside Fig my Anyways,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.950
we just need a different color for it.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:02:00.640
Uh uh And then the date Let's just reuse the same author tax book and even keep the same

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.150
class.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.170
The date is the published eight of this particular block post.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.670
We can already bind this to the CMS.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.050
We didn't have to create the date field because every CMS item comes with it.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.230
We even have three different date options here in this case,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.390
published on is What We Need but as you can see disappears.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.190
That's because we haven't published our website or any off the block post yet so that they

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.060
feel this empty.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.230
Let's use a different date.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.670
Field may be created on or updated on,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.550
and later we can switch it back to publish or keep it that way.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.610
Update is a pretty decent date indicator to with dates.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.150
We even have an ability to change the date format.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.350
This will matter based on where our target audience lives.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.770
All right,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.500
the distance between divider and tax.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.860
Bacchus.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.730
30 pixels.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.850
We can adjust that on the divider itself.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.940
Actually,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.570
on the right side will lead 15 pixels because there's already a 15 picks on margin on the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.520
left off the date.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.420
And lastly,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.220
let's add a margin on top of the whole thing to separate it from the headline.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.120
All right,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.380
old,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.280
that's looking great.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.340
Now here's a thing.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.210
This author,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.620
that we just created this a static content when we publish our block posts,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.510
all of them will have the same author.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.520
But thats not right,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.850
is it for an independent Bulger shore.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.170
It's always the same author,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.750
but for a company website.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.850
There's always going to be more than one person creating blocks for the website.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.580
We need this author information to be dynamic as well,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.450
but we haven't created CMS fields for this,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.840
so we cannot bind it to the database yet.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.520
We're going to do that in the next video.
