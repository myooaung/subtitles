00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
all right.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.510
Time for some photo shop tutorial for most of design fig,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.340
my sufficient,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.050
but in some scenarios can't do without Photoshopped.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.250
This is one of them.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.530
If you don't already have Photoshopped,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.200
you can get a seven day free trial.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.080
And if you want to buy it costs about $10 per month,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.440
which includes Photoshopped,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.060
Light Room and all adobe phones.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.650
In a 20 gigabyte off their cloud storage space,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.750
you can download the trial from adobe dot com slash downloads.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:41.300
Gorgeous Google Photoshopped downloads In case you have already used up your seven day

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.700
Photoshopped trial in the past,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.480
then you can try Affinity photo instead.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360
It's a very good alternative to father Shop,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.430
and most of the interface and how it all works is quite similar to photo shop have include

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.590
that The league resources.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.460
It has that 10 day free trial,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.010
although I won't be demonstrating this how to do an affinity but seems there to very

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.550
similar.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.550
You will probably figured out how to make it work inside affinity as well.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.590
Okay,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.550
back to photo shop.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.800
After you go through the installation process,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.120
this will be your initial screen click open and select the photo file.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.640
I've included this image in the resources off this lesson so you can work on the same photo

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.340
if you want a quick lifesaver tape on a photo show.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.020
When I first started using photo shows,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.160
I would end up losing some tools and options.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.850
Frequently,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.620
I would watch a YOUTUBE tutorial to learn something,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.240
but then that would be not be able to find a tool that they were using.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.190
The video photo show has a lot of short cuts and little options where you can easily close

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.920
some tap or remove it toe on.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.660
So on I would end up with toolbox gone no layers panna and no idea how to put them back so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.710
I wouldn't be able to follow a tutorial anymore because the tour isn't there.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.390
It's a nightmare for any beginner when you are trying to get your hand around this new

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.510
software and learned a lot of things at the same time,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.750
I would lose a lot of time figuring out how to put it back.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.530
So here's a trick on how to return everything back to normal in case you mess up something

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.530
.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.130
Go to this icon right here and select essentials.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.020
If that's what you already have selected,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.460
then quick reset essentials.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.470
And this will return the workspace to the default.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.770
Just like it was out of the box the very first time you installed it.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.670
This will include two extra taps.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.850
This here is for the shops guy tutorial off some essential stuff.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.460
I recommend going through it later.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.350
If this is your first time with photo shop.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.930
Okay,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.260
I don't need these two halves right here,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.350
so I'm going to close them.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.140
If these method doesn't still return everything back to normal,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.990
then that means you have changed something in the preferences.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.110
In that case,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.460
go to preferences in Windows.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.490
This is under edit menu in select general and click reset preferences on quick Restart

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.610
photo shop and everything will go back to normal.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.970
Keep in mind any preference that that you intentionally changed in the past.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.250
That will be gone to all right back to our photo.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.120
Often you find the right image of your project,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.050
but it's not quite the right size.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.570
This image,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.030
for example,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.670
would make a great background photo.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.000
It's cleaning its simple.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.520
It has great color contrast,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.730
but has one problem.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.420
The separation between the beach and the water cuts right through the middle.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.240
Off the picture.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.950
Neither side is wide enough to host our content.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.530
But if we could stretch one of the sites a little more than we would have a perfect

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.250
arrangement.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.110
Luckily,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.890
we can do that in photo shop inside layers panel.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.840
You'll see these lock on the layer.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.540
This means the layer is partially locked and in many ways won't be eligible as you'd expect

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.650
it.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.850
So just click on this locked or unlocked layer.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.150
Now select this crop tool.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.520
You'll have these handles around the image dragged the side.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.070
You want to create the stretch crop on this?

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.310
Just extends the boundaries off our art board.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.800
Quick,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.040
the check mark wants down,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.350
so it commits the change.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.450
Now select this rectangle,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.550
our marquee tool.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.310
In case you see something else here,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.260
right click on it.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.520
This will open up all the other tools that are part of this group.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.960
Now,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.410
Dragon,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.620
select the part that you want to stretch.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.690
Make sure to select parts that don't have any detail on it,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.170
something that is already blurry or uniform.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.450
You can't do this with people or objects.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.250
He's gonna be done on Leon backgrounds been blurry parts and so on.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.180
I select extra on the left side just to make sure the entire adieu selected once it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.670
selected,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.650
Goto added.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.390
And free transform.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.550
You can also press control T or command T just as it's shown right here.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.250
Now just drag the left handle and stretch the image as much as you feel is right,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.550
and then click the check mark again.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.690
These commits the change you are making to the selection.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.380
If you have extra space here,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.350
select crop toe again and crop it out.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:05:01.910
Now we've got an image that has a good amount of space so we can put our content to save

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.750
that image just quick file Save as and select J Pack,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:15.950
and that's all.
