00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
in this video,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.530
I'm going to show you how to build a custom model or,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.230
in other words,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.250
that pop up something like this.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.590
When user clicks on the button and model opens up with a four models are widely used in

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.800
very handy putting forms.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.040
Inside is one use.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.350
One very hated option is to use it as a pop up.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.220
You know what I'm talking about when you're browsing a page and some annoying marketing

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830
message pops out of nowhere.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.350
When we didn't click anything?

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.370
The sound we're going to go with last controversial option.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.180
A form opening up when user clicks on this get access button on our team map website

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.690
building.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.050
This inside weapon isn't as straightforward as you would think.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.020
There is no reading made motile competent that we can just add to the page.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.870
There is one which is called Life Box,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.800
but it's mainly for images and videos,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.430
but forms or anything like that.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.090
There is not.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.900
This was something that surprised me in the beginning,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.450
and when I watched the tutorial How to build this model with a form inside.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.790
That's when I sort of understood what sort of Web design platform Wetklo Waas,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.190
a professional tool where you build things from scratch like a developer and not just

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.950
dropping ready made components.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.570
So it might be surprising for you to.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.440
But that's what makes Wife'll awesome.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.850
So let's begin what happens when Moto opens up There is a background color that overlays on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.340
top of the entire page,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.000
and there's this form inside it right then on a close,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.180
it all disappears.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.890
First,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.590
let's build that,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.040
and then we will take care off the interactions.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.270
I'm going to add a D block and put it on top of the page and name it.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.360
Motile rapper.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.410
That's where everything is going to go now we need to overlay this on the entire screen.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.750
We can do that by fixed position and selecting full.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.850
Let's give it a caller so we can see what's going on.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.310
So it's boiling the hero,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.920
but not the section after it.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.500
And also it's behind the nab our but we wanted to go on top of everything to all related.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.750
On top of everything,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.730
we need to use a feature that we haven't discussed yet.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.150
Z Index,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.300
which we confined under position settings.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.750
It shows up on all positions besides auto or static,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.980
Z stands for easy access.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.750
The death.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.380
Basically,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.650
it lets us control stacking off elements on top of each other by default.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.000
Most elements are set to zero value.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.340
If you have two elements overlapping each other,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.450
one that has hires the Valerie is going to stack on top.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.730
I have also linked the Web close video tutorial on Z Index in case you want to learn a bit

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.480
more about it.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.690
So if I change the index to want,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.730
it's going to stack on top off all zero values.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.570
Great,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.470
but it's still behind the nap are how come the number doesn't show that it has a Z value

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.950
inside.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.910
But since number is that ready made competent,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.650
probably has some defaults.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.990
The index from West Flow,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.760
which makes sense because now bar own mobile views,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.970
has a drop down menu,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.470
which needs to stack on top of everything.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.050
If we are opening the menu on mobile devices or tablet devices,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.650
if we give our model higher sea index value,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.950
then it will stack on top.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.340
We can see what the value for the now bodies,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.640
but I'll tell you straight up,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.680
it's 1000.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.420
So if we set model at 1000 and one man is going to do the trick,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.390
if it doesn't for you,

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.750
maybe the values differences go higher and higher until it parks.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.510
There is no limit.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.570
How How you can go.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.050
Put 10,000 if you want.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.320
Okay.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.900
Finally,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.310
let's make the motel rapper a little transparent.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.650
Something like 80%.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.710
Next,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.390
we need a model in the centre before we at that.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.450
Let's turn wrapper into flax box so we can align content in the center.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.990
New do block will go right in the middle.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.750
Name it motile and style it.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:25.290
Next,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.320
just edit content.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.920
A headline,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:35.470
a paragraph in the form block way Don't have designs for this.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.420
I'm just winging it for demonstration.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.950
We already have classes for the form elements,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.060
so let's just reuse those like button and field.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:59.450
Uh

00:04:59.450 --> 00:06:07.850
uh uh uh uh.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:16.500
I'm going to give the motel maximum with.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.320
So the content fits nicely inside the fields have Maxwell.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.450
That's why they're cutting short like that.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:51.150
Uh,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:07:02.350
excellent.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.600
We need one more thing on the model.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
A close button.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.120
Otherwise,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.020
how do users know where to click?

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.940
To close the model.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.930
We can put something like cancel or close link underneath the button or an X icon on the

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.070
corner off the motel.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.910
Let's go with a close.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.920
I can because it's a little more difficult,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.480
so you'll learn more in reality already know everything you need to build this.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.840
We just need a close I can,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.030
which we can get it from flat icon and then position it in the top right corner by using

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.250
absolute positioning.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:41.050
I'm going to put the ICANN inside another day block.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:49.450
Let's give the image of with off 16 pixels.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:57.020
Now we can set obsolete position on the parent a block to position it on top of the right

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.550
corner.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.670
But when you do that,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.150
it's going to jump to the top corner off the page,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.100
not the model.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.950
Do you remember what we need to do?

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.990
We need to set the model to relative position so that the ICANN is positioned relative to

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.220
the model there.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.350
Now we can position Aiken nicely by giving some margins,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:25.560
just so you know,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:25.960
as Vidya,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.040
colors are creditable and fig MMA.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.800
If we wanted,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.810
we could open this SVG in fig MMA and change the color to match our palate from the project

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.810
,

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.660
but we don't have to do that right now.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.850
We can instead decrease the opacity to something like 30% to make it great.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.760
Okay,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.050
let's check the preview.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:52.120
The cursor doesn't change to a hand.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.700
I should have used a link block instead of a regular day block,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.400
but that's okay.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.550
We can manually change the cursor tie from the Styles panel.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:14.140
It's that is it.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.020
And we can increase the clickable space so users don't have to be so precise on pointing it

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.880
on the I can.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.030
You can do that just by increasing padding on the parent element,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.850
not pay much.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:33.720
But now we should decrease the margins or it's too far from the ach.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:43.210
Maybe even removed the margins hover.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.350
Effect would be nice.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.580
We can simply increase the opacity on harbor and off course.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.120
Give it a transition a fact.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.350
So it's nice and smooth,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:10:09.000
and that's all.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.300
The model is not now what we need.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.190
Interactions close and open interactions.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.220
Let's start with close since it's already open.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:24.580
Our trigger is obviously the clothes I can select and add a new click trigger on the

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.350
clothes Aiken.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:34.750
New animation and name it close model.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.450
So what are we animating?

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.500
The entire model rapper?

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.860
We wanted to disappear.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.560
So select the model rapper on the canvas and add a new action.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.050
We can simply change the opacity to 0% sort phase out.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:56.680
I changed the easing and make the transition faster.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.550
Something like 200 milliseconds.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:04.580
That's all good.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.720
But if you move your mouse over the canvas,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.620
you'll see that motile and form elements are still there.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.680
That's because we simply made a transparent.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.090
They didn't go anywhere toe,

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.300
actually hide them from the page.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.520
We need to change the display to not right after that,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.150
fading animation is done so we can add a new action,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.300
which is hide and show action and inside display sent.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.480
Things were going to change it to,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.450
not or hidden.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:34.000
Check the preview.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.050
How it all works.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.200
Perfect closing is doing fine.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.290
Also,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.910
it would be nice if we could trigger close by clicking the area outside of the model.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.480
So basically closing when the user clicks on the background space on your first instinct

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.750
might be to act that to the motel rapper,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:12:03.560
but that's not going to cut it because even though it works,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.350
it also triggers when you click anywhere on the model to even inside the fields.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:14.430
Because all that is nested inside the motel Rapper so clicking the form is considered same

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.040
as clicking the motel rapper.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.460
So we need a new element that's over laid behind the motel,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.850
and we're gonna set the trigger on that element.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.320
Give it similar style like the Motile rapper,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.770
fixed position and full.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.480
No need for the background color.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:41.450
Keep it transparent now if you add this close area after the model that is going to stack

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.650
on top of the motel.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:49.790
But if you move it before the model than model will stack on top,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.160
usually that order changes enough.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.080
But if for some reason it's not,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.280
then you can use the index values.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.190
Give Model Hires Index,

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.830
for example,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.170
two and one for the close area,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:12.070
and that will do the job ed the same close interaction to that close area,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.850
and that's it.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:23.010
Now,

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.640
when we click on the model itself,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.490
nothing happens.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.260
But when we click on the background,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.350
it's going to close.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.790
Finally,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.910
we need to add the open interaction before we do that?

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.280
First,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.020
let's hide the motel wrapper on a default state that weaken due from the style spanner

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.980
change display to non for the entire model rapper,

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.210
our trigger is the get access button in the nab our.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.450
So we're gonna add a new interaction to that button,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:56.650
a new animation and let's name it motile open.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:03.870
Now we need to select model Rapper to add animations to it.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.120
But we can't do that from the cannabis anymore since its hidden.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.080
So we have to selected from the navigator once it selected at a new action.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.720
Since the model is hidden first we need to show it.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.380
So choose hide show from the drop down and then change the display to flex.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.220
Why flax?

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.690
Because that's our original display setting for the model rapper.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.270
Okay,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:25.590
good.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.060
But that just shows the whole thing instantly know fading to add fading.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.560
We need to start it from 0% opacity and then ended 2 100% opacity.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:46.340
So let's add 0% 1st which we're going to set it to initial state from this toggle because

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:46.980
if we don't,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.340
then it's going to show 100% because of the display settings,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.470
then jumped to 0% and then transition to US 100% again,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.340
which is a terrible animation.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.960
So 0% has to come before the hide and show action,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.880
and now we can add 100%.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.770
Opacity is the final state change,

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.010
the easing and duration to similar values,

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.090
as we did with clothes.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.850
And that's it.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:27.980
Let's just the whole thing in preview moat perfect.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.290
All is working fine,

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.140
and that's how you create a custom model in wet flow.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.680
You wouldn't expect that such a widely used thing needs so many steps,

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.710
but that's how all of them are built.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.650
Developers even have to coat the whole thing by hand.
