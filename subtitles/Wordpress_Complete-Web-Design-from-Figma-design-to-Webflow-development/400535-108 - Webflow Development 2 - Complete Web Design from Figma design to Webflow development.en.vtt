00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
all right,

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.140
This is my favorite part building designs inside Wetklo in this section.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.660
We're going to build that home page design,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.380
and we're going to do this by already using everything we have learned in weap Low,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.130
but also some new concepts that we haven't covered yet.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.070
In the next section,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.220
we're going to learn interactions,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.920
Tool inside wept flow,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.390
and we're going to use it to create some interactions and animations to bring the entire

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.430
page to life interactions.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.260
Make Website more exciting and impressive is going to be fun.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.880
And in the section after that we're going to build up log where we're going to learn CMS

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.680
content management system by wet flow and how to turn any page into a dynamic page to pull

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.450
information from the database and how to actually build a database inside,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.500
ah wept flow and how to structure it so we can create the nice blawg with different dynamic

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.230
fields like author's name,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.990
headlines,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.440
photos to cover photos and all that.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.610
So,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.740
without further ado,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.520
let's dive in,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.070
stick around
