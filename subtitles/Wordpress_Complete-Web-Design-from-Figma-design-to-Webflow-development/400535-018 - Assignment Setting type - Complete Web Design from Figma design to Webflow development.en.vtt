00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
typography is huge for Web design,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.700
and learning how to set type properly is going to make you a superior Web designer.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.920
In this video,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.560
we're going to drill a little fun exercise on setting type,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.340
which basically means simply said,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.960
it's ah,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.050
choosing the right phone size right line hides waits for the phone and letter spacing.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.900
That's all.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.890
It just Combining all these four different elements to make something loca deliberate is

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.390
usual.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.630
You'll find this fig meth I'll under the resources either on the page that I have linked

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.650
around the resources off the video.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.800
And when this stigma pile,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.460
I have arranged five blocks of text.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.630
Each one has a headline and a paragraph.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.850
Each of these blocks are set up in a different type.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.210
Faces the same type phase for the headline in the paragraph.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.770
Pair the name off the typefaces right here on the corner.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.370
Don't worry about the content.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.450
It Saddam attacks that have generated randomly.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.610
I want to go through each of these blocks and improve the typesetting for each pair you're

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.430
going Stewardship.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.850
Two things first,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.140
Good tax readability is gonna be a cheered by mainly adjusting phone sizes and line hides.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.930
All the textbooks are set in their default line heights for some of these phones.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.170
Their default line hide mine have pretty good readability,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.690
like crimson tax here,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.850
but for others,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.350
it might be a little too tight.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.520
There are no specific rules for a line hides.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.850
Just measure it based on your eye and increase it up and down and see what feels the most

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.170
pleasant to you when you read it.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.140
The same goes for the phone size.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170
They're all sat in 16 pixels.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.370
But,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.990
as you can say,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.780
16 pixel is quite different from one to another.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.720
For example,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.650
16 on Crimson Tax is way too small,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.780
and second,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.980
your goal is to achieve good hierarchy between Headline and the paragraph.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.730
Remember,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.910
our lesson about hierarchy,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.260
right?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.110
The visual hierarchy makes design easier to follow and more pleasing to or not.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.740
You can achieve this high brick in between the headline and text by making the headline

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.750
very large or very heavy or both.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.570
To achieve both of these goals,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.250
you're allowed to adjust one.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.530
The phone size second,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.490
the front weight and the Lion Heights.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.020
No need to worry about the letter spacing.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.180
Just keep them as they are.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.620
Also don't change the typeface or the color.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.350
Keep it as they are.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.030
You're free to adjust the position off each textbooks.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.910
In fact,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.200
you will most likely need to adjust it because as you start setting your type,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.250
things will have to be moved around accordingly.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.450
But I want you to keep their We thought each tax box as it is,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.500
they're all 500 pixels wide right now.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.040
I want you to work within those constraints and set your type in the best way.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.750
With these those dimensions,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.490
the height of the box will adjust automatically.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.220
Let me demonstrate the first month.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.220
First,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.050
make sure that you have zoomed your canvas toe 100%.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.030
Otherwise,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.350
you won't see the realistic size.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.340
There are many different ways to zoom in and out in fig.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.940
MK to most common ways is either pinching your mouse bed on laptop.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.520
This will probably work on only on newer laptops that has the support of multi ancients

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.810
pinching action or another way,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.340
which is with your mouse wheel and while holding control or command on Mac and with your

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.150
most biologists,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.720
go scroll up and down and while you hold on control or command,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.030
and it's going to zoom in or out.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.780
Or my favorite way,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.640
which is just Teoh Heat the shortcut shift zero.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.250
And that's going Teoh instantly zooming to 100%.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.870
You can see the shortcut.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.290
If you go to this view options and then under the drop down,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.870
you can see that some to 100% has this short capped off shifts era.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.420
Most of your design work should be done in this normal state.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.920
Otherwise,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.350
you won't be seeing the realistic picture of sizes and proportion.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.280
However,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.520
it is okay to zoom in and out when you need,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.450
for some reason,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.930
okay,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.060
so once we've made sure we're working in normal from state first I will adjust the headline

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.060
.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.180
I wanted to be thin underneath the phone name.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.200
You can select the phone.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.700
Wait.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.970
As I previously mentioned available options,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.350
you're dependent upon family itself.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.150
And if you have installed all the available styles on your computer,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.050
or if it came with figment.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.370
So I select thing now to achieve a good visual.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.840
How American between the headline and the paragraph,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.050
I should increase the headlines sides.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.800
And since I went with a thing headline.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.150
I should make it even bigger than what I would do for a heavier tax style.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.050
I'm pressing in our parochial,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.200
which increases the phone size by one pixel as I'm a large and my tax,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.730
I'm also paying attention to where my tax breaks since the wheat off my tax boxes fix that

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.350
can break the tax on Lee based on its size or weight.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.870
The breaking off the tax is important because you don't want toe the tax to break on an odd

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.600
place like,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.420
for example,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.280
at an article A and the Wards jumping on the second line.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.000
That doesn't make a good readability in the sentence that the best line break is when a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.160
telescope is on the second line or when buying a telescope is on the second line.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.640
I even prefer the second version because there is a logic breaking the sentence.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.420
The basics off what,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.890
buying a telescope?

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.350
OK,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.320
I quite like how there have dying looks.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.870
Now I'm going to adjust the paragraph tax.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.130
In most cases,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.350
I wouldn't touch the paragraph weight and keep it Regular.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.540
Regular is usually the best option for paragraph tags,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.040
but because I have made the headlines white skinny.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.460
The paragraph feels heavy in comparison and is stealing a lot of attention from the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.020
headline.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.870
Remembering visual hierarchy would clearly define what should be the most noticeable

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.450
element.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.620
Then second,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.250
most noticeable and so on.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.940
Now I'm going to increase the line hind off this paragraph,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.360
the default line height off this phone,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.490
which is roboto a roboto,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.130
a roboto.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.420
I'm not sure how to pronounce that is very tight.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.020
Doesn't make a good readability experience.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.930
So I'm going to increase it from this line.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.750
Height filled.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.330
All right,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.050
this looks great.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.870
The headline is thin and sleek,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.810
but still grabs the main attention and paragraph taxes,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.440
airy and easy to read.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.810
What an improvement of what it was before.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.700
Let me show you.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.660
What would I change if I went with a heavy headline instead,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.630
In this case,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.650
I would actually decrease the line height off the headline taxed.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.560
Remember,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.750
as I explained in the lesson,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.320
when dealing with large and very bold tax,

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.830
we might need to shrink the line height.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.950
That's because the ladders have gravitational pull and heavier objects pull each other

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.600
together.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.460
In this case,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.750
I'm going to return the paragraph tax back to regular weight.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.960
I generally avoid using seen ways for paragraph text on desktop screens that don't have

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.290
very high pixel density.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.850
T can be hard to read.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.290
All right,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.690
that's it.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.620
Very simple and fun exercise to practise,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.440
setting type and messing around with different values of heights and phone sizes and

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.940
whatnot.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.960
And in the upcoming excitement I'm going.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.440
Teoh,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.560
check out your submissions.
