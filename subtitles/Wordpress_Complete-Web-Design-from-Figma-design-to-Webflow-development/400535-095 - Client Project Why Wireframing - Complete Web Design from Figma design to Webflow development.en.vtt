00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
before I had my design process may have down.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.790
I often struggled with coming up with designs.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.620
The problem was,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.480
I didn't have content to design.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.180
You can't really choose a correct typeface.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.810
If you don't know the tax that it's going to go with,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.150
you can design a benefit section.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.950
If you don't know what the benefits are,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.350
you can choose the right photo.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.950
If you don't know what's the tax next to it.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.760
You can design a team page if you don't know how many team members there are.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.150
A team page with 55 team members is going to look very different from a page that has only

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
three team members with really long biography.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.550
It's at one point I started working with this amazing agency from Australia.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.420
Unlike me,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.320
they had a proper design process.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.780
The first app was to write down the content off a page before doing any designs.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.980
Working with them got me into the habit of writing the content first,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.750
and I realized how much I was torturing myself by trying to design a blank piece of page.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.780
Once you have the content,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.620
design decisions become obvious and they come to you easily.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.840
Now.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.700
Getting content from the client is not very straightforward.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010
Most of the time,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.080
they don't have any experience on writing the copy off the page right there.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.940
Not copywriters.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.940
They're not designers.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.090
They didn't have much experience with this,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.270
so they don't know how to properly.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.850
And what's the best way to structure a page or a website,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.360
and they need our help for this.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.290
Many designers don't do this,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.450
and they pass the hot potato to the client,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.790
and obviously the client will come.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.370
Who is going to come back with a content that is not very optimal for a page,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.910
and final result off the design is not going to be as good,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.380
meaning.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.850
The client is not going to get the best results,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.750
and they're not going to return for more business to the designer.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.950
Lose lose situation for both of the sides.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.750
So am I suggesting that we should write content for our clients?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.820
Well,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.310
sort of.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.980
But not really.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.910
Here's where wire frames come in.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.670
Generating content for me is part of the wire framing stage.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.530
Here's what I do is I start creating wire frames.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.510
I start thinking about the structure of the content and trying to uproot the page in the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.590
best way possible,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.110
based on the goal off that particular page beat home page or some other lending page or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.220
whatever it is now is that put text blocks on the page,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.790
I start filling those tax blocks out with example text with something that I think might be

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.710
useful for this particular section.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.140
I'm not really a cooperator,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.400
and English is not even my first language,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.990
but I still write down content as much as possible.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.560
If you're English isn't very good,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.500
don't worry about that.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.610
That's not a problem because you weren't hard for your English skills.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.160
You're hired for design.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.540
Just be up front with your client and explain them.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.450
Whatever you're putting,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.350
there is your example and suggestions to help them,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.710
and they should write their own content.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.600
And what it can also do is you don't have to write that copy.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.740
You can borrow and copy them from other websites.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.790
So during your inspiration phase,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.990
you probably went through different websites and found some examples that are from a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.160
similar start ups or similar businesses,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.970
right so you can grab the tax from there and copy and paste them that.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.620
But always make sure to explain that you're not writing content for them so that you're not

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.010
judging you for that content in that you gather this example from other sites and maybe

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.310
even competitors.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.670
And if you are a little into right and consider taking a copyright in course,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.650
so you can add that to your services.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.050
Clients will love you for taking that part off their hands.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.490
You'll make more money,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.980
win win.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.990
And after I'm done with wire framing,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.130
I shared with my client and ask them to rewrite the content and remove anything if they

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.380
want to and filled it out in their own wards.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.140
Having a layout already with pre field content makes it easier for them.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.650
Teoh,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.250
right that copy.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.720
Because otherwise then it's very difficult for him to understand what I meant there and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.550
what would be the purpose off destruction,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.090
maybe,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.820
and this columns and what they should write in that.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.030
But if I give them examples,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.470
then they get the idea and they can easily come out with something off their own.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.170
I avoid using Lauren Gibson and dummy text like that as much as possible But sometimes we

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.670
have to,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.800
and we cannot avoid it,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.980
because sometimes I have to create a page for or a website for a complicated financial

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.150
services that I have no idea how to describe.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.650
So in that case is I'm going to use dummy tax or maybe somebody's biographies or

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.520
testimonials or something like that.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.490
There is no point off me filling out with anything and wasting my time on its right.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.150
We'll use dummy text.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.120
Another big reason why to use wire frame is because of provisions,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.220
because revisions are part of any design process.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.350
And if the revisions are happening right in the during the design face,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.870
then you're gonna take much more time,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.600
because then you're thinking about colors and making everything pixel perfect and wasting a

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.850
lot of time on something that you sort of already designed and sort of attached your ah,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.800
ego to it.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.960
Because thesis what often happens with designers because whatever work that we produce,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.380
we kind of feel attached to that work.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.820
But when you're doing wire frames,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.860
you're not attached to it.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.320
They're just,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.500
you know,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.270
ugly skeleton looking doodles,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.280
and we can change it battery easily.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.550
Revisions are easier is there and you know nobody's feelings get hurt.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.890
This is a wire frame off one of my client projects.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.540
As you can see,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.460
it's devoid of any design collars and is very rough.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.240
Has no images or icons.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.870
I was making these website for a scooter sharing app.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.120
Let's go through this quickly so you can understand why I've done.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.750
And what was my thought process.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.990
The navigation bar is pretty simple.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.470
I didn't even put a low going there.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.330
Just a taxing.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.160
It's a logo.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.850
Instead of a hero image,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.250
there is an image placeholder,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.170
and that's all.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.010
At that stage.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.230
I haven't decided what would be the hero,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.370
and it's not relevant to this either.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.950
Although I have decided on the layout,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.450
I wanted to have a hero on the right and content on the left.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.530
If I wanted a hero's a background that I would put it as a background stretching edge to

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.490
hatch on the next section,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.700
I chose to have three column content to describe how the product works in three steps not

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.340
much designed,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.600
but layout is clear,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.440
and I also made the decision that how it works was an important section to have right after

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.100
the hero.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.100
I have filled the content out myself,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.950
sometimes reusing tax from the competitors sides.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.870
An important part is to give example tax to the client,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.870
so they click and start writing right away without much research up.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.480
Next up created a section with a small demonstration off the APP with some benefit.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.930
But let's on the side on this section of actually already had a pretty good idea of how

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.370
would design the section.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.350
I wanted to showcase the app and show them the app in action.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.990
So I plan to have a video gift animation off the app being used a little more showcasing

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.320
and benefits of the product,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.850
like free parking insurance and so on.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.010
Then I had a pricing and testimonial sections pretty straightforward,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.080
and finally we have call to Action Section,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.800
and the food or closing pages,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.480
especially home pages with cold to action section,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.370
is a good idea.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.960
You want to prompt users to do something after they are done getting to know off a product

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.570
or service you don't want to let them hanging.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.750
Their clue is not knowing what to do next.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.750
You might lose them so After I was done with their fire frames,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.790
I shared it with a client and gave them explanation off each section and the thought

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.400
process behind my decisions.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.980
And here's how the final design ended up looking.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.560
You can see how the layout and content is the same,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.620
but it's sort of like it has been colored in.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.460
So those are the reasons behind using wire frames in your design process.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.710
Use them before you get to design Thank me later.
