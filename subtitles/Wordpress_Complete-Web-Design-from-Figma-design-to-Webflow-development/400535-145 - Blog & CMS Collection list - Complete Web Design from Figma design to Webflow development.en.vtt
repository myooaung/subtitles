00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.025
There are two ways to pull items from CMS.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.215
One is by using Collection Pages.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.510
That's what we've done with the blog post.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.760
Every new collection we create is going to have

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.160
a collection page automatically created for them,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960
which we can access from here.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.585
But what if we want to push CMS content elsewhere?

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.230
For example, on static pages like the homepage or on

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.400
the blog page where we have all those block cards enter a collection list.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.220
Collection list is an element that can be dragged from

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.235
the elements panel on any page and anywhere on the page.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.320
When you drag a collection waste on the page,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.810
you get a bunch of empty purple boxes.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.595
Nothing to see here just yet.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.560
First, we need to connect it to a particular collection.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.775
In our case, blog posts.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.500
Now we get this,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.850
the boxes are still empty,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.235
but this time you can see familiar titles.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:52.805
Each box is corresponding to the blog post in our database.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:57.920
Collection list by default displays all items in that particular database right now,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.390
or five or six of them.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.910
We have a control over how many to show at a time,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.680
but we'll discuss that later.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.500
We also get this layout controls are blocked.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.410
Read has three columns so we can easily switch it to that.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.550
Now our blog cards will be displayed in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.790
a three-column grid just like we intended, but not yet.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.060
There is still empty. If you check the preview mode, they disappear.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.145
To start binding elements to the CMS.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.715
First, we need to drag elements inside one of these purple boxes.

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:34.400
Once we do that, then each element inside will gain

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.405
dynamic qualities and we'll have option to connect to specific CMS field.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:40.430
In this case, we need to drag the whole block

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.890
hard in one of the boxes, doesn't matter which one.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.280
There's no way to select the entire block card right from the Canvas.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.800
So make sure to select it from the Navigator.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.225
Then while it's selected,

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.895
click and drag it in one of the purple boxes.

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:55.520
If that's tricky, you can do that from the Navigator Panel

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.070
altogether and drag it inside the collection item.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.935
All right. I'm sure you have questions on watchers happened.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.064
Why the black cards have multiplied?

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:06.320
The thing is collection list works sort of like a collection page.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.030
One means all acting as one organism like some kind of hive mind.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.700
Once we bind elements with the CMS fields,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.800
then appropriate content will be pulled.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.010
So let's connect elements to their appropriate fields.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.005
See the moment you connect it to the CMS field and headline of each card

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:34.190
updates instantly based on which particular blog posts they're connected to.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.810
Until we make these connections,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.860
then all elements are

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.580
normal static elements and each item will be exactly the same thing.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.405
Remember that the avatar and damnable need to be connected from the settings.

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:56.550
Since we are using dynamic styles and not dynamic content. So far so good.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.210
The thumbnail makes a little fixing the image is titled.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.130
Remember how we fix that is just going to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.605
the background image property and set to engage,

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:47.700
to cover and position it to the center and it just in case disable tiling.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.800
We need to make some changes to the spacing.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.905
First, let's remove that fixed width from the block card.

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:59.335
It's going to get in the way and mess things up.

00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:00.640
We don't want to fix card,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.630
we want it fluid to stretch and shrink according to the width of the page.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.045
There's already some spacing applied on the collection item by default.

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.185
We can add it there instead of adding new spacing properties to the block card,

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:16.270
it has 10 pixel padding on the sides.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.540
In our designs, gap between each card is 30 pixels,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.790
so it's 15 pixels on sites.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.385
And also the bottom margin or padding doesn't really matter, either one works.

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:32.595
Having padding on the sides creates this little misalignment from the edges of our page.

00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:34.865
You know, where all our content is aligned.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:36.440
This is being a little nitpicky,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.870
but I like things as exact as possible.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.470
You should try your best to develop this habit to obsessing about details,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.255
the good quality for our web designer.

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:46.490
So how do we fix this little misalignment?

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.570
We can have a special combo class for those cars that are on edges there one,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.180
remember, hive mind. But it's quite simple.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.330
We can add a negative margin to the parent that holds

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.680
all those items minus 15 pixel on both sides and done.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.910
You get cards aligned now exactly on edges.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.375
Now let's take care of that odd distribution of the cards.

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:17.270
This happens when the heights of each item are different,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.980
so they are laid out messily.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.465
Breaking our tidy grid,

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:22.880
we can fix this is linked with the Flexbox.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.350
Flexbox is an answer to every layout problem to to that on your hand.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.060
So we need to apply flexbox to the first parent that holds those collection items.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.800
This is collection list.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.620
Make sure you don't select collection list rapper,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.170
that's a grandparent with all that stuff inside.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.720
First you'll get all the items squeezed in a single row.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.240
All we need to do here is to enable wrapping.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.580
And we get exactly the layout that we are aiming for.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.355
There is just one thing this cards aren't actually clickable.

00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:04.790
How do we actually access the blog pages that they represent?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.945
For that, we need a link element that is going to connect to the blog page.

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:11.150
Right now none of the elements are links,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.725
so none of the settings has an option to bind URL to the CMS link.

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:18.380
So we need to turn one of these into a link element.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.480
This can be a headline, for example,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.960
that can be a link or a thumbnail image or both.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.500
Or we can turn the entire car into a link. How do we do that?

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.330
By using the link block element.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.585
So we would have to put the whole card inside a link blog.

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:34.010
These are very valid options.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.310
Different website deal with this differently in this current layout that we have,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.065
I like to have the whole card clickable

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.360
if we have different links to leading different places,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.300
for example, author's name leading to an author's page.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.940
Or if there was a link to a category,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.340
then we wouldn't be able to put the whole thing inside

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.775
the linked block because you can't Nast links inside other links.

00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:53.990
But in this case we can.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.815
So let's go with it. Just add a link block element inside the collection item.

00:06:57.815 --> 00:07:01.025
When you get the settings, you will have this purple page icon.

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:03.500
This allows linking to a collection page,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.130
choose that and select current blog post.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.805
Now that link will go to that blog post page.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:14.760
Lastly, let's move the whole card inside this link block.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.165
We actually don't need that extra d block.

00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:24.910
We can apply the block card class to the link block

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:34.640
itself and move the thumbnail and content inside it.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.990
And get rid of the extra block.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.190
All right, let's have a look in preview and test the link.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.585
There is one thing that bugs me a little different heights of the cards.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.385
To be honest, it's fine like that,

00:08:24.385 --> 00:08:26.740
but equal heights would make it look nicer.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.630
That's what we have in designs. Don't waive.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.750
All the cards are the same height regardless their content,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.885
and that makes the grid a little more need to do the same.

00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:38.245
We just need to stretch the cars to fill up the empty space,

00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:41.970
the collection items since it's a flex child, it's already stretching.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.685
But the block card isn't.

00:08:43.685 --> 00:08:46.565
If we give a block card a 100 percent hide,

00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:49.100
that is going to fill up the empty space.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.960
Remember you just need to style one of

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.035
the black cards and all of them will be styled the same.

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:56.510
That's all looking nice, except one thing,

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.860
the author and date block are on different positions everywhere in our designs,

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.750
we have them glued to the bottom,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.345
which creates much nicer layout.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.550
Now how can we make that happen?

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.800
First, if you have a look at the parent element,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.510
which is Card content,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.540
then you'll see that it's not stretching all the way to the bottom.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.810
So first we definitely need to make that stretch these time.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:23.540
100% height isn't gonna work because that means 100% of the parent's height.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.595
Block card is the parent which is taller because there is the image inside too.

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:30.680
So if we give it 100%,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.570
it's not just going to fill the empty space,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.580
but it's going to go beyond the borders.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.220
So how else can we make it fill the space?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.910
Here's one way we can make the parent that blog card at

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.320
Flexbox with a vertical alignment.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.740
And then under flex child settings we can change sizing to stretch for the cart content.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.910
One note for those who are working on safari in Webflow,

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.660
these sorption growth possible has a little bit of a bug inside with

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.950
clothes designer and you're going to get and this.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.635
So it's not going to work when he switched to grove,

00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:12.830
possible and steady, you're gonna get this weird clipping.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:18.035
This just happens in Safari and eat only happens inside the designer.

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:20.240
It's not going to happen now on

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.080
an actual published website on safari in there, it's fine.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.540
It just something, there's some sort of a bug between

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.860
the workflow designer and Safari and it just doesn't work like this properly.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.545
But there is a very simple solution.

00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:36.440
Just instead of having it grow if possible,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.875
go to these customized settings.

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:44.240
Click on this. In within this Customize settings.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:54.455
There are our numerical values and put inside the one hand inside shrink, put 0.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:58.730
This is essentially it's exactly the same what we are doing it,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.070
this actually means growth possible.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:07.910
And this is how the CSS represents this growing function.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.080
It just inside workflow.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.510
We had this nice buttons to do this for us.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.900
But this button somehow just doesn't quite work with workflows.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.475
Web inside multiple designer,

00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:21.935
but this is a solution. So do that.

00:11:21.935 --> 00:11:23.045
If you are on safari,

00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:24.500
on any other browser,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.055
you're good to go as it is with growth possible.

00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:29.870
Now for the second step,

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.125
we need to somehow glue the author block on the bottom.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:38.180
One obvious option is to again turn the content block into a flexbox with

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.840
vertical alignment in change justify settings to

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.115
space between that is going to push the objects to the edges.

00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:50.345
Now the author block is glued to the bottom on every car, which is lovely,

00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:54.875
but that makes post summaries spaced out evenly as well. We don't want that.

00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:59.390
We want pose summary to be grouped together with a headline. This is, is it to fix?

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.990
We just need to wrap the headline and the post summary inside a div block.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.300
And that's all. When I say wrap something,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.720
it means to add a new block and put the elements inside.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.250
Wrap like a gift box.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.990
And that's all. Let's check the preview.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.330
All working grade. There's one other thing we need to do.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.100
We need to add a pagination.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.000
Pagination means to distribute this block cards on different pages.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.920
We don't want every single card loading on

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.890
this page and we have more than 20 or 30 block cards,

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.675
then it's going to slow down the page.

00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:49.354
That's why we need pagination.

00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:51.035
We'll do that in the next lesson.

00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:52.620
Stick around.
