00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
We're back with a final part for this,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.205
here is a call to action section.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.475
It's where you directly tell the audience to take some action,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.025
sort of summarizing the entire page.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.295
It usually has buttons on it or directly the sign-up form,

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:17.190
they're using the same purple but would decrease the opacity.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.350
Let's do the same with our blue. It's quite nice.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.770
10 percent looks quite good.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.170
Lock the layer so it doesn't get in the way.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.450
I'm actually going to shrink this headline here,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.195
so the word small jumps to the next line.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.660
It will look better. They're using a white button here,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.460
but I'm going to stick to the coast button.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.450
I'm pressing Alt or Option key here to see that distances between objects.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.290
I like their stars rating and a small copy here.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.895
This is called social proof.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:37.670
Great idea to include something like this on call to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.180
action section makes deciding easier for the users.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.965
Okay, we need a star icon.

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:48.200
Let's go to a flat icons.com and search for a star icon.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.390
We can download it for free from there.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.340
I can see here are free for personal use,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.350
but if you are going to use it somewhere,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.340
then you must credit the author or by their subscription.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.660
Thank you. Smash icons.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.400
We need SVG format,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.275
which is editable in Figma.

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:04.880
We're going to be able to change,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.950
call our a41 to and then just place it as with any image.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.000
Now here's the beauty of using SVG file format.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.880
I wanted to use our own yellow so I can

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.730
simply change the color like with any other shaping Figma.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.020
Remember the tidy up.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.690
I can adjust that spacing from here.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.070
All right, Looking sharp.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.260
Instead of a desk with computers,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.270
I'm actually going to use a photo here,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.000
maybe photo of a team office or a small

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.060
business owner to represent what the headline says.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.490
This photo looks quite good,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.910
sort of like a startup with a team that works in different places.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.340
So they need a good communication platform.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.820
I'm just playing around here to see what we could put

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.315
this image like a split section background like we've gotten in other assignments.

00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:20.160
But also I can stick with the same style because consistency will be rewarded.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.760
And do something like this.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.590
I'm at those dots behind the image.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.035
That looks pretty good actually.

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:39.580
The further and that's it.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.110
We're close to the finish line.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.450
Let's copy the logo and give it a blue color.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.400
There is some micro copy underneath the logo.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.760
We can do the same. There are footer is divided into four columns.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.155
We can easily arrange a similar layout for us using our own layout grid.

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:13.865
We have 12 columns in our grid.

00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:15.290
If we divide it into four,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.150
we're going to get three-point blocks,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.350
given the small links,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.820
three columns might be too much.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.145
So let's use two columns for each block.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:26.240
Splitting it into six blocks will even fit more in one line.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.400
That's the beauty of using 12-point grid.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.010
It divides into many flexible variations.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.005
I'm going to leave this two columns empty.

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:36.110
Having this gap between footer links and logos and looks

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.530
very good creates this visual separation between the two,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.950
which makes sense because the logo is different than the footer links.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.710
Alright, now let's fill out this links with some random text in places like this,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.135
it's always best to use realistic example text rather than Lorem Ipsum dummy text.

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:00.890
Because depending on the text line,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.610
you might end up needing to rearrange the layout a little.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.070
Also repeating the same x just looks ugly.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.095
Let's keep the social icons and other links on the footer.

00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:00.685
Will already done a lot.

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:04.280
Let's just add the copyright tags and that's all.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.600
Now let's just fix those empty gaps.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.950
I'm pressing Alt or Option key here to see

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.240
that distances between objects and using a 180 pixels as a margin.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.220
There is no rule with this really,

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.600
it's based on how it looks.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.240
But the important part is to be consistent when you can't.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.600
For example, I use 90 pixel margin on the midsection.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.275
So I'm going to try to reuse the same value with other marches.

00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:26.660
But sometimes it's too much or not enough.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.945
In such cases, I'll try to use multiples of the same value,

00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:31.640
either half it or double it,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.620
hence the a 180 pixels.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.380
If that's not right, then I'll use a new margin.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.160
Sometimes we might need to be a little inconsistent as long as it fills right?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.170
On the hero, I have to do exactly that.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.850
190 seems too big,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.200
a 90 seems too small,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.595
so gotta go in between.

00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:48.830
Now let's trim the excess space on the bottom.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.500
Don't forget to hold Control or Command while you do

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.230
this or it might distort the content inside.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.620
Once you're done, select the frame and press the play icon.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:09.410
We can now see the presentation of our design. Looking.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:15.890
Write a quick note about the preview mode.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.580
Sometimes you might have your preview looking like this,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.560
which is you're not seeing the whole frame.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.880
If this happens to you,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.910
that means that your screen on your computer is not as wide as the frame.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.585
And our frame sizes 144040 pixels, right?

00:13:32.585 --> 00:13:35.000
So if your screen is shorter,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.250
smaller than that unusual that I have had,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.570
that happens with laptops,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.530
then it's not going to show everything on the screen,

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.185
but there is solution to this just hover.

00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:51.260
On the top here. The bar will appear and go to the Options and then change from here,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.580
which is 100, 100%.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.020
Now, change it to width,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.565
scale down to fit width.

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:57.050
And once you do that,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.430
then it will feed.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:04.685
The frame will fit your screen no matter the size of your screen.

00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:10.940
Now, there is rare occasions another issue can happen which this might not

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:18.245
help in that is if you have selected something different from the prototype settings.

00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:20.570
So to go to the prototype settings,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.270
don't have any frame or any layer selected,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.605
click on the canvas, so everything is The selected.

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:29.200
And then go to prototype.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:36.145
And from the prototype makes sure that none is selected from the device drop-down.

00:14:36.145 --> 00:14:43.060
If there is like iPhone or a custom fit or something like that.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:48.745
You will have weird iPhone screen or something.

00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:51.460
We are, we'll be showing here in the preview mode.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.035
So make sure that none is selected.

00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:58.555
And when going to the preview,

00:14:58.555 --> 00:15:00.100
and if you have some other layers here,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.365
I have some other layers and frames on the page.

00:15:02.365 --> 00:15:05.650
So it might try to preview some other frame.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.010
Make sure to select your desktop frame,

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.595
and then click the preview.

00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:13.850
And then it will preview the correct frame. And that's it.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.040
By choosing an Excel inspiration we

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.505
have designed and created a fabulous looking homepage.

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:21.545
This is the power of good inspiration.

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:22.790
Hope you have enjoyed the process.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.000
I'm very keen on seeing your submission in the upcoming part of this course.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.270
We're going to build this exact page in Webflow, stick around.
