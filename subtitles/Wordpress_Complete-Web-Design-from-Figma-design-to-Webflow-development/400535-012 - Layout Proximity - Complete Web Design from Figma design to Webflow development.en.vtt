00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
one thing.

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.060
Beginner designers tend to do a space out elements equally on the page.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.500
Mainly,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.970
they do these to fill them to space because all beginner designers have a fear of empty

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.490
space.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.350
More about this in the later lesson.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.610
But what design actually likes is grouping elements closer to each other if they have

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.610
something in common.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.200
This is a design concept called proximity.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.130
The basic idea of proximity is that thinks that are related should be close together,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.650
and things that are non related should be farther apart.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.600
In this example,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.700
I have moved all the navigation links closer to each other because they are related.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.430
They have a same context.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.470
Now the headline is closer to the text underneath because they are related.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.670
The buttons are a little farther from the tax,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.250
but two of them are close to each other because they're similar action batons.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.040
They both offer what to do next,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.800
and finally the little tax underneath the green button.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.940
I have moved much closer to the bottom because it's sort of a description off the buttons

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.970
so it can even exist without it.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.560
Now what happens if you put unrelated elements close to each other well,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.290
this will imply of relation,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.080
which in fact doesn't exist.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.030
For example,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.150
if we put a slogan right next to the navigation links because off its proximity,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.050
users will easily confuse the slogan with a menu item and will think it's a clip clickable

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.600
link,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.450
especially if those elements have a similar style.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.960
Proximity is a very useful design guideline.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.370
Not only it makes content easy to understand and digest for the user,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.700
but it also makes it pretty and design.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.910
And I guess you know things that are simple and easy to understand is quite beautiful for

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.390
the users.
