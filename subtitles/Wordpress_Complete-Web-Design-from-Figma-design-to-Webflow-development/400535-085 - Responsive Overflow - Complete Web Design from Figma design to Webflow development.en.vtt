00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
Now we're going to move down and optimize the next section of this page.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.780
And while we do that,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.550
we're going to learn a new concept called Overflow.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.550
This section looks pretty good on Tablet and doesn't need much editing.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.210
Only one thing I'm gonna change here is the top and bottom padding off the section.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.200
As I mentioned before,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.980
we need a bit more tighter spacing on smaller devices,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:29.950
so 60 pixels should be good on landscape.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.450
We have an overflow.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.360
When you get this sort of overflow on the page,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.650
find the element that is going beyond its parent margins.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.180
That's going to be the cause off the issue here.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.550
It's obvious that the paragraph is causing this because it's outside of the boundaries of

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.470
the container and even section.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.760
The reason is not shrinking is because it has a fixed with.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.810
We made a mistake on the desktop,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.220
and instead of setting responsive value like maximum with,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.070
we gave you the fix with now because this is not an optimal setting,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.200
neither on the desktop.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.340
Let's just style this on the desktop version and let the styles then cascade all the way

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.440
down before we move on Let's actually understand what is overflow.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.350
Is it a bug,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.900
or is it a future actually,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.520
over floors?

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.690
A very handy feature.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
It has its own dedicated setting in the styles.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.450
Let me demonstrate how this works.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.320
We have a deal block here,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.880
I've added to this day of exact with and hide its 900 pixels by 300 pixels.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.080
If we put more content into this death block,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.950
that content will overflow.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.140
Why?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.870
Because it has a defined high 300 so it's not going to grow beyond that size.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.060
If we remove that high value,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.550
you'll see the box will grow with the content.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.630
But sometimes that's not what we want.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.920
And we want to keep the box at exact dimensions.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.690
If you checked overflow settings off this deadlock,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.500
you'll see that it's set to visible.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.540
This means that overflowing content will still be shown.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.070
If we set it to hidden,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.550
the content will be clipped,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.040
and it's not going to show no matter what we do,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.050
even if we tried to scroll inside it.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.650
But for such cases,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.560
we have another option to make the content inside scroll.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.170
But this option isn't very good because it always shows a horizontal and vertical scroll

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.570
bar,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.520
even if there is not enough content to scroll for these,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.270
we have a better option that last auto thes displace crowbar Onley.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.940
If there is something to scroll,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.250
horizontal bar is gone.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.860
And if there is content overflowing vertically than it will show the scroll bar,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.340
this is always a better option.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.070
If you're creating a scroll level content just to note on your computer,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.150
you may or may not see this difference.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.700
This depends on the settings who have chosen inside your operating system inside macro

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.250
windows.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.600
Another thing to note the overflow sendings are sat on the parent element,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.640
not on the Children.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.610
So in this case,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.760
we sat it on this whitey block.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.350
If we said it on the paragraph,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:08.810
that's not gonna do anything besides growing content.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.790
Another common use for overflow setting is when we want to clip content,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.770
and that's usually done with images.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.380
We never want to clip tax.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.010
Probably,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.240
for example,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.110
if we have a section with an image and we want to clip that excess off that image,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.870
we can set the overflow hidden on the parent element,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.550
and that's going to clip the image.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.870
All right,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.800
let's finish up our mobile views.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.590
We still have this gap on the page,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.170
but that's caused by some other element on a different section.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.440
So we will take care of it once we get there.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.290
Now let's do something about this very narrow look on hero section.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.570
We have changed the padding to 30 pixels,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.570
but we never did it for this section.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:00.430
So let's do that and last decrees the vertical padding as well,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.250
to be more economical and spacing.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.740
I'm actually going to decrease this on landscape as well,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.700
because vertical space is even more important on the landscape and reset the value in

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.190
portrait.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.440
If you have changed them at any point,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.790
it's better to inherit values than to repeat the stars because it just adds extra code,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.990
which we don't need and finding.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.170
Well,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.350
let's do something about the headlines too big for the mobile.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.100
Now remember,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.640
the heading is in a class we styled attack.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.800
So this is how we're going to style this select H one headings from the selector dropped

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.650
down and then change the styles that will change all a Tron headings for mobile portrait's

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.850
but won't affect other devices.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.190
All right,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.050
35 pixels works quite well.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.240
Finally,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.400
what to do with that image?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.060
It's too small to be anything.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.850
There's one thing we can do.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.130
We can have a magical off the site and quipped Overflow,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.580
using what we just learned.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.130
First,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.760
we have to increase the size of damage when it comes to changing.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.430
Emphasizes in response abuse.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.000
Never used these settings.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.660
These changes that HTML settings off the image,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.450
and that's going to change the size everywhere on old devices.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.600
You could also drag the image to resize,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.750
but don't use that high,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.610
very changes that same with that's inside the settings.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.850
What we want to change,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.030
instead is the CSS style of damage,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.930
because CSS style gives us flexibility to have different sizes.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.150
Some different devices to do that,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.250
select the image.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.640
You see this max width off 100% that tells the image to do not grow bigger than its parent

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.400
container.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.950
So that's why it's drinking.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.920
Since this is a rare scenario where we want the image to actually grow beyond the container

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.520
and even beyond the page,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.400
we're going to add it that exact setting and set it to something like 170% and now it goes

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.190
off the page.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.520
And since it's bigger now,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.650
we can see a bit more detail off the image.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.220
But we have image overflowing like this.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.320
So what do we do?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.450
We need to set over floor hidden on the parent element to quit the image.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.420
But we can set that on the direct parent,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.500
which is the container,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.250
because container doesn't go old away to that,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.750
the section does,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.420
so we need to put that overflow style on the section.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.850
But let's at the comeback laster it so it doesn't affect all the sections.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.220
And there we go now,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.750
the images clipping right on the edge of the section.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.220
So we've learned important concept,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.840
off overflow and how to use it for our benefit.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.200
Overflow visible is the default setting,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.200
so it will show any content that goes outside the borders off.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.220
The parent element or floor hidden is going to clip the content just like it did here,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.080
and overflow,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.450
scroll and auto will let the contents grow inside the container.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.750
But the scroll option will display persistence,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.270
crowbar,

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.450
even when there is nothing to scroll
