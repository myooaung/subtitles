00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
All right.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.420
Welcome back In this video,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.980
we will finally take care of those arrows on the slider.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.870
In the previous video,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.090
we have learned an important technique that will be useful in order to properly position

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.890
these arrows.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.640
For starters,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.970
we're going to replace the arrow icons with our own Aikens Weaken.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.850
Do that simply by deleting existent Aiken and inserting image element in their place.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:30.780
Just dragon image element inside the arrow block and insert the arrow image which we're

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.250
going to export from Sigma.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:01:00.480
And the same goes for the right arrow.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:22.250
Now we're going to need position feature to place these arrows on the bottom.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.560
If you have a look at the position settings,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.180
it's already set toe absolute by default,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.440
unlike the usual static position.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.750
And that explains why the arrows are sitting on top of the slider.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.830
That's what absolute positioning does.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.550
It yanks the element out off the page flow.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.220
They live on a different dimension,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.580
like layers in fig MMA,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.180
this is exactly what we need.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.040
Absolute position with a bottom right placement.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.400
Once you press on bottom,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.220
right position,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.230
the arrow will be placed on the bottom right corner off the slider element.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.710
Now why the slider element?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.500
Because it's the first parent that doesn't have a static position.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.650
Remember the trick?

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.750
Absolute element is relative to first non static parent.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.640
If there is no such parent than it will be relative to the body,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.410
in that case,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.090
it would jump on the bottom off the page.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.790
So if you see it doesn't work the way you expected,

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.750
check the parent and make sure it's set to relative.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.500
From here,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.930
we can easily position it exactly where we want it.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.170
Let's check the design to see the distances.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.650
Arrows are 60 pixel below the slider.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.980
Now here's an interesting part.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.870
We need to add 60 pixels in one of thes position.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.340
Mallya's.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.040
But which one?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.250
Let's try all of them and see what happens.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:03:00.950
None of this actually work by.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.090
The arrow is positioned like this on the bottom,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.540
right?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.350
This man said zero pixels from the right and zero pixels from the bottom.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.790
The position values tell us exactly this.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.100
If we add 60 pixels on the bottom,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.390
then it's going to move.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.550
Six depicts us upwards from the bottom edge for it to move outside of the slider than we

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.250
have to go negative values.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.830
Actually,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.100
it works more like this.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.680
It calculates distance between bottom off the slider and the bottom off the arrow block.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.950
So often we have to compensate for the height of the element.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.730
By the way,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.650
make sure you type E X next to 60 by default.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.270
As you can see,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.470
it says percentage.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.260
So the field is set to percentage value,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.650
and if you just type six,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.610
it will think you mean 60% that.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:03.760
Now let's apply the same class to the second arrow so we don't have to do all these changes

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.250
again.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:18.670
Let's move the left arrow towards the left.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.610
We can do that by putting some value in the right position,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.710
but before we do that,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.990
let's give the left arrow a combo class.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.470
Otherwise,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.250
that changes will be applied to both of them.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.410
Again,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.580
we're putting value the right because we're telling it to move away this amount from the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.350
right edge.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.050
Excellent.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.150
Let's check the preview and see how it works.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:47.060
There is just one issue.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.250
If you take a closer look at the arrow blocks,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.320
you'll see that they are sort of overlapping.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.900
The boxes are a little divide and in the preview of the entire boxes,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.640
clickable.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.460
So user is able to interact with the empty space to a little bit of interaction with empty

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.960
spaces.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.180
Good.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.680
So user doesn't have to be so precise that aiming the arrow but too much makes it on plus

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.550
overlapping will cause some issues as this are links.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.350
To fix this,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.450
we need to change the with off the era blocks in the with It says it's auto,

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.730
but that's not really true.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.670
There's some default with apply to it that we're not seeing.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.750
Let's give it some size.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.780
I think 40 pixels is good.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.420
I have styled the right arrow,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.200
which has the base class that way.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.850
Both of the arrows were updated at the same time because of the linked based class.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.240
There is one more thing we can do with arrows.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.030
We can hide them on each end.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.050
We can do that from the slider settings.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.470
This is actually a batter user experience that way.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.350
User knows which way they can slide and see when the testimonials have reached the end.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.360
Let's check the responsiveness to make sure it all looks great there,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.850
too,

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.170
and we have just one last section left the food or will do that up next,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.850
stick around
