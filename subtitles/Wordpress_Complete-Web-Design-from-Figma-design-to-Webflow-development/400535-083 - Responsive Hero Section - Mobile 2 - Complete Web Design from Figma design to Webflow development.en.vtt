00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
Let's finish up with the portrayed it for you.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.490
Almost everything is overflowing here,

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.600
but we can fix all these with similar measure we used on previous views.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.100
First,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.250
let's make more space by shrinking padding even more to 30 pixels.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:27.680
Same on the NAB Our on a now bar.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.630
The brand block has a default patting apply to it.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.660
Desktop and tablet doesn't have this but mobile studio,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.150
so let's remove that padding.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.870
I actually forgot to notice this on the landscape view.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.680
It's there as well,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.150
so let's remove that from there.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:56.120
Now we just need to shrink the size off the content first.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.710
If you have a look at the Left Bloc,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.740
you'll see it has a minimum with or 300 pixels on it,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.180
so it refuses to shrink beyond that point.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.890
Let's remove that minimum and set it to auto.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.640
Second,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.840
Let's remove the right margin that sat on the Left Bloc.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.470
We have this margin for side by side layout,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.580
but here with the vertical alignment,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.850
we don't need it anymore.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.350
And let's decrease the size of the headline phoned.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:28.890
The thing with the headline is that on the smaller stuff,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.780
narrowest a screen we have to make it very small.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.520
Otherwise,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.360
we get one ward per line,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.670
which is not idea.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.490
But if you check the super narrow screen is for old Android phones,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.010
the Web usage off the screen sizes are very small.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.440
I've checked the statistics,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.450
and they don't even seem to make 1%.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.220
So most of the time I don't go out of my way to make it perfect for the screen sizes and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.440
sacrifice more common screen sizes.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.910
But there is a way to make it close to perfect for this entire range.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.900
Instead of pig cells,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.050
we can use responsive units for the font,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.360
in this case,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.130
VW for the View port with,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.870
If we give the phone about 14 VW,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.850
that should shrink and grow nicely with screen widths.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:19.940
Now for the buttons with buttons,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.690
we can change the display setting.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.310
So instead of them sitting next to each other,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.780
they can go on top of each other.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.040
Remember which displace that thing does that display block,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.750
which is going to stretch them edge to edge to finish them up?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.260
We can set a maximum with then remove that left margin and at a top margin to create a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.950
separation and that's it.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:03:04.780
Our hero section is sort of done.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.400
We will style the navigation bar in the next video.
