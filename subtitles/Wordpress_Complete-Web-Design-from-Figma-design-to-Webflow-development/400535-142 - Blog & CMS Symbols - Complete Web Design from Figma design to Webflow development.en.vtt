00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.490
In this video, we're going to add a footer to the page.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.750
Nothing's easier than that.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.140
We can copy the further from the homepage and paste it right here.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.735
It's ready, nothing to change and it's already responsive.

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.435
But there is even a better way to do this.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.660
Now, imagine we have a website and it has a lot of pages,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.550
especially a lot of static pages.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.720
On each of these page,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
we're going to have same navigation bar and seeing footer usually, right?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.470
And sometimes we will have some sections like

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.035
a call to action section may be repeated as well.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:38.985
So we'll have, let's say 20 or ten pages in all of,

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.320
on all of these pages.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.785
Same component like footer repeats over and over again.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.525
Now when we want to add it,

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:49.415
this right, we want to end it the footer.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.550
We would have to go edit one of the footers, right.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.215
Then take that further,

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:58.355
copy it and then replace it on every other single page.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:00:59.989
Now when it comes to styles,

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.700
we can easily take care of that, right?

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.590
We already learned we have CSS styles,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.045
we have HTML tags.

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.420
We can just gig go in one place and change one instance.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.415
And across the entire side,

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:12.125
everything will be updated.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:13.835
But how about content?

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:17.060
How about the entire skeleton and structure of Footer?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.670
Let say we decided one column has to go or we have to replace the text of maybe just die.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.000
Little headline needs fixing and changing something in sigma,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.255
we have something that solves that problem. The components.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.985
We can create a component and then

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:35.570
any other instance of that component can be updated everywhere,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.060
right, until it's all written up.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.360
Obviously, we have something similar in Web Flow as well.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.010
Enter symbols.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.555
Next to elements tab,

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:46.980
there is a tab for symbols.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.490
Symbols work sort of like components in sigma.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.670
How making any sort of change to the master component,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.870
even on the content,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.200
is going to update every other instance of that component.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.660
Symbols in web flow work in a similar way.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.130
We can create a symbol out of anything and then reuse it across the website,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.855
except in case of wet floor,

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.225
every instance of a symbol is a master.

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:17.660
So update to any one of them will update all of them.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.420
So we're going to create a symbol out of the footer.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.470
I'm going to delete this one and create a symbol from the one on the homepage.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.920
To create the symbol, just right-click on the element,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.440
in this case the entire section that holds all the footer stuff and click Create symbol,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.600
give it a name and create.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.425
It's going to turn green.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.895
This means it's a symbol.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:49.610
You will see a different indicator inside the navigator,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.485
two with the name of the symbol.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:54.570
Now let's go back to the blog post.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.160
If you go to the Add panel and symbols tab,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.455
you'll see now there's a footer symbol in there.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:02.360
You can drag the symbol on the page,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.610
make sure to drop it inside the body element.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.430
And that the entire folders here.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.230
To edit elements inside a symbol,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.325
you need to double-click on it and you'll see that rest of the content will fade white.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:23.630
That's showing you that we are inside the symbol and only editing elements in there.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.310
And then make changes the way you would usually do and work with any other element.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.750
If we change texts here,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.050
this change is going to reflect on the footer on the homepage.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.805
To exit the edit mode,

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:36.350
press X on the top,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.245
or anywhere on that canvas or escape button.

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:46.730
Let's see the homepage. There.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.910
The change was instantly reflected on this footer as well.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.115
To edit again, just repeat the process,

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:54.350
doesn't matter which, for instance, you added.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.450
Changes will be affected to all of them.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.050
But let's say we do want to have one of the photos to be different. No problem.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.220
You can unlink the symbol,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.190
just right-click on it and select unlinked from symbol.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.390
Now it's independent footer in no way connected to the footer on the homepage.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.910
So any content edits to this one are not

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.820
going to affect to the footer on the homepage and vice versa.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.175
Although keep one thing in mind.

00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:40.310
This is just about the symbol itself,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.675
not about the classes.

00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:43.190
Because if we change the,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.360
something about the class,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.115
so if we change the style and if we change the background of these footer,

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.470
it's going to be reflected back on

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.560
the original photo because we are using the same class.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.110
So classes and symbols, they are independent.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.960
Symbol is just groups all the elements together

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.720
and whatever you change inside will be reflected to anywhere.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.270
So for example, if you decide to change

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.510
a class inside the simple right to apply a new class,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.245
that new class will be reflected on every other instance of that symbol.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.315
It's okay if you, unlike all instances,

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:16.040
that symbol isn't going to disappear,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.845
it's still going to be available inside the symbols panel.

00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:22.010
If there are no instances underneath will say 0 instances,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.900
meaning it's not used anywhere on the side,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.730
but still can be added without a problem.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.800
This is a great way to save some components for

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.170
later and it doesn't have to be a section.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.110
It can be anything a Form Block or even just a textbox.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.550
To delete a symbol first,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.280
you'll need to remove every instance of it from the website.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.650
It won't let you delete otherwise.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.570
So those are symbols,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.225
reusable connected components super-useful.

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:47.720
You can create a symbol out of anything just by right-clicking on the element,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.370
edit anything on any of the instances and see changes refactored on all of the instantly.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.475
Almost always used for footers and navigation bars.

00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:57.860
Are there good uses can be called to action sections,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.395
sidebars for blogs, et cetera.

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.450
As for our page, it's nearly done.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.585
We just need to optimize for responsive versions.

00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:07.155
But this time is quite simple.

00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:10.110
Most of it is ready, so stick around.
