00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.110
Here's one important rule to follow.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.270
When choosing typefaces for your projects,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.620
use maximum two phones for each project and make sure they look different.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.820
Let's discuss first half off this role.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.390
Why only two?

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.790
Because deciphering too many phone styles is overwhelming.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.770
And two will give you enough room for any specific personality that you want to portray.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.340
Se through some display typeface and have something more neutral for the paragraph and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.140
other text.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.180
As for the second half off this rule,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.800
if youse two typefaces that are too similar,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.350
you'll feel like you Miss Clayton and accidentally picked the wrong phone for one of them.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.300
The headline is an open sense,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.850
and the paragraph is sat in Roboto.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.600
The only contrast that is created is through that size and the weight off the headline.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.860
If we put them insane weights and sizes,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.070
you'll see their way to similar,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.080
but not the same.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.220
If you're going with to a very similar types,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.960
then when I just go with one of them,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.180
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.090
In this example,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.050
I replaced open science with play for display.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.850
This looks significantly better.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.830
The contrast between these two tie faces is very high.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.720
1st 1 is a modern Saref,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.170
and the 2nd 1 is a neutral sand Sary's that has high readability for smaller text.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.790
Now this looks deliberate and intentional.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.020
You know,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.710
one of the best ways to make designed look good is to make it feel intentional.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.240
Sometimes you can break the rules and ignore the guidelines and do something that is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.450
completely out off line.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.850
But if you if it feels intentional,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.480
it will probably look good.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.710
This why learning and practicing this design?

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.460
Rosen guideline.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.300
It's going to make you a very good Web designer because your war will fail and look

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.020
intentional.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.930
It's gonna feel like you have put some work and thought process behind it,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.690
and you weren't just throwing things around.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.310
Funny enough.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.530
Open Sanson Roboto is very commonly used.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.850
Pairing Google phones has this option to show popular pairings for the phones that you

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.360
select.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.180
There's just points to the fact that there are a ton of Web designers out there who have no

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.000
understanding of good design principles.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.370
And if you follow this simple typographic guidelines,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.350
view will make your designs much more superior.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.660
This doesn't mean you can pair to a sans serif typefaces together.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.510
When you do,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.890
it just has to make sense.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.690
For instance,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.500
when I pair to sensory types,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.140
it's usually because I want something with a personality for the headline texts and then

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.350
something neutral with excellent readability for the body tax for the main body takes,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.850
I often use the same type faces exposed,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.650
all projects,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.300
depending on what's my obsession for a certain period of time.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.840
I choose something that is neutral and has a lot of phone waits like Open Sands,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.610
Roboto or Muli.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.020
This way,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.940
then I have a lot of freedom.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.480
With that lines.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.600
I can use phones with limited weights but a bit more personality when I will true something

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.640
that's most fitting with the personality of that particular project and the brand.
