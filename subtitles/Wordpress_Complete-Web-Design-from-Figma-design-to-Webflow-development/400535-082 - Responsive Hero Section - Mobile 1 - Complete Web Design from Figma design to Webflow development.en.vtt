00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
As I mentioned in the previous video,

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.500
the style changes cascade down to smaller screens,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.380
so all the changes we made to the tablet is reflected on the mobile views as well.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.870
Usually,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.420
this is a good start and sometimes might even provide good results for Mobil's.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.850
But often it's not enough in we have to add extra tweaking on Mobile is,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.260
too.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.050
I liked his use.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.750
Same layout for mobile landscape and mobile portrait.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.190
I use Mobile portrait as my guide when I plan in my head and try to use solutions for

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.820
landscape here that are going to work on portrait view as well.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.310
It's just a good way to save time and keep things more efficient.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.390
So based on the portrait view on Mobile,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.750
I know that nearly everything is going to be in vertical layout.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.170
Not much space for columns inside by side Lee outs.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.960
There's no way we're fitting hero.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.780
Imagine content next to each other.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.250
We'll need to find a vertical alignment solution.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.810
Luckily,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.910
we have flex box to help us for this.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.590
The default direction of flax boxes horizontal,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.520
but we can change that direction any time to the vertical and alignment options update as

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.840
well.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.260
When we change the direction and this direction change is not going to apply to the desktop

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.210
version there.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.260
It's still set to the horizontal.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.060
That's how awesome the flex boxes.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.420
We can change the layout without alternative HTML structure and setting the styles on a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.790
specific devices.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.740
But before we make this changes last,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.430
give our flax box a combo class because we are using this default flax box elsewhere,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.210
for example,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.850
on Footer.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.480
And we don't want to make all these changes to all the flak sparks,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.250
instances,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:41.210
rial landscape years and actually as tall.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.960
Think of it when you hold your phone in the landscape more,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.640
you're not going to get the visible screen this tall.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.450
It's going to be more like this.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.220
It means vertical real estate is very important for us.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.150
So let's try to shrink spaces and try to fit as much as possible.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.620
For example,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.740
this padding for the section we already shrank this on tablet view,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.650
but we should shrink it a little more.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.050
Same here for the paragraph margin.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.950
40 pixels looks descent.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.240
The photo is a little too small,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.440
and most of it won't be visible in this single screen and user will have to scroll through

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.790
it.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.320
So let's set the maximum.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.400
With on that image,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.600
I'm setting maximum with and not hide,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.050
because if you do a high value than this will happen.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.750
Changing high doesn't preserve the aspect ratio,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.150
but with value dust so on images best to use with to resize them.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.270
All right.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.990
Something interesting has happened here.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.830
The image doesn't shrink anymore on a smaller screen,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.330
and it goes off the page.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.910
This is called Overflow.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.870
When elements go outside off their parent box,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.170
you will come across with overflow of Jack's often,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.730
especially on smaller screens.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.300
These overflowing can happen for many reasons,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.050
and it effects entire page.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.070
For some reason,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.560
Image refuses to shrink,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.350
so it creates an extra space on the entire page.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.560
So how come image doesn't shrink anymore?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.360
Because when we gave an image maximum weight of 500 pixels,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.030
we gave you the permission to grow all the way to 500 pixel.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.520
So does ignoring the dimensions off its parent element.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.370
The sort of behavior is common with images,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.570
some other elements,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.130
for example,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.290
a paragraph is not going to do this,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.220
but images they do because they haven't exact with as part of the file or has a with

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.900
specified in the settings.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.840
So by default,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.900
image will always try to grow to its original file size.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.040
And when we set Max with 2 500 it stops on 500 but doesn't shrink beyond that,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.120
as long as it's allowed to avoid the sort of behaviour.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.470
Wet Floor has an edit default value for every image that you're dropping and Max wheat off

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.830
100%.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.970
This means that the image will take up maximum off 100% of its parent element.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.750
For this reason,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.790
it's best to leave this value untouched.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.620
This thing always gave me a lot of confusion and clueless stairs on my screen.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.300
So now,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.010
instead of styling the image itself,

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.250
I prefer styling the parent off damage.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.850
This way we can avoid a lot of strange behavior down the line,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.440
All right,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.130
so let's give a maximum width off 500 pixels to the parent element instead.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.760
Now this behaves exactly as we want it to.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.250
It doesn't grow beyond 500 intrigues when it needs to.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.980
All right,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.970
we can conclude the landscape you here.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.140
We still have this horizontal overflow,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.060
but this is from other part of the page,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.150
and we will take care of it when we get to it.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.190
We do need to style the hamburger menu,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.440
but we'll do that in the end.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.010
Once we're down with old views off the heroes action up next,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.840
we'll do the mobile portrait view.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.450
Stick around.
