00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
and we're back to build a content off the hero section for stars.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.660
We need a container,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.130
right,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.760
but not the default container from what flow That one is no good now,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.670
very flexible.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.390
Instead,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.520
we're going to drop a regular day block and give it a container class,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.250
which we already created last time inside the now bar.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.440
Now,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.020
as you can see,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.360
this container did take a maximum with,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.850
but it didnt center in the middle,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.880
unlike the nab are,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.170
the reason it didn't center is because we haven't given it any properties that would make

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.690
it center one inside the now Bari Center because we're ploys centering that particular on

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.650
by using some default settings.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.270
So let's center this container.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.210
If you remember,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.250
this happens by giving autumn margin on both sides.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.230
What a margins work like a spring,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.770
not the season but that little Iran device.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.050
It feels the space and pushes the box to the middle.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.220
There is a shortcut to this.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.420
You can press this button and it will center the element in the middle,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.800
meaning it will apply on a margin on the sites I remember to center something in this way

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.930
has to have a fixed with or Max with.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.170
If it has no with the boxes going to stretch from edge Dratch,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.890
so centering.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.810
Want to anything?

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.360
All right,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.650
let's put our content inside the container.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.570
We've got a heading A paragraph and a form will style the having in the paragraph in this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.910
video,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.870
but we'll do the forming the next so we can cover forms.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.450
Maurin depth as we haven't touched them yet.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:32.240
Let's style the heading size is 55 the weight this regular this is saying with other

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.770
instances,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.840
off a headline everywhere in our designs.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.310
So it's going to be a good idea to style.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.090
This headline is an H one tack and not just a class,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.690
remember,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.830
what's the difference between a class and attack?

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.240
The tag is a basic HTML element.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.420
It's how you tell browser that something is a headlining,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.050
a paragraph or a deal block.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.920
If we style an H one tacked directly,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.280
we will be able to control all H one tax on our website without applying any glasses to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.410
them to style attack.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.400
Make sure no classes selected,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.790
so the selector field needs to be empty.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.350
Sometimes you'll forget and will style headline directly that will automatically create a

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.830
new class.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.150
So any changes will apply only to that class.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.800
To fix this,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.750
just remove the class and start over.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.220
Then select all H one headings from the drop down.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.070
Now you're styling the H one tack.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.450
That's exactly what we want.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.210
We need the line height value.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.200
We have a little trick for this to remember.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.530
We can see the line hide inside the code tab in fig MMA,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.250
which is 67 pixels.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.150
All right,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.340
I'm not going to set this to white color.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.960
Do you know why?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.900
Because most of our headlines are not going to re white.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.620
They're going to be that dark blue color.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.820
So instead,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.890
let's set that dark blue collar here,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.750
and then we'll find another way to change this particular one to White.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.760
I'm going to copy the color code from the code stab.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.710
It's easier that way.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.170
Otherwise,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.640
it doesn't show right off the bat.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.380
As we've set,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.860
this color is a style excellent.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.110
I'm also going to save this blue as a global color.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350
Global colors work sort of like tax,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.950
so we can control and added them from one single instance,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.510
the H one tag is ready.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.130
If we add a new headline now,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.950
we will carry that headline styles.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.760
So how about that white color for the hero headline that one.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.160
We can simply add a new class to it and then style it into white electorate,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.240
a classmate and white.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.120
In this case,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.470
if the color is only think,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.970
I'm changing that way,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.730
the classes clear what it does,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.700
and I can reuse this class every time I need a white headline or any other white text for

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.250
that matter.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.000
By the way,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.470
many common color names work inside this field,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.180
so you can just type them out like wide or black paying.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.150
That's on.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.910
One more thing I'd like to change is the top margin.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.150
There is a default help margin of 20 pixels on a Tron tags that's going to add extra space

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.370
to our spacing between sections.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.110
So let's just get rid of it.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.040
If we ever needed,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.150
we can always add it to the particular headline.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.580
As for the paragraph,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.140
we're not going to style the tag.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.370
We're going to style the class instead because the paragraph in the hero section is

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.850
different compared to other paragraph there elsewhere on the page.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.850
-

00:04:32.850 --> 00:05:07.240
Lastly

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.240
,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.980
let's position that hero content properly in the middle.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.370
That's a simple as adding a margin on top,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.080
but we don't want to add a margin on the container.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.940
We're going to reuse that container class across our page,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.490
and we already have it in the knob are so ending a margin on top will alter all the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.930
instances off this container.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.940
There are two ways we can go about this.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.290
We could add a combo class to the container and then at the margin this way,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.900
our base container will be intact.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.120
But a little better option is to add an extra box and put the container inside,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.660
then weaken style that box as we want.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.720
I prefer this option because it's a little cleaner and offers more flexibility down the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.350
line at a new do block and just dragged the elements inside.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.750
You might find it easier to do this from the navigator.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.540
Let's name this day,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.550
block something like hero content and add a similar margin that we have in the designs.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:26.440
And let's give it a max wet so it's contained nicely like in our designs see using the

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.710
separate did block already gave us more flexibility,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.750
but what we can do with it?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.930
Excellent.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.900
Let's check the responsiveness Group C.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.510
We need some space on the sides,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.120
just like we did with a now bar.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.050
We can add the padding to the hero box,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.880
But wait a second.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.860
This doesn't look right.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.910
The now Barno has moved even tighter inside.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.710
That's because we have a padding on the not bar and navigation bar is sitting inside the

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.540
hero block,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.960
so there's double the amount of padding,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.680
making a total of 120 pixels.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.950
So let's remove that padding from the navigation bar because we don't need it anymore.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.150
The one from the hero will take care of it.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.740
You can easily reset any off the stars by clicking here.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.520
I usually use a short god,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.110
which is option plus click.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.270
I think it should be out.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.650
Click for the windows.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.590
Perfect.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.760
Now it's all looking sharp.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.000
We just have a form left,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.590
which we're going to do up next
