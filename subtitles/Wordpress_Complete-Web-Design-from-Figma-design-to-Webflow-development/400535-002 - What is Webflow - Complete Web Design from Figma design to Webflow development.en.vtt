00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
when Apple decided not to include the usual floppy described on their new I Mac,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.370
Steve Jobs quoted hockey star Wayne Gretzky's Maxim Skate Where the pucks going,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.100
Not words.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.410
Ben,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.110
If you're learning new tools,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.640
bat own technology that is going forward,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.310
because by the time you're done learning current industry standard,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.280
it might be already dead.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.940
In this course,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.590
we're not going to learn industry standards like photo shop and board press.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.340
Instead,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.330
we're going to learn tools off the future Fig,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.500
MMA and wept flow.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.670
It takes a little time for the world to catch up because most people there are reluctant to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.260
change.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.850
But they will catch up,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.740
No doubt about it,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.440
just like there are no floppy disks on your computers anymore.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.090
In this video,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.050
I want to answer several questions you might have about Web salt.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.180
So what is wet flow?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.760
But Flow is a no code website builder that is unlike anything else out there.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.570
It helps you design and build responsive websites from scratch,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.670
like any pro Web designer would,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.170
but without writing any coat well,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.630
actually,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.190
Web Flow writes it for you.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.060
You designed everything visually,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.470
while Wetklo rides clean semantic code for you.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.360
You can then either export this coat or keep it and host the website in wet flow.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.710
In addition to the Web designer,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.500
it's a CMS platform sort of like or press,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.510
which means you can build full blown,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.640
dynamic sites like blog's and e commerce websites.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.970
And here is a really big one.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.880
With West flow,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.700
you can build rich animations and interactions,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.170
something that no other platform has and if coding,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.490
it's something that requires advanced knowledge of JavaScript.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.460
But in West Flow,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.520
you do it visually without event.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.610
Thinking about the code learning ref Low feels like learning a new superpower.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.430
It's really a groundbreaking tool that is changing the industry.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.670
A Tesla off Web design and Twitter is filled with love from wet floor users,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.950
anyone from longtime developers to design director off Dropbox.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.780
You won't cite examples building Web flow.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.940
You don't have to go too far.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.770
Wet Flows Own website is fully built in West Flow.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.220
It's far from an average website with nontraditional layouts,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.440
complex interactions and animations.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.760
It's great example off the power of weapon,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.100
though there's also a showcase page on their side where you can find projects posted by

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.520
other wet flow designers.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.020
Just a couple of examples are enough to show how endless are the possibilities of what you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.350
can achieve with Wetklo.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:45.700
But it's not without limitations,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.530
so we cannot build Web applications on Web flow.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.840
At least not yet.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.400
Web applications are sites like Airbnb,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.300
Facebook,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.130
Dropbox,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.810
YouTube.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.630
Basically anything that has user generated content where user log zine and creates and add

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.650
some content on it.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.270
These are 100 times more complex than regular company websites,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.290
and they are more part off software and Web development rather than Web design field.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.100
We could definitely design the front end off all those websites and Web flow.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.980
For example,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.650
Recode's design it and develop it inside weapon oh than export the code,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.540
which is HTML,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.770
CSS and JavaScript.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.200
And give that coat that front 10 kowtow.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.660
The developers who then are going Teoh connected to the Web application.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.780
But we're not going to touch on that in the scores here,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.110
we're going to learn how to design and build regular websites that make the majority off

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.580
the Web.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.850
There is another type of site you can build on Web flow e commerce sites.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.410
It's ah New York addition to their platform.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.880
But we're not going to cover those in this course.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.070
The demand for e commerce sites are much smaller than regular website,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.950
so my recommendation would be to go and move to re commerce site Web design and Web

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.640
development.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.410
Once you gain a good enough riel Warrick experience with regular and general Web design.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.620
It doesn't make a lot of sense to jump right into a complex,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.960
a bit more complex Web development,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.450
which is e commerce rather than regular websites,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.750
which is much simpler and much more straightforward.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.570
One thing you might wonder if there is a demand for wept full.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.560
And that's a valid question because sometimes clients ask for what designers who are

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.990
specializing in specific platforms like board Prize Drew Paul and many more Dancer is.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.410
Yes,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.720
just like other platforms.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.450
There's also a demand specifically for Web flow designers,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.400
although this demand isn't as big as WordPress.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.230
But that's not much of an issue of because majority and most demand for websites and Web

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.080
designers seasons platform specific,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.430
because clients don't usually care where you're going to build our website if they trust

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.560
you.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.430
As a Web designer,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.150
they will trust your preference and your judgment in it.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.470
There are times when you might need to explain why they shouldn't go with the flow.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.720
However,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.660
it's very easy to do because just one single rep low future is enough to convince them to

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.250
go for it.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.540
You see,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.010
clients need to keep their website updated.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.320
They need to create content and you to update the tax on the pages thing to create in your

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.840
block posts and so on.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.980
In war press,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.570
they have Teoh update that content in a very complicated,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.750
clunky,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.070
not very user friendly admin panel which looks something like this for clients.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.830
This is not an exciting thing to use.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.600
It's scary,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.440
and they fear that will break something now in Web flow.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.540
Klein's added content directly on the life site.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.270
No admin panels and weird text editors.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.590
They added exactly what they see.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.010
They can change photos,

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.900
update tax,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.760
and no way for them to break the site.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.530
There are more benefits for clients and other ways you can make the case for Whitelaw.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.640
I will teach you all about it in freelancing part of this course when flow isn't something

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.120
that you just jumping and start using and start building websites.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.350
It's not as intuitive as something like maybe squarespace.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.010
It has a learning curve and the mainly it's because it is based on the regular code

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.650
structure that regular Web designer and developer would use.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.320
For example,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.250
you add HTML moments in wet floor and style them Using CSS class is just like what one

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.350
would do when actually,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.390
according the website,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.550
if you have some experience with HTML and CSS,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.490
definitely it will come in handy.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.160
But if you don't have any,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.210
don't wear about it.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.890
You don't need to have any prior experience.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.450
I will teach you everything as we go.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.290
During this course,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.680
you're gonna become a pro user A but faux ready to take on riel paid website projects right

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.230
after you're finished with the course where Flo is free until you need to publish the

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.190
website and then you pay for the hosting,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.870
which is about $15 per month.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.880
But hosting is something that every website owner has to pay,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.090
even if they're using free platform like WordPress.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.030
But you don't have to worry too much about this.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.160
It's not your expense.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.590
Clients pay for the hosting.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.490
In conclusion,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.570
wet flow has changed mine and so many other people's careers,

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.270
and it can do the same for you.
