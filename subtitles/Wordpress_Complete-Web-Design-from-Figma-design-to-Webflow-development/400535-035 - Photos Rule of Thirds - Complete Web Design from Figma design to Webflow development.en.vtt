00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
have you ever noticed how in movies actors are often positioned off center in the frame?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.060
After you learn these,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.160
you'll never be able to not to notice,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.090
and you will be obsessed about it Every time you watch a movie,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.020
movie makers and photographers use a technique called Rule of Thirds to add some visual

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.550
interest to the shot.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.390
It goes like this.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.220
If you divide a screen in three equal parts,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.280
both vertically and horizontally,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.430
the intersection of those lines will be the visual in most interesting spots to place your

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.050
subject.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.760
If the object is big,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.510
like Angelina Jolie here than you'd place her across that entire vertical line,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.970
and if it's an image off landscape like this,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.430
then you would position the horizon on one of the horizontal lines.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.380
Putting a subject in the debt center is something that is expected.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.510
It's symmetric has equal space around it.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.850
It's safe and comfortable.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.700
That's also what a non photographer would usually do or a non designer.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.300
You would grab a camera and point directly at the subject,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.640
and that's usually boring.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.890
But placing your subject off center creates tension.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.090
It's unexpected,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.460
yet looks intentional,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.450
like there is a specific hidden reason behind this,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.340
and we want to know what it is.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.360
A camera app on your phone probably has this option.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.640
I know.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.380
I found us.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.760
Turn it on and try it.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.900
Your photos will significantly improve by doing so,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.910
to demonstrate this point,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.630
let's take a look at this simple example.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.950
We have a box that is placed in the dead center off the canvas.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.920
The distance between the address of the cameras and the box are identical on all sides.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.530
The result is symmetrical stationery and box it at rest.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.400
It's not moving.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.410
If we move the box a little off center,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.010
it instantly adds tension.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.970
But this is not a good kind of tension,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.250
because it looks like the box is supposed to be in the center.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.140
But it's not.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.750
This looks like an ever that a designer Miskell ate or didn't notice.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.740
But if we move the box quite far off center than the result looks intentional,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.220
it doesn't look like it was meant to be in the center,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.530
but that it's deliberately out of parents.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.530
This creates a good kind of tension,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.200
giving as a visual interest.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.970
The rule of thirds is in a law,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.550
it's more of a soft guideline.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.350
You can sometimes go quite far from those intersection points.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.200
This rule comes super handy when you work with faces.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.740
Take a look at this example.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.100
The face off this model is in the center,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.930
off the frame,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.290
and this makes it appear like he's too low in the frame.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790
The empty space above his hand is sort of pressing him down.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.520
To fix this,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.650
we moved the model on one off the top intersection points use Always the eyes as your guide

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.010
ice are the focal point of any human face.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.650
That's where we always look at first.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.330
Now this is much better look,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.750
and the space above him is small enough,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.420
so it's not pressing down on him.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.610
And another great news.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.840
This works no matter the size off the face.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.480
The person can be far in the frame or in extreme close up.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.210
As long as we keep those eyes aligned with that intersection point,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.840
it will always look correct.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.550
Watch what happens when we zoom in.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.750
Still looking great.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.220
Let's zoom in more looking great.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.240
No doubt one last time still looks good.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.980
No matter how far resume in.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.510
This is the beauty of rule of thirds.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.960
It's a super simple guideline,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.450
yet can make photos look way better.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.360
Now.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.500
The rule of thirds is a soft guideline,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.770
and it has exceptions.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.200
There are a lot of cases when you will have better results.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.040
If you don't follow this rule on an image like this,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.780
the center is the best position,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.590
and you shouldn't use the rule of thirds.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.940
Why?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.720
Because the central point of view is the intention here.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.550
The photo is in the first person perspective.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.890
We are seeing the view from the guy's eyes and with his perspective.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.530
Obviously,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.900
the most natural placement is center because it wouldn't make sense for him to see things

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.750
sideways.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.840
There are more examples of central position being the correct choice.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.830
For instance,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.120
when the subject placement and other elements in the image actually create the visual

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.490
interest in the center,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.580
the road edges the yellow road marking in the middle that gap between the palm trees.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.850
All that is creating visual interest in the middle.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.780
Keeping this ruling mind helps you pick out good,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.350
better photos when you're searching for them on stock photography sides,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.850
for example,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.150
if you're looking for a photo for a split screen like in our exercise,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.950
then in those cases,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.160
a photo with the model that is in the center is a better choice because in cases of a split

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.480
screen,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.820
you get this narrow portrayed mode off the photo and in the narrow photos.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.950
It's not the best option to use the rule of thirds.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.900
But if you're looking for a background photo,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.250
especially one where you're going to place a content on,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.400
then off center alignment will be the best bet.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.600
So this way you will look through the photos and you'll find a while where there is enough

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.840
room for you to move a subject to wards one off the lines off the rule of thirds.
