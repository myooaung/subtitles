00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.380
Now for the testimonial section,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.815
let's actually copy the card from the wireframe and make edits on it.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.690
That should theoretically save us time.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.195
To change the styles you have to click on Link.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:37.270
So they're not linked to that wireframe kit styles.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.150
Hello.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.550
Let's find some testimonials.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.085
One thing you should never do is share designs for

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.810
your client that has repeated gummy photos like this.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.360
This doesn't look very nice and sort of ruined.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.230
Stay impact your design can make when sharing it with their client.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.445
Even with the news doesn't really take much time to come up with some random names,

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:36.680
but the visual flare is way more impressive.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.410
It looks real, real and can be appreciated better.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.090
There are some plugins that you could use for Figma that came create a dummy content.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.330
This one that I'm currently trying is called Content real.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.530
And it can actually do a pretty good job with creating dummy names.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.880
Inside the resources page,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.110
I have put the link where you can find all the available 50k Figma plugins.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.080
So you can go through that and find some different plugins that's

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.050
going to help us or a tough speed up your workflow.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.800
Similarly, what I like to do with dummy paragraphs is to use

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.865
different text instead of just having the same exact thing repeated.

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:37.970
He's seen the wireframes wouldn't bother about them because it's wireframes,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.610
they are supposed to look bland designs.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.650
We want things to look as real as possible.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.220
Alright, well,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.885
I'm gonna do the same thing with a further

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:05.450
copied from the wireframe and style it right there.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.765
As I mentioned before, I want to use this dark style footer.

00:07:22.765 --> 00:07:25.250
Let's try using our dark blue.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.125
Let's okay, but I'm going to desaturate it a little so it has less blue in it.

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.985
I'd like you to be a bit more subtle,

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:35.740
more towards black or gray.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.590
Luckily, we know how to fine tune colors, don't worry,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.490
you can refresh your memory by watching fine-tuning lesson in the color section.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.160
One more time, I've been teaching you a lot of concepts in this course,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.625
so it's natural for them to slip out of your mind.

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:49.520
Going back to those lessons when you need,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.770
it is a great way to solidify your knowledge.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.105
We can remove some of the blue from the color by decreasing the saturation.

00:07:56.105 --> 00:07:58.790
Change the drop-down to HSB,

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.400
which is saturation and brightness.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.250
That makes the second box to be saturation.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.910
And in the percentage value you just decrease it.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.020
It's still the same hue and this new color still fits well within our palette.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.755
Just playing around with colors and sizes here,

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.350
I like footer links to be faded and small.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.250
Hi,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.990
and that's it.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.090
Let's have a look at it in presentation mode.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.630
So our homepage is Don,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.680
you're looking pretty slick.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.300
We have two more pages, Laughter,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.625
the blog grade and the blog post page.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:58.560
And we'll get to that in the upcoming videos.
