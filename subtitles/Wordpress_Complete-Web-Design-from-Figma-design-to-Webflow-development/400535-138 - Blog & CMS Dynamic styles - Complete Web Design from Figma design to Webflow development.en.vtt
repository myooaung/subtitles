00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
So we left off here,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.870
where the Avatar isn't looking at its best.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.550
That's because we haven't styled the image in a way that it looks same.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.420
No matter what type of photo we upload right now,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.960
it changes the shape based on the image itself.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.270
The image that we had before from Fig MMA was already oval and right size.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.770
That's why no styling was required without proper styling.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.250
Then we would have to upload already cropped and oval images,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.550
and living that up to content creators and clients is a bad idea.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.880
First,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.760
it adds extra work.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.980
Second would have to teach them how to do an oval crop and just leaves a lot of room for

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.330
error.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.610
The Best Inc is to style our image placeholder in a way that it looks great no matter that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.150
image that inserted inside.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.110
First,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.140
let's make it over.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.750
We do this by rounding corners off the border.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.870
Then we needed to be the same width and height.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.450
We can either apply this value inside image settings or in the Styles panel.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.490
All right,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.390
the shape is good,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.340
but if you notice the image inside is stretched and it's the case for all the images that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.160
don't have equal dimensions,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.020
meaning if the width and height off the original image file is in the same size.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.550
So how do we fix this?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.970
Well,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.370
one way again needs to upload square images.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.050
But that,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.240
as I mentioned before,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.380
is a very good option.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.650
It's pushing work onto other people and opening room for mistakes.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.430
There is one place where we can have better control and images inside background styles.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.850
If this was a background image,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.660
then would have a much better control.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.540
The thing is,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.700
background image isn't really a content.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.180
It's a style control from the Styles panel.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.950
Now can we pull image from CMS and use it as a background image style?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.790
The answer is yes.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.050
Well,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.780
flow has an option for dynamic styles.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.150
It's in the settings panel,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.710
one of them says,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.080
Get background image from block posts.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.020
That means we can set background images dynamically.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.850
So here's what we're going to do well.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.750
Replace this image element with a regular did block,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.550
give it a same class name,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.400
set the width and height values,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.160
and then in the Settings panel,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.910
pull the background image from the CMS right now the images in position properly.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.270
It's even worse than before,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.310
not things visible.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.640
But that's not a problem.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.190
We can style this background image as usual,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.310
as we do with background styles.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.470
To be able to style this,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.350
we need to end a new background image from the Styles panel.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.140
Don't worry about the placeholder image here that's going to be ignored and be over

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.970
returned by the dynamic image.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.410
Now we can style this image the way we want,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.350
which is to position it as cover and center.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.360
Now we have the best solution,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.300
which is going toe work with all image forms and shapes.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.540
Content creators are free to applaud anything they wish,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.560
and that's all done with a header off our block post.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.770
Stick around for the rest.
