00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
and we're back in this video.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.370
We're going to adopt Hero section to the different devices.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.500
There isn't a lot that needs to be done,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.550
so it should be quick.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.270
Let's bring the height of the hero section on the tablet.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.430
It's too tall in this case,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.270
something like See if Sandra an 80 pixel should be good and we need to adjust the margin of

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.950
the contents or it's centered again.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:34.760
130 pixel looks good moving onto mobile landscape At first it looks like there's nothing

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.880
that needs fixing here,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.320
but we can't forget that we're not seeing the true mobile landscape here.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.340
This is to talk.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.740
To visualize this properly.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.170
The best is to check it on an actual mobile,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.830
but we can shrink the height off the browser to give us a rough idea off what we're working

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.140
with.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.060
This is something how it will look like nothing's visible here.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.340
Vertical spacing is crucial mobile landscape sewing to make our content snug and tighter.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.920
First,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.900
let's cut down on section patting and remove the fixed height off the hero section.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.010
We wanted to be automatic in this case,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.950
so to be only as tall as the content.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.900
Similarly,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.960
let's cut down on horizontal padding on smaller devices,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.390
spaces,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.010
scars,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.250
I'd say 30 pixel padding on the sides instead of 60.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.430
Next,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.010
we should shrink the phone size a little.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.300
Our default H one size is 55.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.770
That can be a little too big.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.570
Formal balls out.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.110
Go with 35 or 40.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.600
Remember that having style is coming from the H one.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.610
Tak Tau added.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.800
H one tack on all mobile landscape.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.360
First,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.610
remove whatever classes applied.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.210
And then from the drop down,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.950
select all H one headings.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.750
You should get that same landscape icon on the left.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.180
That's important this way.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.750
We know that we're affecting all H one for mobile landscape and down and not tablet or

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.350
desktop.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.870
Once down,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.850
we can put that white class back.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.470
One last thing for the landscape view.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.030
The content and background image are interacting now,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.860
much more in the ball versions.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.480
Content is on a blurry plain area,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.150
but here is covering the model's face.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.100
This makes tax difficult to rid.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.720
First,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.650
let's move that war to the next line,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.730
but that's not enough.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:52.750
So we're going to add a dark overlay on the background image 30% seems enough,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.420
and thats down for landscape.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.740
You so portrayed needs a couple more things.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.240
First,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.160
let's change the direction off the form to vertical so that field is on top of the button.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.220
This quite easy because we have set this form is a flex box.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460
So we need to do is just switch the direction.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.980
Make sure you're selecting the correct element.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.640
There is form and foreign block.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.180
We haven't touched the form block.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.050
It's unstylish.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.850
Second,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.450
we need to fix the hero background.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:43.110
This is where that custom positioning comes in handy because none of the preset alignment

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.850
work for us.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.950
I think 55% does a better job.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:04:00.160
Okay,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.630
let's check the fluidity groups.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.690
The filled isn't stretching all the way because it has a max with.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.460
So let's remove it in this case and set it to none that will make it as wide as the parent

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.460
.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.860
Keep in mind that any style changes that we make on this versions only affect downwards and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.350
not upwards in the hierarchy.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.310
So this field is only going to be reflected on the mobile portrait and not on landscape,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.450
tablet or desktop,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.080
all done for the hero section.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.610
Let's give it a going the previous boat,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.410
making sure everything is looking nice and working properly.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:42.120
Exxon will continue with following sections in the upcoming videos.
