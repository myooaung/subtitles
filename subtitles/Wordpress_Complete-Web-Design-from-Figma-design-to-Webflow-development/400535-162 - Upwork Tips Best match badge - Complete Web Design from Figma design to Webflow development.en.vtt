00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.150
every job posting can get a huge amount of proposals here that are 15.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.660
That's already a lot right,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.350
but it's actually on a smaller side.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.130
Clients can get more than that,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.830
usually 20 to 50 and sometimes even more than 50 proposals.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.090
Is the client going to go through each one?

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.860
Not really.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.950
They'll keep their eyes on the very top.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.780
What does that mean?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.450
You gotta find ways to end up on the top up work,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.610
puts past matches on the top and even adds thes shiny best match badge on their proposal

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.210
that puts those freelancers miles ahead over everyone below.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.090
As a freelancer,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.190
you don't see if you got this badge or not,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.600
but potential clients do,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.250
and you should always aim for it.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.910
So how do you get that batch?

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.890
No one really knows What's the algorithm behind this op?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.720
Work doesn't really share that information,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.790
But after analyzing proposals that I usually receive,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.150
I have nailed down several key ingredients.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.450
When you create your profile up,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.140
work will ask you to choose your experience level.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.150
The same question is asked to clients when they post the job.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.770
You can easily see that experience level that the client has chosen for the particular job

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.670
apply to matching experience level.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.930
This is probably the most important factor in determining this batch.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.360
The job that I had posted,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
I was asking for expert level,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.450
and most proposals were from intermediate and entry level for lessers.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.650
What are they thinking about?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.200
It's a waste of everybody's time.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.910
There are enough jobs in each level,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.500
so apply to matching ones.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.630
If you don't like jobs in your experience level,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.120
then change your level in the profile is that the second most important criteria seems to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.180
be the scales.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730
When clients post the job,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.780
they are asked to select specific skills they're looking for in a freelancer.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.810
They are given the same database of skills as you have used in your profile,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.450
and you can see this information on the job post,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.850
too,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.980
applied to jobs with matching skills.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.700
For example,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.240
I don't have any off the scale selected in my profile,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.820
so if I applied to this job,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.360
I wouldn't get a good match score.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.060
So always check the skills that decline has selected for the job and make sure that you

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.440
have those skills in your profile as well,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.550
and they match because that will definitely increase your chances of being the best match

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.090
now up work only allows you to select maximum of 10 scales,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.080
so there will be some related skills that you might have to leave out.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.230
But sometimes you'll see a job that uses exactly those skills that you had to live out.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.780
What you could do in this case is to remove some and add those missing skills from the job

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.050
and to create a match.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.080
This might be a little hacked that upward might be aware of,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.150
so the algorithm might ignore last minute profile changes,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.490
but it's still worth the try.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.750
At least decline will see that you have this gift they were looking for.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.790
When client is selecting the desired experience,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.650
level off a freelancer underneath each level,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.500
it shows approximate price range to be expected.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.050
You want to match your bid to the up work suggested range.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.830
If clients elected expert and was fined to pay more than $50 an hour up work isn't gonna

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.310
like it.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.250
If you bit 30 per hour,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.600
you're making both you and up work lose on higher revenue to find out what's the current

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.100
price range for your level.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.050
You can almost post a job back to get to the step,

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.510
and you'll see the most recent price ranges.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.120
Doesn't take anything to do this.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.110
You don't have to post the job in the end.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.810
It just one of the steps in the job posting wizard,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.650
and you can do this from time to time to have most recent values.
