00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
before I show you how to install a website and movie to your workflow account.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.050
Let me give you a tour of the website and show you what's what and show you.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.250
What's the design Thinking behind all that.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.230
Some of the content you'll see on a page is a placeholder tax like this headline.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.060
And in the next video,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.440
where I show you how to install,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.410
decide in your Weppler icon you're going to replace the generic generic content with your

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.290
personal info.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.960
The website is quite simple.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.150
The way put for your websites are supposed to be.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.750
We have only two pages at Home page and CMS pages for each project.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.830
The content off the website is in the first person narrative.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.640
This is sort off style that I love for portfolio websites.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.540
If I'm looking at someone's portfolio,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.560
I'm interested in the person behind it.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.750
So I want to see a friendly interaction so I can sense the personality of the person.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.910
I also want to see a clear information of what you do.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.190
What is your specialty of what is this website about clear direct language,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.650
you know?

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.710
Can I work with you?

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.380
Are you available for work.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.980
How can I work with you?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.640
What are the stabs and so on?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.960
Also very directional case off the portfolio.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.220
Some performer upsides have it on a separate page,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.580
and that's just too much for it.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.860
I have to find a lane.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.850
Click that language for the page to load again to finally see your work.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.550
So I like showing for for your pieces on the home page instantly after the hero section.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.780
No looking right in your face.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.570
How you display or print for your business is important to a lot of work for your sides

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.130
that I've seen.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.830
They have very confusing,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.330
creative but often confusing way of showcasing passport.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.830
Often they use just thumbnails.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.570
No titles,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.480
no description.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.750
You have to get to a conclusion on your own,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.710
not cool making me work here.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.250
As you can see,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.400
everything is super clear.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.450
We have a title.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.470
If we are not sure what this is,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.900
there is a smaller title saying Latest War.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.020
No way to get confused about that.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.660
A description of the project,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.660
which is super important because many designers don't do that on the homepage.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.470
Clients might not even visit the project page they'll want to get information right from

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.150
here,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.480
and it's important to tell them what sort of project this is.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.490
Did you design it?

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.040
Wasit.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.170
An individual work?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.050
Teamwork?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.490
What was your role?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.520
What's the website for?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.260
And so on?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.170
They want to know this essential information to understand.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.710
What the heck are they looking at?

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.010
I've added some tax as well to give us scannable information on type of projects like Wet

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.030
Floor Development Concept Project.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.440
Saying that it's a concept in a tag is a subtle way to be honest about the fact that it was

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.970
a concept project concept project means that it wasn't really paid project that you did for

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.340
some existing business or a product,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.410
but you did it either for practice or for this course or for some any other reason.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.600
You want to avoid awkward disappointment later,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.000
when your client asks you something about that chat app company you worked for and of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.290
course,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.950
pretty more cops off the project.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.740
How you show the screens of the project is important to very important note when creating

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.660
your accounts on freelancing platforms like up worker and freelancer,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.080
take down this portfolio pieces and generate something else.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.960
Why?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.590
Because the sites have review process for new freelancers.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.000
A lot of students are taking this course,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.820
and if you guys all apply with the same portfolio work,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.960
that's going to raise red flags when dealing with clients,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.860
that's not a problem.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.000
You can use that work,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.300
but for platforms application process,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.570
hide them temporarily once approved,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.350
then you should be safe to put it back up.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.710
What I do section is exactly what it says.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.890
Thesis a place to give a more detailed description off services you provide and pitch a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.530
little more.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.320
Here's a pro copyrighting tip.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.510
If you want to write persuasive copy,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.810
make it about them.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.950
Talk about how you're going to solve their problems and improve their lives,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.900
not how much you love Web design and the chicken case of DSR.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.850
Your passion.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.050
Lastly,

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.200
very obvious section.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.490
If they want to work with you,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.650
what's their next step?

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.350
Now let's check out the Project page.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.720
Project pages are quite straightforward.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.750
Some description of the project and a large screen shot.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.940
There are many different ways to demonstrate your portfolio work,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.820
but this is a style that I use on my own website and I like it the most.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.200
Some designers like to do a case study so they will have a large presentation off the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.290
project and quite a bit of explanation off the process.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.050
Goals challenges Basically a short story on how the project came to freshen.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.120
This is an excellent approach and shows all the work you have put in it and shows your

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.440
potential clients that behind the saints off your process the reason why I don't do this

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.910
case study is simple.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.480
It's a lot of work and amount of advantage.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.310
Isn't that big?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.840
Mainly because war target audiences as freelance Web designers,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.950
Our clients 90% of the time are non designer and entrepreneurs.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.580
A good for for your side with simple screenshots off your passport is enough information

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.050
for them.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.610
They're not going to dive deep inside the case study anyways.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.340
There will appreciate that it's there and they will think even more highly of you.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.720
But amount of work we have to put in to create the case study for each portfolio is too

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.250
much.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.990
Maybe in the beginning will have enough enthusiasm.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.980
But later we want,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.880
and we're just not going to keep our website updated because of that,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.800
and that's where we're going to screw ourselves over in the future because updating the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.810
perfect four year is going to be so much work that will just not do it.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.310
And we will end up with an old portfolio pieces and that's the worst outcome your designs

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.240
will improve and generally Web design Trans change so you're older designs will look dated

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.050
and not modern.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.900
But if it's very simple to update,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.010
you'll beam or encouraged to keep it fresh.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.980
So the project pray just needs a paragraph off a description and a screenshot,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.410
which you can export right from Sigma.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.010
And so is it the linking to the life upside is optional.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.920
It's very helpful for clients looking at the project.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.900
They can see the website in action and play with it and see all the work you've done,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.130
not just green shot but interactions and all that stuff.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.450
Although I have a rule on this Onley linked to live websites that you're proud off,

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.040
really,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.180
client websites are living organise,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.640
and when you're done with a project,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.400
that client might change things on the website.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.050
They might add new section and change things on their own,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.130
hire someone else for any new updates and so on.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.260
So at some point you're pressures.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.470
Designs might end up looking her and us,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.100
and you don't want to showcase a website that has been put your it over time.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.210
Even if you're the one doing butchering well,

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.660
that's it.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.360
Minimalistic,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.710
beautiful and strong personal website to demonstrate your work and show potential clients

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.260
or professionalism and Web design skills.
