00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
let's talk work and where to find it.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.010
There are many ways for a freelance Web designer to find work.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.130
The very first and obvious option,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.140
which is online platforms like freelancer dot com and obviously a pork dot com or locally

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.960
in the city where you live and networking with people in the industry.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.420
Or networking with the star tops.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.930
Going to the tech conferences,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.100
making friends with other successful Web designers who can send work towards your way.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Because what more often happens with the Web designers is that they get fully booked

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.380
because,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.740
you know,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370
one designer can only do one website at a time,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.610
right?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.530
You cannot do 10 20 websites simultaneously,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.710
so good designers very easily get book and what happens.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.270
And then they send work to their friends or some other people that they would recommend to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.460
their clients and so on.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.840
Also lengthen and regular job boards like a sip recruiter.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.560
There are more than enough ways to find work,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.340
and if you Google this,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.870
you'll find more and more options.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.230
The question is which one off this options is the perfect place for you to look,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.530
Bork thinks like your current scale your personality or experience where you live,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.650
the city that you live,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.280
all those things will determine which one off this options is going to be the perfect fit

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.800
for you.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.540
At this stage,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.090
I can tell you which one is going to work the best for you.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.870
No one can.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.330
But the best approach is to just pick one at a time and just go through the list.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.030
In this video,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.420
I'm going to talk about the online platforms and finding work on online platforms.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.950
I'll give you a general overreach off the biggest ones.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.020
There are many off this there is up work.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.900
There's fiver.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.160
There is freelancer dot com people per hour top tall and so on.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.100
The list is endless.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.440
And if you go go it you're gonna find more and more in every year.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.070
Obviously,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.560
more and more off this platforms will pull purpose.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.650
Competition changes as some of them fall out of there top plays and the other one will

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.410
replace them or new ones come up first up work.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.990
This is where I found my success.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.790
I found enough work on upward to BBC full time.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.970
Ah,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.690
work is huge.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.670
It's a public company,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.690
meaning it's trading on stock exchange.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.840
I think it's the first for Langston platform to go public.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.690
It was created out off the merger.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.720
Off balance and oh,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.700
desk jobs are plentiful here,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.820
which means competition is rampant.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.590
I have a dedicated video on up work and how to be successful on it,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.150
so we will cover it in detail that I'll teach you some strategies on how to be successful

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.620
in some common mistakes.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.220
To avoid another big plays for freelance jobs is freelancer dot com.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.790
I haven't working freelancer,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.470
but I have used it to hire freelancers.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.410
I have a feeling that ah,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.250
poor clients pay a bit more than freelancer clients,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.750
and that might be because of the way these two platforms target their clients.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.320
As you can see on the home page,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.280
they have this examples off mobile app,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.850
design and website design and their prices.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.320
Those are very low prices,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.650
so it seems like they want to excite clients how cheap they can get something which is bad

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.800
news for freelancers.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.070
But don't worry about this.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.090
As the saying goes,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.020
If you pay peanuts,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.840
you get monkeys.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.500
Soon enough,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.810
clients will learn this and they will intentionally choose higher prices because low price

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.800
will get them low.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.750
Quality result.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.800
This least gets updated constantly.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.050
It shows open jobs.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.220
These are jobs that you can still bid on.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.320
This is already pretty good,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.710
but you'll see that it's lower number than up work,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.980
which at this moment has more than 70,000 open jobs.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.360
To search for Web design jobs,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.780
you can search with keywords,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.350
which I think searches through the title and the description off the job.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.050
But a better way to search is to select the scale from the filters.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.610
That's much better off course.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.060
Not all of these is going to be a fit for you.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.010
These keywords and skills are all selected by clients.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.250
What they consider website design is not always going to be correct,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.250
so that's a short over real for Lancer.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.750
Then we have fiber,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.990
which is slightly different than the 1st 2 on up work and freelancer clients post jobs and

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.490
freelancers bid bottom fiber freelancers,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.350
post services and clients by them directly.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.410
For example,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.010
this brilliance Air here says he will design a responsive,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.800
wet floor website for $200 he offers three different packages basic,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.150
standard and premium.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.450
I quite like this service based approach on Fiverr.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.030
I've actually done my first freelancing on fibre.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.440
This was a while ago.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.040
I did resume designs for five bucks back then on Fiverr.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.790
That's the price.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.200
You could only charge five bucks and offer some upgrades.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.960
But as a base price for every service that was listed,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.380
there was five bucks.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.450
Hence the name fiver.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.280
They've changed their approach since then,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.880
and now you comprise your services.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.170
Whatever you want have often hard for lancer,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.830
some fiber to do quick and small jobs of translation and video editing and things like that

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.830
.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.800
As a client,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.410
it's great to just buy a service that is like a complete finished product,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.080
no negotiations and all that by send details great couple of days for results and done to

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.080
be successful in five,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.050
or you have to make money on volume.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.240
The whole thing is arranged for that.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.320
There aren't much meetings with clients or negotiations.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.460
You get the details,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.780
deliver a result down next job given set specific delivery dates,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.400
which you have to meet after you have all of the important assets from decline.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.900
So if I were to create a Web design service here.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.320
Here is probably what I would do personally outside,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.760
I will build a website for a specific type of business.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.550
For example,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.350
a website for freelancers,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.020
or put for your website or accountants,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.670
etcetera out create many such gigs.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.830
That's what it's called here.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.460
The gig.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.820
They're not create a couple of templates or just use templates from Weapons Marketplace.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.160
There are a lot of beautiful templates sold on Web flow,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.350
and there are even pretty great free templates.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.990
I would count the Template Coast in the total price,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.980
may be used free templates for basic pricing and then have paid templates under premium

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.490
pricing.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.280
And then,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.660
when people would buy my gig,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.260
I would have them choose which template they want.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.080
An offer,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.820
color type or other custom is ations based on their brand.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.640
This way,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.570
clients know up front what they're getting.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.970
No discussion on designs,

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.250
and I don't have to design and build an entire website from scratch.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.350
I'm grossly simplifying the process here.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.800
Of course,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.050
I could make an entire course just on this.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.410
Keep in mind that you would be creating a complete,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.240
ready made service for your clients.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.530
You'll need to put a lot of thought into it to create a really nice package and will take

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.910
some trial and error until you get it right.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.910
As a matter of fact,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.510
this is exactly what I was doing with resume designs.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.210
I was giving them about five resume templates to choose from.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.750
They would choose it than out,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.750
fill in their details and done.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.560
No one ever had any complaint about the design because they knew what they were getting up

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.950
front.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:37.840
People per hour is sort of mix between five or and up work clients confined freelancers

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.880
directly by searching for specific skills and then reviewing profiles of freelancers and

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.240
getting in touch directly.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.750
Also,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.750
they can post project just like a pork and freelancer and get proposals from freelancers

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.790
and just like five.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.430
Or you can post services here.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.120
They call it offers on Fiverr.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.940
It's called the Gig.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.560
I have used people per hour both as a freelancer and as a client.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.830
I did some resume designs here back in those days and have hired Web designers and Web

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.550
developers several times in here.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.900
Top tell is a freelancing side that has quite a different approach than others.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.750
This side is going to be a bit early for you in your career,

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.020
but I'm still going to throw in here so you know what's out there.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.640
Top Tall has a very rigorous selection process for freelancers.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.690
They do interviews,

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.550
challenges portfolio reviews before they accept you on the platform.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.480
They want a top talent in their hands.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.350
The name Top town,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.760
as they claim only 3% off applicants are selected.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.150
So consider top tell once you have excelled in your skills.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.440
This,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.820
of course,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.180
means that clients who look for freelancers on this side are looking for a premium service

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.180
,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.420
and they are not afraid to pay accordingly.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.200
So as you can see,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.600
even on online platforms,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.850
there are places to find high paid work.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.470
If you want more sides.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.770
Forbes has listed 79 sites to get freelance jobs.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.030
Go get your head spinning,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.360
linking the resources.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.320
Overall possibilities are endless online,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.130
but competition is fierce as well,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.480
because there are a lot of Web designers out there,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.410
its entire world competing for the services,

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.340
but don't get discouraged.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.200
In reality,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.750
Most off the Web designers and most of the talent.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.490
Daddy's applying for jobs that are on these platforms.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.850
They are terrible.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.520
They are not even mediocre there,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.760
below mediocre clients actually struggle,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.090
finding good talent as well.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.220
Often my clients,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.070
when they come to me and I'm busy and I'm no,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.150
maybe fully booked and I don't have any capacity to take new projects.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:27.760
They asked me,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.530
All came over then Do you know anybody else that you could recommend?

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:30.840
Because,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.030
you know,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:36.070
we went on this side and we couldn't find anybody because there's just so much competition

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:41.840
and there's just so much kind of noise going on out there that finding hara finding the

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.570
talent for them is a bit difficult.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.490
And the thing with this platform is that because anybody can join in,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.470
it's open to the world,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.800
and world is frickin big.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.650
You have so many people joining without even having any skill at all,

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.380
like people will claim that that Web designers and they will do anything even before they

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.740
took out what design course,

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.100
if you can imagine,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.440
like any kid or anybody comes here and they think you know what,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.290
I'm gonna make a lot of money online,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.130
and they started like,

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.340
Well,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.050
do Web design.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.000
I just installed a squarespace side for somebody,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.220
or I just learned how to install a WordPress theme.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.580
And now I'm a web designer,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.830
a web developer,

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.130
right?

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.480
And for someone like you has put so much work into it.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.460
And let's be honest,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.130
this course was quite huge.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.430
So if you put work and if you are working on it,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.020
if you are taking this seriously,

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.230
then you will be unstoppable.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:32.590
And if you provide good service and you deliver a good service and with the Polish and

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:38.570
process that you have already sat having a great great website showing portfolios in some

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.700
other tips and tricks that I'm gonna teach you later on in this part of the course you're

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.370
gonna be Miles A had off the competition who are just messing around.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.090
They're not knowing what they're doing in reality.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.110
And they're just random people around the world.
