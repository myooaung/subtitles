00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
This is a poster from BMW Spare Parts Advertisement campaign.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.360
It says B W am instead of BMW on the bottom,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.860
it says,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.390
use original parts.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.510
You get the joke crime.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.950
It's a very clever at,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.330
but that's not the reason I'm showing it to you.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.450
I want to demonstrate a huge design concept called White Space White Spaces,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.090
Empty space around elements in this case around there be Emma not be W am title Whitespace

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.730
draws attention to the object.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.600
It's not just easier to see the object,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.150
but it becomes much more interesting and important.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.650
That's Yahoo's homepage.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.110
There's not much white space here.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.710
It's hard to tell what's important on this page.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.310
This one,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.960
on the other hand,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.270
is a whole different story.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.260
The importance of white space isn't just in attention and simplicity.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.400
It's also your design achieving its primary goal.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.390
If your websites primary goal is for people to search,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.050
then you better make sure all attention is directed towards that.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.430
When we arrive on Google,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.180
we instantly know where to Clegg on where to direct our attention.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.660
It's much less demanding to search on Google than on Yahoo,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.830
and much more likely that relations are going Google than being distracted on Yahoo and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.470
forgetting what we came for in the first place.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.240
Why space doesn't have to be white.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.450
It can be any color.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.990
It's any unused space that is in between the elements.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.670
The worldwide is a left or from the era when graphic design used to take place on Lee in

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.730
print and on a white piece of paper.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.210
Let's have a look at this example say you are working on the taxi APP website.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.080
You could put a photo is a background,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.950
and there's nothing wrong with it at all.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.970
Or you can use white space to bring more attention to the message and the button.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.800
By the way,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.810
remember tinting with image overlays.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.720
Sometimes you don't have to make the photo black and white.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.460
You can keep the image colorful and still add color attained over it.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.440
Like in this case,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.810
You know,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.630
a long time ago,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.950
before I knew anything about a graphic design,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.820
I worked as a marketing manager and as a market here,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.010
you do need to create a lot off graphic materials design materials like flyers book.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.650
Last magazines were posters,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.780
advertisements on Facebook or Google Edwards or Facebook covers or whatnot.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.100
And I used to work with this Exxon graphic designer who later became became my design

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.480
mentor,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.050
basically,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.250
And when we would sit down and I would look at his design iterations,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.780
I always had this comment that I would look at his,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.920
uh,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.780
whatever composition were doing.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.220
Sometimes it would be like a booklet for our company,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.300
and I would say,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.540
Oh,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.720
you know,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.550
why don't you feel the space that is like too much,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.990
too much empty space?

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.180
And I always and I never liked the empty space when he was making the designs,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.090
and I would always push him to try to feel that empty space with something because I felt

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.780
it was empty.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.950
Oh,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.280
man,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.990
I had no idea back then.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.860
This is quite a common reaction with beginner designers or clients who don't have any

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.400
design training but are looking at the work from a kind of sort of wearing the designers

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.710
had,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.270
or from a designer's perspective,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.550
they have this insecurity about empty space,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.150
and they always try to fill it with something for them.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.950
It feels like if it's empty space and it's not designed enough,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.860
keep this in mind,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.750
no user will ever complain about too much empty space.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.590
However,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.150
they will be annoyed with too much clutter on the page.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.450
My personal portfolio side uses a lot of white space.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.150
I wanted to bring all the attention to me first,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.980
a person behind the work.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.160
So I removed all the distractions and pointed the entire focus towards May.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.400
EP always does this masterfully,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.630
using a lot of white spaces of very bulls,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.880
a design that Mac book looks super important and much more valuable when it's displayed.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.550
Like that,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.980
wide space improves almost everything,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.100
even on paragraphs.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.560
Remember what we learned about line spacing?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.100
Increasing line spacing is basically adding more white space between the lines.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.930
And guess what?

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.850
Designing with a lot of white space is actually easier than designing without it.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.900
Deter Rams Is this industrial designer best known for his work for Brown?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.250
He has coined these popular 10 person pose for a good design.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.850
The closing 10th principle is this.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.550
Good design is as a little design as possible,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.700
so don't be scared of white space and doing less.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.970
That's just good design.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.910
There is an exception with white space for items that are related and are part of the same

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.250
context should be closer to each other,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.160
putting white space between them.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.320
We'll disconnect them and will feel like separate unrelated objects,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.650
just like we learning the lesson about proximity.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.860
For example,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.380
the headline in the paragraph on this page white space will disconnect them from each other

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.380
.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.090
This does and more focus on the paragraph.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.950
But now it's an independent object,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.940
adding to the amount of elements the viewer has to process in.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.540
The original version that had line in the paragraph looks connected due to the proximity

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.610
and will be perceived as a single group,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.170
sort of like those links in the navigation bar.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.940
Because of their proximity and grouping,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.840
there will be identified as a single group.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.550
Instantly.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.630
They sort of grouping makes it easy for a viewer to process the elements on the page,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.270
and it's more organized and meaningful.
