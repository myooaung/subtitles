00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
So far,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.770
we've been building a static website as opposed to a dynamic website.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.740
This probably doesn't really tell you much.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.490
Let me explain.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.640
Let's say we have an article page for our block when we need a new block post.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.450
We can simply duplicate this page and change the content.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.150
No problem.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.580
Now what if at some point we decide that we want to make some layout changes to this

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.950
article page template?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.360
Well,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.940
no problem.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.840
We can copy those changes to the second article page,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.760
and when you have 100 article pages,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.790
then you're ready to give up your Web design career.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.770
These static content each page is independent from one another,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.560
and content off that block post exists on Lee on that particular page.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.250
Enter dynamic content.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.030
This time,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.860
content doesn't live inside each page.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350
They now live in the database,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.620
neatly organized,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.950
sort of like in a spread shit and then anywhere on the Web site.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.710
We can reference any off this database items and pull them to display on the page.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.840
These databases called CMS short for content management system.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.340
I know very sexy name with dynamic condom.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.750
We have only one article page template in master page.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.750
And within this master page we can reference those database items.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.360
And each time any article page loads wept,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.180
flow will pull appropriate content for each item.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.600
Now,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.960
if we make any changes to this master page,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.290
it will instantly reflect on every other page.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.780
Even if we have 5000 off those that's the power of weapon Oh,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.590
CMS and dynamic content.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.910
We're going to learn all about it in this section.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.830
How to create CMS items have to create master pages out of reference the CMS and so on a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.430
stick around.
