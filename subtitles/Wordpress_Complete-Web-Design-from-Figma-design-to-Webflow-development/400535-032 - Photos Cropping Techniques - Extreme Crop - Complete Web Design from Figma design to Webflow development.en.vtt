00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
I'm a big fan of movie poster design.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.540
Most of them have a great design work.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.510
It's intriguing,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.640
exciting and often mysterious.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.320
I haven't have this habit of staring at movie posters in the streets and then boring my

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.870
girlfriend with details on what sort off typography that were using.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.980
And what did they do with the photo and with sort of design trick they used on it.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.250
As you learn fundamentals of good design,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.710
you will never look at the movie posters the same way again.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.100
Here on these two posters,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.050
I want you to notice the similarity in how the photos are used.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.250
Do you notice how they're full hat is invisible and it zoomed ing very closely to their

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.980
face.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.820
This is called Extreme Crop.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.240
In this and following lesson,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.160
I'm going to teach you several ways how to crop an image.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.250
How cool was designed.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.560
There are even tricks on how to crop a photo.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.250
Let's start with extreme crop.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.550
Remember this example from the color lesson?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450
The original photo off the line is actually this,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.670
but this layout isn't as impressive as the previous one,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.100
despite the fact that we Seymour of the Lion compared to the full view.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.420
Her look now has become much more intense and a little unsettling.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.070
It adds more emotion and drama to the image.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.520
There are two things happening here.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.380
First,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.220
there is more focus on the most important part of any being their face and especially the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.750
eyes.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.300
This makes a shot more intimate.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.900
The eyes are sort of talking to us like they're trying to give us a message or demonstrate

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.080
some sort of emotion,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.930
makes us more curious and interested in the second hiding.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.950
Parts of the subject reads Mystery.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.380
The story that is on the poster now doesn't end on there.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.480
Just off the poster,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.180
it feels like there is much more to read,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.270
then what we see,

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.380
which means we want to find out.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.200
And we want to solve the puzzle off that mystery.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.430
This is how you make interesting design.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.720
Extreme cropping isn't just used on humans and animals.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.040
It can be used on objects.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.780
To this,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330
a great example of extreme cropping.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.000
I came across on some website cropping out parts of the bicycle makes the section more

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.700
interesting.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.730
The key to nailing extreme crop is to not go to fire and make the object unrecognizable.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.590
The audience has to understand what start.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.980
Check instantly without squinting or pausing even for a second,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.740
until the object remains obvious.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.960
Then you have a freedom to go Pretty extreme.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.660
For instance,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.310
say you are designing a website for a guitar store.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.850
Instead of using the full shape off the guitar,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.000
you can zoom in and crop to the head off the guitar.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.650
We can clearly see it's a guitar.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.470
Absolutely undeniable.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.360
But this is no more interesting this way.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.210
We're teasing an audience a little.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.100
We are dangling a little information in front of them,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.860
but none revealing the whole picture.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.650
We're making them finish the puzzle at your content.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.070
Simple of color from the guitar.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.960
Make the body text that big lighter so it doesn't compete with the headline and Bam!

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.360
You have an excellent section.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.140
It's interesting and intriguing.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.940
Remember the last thing about typography and how to match the personality and mood of the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.420
type Pace with the context.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.870
Take a look at the headline it says classical guitars without knowing anything about

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.400
guitars.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.640
The ward classical already dictates what choice we should make with a typography using a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.440
modern geometric tie face like Futura would be so out of place in here.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.920
But a script typeface like Apple Chancery,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.150
is a great match.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.700
Often you'll need to design for a very narrow spaces,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.500
for example,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.600
Ah,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.670
horizontal banner for newsletter sign ups in a narrow space like these,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.220
when we place an image that drama and power within the images decrease because how small it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.710
is disagreed image with a lot of emotion in it,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.590
But it's lost.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.120
There is a great solution to this.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.750
We can find a frame that tells the story.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.690
In this case,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.660
it's the faces and zoom into that frame of these frames still portrays the story of the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.300
image.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.350
The face of the kid is in focus,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.030
and the parts of the mother's face is enough to demonstrate the motion of the photo like

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.620
love and happy vibes at the content.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.650
And that's it.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.990
Now we get a more effective banner than Motion is still there,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.840
and we don't have to screen to understand what's going on in damage.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.170
This trick is quite handy for Blawg Hatters and article pages find a frame that tells the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.520
story on its own cropping to that and Now you have a very interesting hander for a blocked

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.950
page.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.950
One graphic design professor called this technique peeking through the blinds.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.740
Think of it not as a cropped photo,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.020
but more like the parts of the seeing that you see as you're looking at it through the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.470
blinds.
