00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
take a look at this hero section design.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.050
This design isn't bad at all,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.030
but there's one thing wrong with it.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.950
See if you can notice individual.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.480
Each element is variable design,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.360
but composition together look somewhat off before were to draw lines on the edges off each

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.950
element,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.200
you'll see that elements aren't really lined up.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.790
Fixing this is quite easy.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.550
We just lying.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.850
Things are as much as we can.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.710
A simple trick.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.960
Change the same design,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.430
looking from clumsy,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.080
toe,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.010
orderly and polished.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.190
Now,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.460
if I was to draw lines on the edges,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.490
you'd see a simplistic grade with two main vertical access.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.750
Why does aligning objects make a composition look better?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.340
It's exactly the same reason why this room looks better than this room.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.450
It's the order.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.690
We avoid chaos and seek order,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.460
and everything that is orderly,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.460
symmetric and organized will be perceived as more beautiful than anything that is chaotic

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.450
and disorderly.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.350
Some of the most important design rules are about layout.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.130
It's a question of where to put things,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.140
how to arrange them,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.730
what comes after what and upcoming lessons will be talking about all the design techniques

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.630
and rules related to lay out.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.880
This one is about alignment,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.920
probably one of the simplest,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.960
the most basic but one of the most powerful design rules out there.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.210
Just a simple alignment can make something look designed.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.520
On the other hand,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.050
misalignment will make it look sloppy and amateur work.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.300
How many Web developers who don't have a background in design will just drop elements of

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.480
the page randomly wherever they fit.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.490
This makes a page look messy and not attractive at all,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.120
but we take every chance to align objects with each other.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.230
Then we create something that looks s statically,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.550
more attractive.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.030
There are six ways you can align objects left alignment.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.460
That's the most natural way of the lining things.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.450
Because the way we reading Western languages from left to right,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.670
it feels the most natural to our eyes to start scanning for objects from top left corner.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850
Then you have the center alignment.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.150
This is frequently seen in weapons on last in print design.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.900
If you're designing for a rabbit,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.110
Hebrew and other right let languages than most natural alignment would be right alignment

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.370
notches for tax.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.210
But for other objects to and there are three similar ways toe the line objects on the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.550
horizontal axis.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.590
Top lineman center alignment again,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.450
but horizontal axes and the bottom alignment.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.210
Almost old design software will have alignment action buttons,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.920
and they will use this exact icons to represent ege feed my uses three cycles to,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.530
and I will show you where they are.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.480
In this example,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.150
you can see that with a line objects on their left edges.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.850
Alignment is the first staff for a good layer.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.990
When you start lining things up,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.920
you'll see that the layout starts to form some sort of a structure.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.580
This is called the Great.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.550
It's the way of organizing elements on the page to put them in a recognizable structure.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.210
But what design really likes the greed that is divided in equal sizes?

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.160
So if we were to draw eight equal with columns that are spaced out evenly and we took all

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.960
our objects and align them with this columns,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.450
then we would get a layout that feels so much more balance and designed.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.150
And the final step in this process is to reuse the same values as much as possible.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.410
The vertical gas between objects are all 30 pixels,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.940
but the horizontal gap is 60 pixels.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.130
The right move here would be to make that horizontal gap 30 as well.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.020
Now we have a truly balanced layout.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.950
Why stick greed so important?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.350
It gives the audience the sense of clarity.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.370
The agreements aren't actually drawn right,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.660
you know,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.510
they're implied.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.790
And there that and audience sort of feels it.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.550
And when Ah,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.040
something looks predictable and familiar and because of the repeating creed,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.280
the audience and the viewer will trust the website more,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.380
and they'll understand.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.150
And they know this is the website that it's not going to waste their time.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:24.030
The group rule is flexible on always design inside the great Sometimes sometimes I do.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.170
Sometimes I ignore eight.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.310
Sometimes I have agreed.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.800
And then,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.350
you know,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.390
I let things sometimes go out of the constraints on guy know many designers to exactly the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.840
same,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.240
which is,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.590
you know,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.950
they might not use it,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.030
greet completely or they might somehow have it.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.250
But,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.750
you know,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.670
using more in a flexible manner.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.560
But for you,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.370
in the beginning,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.630
I want you to use the greed because for the beginnings and when you're learning how to

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.420
design it just really amazing way how to kind of ingrained this great design habit inside

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.830
of you,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.820
and then later on you can and cannot go about it a bit more flexible way.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.920
We're going to do a practice exercise after this lesson,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.790
and I'm going to show you how to easily create agreed Inside Sigma and how Teoh design

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.650
within the grid.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.950
Most of the design rules that we're going to be speaking in this course can be broken,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.170
although if we're breaking a design rule,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.390
we have to do with an intention,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.980
because if we're not doing it with an attention in which we are not really thinking about,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.210
it,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.980
probably were being sloppy.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.650
One very common design Lee out to use in Web design is a center lee out,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.750
which doesn't really fall under a proper grid.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.450
Let's take a look at this example.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.930
There's no prominent grid on this section that artists free flowing,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.890
and the elements in the middle aren't creating any sort of grid.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.870
However,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.350
it still looks good and doesn't look sloppy at all because at least there is an alignment.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.170
You can break greed,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.450
but it can really break in alignment.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.920
We can feel the imaginary vertical line thesis elements are aligned with imprint design,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.450
the rarely use center alignment.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.450
However,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.430
unlike print,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.610
the website can be viewed on hundreds of different screen sizes anywhere from a tiny

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.610
smartphone toe.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.090
A large TV screen.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.000
Because of these are upsides have become responsive.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.850
The content can shrink or expand,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.600
depending on the screen is being viewed on imprint.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.870
The designer would mold the elements to his absolute.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.650
Were Whatever is printed wasn't going to change shape or size.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.440
So you know he would achieve an optimal result.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.570
This is why you see crazy layout in magazines,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.450
but not in Web.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.080
So that's alignment and greed in theory.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.750
Up next,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.690
we're going to practice alignment in Great so you can make it as part of your design

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.330
process.
