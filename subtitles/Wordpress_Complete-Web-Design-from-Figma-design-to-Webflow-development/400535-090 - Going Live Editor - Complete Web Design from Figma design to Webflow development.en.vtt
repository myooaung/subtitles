00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
have I ever mentioned how amazing?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:01.740
Well,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.010
fluids this is how amazing it ISS.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.300
Besides the designer,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.510
it has another view called the Editor,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.450
which you can access from here.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.370
Editor is a place for clients and collaborators.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.660
Toe added the content off the website,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.560
and they can do this right on the life site,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.660
literally on the life site.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.810
No ugly content management and text editors.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.650
You can just click on the content and start editing.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.750
This is so incredibly useful for clients that I can't even put in Mauritz.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.580
Your clients aren't usually tax savvy,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.640
and last thing they want to do is figure out how content management systems work and the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.830
last thing you want is your client emailing your every time they need some sort of small

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.290
change in the headline to remove a coma or Adam Ward to it.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.090
The sort of requests will creep up on you after you have finalized and shipped your project

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.690
to clients.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.920
Well,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.080
if you're getting paid hourly,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.720
that's fine.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.850
But if you're getting paid per project,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.950
then you're working for free.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.740
We cannot change any styles or layout from the editor that's inside the designer here.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.600
It's just content be tax images or links.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
You can change an images by clicking on it and uploading a different one.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:20.740
You can also change a lynx destination,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.350
your l or the text.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:34.250
The changes won't be reflected on the life site until you click the publish button.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.130
After that,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.160
all the changes will go live instantly,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.310
and it's that simple.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.620
And obviously these changes will be reflected in the designer,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:56.050
to which we can switch to from here in case we want to restrict access to some parts of the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.320
content from the editor.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.310
Inside the designer,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.950
we can go to the elements setting panel and uncheck collaborators can edit this element.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.530
And now the headline won't be at the table.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.450
Insight editor.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.750
Inside the project settings,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.670
we can add extra collaborators.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.050
This is independent from the main account,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.250
and it's going to give access to the content management off the side.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.780
This gives access to the editor to form submissions page settings,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.420
creating new CMS I temps like block posts and so on.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.280
So that's that it are quite simple,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.260
yet powerful.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.160
There's nothing that we actually need to do about it.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540
I just wanted to show you around because I don't usually work with an editor as because I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.750
worked through the designer.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.670
But this is usually something that you sort of teach your clients and tell them.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.980
OK,

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.170
so this is the option.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.580
And this is how you do.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.800
This is how you I did the pages and so on.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.050
What floor actually has tutorials on the editor?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.860
So sometimes you can just send that video tutorial like that.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.010
Or you can record your own video tutorial.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.680
Not to you.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.500
And that concludes the third and big part of this course,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.610
which was about wet floor and development.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.330
The next spot,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.750
we're going to do a full clan project,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.480
stick around.
