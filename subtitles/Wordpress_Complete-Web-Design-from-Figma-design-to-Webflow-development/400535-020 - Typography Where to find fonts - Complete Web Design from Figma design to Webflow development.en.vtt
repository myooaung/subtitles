00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
finding bones online is quite simple,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.000
and you probably have might have some experience already with downloading and looking for a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.860
simple until online.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.430
There are many different paid and free options,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.350
so let's go over some of deceptions.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.330
Sites like deformed dot com have a big selection of free funds.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.690
The problem with free phones is that they can be designed by amateur designers who created

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.050
them for fun or to king some font design experience.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
You could end up with anything from a deadly space falling Teoh something like a kid

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.690
different.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
Avoid this sort of free phones until you gain good experience in typography,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.590
and even then,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.930
it's just best to keep away and stay away from this sort of free funds because often they

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.020
are overused,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.650
which means there is a lot of different designs or websites that help.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.880
They have been using them,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.480
and they have been using Tham wrongly,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.350
and it's just has a really bad reputation.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.310
Paid phones obviously,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.250
are more superior.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.080
Option one benefit off a premium bond is that it can give your project more unique.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.920
Failed because they're not is popular and they're not as overused with individual paid

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.590
phones you pay for each style,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.880
usually around 22 50 bucks.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590
So if you want an entire family with all the weights,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.070
then it can get costly.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.490
Also,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.090
you have to buy a license for each project separately.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.010
So best approach with individual paid funds would be to buy one or two styles for our

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.920
headline texts and is the main body text that where you need a lot of different ways,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.890
like bowls and extra bulls and all that stuff.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.540
Then you can use things,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.850
places like Google phones and some other options that I won't mention.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.480
There's a cheaper way to get hands on a lot of premium phones,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.220
and that's by using subscription based sides,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.250
the most popular being adobe phones.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.270
The old name is typed kit.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.850
Adobe phones is included in their Creative Cloud subscription.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.330
They saw subscriptions toe for the Shop illustrator and other adobe software,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.150
So if you're subscribed to that,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.480
you get more than 7000 adobe phones with it.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.000
The cheapest plan is about $10 a month of things,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.250
so it's a pretty good deal.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.780
Personally,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.860
My favorite places.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.660
Google phones.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.520
It's free.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.970
No licensing warriors there well designed,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.450
its curated by Google,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.110
and both fig,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.520
MMA and,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.680
well,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.350
flow already come with it.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.400
So that just saves me from so much installation and,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.860
uh,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.990
all that headache.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.850
My advice for you in the beginning is to stick with Google phones or adobe phones.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.290
Two together provide more than enough phone steady will need for any project.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.450
One important note about phones generally is that phones are actually regular computer

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.880
files,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.020
so that means they can be copied and reduce re distributed countless times.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.200
So if you have a file for this particular phone,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.460
that doesn't mean you can actually use it to use the phone for a website on your project.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.640
You either you need to have a license that you paid for or the phone itself has to come

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.950
with a free commercial free for commercial use license.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.560
Here's a cool browser extension that I frequently used.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.370
It's called Fun Phase Ninja,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.450
and it lets you see the front that any website is using.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm a type gig.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.660
I love the look often attractive typeface.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.910
So when I see a website that uses a beautiful fonts and typography,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.930
I want to know what it is and saving as an inspiration for my future projects,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.030
which basically means so I can steal it and then use it on my projects.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.370
Later,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.600
link in the resources installed this extension and start noticing different phones on

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.550
websites that you visit.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.070
Getting curious is a designer's best teacher.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.760
Noticing designs around your and examining them closely will teach you a lot and will

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.790
actually improve your design skills.
