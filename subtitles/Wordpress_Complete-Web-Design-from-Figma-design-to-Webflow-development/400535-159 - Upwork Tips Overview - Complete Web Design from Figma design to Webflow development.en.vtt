00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
over the years of working on up work as a freelancer and hiring other freelancers.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.700
I have accumulated some interesting tips and tricks that I used for myself to be successful

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.250
in up work.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.850
And I want to share this tips with you so you don't have to waste years so few no trial and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.340
error and trying to find out how to make things work on up work.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.540
So I've put all these tapes in different videos and sort of compile them in different

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.050
themes.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.430
But before we get to those tapes,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.350
let me give you a quick tour off up work.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490
This is how upward works.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.170
I climbed post a job that they want to get done,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.770
like a website design and build for a startup.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.600
They give details,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.470
sometimes up,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.380
redefined budget and sometimes without a defined budget as an hourly rate.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.680
The freelancers speed on the job,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.050
sending proposals with prices,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.730
inclined,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.170
response to proposals and starts a conversation with freelancers that they like.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.350
Often they might do interviews over the call.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.900
Finally,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.850
they make their choice and award the job to one person.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.260
The contract and building is old,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.670
managed through the platform.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.340
If you're working on an hourly rate,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.230
then you are going to track time through their application.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.070
Old time is automatically log and find is automatically built for it,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.870
and declines payment method is automatically charged.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.700
This is great because you don't have to worry about billing,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.640
money transfers and all that up work is free to use,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.050
but it takes commissions from what you make.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.450
They have different commission rates based on certain brackets.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.180
This is the current commission structure,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.080
but it might change any time on the 1st $500 that you build a specific client.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.720
They will take 20% after that,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.580
10% until 10-K and then 5% 20% sounds big,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.540
but that just on the 1st $500 that you build to the client,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.200
for example,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.090
let's say you build a client total of $5000.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.550
The time frame doesn't matter.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.800
Up work will keep 20% of the 1st $500.10 percent off the remaining $4500 so the total of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.280
$550 in commissions that's 11% off the total amount.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.980
This bracket dating is pretty good for Web designers because our projects go well over 500

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.660
mark and often client relationships are very long term.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.040
I don't think I've ever had.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.850
At one time project on up work.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.010
All the jobs turned into long term work relationships for those freelancers who do smaller

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.270
one time jobs for many clients,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.020
maybe like logo designers,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.490
then the system sucks because they end up paying 20% on most of the money they make.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.680
What designers haven't better.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.450
In this case,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.470
searching for jobs is pretty straightforward.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.980
You can search jobs by keyword skills or some other filters.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.260
Searching correctly is going to be important to find the right jobs.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.700
Keywords for you are going to be website design,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.610
Web design,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.490
wept flow lending page,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.200
webpage,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.250
Responsive website and so on.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.630
Don't forget landing pages.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.700
Those are in high demand,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.890
and they are simpler than websites in terms of design and development.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.890
Landing pages are all the same webpages we've been doing so far.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.050
It just a single page and studied off an entire website.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.170
Keywords aren't the only way to search.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.450
Often they're not the best way because it returns everything that mentions your keyboard

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.750
and you were in the job posting skill search can be a bit more targeted in such cases.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.850
You can do that from Advent Search,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.940
select a scale from the drop down in search.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.650
But once Guillot a time otherwise he's going to look for jobs that match all the skills

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.550
that you have selected.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.880
These are skills that client selected when they were creating the jobs,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.450
so it can be a bit more precise than just keywords in the description.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.180
This is how the usual job posting looks like this one is an hourly rate project that shows

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.050
right here.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.510
Job descriptions on up work are most of the time,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.170
quite bad.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.680
Often not a lot of detailed information is provided about the project.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.640
Employers could use some training on how to post proper job descriptions to attract the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.400
right crowd.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.610
To apply for the job,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.150
you have to submit a proposal.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.160
This is how proposal submission form looks like you select your rates that you propose for

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.750
this job.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.050
The billing type is set by the client itself,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.450
so if it's hourly billing,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.060
then you can only propose hourly rates for flat freights.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.480
Then you have to only propose flat rate cover letter is the message that you write to the

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.050
client.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.560
This is where you try to make that pitch and convince them to hire you.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.680
Basically the rest,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.950
like your portfolio reviews and all that they can check directly on your profile.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.850
I haven't experienced or posting job ads on up work,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.980
and that gave me an advantage that other freelancers didn't have.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.500
I knew something they didn't.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.640
And so you will.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.390
This is what a client say's after they post a job,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.640
at least of proposals from freelancers.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.750
This is most important page where the decision making by the client happens.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.460
This is where they filter out frill interest that they don't want to work with and choose

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.550
the ones they do.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.140
I have several great tapes on how to be successful in this page and stand out from the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.560
crowd,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.360
but later on that the client can see your proposed rate here,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.550
in this case hourly.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.000
Since that's what I said as the project building,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.720
they can see your lifetime earnings on up work,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.660
your job title,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.330
some badges,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:16.240
which will discuss in more detail and a few lines from the cover letter when plan clicks on

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.500
one off days they get to a proposal view,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.480
which is basically the same as the Freelancers profile,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.790
plus the cover letter.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.310
Now all other details off your profile and the cover letter will matter.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.110
Client can check reviews and ratings from the past.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.510
Job How much you made on those jobs.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.100
It can see your portfolio.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.550
These are screenshots you can upload under your foot for your section.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.550
They can see your scales.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.230
Give this guilt genuine and focus on your domain.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.200
Don't put things like Microsoft Ward.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.390
It doesn't make you look like a batter Web designer,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.450
and they can see your employment history outside of up work if you add any.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.400
If you do have employment history,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.200
it's a good idea to add them here.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.020
Prior experience counts two,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.320
and it can help build your credibility.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.560
Although whatever you put it has to look at your summer job at KFC isn't going to add

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.020
anything.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.240
And that's it.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.540
That's general overview.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.240
Off up work
