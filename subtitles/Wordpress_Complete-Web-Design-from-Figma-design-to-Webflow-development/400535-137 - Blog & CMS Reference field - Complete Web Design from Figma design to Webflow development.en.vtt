00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
as we previously discussed.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.120
Author elements right now are static.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.830
Same author,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.130
image and name for every single block post.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.850
Even if there were like 5000 block posts,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.310
we need to change authors into dynamic content.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.450
That way we will have multiple authors and choose one for each block post.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.280
There are two ways we can turn authoring two dynamic content want is to add an avatar and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.970
author name as filled store,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.850
existing block,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.150
post collection something like this.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.710
Then each time we create a new block post,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.900
we would have an ability to upload author,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.340
image,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.050
name or any other author related info.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.300
Then we would bind those fields on our page and done.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.250
But this means for New Block Post.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.310
We will have to enter author information,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.380
upload an image,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.490
put their name if you want thereby or other information than all that,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.930
too,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.830
and repeat the same process for the next post,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.650
even if the author is the same.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.460
Luckily,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.510
there is another option.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.170
We can create a separate collection for authors just like we did with the Block post.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.230
We can create a CMS database for authors where we would save all the authors with their

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.990
profile photos name.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.500
Spy owes contacting for any other information,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.350
and then we can pull all that information from the database into our block posts.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.420
All right,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.990
so let's create a new collection for the authors.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.120
Click here to create a new collection.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.190
Wet Floor actually has a template for authors as well,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.310
but we're not going to use the template this time,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.240
and we will add fields from scratch so you can better understand how this works.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.200
So for starters,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000
we need the name.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.210
Anything works here.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.050
This is internal,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.850
although it will automatically pre feel that you're all with the same name.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.170
But we can change this,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.410
your rallies public,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.590
and it does matter what we put there.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.670
I like using a singular form for the girl because then it would go something like author

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.370
Slash John Smith.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.950
And that sort of makes more sense than authors in Plural.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.250
As for the fields,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.820
what do we need?

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.450
Obviously,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.190
the name which is already there.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.900
Then we have an avatar or,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.630
in other words,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.060
profile photo and also in the bottom off our bloke post.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.800
The author segment also has some little biography.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.360
Let's add this fields when we had new field.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.050
We have to choose what type of field it iss the field and information and will be affected

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.750
by this.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.710
In this case,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.860
we're going to create a filled for the Avatar.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.780
So obviously,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.180
that's going to be an image type we can make this filled required.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.330
So at any time we're adding a new author,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.150
we make sure that there is always a profile.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.060
Photo uploaded.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.020
Next author.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.990
Bio Pretty straightforward again.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.850
The plane tax.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.460
We have an option for single or multiple line field.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.970
You can see how they feel changes in the preview mode with multiple line,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.340
and this depends on the company.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.310
But we could put maximum character count for the bio.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.600
It is a good idea this way.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.950
We're not gonna have an author with a biography that is two pages long and another one that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.820
is one sentence and create collection.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.420
That's it.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.320
If we need to add it or add more fields to this collection.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.840
No problem.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.170
We can always do that later.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.720
Finally,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.950
let's have weap low Add some dummy items to this collection.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.650
It might need a little of refresh,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:27.900
sometimes to show up all right,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.300
our collection is ready.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.250
Let's connect it to our elements on our page.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.130
Except we can do that right now.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.110
There is no option for Avatar and author name.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.750
Why?

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.990
Because he said completely independent collection.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.040
That has nothing to do with Block posts yet.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.870
So we need to create some sort of link between these two collections,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.070
and that happens through reference fields it just another type of a field inside the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.770
collection.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.450
Let's go back to the Block Post collection,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.690
Click the setting icon,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.180
and we're going to add a new field and choose a reference type.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.940
Now what this type of element does is that we can pull information from a different

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.550
database in our case,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.380
the author collection.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.040
So let's put it author,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.050
name and from a drop down,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.790
select an appropriate collection,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.500
which is authors make it required and say and save the collection to.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.500
Now let's go into that one off the block posts and you'll see that we have a new field,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.620
which is an author dropped down,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.580
and this drop down is looking into the database off authors and pulling information from

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.150
that database so we don't need to upload author information Every time we create a new

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.970
block post,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.450
let's go through all the block posts and peak and author for each one.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:04.970
Now,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.990
when we go back to our master page for the Block post,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.850
we will have more options in the binding settings.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.960
There's a whole new section with fields from the author collection.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.370
Again,

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.310
these fields are shown on Lee for compatible elements lavatories in here.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.220
But Avatar is definitely available for the image element.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.020
Select author Name here,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.750
An avatar for the image.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:39.900
Now,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.830
as we switched between different block post,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.640
the authors update accordingly.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.210
There's one issue with the Avatar,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.590
though,

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.770
but we're going to take care of that in the next video.
