00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.285
Now one last page our blog needs is this block homepage.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:08.145
That greed that we have designed.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:13.740
Blog homepage is going to be a combination of static page with dynamic content.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.300
Unlike the blog post page,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.995
which is fully dynamic page,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:22.620
what we are going to do is create a regular static page and then insert CMS items inside.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.940
So to get started,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.125
create a new page.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.400
We will name it block.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.290
And make sure the URL slug is blocked.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.190
Starting with Navbar.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.375
That's exact the same as the one on our blog post page so we can copy that one.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.560
But instead of copying,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.495
it's better to create a symbol out of it.

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:51.710
Remember the symbols. Right-click on the nav bar and select Create symbol,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.180
name it now bar.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.510
And we get, Now we can track that symbol right on our blog page.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.580
Next we need the usual section and container.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.670
We have a little issue with

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.195
an outburst background color here because we needed to be gray.

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:34.295
We could drag it inside a section,

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.325
but then we would need to change paddings and all that stuff.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:40.580
We could create a MBA class and give it a gale gray background.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.610
But that means we'll need to unlink it from the symbol,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.810
which is not a problem,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.015
but it's nice for it to be linked to the symbol.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:50.120
The best option is to wrap the navbar inside

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.180
another d-block and give that the block a background color.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.965
All of these options are appropriate and valid.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:22.190
But this one was the best because I didn't have to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.640
alter any of the default elements or the symbols.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.920
Now let's add a headline and subhead.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.030
Pretty straightforward.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.730
And nothing is to be tricked in this case.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.765
Now for the fun part,

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:53.030
first we are going to design a static car.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.520
Then we will figure it out how to turn it into

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.430
a dynamic item that pause content from CMS.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.700
Let's add a new d-block and give it a class of blog grid.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.275
That's where we will keep all the blog cards with a top margin of 60 pixels.

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:20.070
Next, we need a new d-block named block card.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.410
Let's make this white background

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.430
give the rounded corners and some width.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.230
For now, let's give discard a fixed width.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.540
We're not going to use a fixed width in the end

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.720
because we are going to arrange this in a three column layout.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.415
But for now let's do it so we can't see properly what we are designing.

00:03:55.415 --> 00:03:58.010
It disappears when we give it a width, it's empty.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.270
That's why noise.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.920
Next we need a thumbnail.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.965
Your first thought might be to add an image, but think again,

00:04:03.965 --> 00:04:05.390
if we add an image element,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.315
then the shape of the image will be controlled by the image itself.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:12.680
We won't be able to cover a certain part and have the image crop inside as necessary.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.650
We've already dealt with this obstacle in previous cases.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.075
Just like the last time,

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:21.090
the answer is to use a regular diblock with a background image.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.550
This needs a hide. The exact hide from their designs will do.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.685
No need to replace the placeholder image.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:51.000
We will see live images once we connect this to the CMS,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.525
there's just one thing that block card has rounded corners,

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.145
but this thumbnail doesn't.

00:04:58.145 --> 00:05:01.505
It's going outside of the corners with its pointy edges.

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:03.395
This happens because by default,

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:06.260
overflow is visible on any deal block.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.485
But if we change the overflow to hidden on the block card,

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:12.995
then that will clip anything that's going outside the boundaries,

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:15.665
hence rounding the corners on the thumbnail.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:21.390
And there we go. Next we need content which we're going to wrap in a diblock.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.840
Give it a padding of 20 pixels.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.290
Its founder having an paragraph for the heading,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.120
we can create one of them.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.505
Tags may be h, h2 or h3.

00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:09.575
Remember how to style having tax,

00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:11.465
change the tag from the settings,

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:13.640
then go to the selector and on the bottom of the

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.860
drop-down you'll get an ability to select

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:25.100
that particular tag and apply all that according styles from the designs,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.740
22 pixels and semi ball and then so on.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.480
And one last thing, remove top margin from it.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.690
Now for the author and date blog,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.490
we'll need a new block for this.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.830
We already have exactly the same block on the post page.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.335
So I'm going to try to reuse the same class here.

00:07:30.335 --> 00:07:31.685
It will need tweaking though,

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:34.680
like check the classes that we have used there.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.290
If we apply this classes,

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.715
we should get the same results.

00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:45.230
Copying would be an easier option,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.110
but it doesn't work with dynamic items since they are linked.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.870
Now let's tweak the style by using common classes.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.820
Avatars 30 pixel in size instead of

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:17.900
4012

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.500
pixels

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.000
has different spacing on the side.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.080
So let's adjust that.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.420
And finally, the top margin.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.845
One thing I would like to add to this card is a hover effect.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:16.550
One thing we can do is we can add a background shadow on it on the hover.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.379
That'll be nice interaction.

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:21.140
We already know how to create the shadow right on the cards.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.955
We've done it on the testimonial cards.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.950
And we can do exactly the same here,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.590
and we can just reuse the same values for the shadow.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.560
And let's add a transition effect so it's not that abrupt and jerky.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.510
There is one more hover effect we can add.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.240
We can make the car move a little. This way.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.125
The shadow will create an effect of card being lifted in the air.

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:32.835
Very simple to do in the hover state and the Transform effect.

00:11:32.835 --> 00:11:36.695
And on the vertical axis move about two pixels.

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:39.275
We need negative two pixels to lift it up.

00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:41.315
Positive values will move it down.

00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:45.755
We don't have to add the transition effect because we have added one for all properties.

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:48.635
So that's taken care of the transition for the move as well.

00:11:48.635 --> 00:11:51.110
That's why I like using all properties transition

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.975
instead of individual one for each attribute.

00:11:53.975 --> 00:11:55.400
Excellent, the car is ready,

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.625
but we're not going to connect it to the CMS just yet.

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.620
We'll do that in the next video.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.930
Right now let's just finish up the page.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.295
We need to add the footer,

00:12:04.295 --> 00:12:09.030
which is easy since we just need to drag a footer symbol on the page.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.385
Now let's link to this blog page.

00:12:22.385 --> 00:12:27.360
So people can access this blog page through the navbar or through the footer.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:39.980
And then select the link and go to settings panel connected to the blog page,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.990
which now shows up in the drop-down.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.380
And same thing in the footer.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.130
And let's not forget the homepage now bar because

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.860
the navigation bar there isn't connected to assemble.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.230
And that's all now the blog page can be accessed from anywhere on the side.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.190
Right up next we'll connect the green to the CMS, stick around.
