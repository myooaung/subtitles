00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430
interactions toe isn't the only way to create interactions on a page.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.920
For example,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.590
a button changing the background color and the mouse hover is an interaction to when doing

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.450
something simple like that we don't need to use interactions to at all.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.050
This can be done from the stylist panel because CSS alone can handle such things.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.100
Anything that we can change in the Harbor state off,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.450
the element is going to become Harvard interaction.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.740
This can be background color,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.740
size position,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.120
shadows and what not transitioning from one state to another is that mentioned before one

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.260
of the interactions were going to build is the arrow animation.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.320
So I want this error to move a little towards the right.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.840
When we move the mouse over this link,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.880
we can move elements from the style spaniel,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.350
and I'm gonna show you how to do that.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.370
You don't have to follow along with this because you'll see that we're going to hit a wall

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.200
with this option.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.870
But I still want to show this option so you can understand when it's best to use house and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.370
we needs best to use interactions.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.330
Toe Stylus panel has a proper tickle,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.330
transforms under effects section underneath.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.560
We have several options.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.950
Move,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.450
scale,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.200
rotate and skew the older What they say We're going to Onley.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.320
Touch them over this time,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.550
as we don't need the rest.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.720
Move will move an element on X,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.500
Y or Z.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.960
Access X and Y are horizontal and vertical access,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.270
but Z excesses.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.820
To be honest,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.760
I really don't know how to explain the access.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.900
I don't think I've ever had a need for it.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.920
It's basically for moving an object in a three D space.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.770
So if accent wise with and hide,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.950
then see should be something like death.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.710
Most of the time will be using X and y anyways,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.530
as you can see it,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.010
simply moving object horizontally or vertically from its original position.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.060
It's sort of what we've already done with the relative and absolute objects.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.650
So what I had in mind with this arrow is to move it horizontally for about eight pixels.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.440
But moving on a regular state isn't going to work because it will appear like this

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.160
permanently.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.830
We need to move it on a hover,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.020
which is quite simple.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.050
We do exact the same on the hover state,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.680
but leave the regular state untouched and there we have a little interaction.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.780
The transition from one state to another is very jerky right now.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.900
To make it smooth like a real animation,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.620
we need to add something in the transitions property.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.110
So here is why we can't use this basic hover interaction.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.460
Because,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.120
however interactions from the Styles panel on Lee and he made the object itself,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.980
in our case,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.550
the arrow.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.820
But if we move mouse over the tax,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.780
nothing happens.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.150
Hover state effects on Lee the target element and nothing else.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.010
But in our case,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.040
we want the arrow to move when mouse moves over the entire link block.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.110
This is where interactions tool comes in.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.320
Hover states is just a CSS property,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.070
But the interaction to adds a little bit of job script to the mix,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.660
which gives us an incredible amount of control.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.950
So that's what we're going to do in the next video
