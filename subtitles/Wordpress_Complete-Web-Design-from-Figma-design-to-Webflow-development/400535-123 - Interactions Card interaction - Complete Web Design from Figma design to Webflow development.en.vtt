00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
in this video,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.610
we're going to animate this car's right here.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.510
It would look really cool if this cart,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.460
instead of just being static and just fixed on the photo if we animated them,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.550
I'm thinking something like sliding in from the bottom.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.150
In order to animate this cards,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.180
we need to change our existing layout a little.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.350
That cars are part of the background image right now,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.570
and,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.650
as is currently that can be animated,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.980
we'll need these cards as independent images.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.150
So let's go to Fig MMA and export them.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.760
These cards have a shadow on them.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.050
They're not really doing much,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.310
so let's just get rid of it.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.730
If we really want the shadow,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.780
we can always add it inside Web flow.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840
We're going to export them in PNG.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.040
I've tested this with SVG export,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.680
but it came out to be a larger file than PNG.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.660
Sometimes that might happen so you might end up with an SVG that is large in size,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.250
so just pay attention to it.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.650
Also,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.550
we need to export the background photo independently,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:11.840
and,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.310
of course,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.200
let's compress all the images.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:29.870
So let's see what sort of layout we have and how we can change this layout.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.320
So there is our flex box,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980
which has to do blocked inside image and content.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.400
Rapper Inside the Image rapper We have our current image.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.340
Here's what we could do.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.130
We can put all three off our images in sight damage Reppert or use obsolete positioning for

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.950
their cards.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.050
That way there will be stacked on top of the background image.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.950
Uh,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:09.760
uh huh uh,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:33.950
let's replace the current photo.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.280
All right,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.930
Now let's give these images same class and then apply absolute positioning and go from

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.350
there.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.250
Uh,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:04.100
remember the important adjustment with absolute elements.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400
They need a parent with a relative position,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.240
as you can see here Right now,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.990
it says it's relative to the body.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.370
We need to be relative to the image rapper that way will position them exactly where we

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.870
want.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.550
So let's change the image rappers position to relative.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.760
By the way,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.390
the second car hasn't disappeared.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.090
It's underneath the 1st 1 They are in exact the same position because we're using the same

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.710
class.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.590
Now we can position cards on top right corner and then move them.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.250
From there,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.390
we can simply look up the values inside Sigma how much are they separated from the address

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:46.120
and use exactly those values when in putting this values,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.910
don't forget to add p X at the end.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.330
Otherwise,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.810
it's going to use percentage value,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.750
and that's gonna send cards somewhere else.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.140
Finally,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.700
let's move the second car below.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.450
The 1st 1 will need to apply a combo class to it.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:09.060
Excellent.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.550
Let's check that responsive fluidity and see if this arrangement is working.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.290
Is you consumed the smaller screen size that cards are covering the model's face?

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.530
Let's adjust this so this doesn't happen.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.740
We could use percentage values in reality,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.570
but I don't think there's much need for that.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.450
We have space,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:40.520
and now let's do the same thing with a second graphic that,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.800
uh,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:05:02.090
that the to get the car to class instead of creating another combo class,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.000
it's going to have a different position on the left anyways.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.420
This time we don't need to change their relative position because the Image rapper is the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.680
same classes involved,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.580
and it is inheriting the same relative positioning.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:34.350
Uh uh,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.380
excellent layouts are ready now.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.650
Let's create interactions.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.830
So what we want here is for the cars to sliding from the bottom.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.010
When this section is scrolled into view,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.130
What floor has a trigger exactly for that?

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.060
It's this one scroll interview.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.450
Once you select this option,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.470
you'll get to settings one for when it's scrolled into view and one for when it's crawled

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.250
out of view.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.600
We could create a custom animation for this if we wanted to,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.690
but where Flo has present animations,

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.040
which works just fine in this case so we can choose slide animation.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.480
We get these properties to find,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.580
too,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.180
in our animation and click on preview to see what's happening.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.220
It's sliding from left by default.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.890
We wanted to slide from the bottom,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.250
which we can change easily from this drop down.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.610
Excellent.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.890
Now let's check our preview and see how it's working.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.960
Scroll top of the page and go back and forth to the preview mode.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.450
This will restart the animation.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:33.400
The card animates way too early for us to notice it.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.980
It animates when were still on the section above.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.740
That's because by default it triggers when even just the tip off the card interests a few

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.250
port.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.170
Luckily,

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.710
wet floor has an option to adjust that setting,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.220
and we can do that from this offset property.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.840
Right now,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.120
it's set to 0%.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.140
If we set it to something like 50%.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.960
This means interaction will only trigger when the card is halfway through the screen.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.440
Let's see halfway through is usually pretty good trigger for a school interaction,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.310
because users are usually focusing on whatever is in the middle of the screen.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.130
This way,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.080
we make sure cars don't animate when you very still concentrate on something else.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.880
It will be very distracting in such cases,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.250
and they will barely noticed animation so will be pointless.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.750
Let's add the interaction to the second car now and see how it all looks.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:25.750
Uh,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:33.430
uh.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:41.740
I feel like the second card is a little too delayed out.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.460
Prefer if it animated right after the 1st 1 although not at the same time.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.560
However promptly.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.130
After,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.920
let's decrease the offset on the second car to like 45%.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.850
That should trigger it a bit earlier.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:02.160
Excellent.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.550
Now let's do the same thing for the calendar card,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.150
with only one difference.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.450
To slide the calendar from the left.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.650
Somehow sliding it from the left makes a bit more sense.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:25.440
We haven't set up anything on the scroll out of view.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.110
If we wanted this cars to sliding every time,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.000
user scolding and out of the view,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.770
then we would have to set up a slide out interaction when it's rolled out of the view.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.660
But I prefer this to animate once and then stay there.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.250
It's not a sort of interaction that needs to be continues.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.580
This interactions were so simple to set up,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.000
but it brought a lot of life to the page.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.830
HelpAge feels a bit more live,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.770
a bit more friendly and interactive,

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.540
although be careful with interactions because if they're overdone,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.170
they might make surely bring worse results than improve the website.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.320
11 thing is for sure,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.640
because the interactions they take a lot of powered like on the graphics card,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.710
and they might slow down a website.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.790
So on a simple interaction like this,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.810
that's not a big deal.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.270
It's easy to perform,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.930
and nothing is going to slow down the website that much.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.650
However,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.620
when it comes to a bit more complex interactions,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.070
some might be not even complex.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.770
But the way things are arranged in the way the animation is working on the page,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.100
it might actually slow down the website.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.770
And if you know to some performance drops,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.450
and if you see maybe your page is kind of like jerky or something is trying to feel slow or

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.140
not animating fast or,

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.560
you know,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.080
maybe,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.470
or sometimes you're left of my start heating up because some in some interaction or

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.580
animation that you set up,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.770
it's kind of running on Infinite Loop or it's just not working very well.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.750
Then just drop the interactions and dropped animation because no matter what,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.190
it's always better to have a website that is super fast and performing well.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.940
There's something that looks pretty,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.550
is animated really well,

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.180
but it's very slow and people just want to get out of there.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.450
This was a simple interaction,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.210
and we used wealth,

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.180
those presets animation.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.200
In the next video,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.720
we're going to build our own custom animation,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.050
and that's gonna be fun.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.670
Stick around
