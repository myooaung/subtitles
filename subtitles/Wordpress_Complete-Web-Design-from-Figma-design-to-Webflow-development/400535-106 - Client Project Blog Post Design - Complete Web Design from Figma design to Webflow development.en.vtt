00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
our home page design is down.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.240
Now let's do the block Post page this what we have from the wire frames.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.850
Let's copy this frame into the design page so we can follow it easily.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.860
Our home page has an off white background,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.820
but on the blogger,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.350
I prefer to have it white.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.780
It's better for tax readability,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.450
which is very important when it comes to block posts.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.750
So let's copy Paste and now bar directly from the home page design.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:41.310
Well,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:56.860
we have to do is just change the collars for the lynx.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.140
Dark blue is good,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.170
and for the button,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.090
we can keep the same style as is.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.780
But instead of white cars for the tax than background,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:24.750
we can use our primary blue color changing the headline style note.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.270
Here you'll see two headings,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.460
but one is from the wire frame kid,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.600
and the one is from the local styles.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.340
We need the one from the local styles because that's the headline style we created on our

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.380
home page design.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.820
Same goes for the colors.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.260
Off the headline We need that Dark blue from the local styles for the author block.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.960
We don't yet have the special style like caption Weaken.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.350
Just apply the paragraph style first and detach it and then and it.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.210
15 pixels look good.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.830
And don't forget the color.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.180
Gray would be fine here,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.650
the one from the local styles.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.570
We should create a textile out of this.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.850
I should have created this already on the homepage.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.150
There were some small text elements like this,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.510
and if I had done it there,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.310
we would have less design decision to make here,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.450
and all of them would be linked and easily edit herbal and manageable in the future.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.610
Imagine if the client comes back and says they don't like the phone style.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.240
Then you'll see the true benefit of using staffs there.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.700
We have the caption style now,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.920
and let's apply that to the date as well.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:58.740
For the

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.100
image.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.130
Let's grab some photo from on splash or pack cells.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.370
There is this circle inside,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.760
so what we can do is set that image as a feel off that circle.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.380
Just remove that.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.550
I come from his face,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:24.650
uh,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.230
for the cover photo.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.180
Let's find something.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.580
And then,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.240
just like the author image,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.950
edit as an image field,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.850
uh,

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:57.490
excellent for the body were going to select the paragraph style and give it a dark blue

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.050
color.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.700
I'm not going for the great color like the homepage,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.630
because Gray wouldn't be as good in readability on the home page.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.650
It was okay because there was the tax was not as much.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.820
But here it's a block posts and people have to have a very good,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.790
enjoyable experience when reading it.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.370
And if they're squinting,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.960
or if the screening flea carrying.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.440
If they're not seeing that tax fund properly,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.750
then they're just not going to read such a big amount of text.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.080
And for this author block,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.750
the same thing replaced the image than change the phone styles and colors.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.750
-

00:04:31.750 --> 00:05:21.560
Common

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.890
box.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.490
Leave it as is no need to style this because we will be using a plug in,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.880
which has its own style.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.420
Also no point in Crete creating that style here.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.870
But sometimes I take a screen shot off a plugging and insert that instead,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.820
if it's important for my client to know how it looks already and footers easy peasy,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.020
we can call peon pace.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.690
But there is a better option.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.460
We can create a competent out of it because we're going to have this footer on three

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.230
different pages.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.700
And this way,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.430
if we decide Teoh that we need to change some designs will be easily able to change one

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.950
instance.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.390
And then all the three will update at the same time.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.450
Uh,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:12.560
that's it.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.150
Our block.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.350
Post pages done.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.940
We have one more page left,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.120
which is the block create.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.650
And we're gonna do it in the next video stick around.
