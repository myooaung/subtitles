00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
and we're back for some responsive design.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.250
There is very little that needs to be done so we can take care of it in one video.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.960
The NAB our needs some editing for the landscape mode.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.550
First,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
let's fix the margins or default section has 30 pixel side patting,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.930
but nah.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.230
Bar,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.250
in this case has a 60 pixel one.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.190
That's because this is a little different now.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.480
Bar from our home page,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.450
So just decreased the padding to 30 pixel and you're good.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.610
The menu I could need to different color.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.650
It's white so we can see it right now.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.150
Before we change the car,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.250
we have to make sure to apply a comeback class to the menu button,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:50.360
or it's going to affect the one on the home page that's looking good.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.700
Let's check the preview mode.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.760
So here we have a little conflict between the background and the link collars and the menu

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.560
button color.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.310
The links are here.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.380
They haven't disappeared there,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.470
just dark color for the same reason as the menu button.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.900
We just change them.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.720
Previously,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.440
when we were designing our navigation bar and scenes,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.750
they have to maintain to be dark.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.220
Then,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.890
in this case,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.950
we can Onley change the background off this drop down menu,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.650
so changing it to a very light gray is going to be just fine.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:44.580
That the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:55.080
all right now,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.950
But he's looking good on all screens.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.850
Now let's check the hat are with the main image.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.750
The tablet is quite fine.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.480
The landscape mode looks good at first sight,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.300
but think again.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.370
It's going to be narrow,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.150
so the image that is so tall is going toe occupy too much visible screen.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.580
These images going toe work best when it's landscape mode as well,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.850
especially because that's what content creators will upload.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.050
Something like 250 pixel hide should bring it to proper dimensions.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.450
Similarly,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.690
for the portrayed mold will need to shrink it.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.850
A little more 150 pixels look good,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.220
but also shrink spacing around the image both on landscape and portrait.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:55.350
Uh,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.010
there's something fun weaken do with the main image on the desktop.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.620
We have these nontraditional layup where main images sticking out off the main container,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.250
but on a smaller screens.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.460
That's not happening because the section padding is pushing everything in one place,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.590
but there is a way around it If we give the main image some amount of negative margin,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.950
it will cancel out the padding from the section.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.620
So the tablet section has,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.800
ah,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.050
60 pixel padding so we can give the image negative 60 pixels margin.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.020
And that's going to cancel the padding and go edge to ach,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.090
making it look more interesting.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.970
This will cascade down to the mobile,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.340
too,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.820
but we need to adjust on Mobile section panning is 30 pixels,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.070
so we need to adjust it to negative 30 pixels as well.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:57.000
And that will be exactly a stretch on portrait mode.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.860
Author and date segment needs some adjustment.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.940
The space in between.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.780
It's too much.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.650
That's why it's being squeezed like that.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.950
So let's just drink that.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.320
We're controlling spacing on the divider,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.140
so that's what we need to add it.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.910
15 picks,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.330
alas,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.230
is going to be good on the last 15 but on the right zero,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.890
because there is margin from the date.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.350
Uh,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:35.150
now let's check rest of the page.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.200
Rich text doesn't need any adjustments.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.330
It's responsible,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.450
ready and looking good on all screens.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.360
There is just this squashing issue for the avatar on the bottom,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.160
both on landscape and portrait.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.020
That's because to flex child flex Children by default can shrink.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.330
If there's not enough space,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.150
you can see the setting under flax child properties.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.650
If you change this to don't shrink or grow,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.790
and it will owner the width and height size that we have already put for the element on the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.290
portrait.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.050
We can even trim a little bit of space on the right and bring the content closer to it,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.170
and that's all for turn.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.870
It's nothing.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.790
It's the same footer from the whole page,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.150
and it's already optimized.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.050
This page is now fully ready and looking stunning in the upcoming videos.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.060
We're going to create the block home page stick around.
