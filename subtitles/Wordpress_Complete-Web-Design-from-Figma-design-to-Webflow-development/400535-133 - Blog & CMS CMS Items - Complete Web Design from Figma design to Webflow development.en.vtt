00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.230
our database for Block Post is ready.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.840
Now we can start building and adding new block posts to go back to the block post

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.320
collection,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.420
click on the CMS from the left bar and then block posts.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.130
Make sure you don't click on the gear icon that's gonna take you to the place to add it.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.850
The settings.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.280
This is one place to add new block posts,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.440
but this can also be done from the editor.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.290
We can add new block posts from these blue button.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.970
What floor actually has this option to generate some dummy content for us?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.740
So let's do that.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.350
Let's add five or 10 the items.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.490
Give it a few seconds and you'll get this so we have five new block posts.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.860
If you click on one of thes,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.820
you will open up the block post here we can see all those fields we created previously,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.690
this time all filled with some dummy content that weather generated for us.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.680
There's a headline,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.940
and there is a main image.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.250
We have a post body and the post summary.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.530
All of that is edible.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.350
Even you have to republish and make our post live.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
Let's create a new block post from scratch so we can understand how each of these fields

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.680
work.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.650
We can use content from our designs,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.950
so let's go ahead and fill out each of these fields.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.720
When you enter the headline,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.170
it will automatically be used as the girl.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.510
You want to have something different for the URL.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.120
No problem.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.940
You can added this,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.330
Ural.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.620
Right here I keep headlines in euros.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.780
Always the same.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.220
Just makes more sense that way.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.470
Then we have the main image,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.350
which is same as the hero image,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:40.450
and I'm going to upload this image right here.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.640
Now the post body is a special kind of film.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.050
It's called Reach Text.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.240
We can put headlines in this tax up hats,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.850
images,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.470
videos,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.140
quotes,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.690
bullets and that sort of stuff.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.270
We have different types of headlines.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.190
We have images we don't need individual feels for all this stuff.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.950
One rich text field can take care of all the content like that.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.950
And within this rich tax failed.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.880
We have a lot of freedom to style taxman,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.750
different ways or at YouTube videos right between the text.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.950
This even has some way out controls to display the video in many different positions,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.140
although this isn't really how the final result will look like the final result depends on

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.850
how we style this block and more about that later.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.280
Lastly,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.610
we have a post summary film,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.950
which is this click create and will be added to the database.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.480
The status has this message staged for publishing.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.700
It means next time we publish our website,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.310
all those block posts that are pending will go alive.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.130
But in our case,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.120
they actually won't go,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.480
Enver,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.170
because we have only created a database.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.790
We haven't created a bloke page that is going to pull this content from the database.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.750
We shall do that in the next video.
