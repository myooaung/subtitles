00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
When we build our page and wept flow,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.600
we're going to have lots of boxes.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.700
Many of the smaller boxes will sit inside other,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.300
bigger box.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.160
This and those bigger boxes will be sitting even bigger.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.030
Boxes do not get lost in the jungle of Box,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.950
says Wet Floor has a Navigator panel,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.170
which you can find here these navigator,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.330
a similar to fig mus layers panel everything that we add to our page.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.400
We can find it here,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.850
even invisible objects.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.490
Elements in this panel are arranged with the box model logic.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.230
The first top level box that holds everything inside is called the body.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.850
Nothing goes next to it or outside of it.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.380
Everything goes inside.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.400
It's the great great great grandfather off all the Children boxes.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.930
That's why you get this light indentation to represent the hierarchy of elements and to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.150
show what sits inside one box.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.330
We call these nesting so the heading and paragraphs are nested inside the body.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.290
Right floor shows us this Iraq with lines to if we take an empty box and put are heading

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.900
inside,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.050
the line will appear.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.750
The's Line is a helpful guide to easily identify the hierarchy of elements.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.080
Hierarchy is a big thing here.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.100
Many of the properties passed down from the parent to the Children.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.960
This is called inheritance,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.960
so the child will inherit the properties from the parent just like real life.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.780
For example,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.850
if I change the phone caller to read on the parent,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.490
any text element that I drop inside the parent will be read as well all of them,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.480
regardless of the type of text I dropped the headline in paragraph,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.110
Bullet point or what not and that's until I override it.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200
We don't have to be exact copy so far.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.600
Parents,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.990
right?

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.180
If we decide to be different than we can,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.050
we can directly change in tax style on the child element that's called overriding.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.620
Not all properties can be inherited.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.750
Mainly this per applies to textiles.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.780
What floor can show us if there is any inheritance happening on any element?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.960
Do you see how some off the styles are highlighted in orange?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.130
It means that the style is being inherited,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.150
and if you click on it,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.390
it will show you from where it's being inherited.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.980
For example,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.460
in the color,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.340
it's as did Block.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.900
Referring to that parent box,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.530
we just edited later Likes plan.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.230
What's a deadlock if the style is highlighted in blue collar instead,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.010
that means we have directly style that property,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.220
and it will override any stars from their parent.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.810
You don't need to understand this fuller.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.300
For now,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.630
you'll get a hangover it as we practiced and build our page.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.830
The second visual representation of the hierarchy of elements is visible on the bottom

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.910
Navigator bar.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.540
It shows that having is inside did block,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.950
which is inside the body.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.120
These are clickable,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.860
and you can select any of the parents.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.500
But it doesn't show Children or the siblings Onley their parents all the way down to the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.850
body.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.910
For a complete picture,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.780
Navigator panel is a better use.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.220
The same,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.530
of course,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.060
applies to the Navigator panel.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.970
If we select an element in the panel just like Fig ma,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.360
we will be editing that exact element in fig MMA.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.130
When we move elements up and down in layers panel that the position off the element doesn't

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.740
change,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.380
he just goes behind or in front of some other element.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.480
If they're overlapping,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.430
if they're not overlapping that nothing really happens visually but in wet flow,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.650
the position changes.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.100
Moving paragraph element in the Navigator changes the order off how it's displayed on that

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.850
cannabis.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.720
We can also do this moving on the right on the canvas.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.550
You'll notice that Navigator panel updates accordingly.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.330
We can also drag elements inside boxes in the Navigator panel and move the entire boxes,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.050
which will move all the trailer Children elements with it.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.590
Okay,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.270
these Web structure might feel a little confusing in the beginning,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.390
but don't worry quickly,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.350
you'll get used to it.
