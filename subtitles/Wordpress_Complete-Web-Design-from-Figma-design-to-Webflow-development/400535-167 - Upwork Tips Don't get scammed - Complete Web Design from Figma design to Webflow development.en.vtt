00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
up work is large,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.960
very large,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.190
and there's a lot of money that is moving around and a lot of money that can be made.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.730
So when there is money,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.950
there's always bad actors that are trying Teoh rip people off.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.350
So here are some tapes or not to get scammed on up work.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.540
Never do free or trial work on upward.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.390
There's this game going around where some jackasses ask you to do trial work that you have

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
to perform some free ward before they can award your job.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.190
So they have to,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.570
you know,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.690
test you on your skill or something like that.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.040
And what they do is they asked many different Relent sirs to do that free war,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.450
and then they kind of gather this free work,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.190
and then they use that free work.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.780
Teoh for some other client and canna get paid for it.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.050
Then,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.680
without themselves doing any job.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.530
Here's a video by one off the upward freelancers who has recorded one such scam.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.890
The link is green,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350
the resources if you are interested,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.420
this is a repeated tape,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.430
but this time for different reason,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.840
because not just because you couldn't get banned by upward But also you could get scammed

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.540
if you take things outside of up work.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.350
If a new client who hasn't paid you yet and you haven't you haven't had any work

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.110
relationship asks you to take things outside a platform to save money or,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.430
you know,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.470
kind of get rid off the commission,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.380
then warning bells should go in your hat instantly because riel clients don't care if they

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.580
pay you up on that pork or outside of it,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.030
because they're not the ones paying the commission for them,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.020
the price is exact.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.460
The same.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.230
You're the one who orsa gets the commission deducted out of your pay.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.070
So for them,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.810
it's all the same.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.660
So there is no reason for them to initiate to ask you to a Why don't we take this outside?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.160
Because we're going to save money out of it.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.810
They don't even most of them.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.970
They don't even know that you are how much you are paying in commissions.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.660
Obviously,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.340
for the clients,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.230
it's safer to keep things on up work because they have some guarantees from the airport,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.540
right?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450
If things things go wrong,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.670
then at least up working,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.370
gonna intervene and mediate the situation.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.410
So when they're asking,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.940
you take things from outside,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.410
it might be shot.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.070
And if something looks shoddy and it probably is having a video call with perspective,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.920
clients has two great benefits.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.630
First,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.220
bad players and scammers.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.900
They don't want to show their face.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.550
They will like.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.110
They like to stay anonymous.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.730
So if somebody is refusing to have a video chat,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.030
then you should be a little suspicious.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.430
A video call with clients.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.690
That's a very good start for a good relationship.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.150
When you have this sort of face to face connection with the client,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.290
they will be more likely to honor you.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.380
More like to respect you more likely to give you a better review than have worsened review

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.380
.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.000
And if something goes wrong,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.110
they will be more likely to pay you rather than kind of dispute the payment without pork or

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.900
something like that.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.110
They will also trust you.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.760
Maurin there will trust your work more so whatever designs you produce,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.770
they will take it a bit more seriously if they saw you.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.800
If they know that who you are and who is the face and person behind the work and not just

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.050
some sort off name and profile for on that's it
