00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
in the very last section off these page.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.150
The footer layout is quite simple.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.580
We used our 12 point agreed to divide the foot or in six equal blocks.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.670
Each block is made of two columns,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.450
and one block is reserved for the space between the logo and the foot or links.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.380
The most obvious option here is to use flex box.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.030
Of course,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.070
there's an option of using columns element from Web flow.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.650
It would fit our layout just right because it's based on fall point agreed to.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.940
But you know how much I loved those columns,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.350
so we're not going to use them.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.480
Instead,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.850
we will make our own columns using flex box,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.360
as usual,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.950
lets at the section and a container inside,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:58.050
id another bloke and apply our usual flex books class to it.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.930
Now let's add another do block inside,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.850
which will name as Footer Column.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:17.850
I'm gonna give it a temporary background and high just to see what we're doing.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.220
Just like in our designs,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.930
were going to use six columns.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.260
These are going to be equal with columns so the entire flex box will be divided in six

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.160
equal parts.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.150
We can do that using percentage points 100% divided by six gives us 16.666 and so on.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.070
Instead of doing the math on our own,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.640
we can actually have wet flowed to the math for us.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.450
Just like sigma inside the Whitfield tied 100% divided by six.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.940
If we duplicate this six times,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.650
you can see how it fills up the entire space.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.620
Let's add the margins from the side,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.400
just like we have in our designs.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.600
They're separated by 30 pixel space.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.020
So here we should add half off that on each side.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200
15 picks a left and right margin this way.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.220
Margins from adjacent columns will add up to 30 pixels.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.860
However,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.370
we shouldn't have margins on the first and last columns because these margins will add

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.840
extra space to already existing petting.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.950
That's part of the section.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.350
Dave.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.090
This might not be that big of a deal,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.200
but it's a great habit to be consistent.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.790
We can do this is alibis using combo classes,

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.450
just create a combat class first and removed the left margin and same thing on the last

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.850
column.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:47.850
All right now,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:03:14.090
let's put the content in the corresponding columns instead of using paragraph for regular

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.610
attacks.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.550
We have another option for attacks cold text block,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.420
which is what we're going to use for this tagline.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.350
Under the logo.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.740
Text Block is basically a regular div with text inside it.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.560
It works the same way as a paragraph element,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.250
but they have different purposes.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.120
You should use paragraph for a multi line longer tax than main content off the page and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.670
text box for everything else.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.300
That is not a heading paragraph.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.950
Our link.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.040
You can use these to interchangeably.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.280
The result is the same,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.510
but it's a good habit to use them purposefully,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.520
because search engines and screen readers can identify how your content is structured on

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.160
the page.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.680
Another way to create the text block is just by double clicking inside a regular did block

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.630
and start typing.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:06.550
It will turn it into a textbook for the food or links that we are going to add regular link

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.250
elements.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:17.000
Let's dial going before duplicating that way duplicates We'll carry the class.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.510
The phone caller already shows the great color,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.350
but for some reason it's still blue on the canvas.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.590
This is a little odd behavior that seems like a bargain workflow side.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.630
It is correct that it's blue because the gray color from the body tag is being overridden

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.640
by more specific old links Attack,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.750
which has a blue color by default.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.380
So in reality,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.540
the properties panel should be showing blue,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.250
not Grey.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.410
But there might be one reason why that's not happening,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.920
which I'm not gonna go into right now,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.150
because it's not really adding value to this lesson.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.540
So to fix these,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.720
just select some other color and select the great again,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.490
we don't need it to be underlying that we can remove by selecting none under texts

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.520
decoration.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.880
We need some,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.150
however,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.380
effect for this link.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.960
Otherwise,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.750
they're not gonna look like blinks.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.070
We can simply turn it into blue collar on the Harbor State.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.850
That's a simple and effective option.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.700
We could add a hover transition effect here,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.920
just like we did with buttons,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.520
but it's not really necessary.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.760
It's not a lot of change,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.050
so let's keep it with a trend without a transition.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:36.800
Now let's duplicate but hopes it puts them side by side.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.520
Why's that?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.210
Can you guess?

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.850
Because display for links is SAT two in line.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.420
That means it flows like text,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.580
which it is,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.250
so they are going to go one next to each other.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.210
If we apply display block instead,

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.550
we know what's gonna happen.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.780
It will occupy an entire with and stack on top of each other.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.170
But this method has one little issue.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.200
Not really an issue more like not an ideal user experience,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.710
since it's a link and it's a full with that means it's a clickable,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.320
even on the empty space on like are now bar where similar thing is happening.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.950
The links interact even on the empty space.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.520
But here,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.050
the border on the bottom is a good representation that the entire thing is a link.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.830
If we were just highlighting that tax they need would be awed on the NAB our too.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.350
So how can we make them stack on top of each other without using display block function?

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.250
By using flex books,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.040
we can give the parent flex layout and give it the vertical direction instead of horizontal

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.040
,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.520
then left a line.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.570
Make sure to give this left align,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.850
otherwise it will stretch edge to edge by default edges like a block,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.250
and they're now it's stacked on top of each other and empty spaces and part of the link.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.280
Okay,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.920
let's dial our headline instead of applying it class to this food or headlines.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.230
Let's style one of the having tax say H three.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.020
Maybe it might be the right level h two or we could use for something bigger.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.570
He meet level headline.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.500
Do you remember how to style attacks?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.270
We need to select attack from the selector,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.050
and now we are able to style all the age three tax.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:29.500
Let's remove the top margin and add a 20 pixel bottom margin,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.250
just like we have it in the designs.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.950
And there we go.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.150
Now all age three tax will be started like these by default.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:53.540
One thing you'll notice that columns don't align on top like we having designed.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.050
Let's have a look at our flags box headings.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.340
You see it's as a line center.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.330
What we want is a lying top.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.850
Instead,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.530
as usual,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.900
lets at a Compal class to this flex box before we make any changes to not mess up other

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.710
instances,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.550
and now that's a correct alignment.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:45.380
Let's finish up the links in this practice project.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.830
We're not going to link this page is because we don't have other pages.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.350
But we could connect the Contact US link,

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.840
for example,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.490
to link the email address so it opens up a new email window when the user clicks on it.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.250
We just need to put the email address inside these field.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.440
We can skip the subject line on.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:14.600
We can do the similar thing for the phone link and also for the office address.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.790
We could link a Google Maps.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:40.670
You are all Jack opening new window so that Google Maps doesn't open up right inside this

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.230
window,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:49.850
forcing the users to leave the site and finally leads at the copyright text on the bottom.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:59.250
We're going to use tax to block and gain instead of the paragraph element.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:18.710
Have added the text block inside the container but outside of the flex box and we can add

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.080
180 picks on margin on top,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.450
just like our designs.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.300
You know our designs.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.360
The corporate tax is quite close to the bottom off the page,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.750
30 pixel away from the bottom,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:37.280
but in Web floor it's much higher because our section log has a 90 pixel Paddick.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.730
We need to change that 90 petting to there's 30 pixels.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.780
But before we do that,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.450
we gotta add a combo class.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:53.380
And there you go.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.790
We're down without desktop version off our page.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.850
Let's go to the preview mode and check how it all looks.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:14.730
So,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.290
to recap,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.770
we have built the food or using a Flex Books layout we have given food or columns

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.670
percentage with so they shrink and expand equally.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.470
And we have laughed one of the columns empty to create space between the logo and the food

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.070
or links.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.950
We have learned about a new element.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.850
Tax block.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.340
How it's used for non paragraph text in,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.050
more off a general use.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.310
This concludes the current section in the upcoming section.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:44.310
We will learn how to make our page responsive so it looks beautiful and user friendly on

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.250
any device.
