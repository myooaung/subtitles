00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
before we dive into design,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.040
let's first set up big markets going to be a quick order.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.110
You are going to show view just a general understanding of how the two works and allow the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.180
important futures that we will need to design websites in Fig MMA.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.750
I will teach you them and show you them as we move through the material and as you need

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.060
them,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.050
not right away.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.840
So first things first.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.050
Let's download fake my right.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.850
We have two options Mac and Windows on a Mac,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.450
but windows have Bork's and looks the same.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.200
So even on Windows,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.700
you'll be able to follow my editorials perfectly.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.610
Your own Linux next or some other operating system.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.220
Don't worry.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.580
You can use Sigma directly in your browser.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.000
It's that awesome.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800
But I strongly recommend using left up app.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.150
If you have a chance.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.080
This our fund installers,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.460
which are needed for the browser only if you're downloading the app.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.370
Don't worry about this now.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.860
Let's install it on a Mac.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.300
It just needs to be moved to the application's folder,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.450
and that's all.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.090
No idea how it works on Windows,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.210
but I'm sure it's not your first time installing an application.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.820
So just go with the usual installation.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:29.890
This is the initial screen sign up with Google.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:40.970
If you want to make it is there are Click here to sign up with any mountain Your name not

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.550
go.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:51.490
What kind of work you do design create account and we're going to arrive on our homepage,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.350
which is our file browser.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.370
All your feed my vials will show here Pygmies Cloud based So you will need Internet when

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.000
working on it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.450
You can work out fine,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.020
but only if you load the file before going off line.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.470
Then you can work with a file,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.440
and once you get back online,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.060
it will sink and update the file.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.770
It's it's OK,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.710
but I wouldn't recommend doing this just,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.220
you know,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.190
make sure you're always online would working on it.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.250
Let's start by creating a new file.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.850
We can do that from here or here.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.850
Let's close the on boarding tutorial.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.800
Now we're in the Sigma Editor.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.590
This is where everything happens.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.970
Nothing to be scared off.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.750
It's quite simple.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.150
Open files will show as tap sort of like your browser.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.600
And if you want to get back to the home page to open another fire.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.210
You can do that from this.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.150
I can run here.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.710
Let's go through it.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.490
Toolbar here.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.430
As you can see,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.170
it only has a handful of toast.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.620
Nothing like what you to get in Futter shop 1st 1 is a menu that has a search field,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.050
which is a great way to find an option that you're looking for.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.070
For example,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.650
Zoom,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.380
then,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.460
is a move tool,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.550
the default tool that is selected my most of the time.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.000
It does exactly what it says it most objects and interacts with them.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.700
The next one is the frame to.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.250
It's similar to art board that you get in other design tools.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.650
All our designs will start with a frame,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.690
depending what we're designing for.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.050
We need to choose a specific size,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.150
the screen that we're designing for.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.080
So either we are designing a scream for a desktop computer,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.650
a laptop iPhone and so on.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.050
As this is a Web design course,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.450
we will be designing for a basket up unless left up less stuff left up computers.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.520
We can draw it,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.360
but better option is to choose one of the presets sizes.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.960
We can choose the screen from the struck down.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.340
There are iPhones,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.120
Androids,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.980
tabloids.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.350
We're going to choose one of them,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.380
asked up screen sizes.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.150
Obviously,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.000
you're not stuck with this dimensions.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.690
If you want to,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.450
you can resize it like this.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.260
Next is a shape tool.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.800
When you click a tiny arrow,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.160
it will let you select any of the following shaves rectangle line,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.910
etcetera.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.980
Let's draw a rectangle.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.360
It's the first thing selected by default,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.850
and on the brain you draw a rectangle like this.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.800
Same logic for other shapes Doesn't have a panto.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.520
Don't worry about this.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.930
For now,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.770
we won't be using it that much.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:46.030
Next to it is a text tool pretty straight forward and finally,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.740
the comments he sees for a collaboration.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.920
When you send it to your client or team members to review,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.780
they can directly comment on each element.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.180
And that's all you need to know about the toolbar.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.750
For now.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.080
On the right side,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.440
we have the properties panel.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.450
Fun thing about proper spinal is that it changes based on a object you have selected.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.680
We select a rectangle and we get along.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.050
The property's off this particular rectangle.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.250
When we select tax,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.020
we get slightly different properties boned tax size.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.450
So we will explore each of the properties later when we actually need them.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.680
No need to memorize everything right now.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.290
Finally,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.680
on the left side,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.230
we have layers panel.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.550
Every new element that we create will show up here.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.550
Why is it cold lairs then why not objects or elements or something that because the they

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.890
lay on top of each other?

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.350
And if you want to rearrange them,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.030
you just need to change the order in the layers panel.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.130
For example,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.300
if we want the purple box to go below,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.970
we just need to drang that layer and move it below the rectangle.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.540
And if we move any of this object site I tied off this frame,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.870
you'll see how the layers panel oil update and will move the object outside of the frame

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.550
onto the general canvas.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.360
That's all you need to know about big.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.430
Before now,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.750
more features will come up in all the practice exercise that we're going to do.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.600
If you haven't been following along,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.950
stop pause and go ahead and do this right now and then continue with the next lesson.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.600
If at any point in this course you get Stark.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.060
You know,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.900
it's new tools.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.650
They sometimes update and different things change.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.480
And I might not be as quick as updating the screens and everything.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.140
Obviously,

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.690
I will.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.400
But,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.610
you know,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.570
there they move very fast,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.610
hold these tools and they update screens and user interface very quick.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.620
So I might show you something in my build.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.520
Without a gun,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.340
let me know.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.250
I'll fix that.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.120
But if you get stock,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.810
you can always drop me a message or ask a question in the discussion forums.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.840
Either me or some other student will help you out.
