00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Let's do a fun exercise on sampling colors from images.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.150
Have prepared the Figma file for this assignment.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.925
It has three frames with the same layout.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.500
This is a very common web layout,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.540
having a sort of split screen.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.620
50 percent of the screen is the image and then 50 is for the content.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.235
It's a very simple layout to make and can be quite effective and beautiful.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:24.420
And it will be good for you to practice this layout as we practice our color sampling,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.250
there are three frames in this file.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.735
On two of them,

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:31.905
I have prepared images of for you and one is empty.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.910
I want you to sample colors from these images for each frame and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.945
paint the left side of the frame with a color palette on the empty one,

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:41.590
I want you to pick your own photo.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.080
You might discover that not all photos are good pig for the color palette.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.080
Also, I want you to use what you have learned so far

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.170
and apply that to the left side of the frame,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.415
the hierarchy, and every thing about the typography,

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:56.840
let me do one as a demonstration,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.415
I'm going to use an empty frame.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:03.830
First. Let's go to unsplash.com and find a good photo.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.560
Unsplash is a great source for free photos.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.620
They are free for commercial use, not just personal,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.850
so and they have a wide variety of different photos.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.760
They're not very, they don't look like stocks,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.965
so they are quite natural and nice looking.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:22.190
Although because they're free in their designs,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.990
they are used a lot,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.540
but more about the photography later.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.310
Alright, So a lot of mountains,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.020
so I'm going to pick a nice photo of them.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.560
Mountain View.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.595
This one is a good choice.

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:42.380
It has a lot of colors in it,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.270
so we'll be fun to work with.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.015
First, I'm going to create a placeholder for the image.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:57.935
I'm going to draw a rectangle to make this exactly half of the frame.

00:01:57.935 --> 00:01:59.870
Let's check the size of our frame.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.845
It's one hundred and one hundred and fifty two pixels.

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:06.080
And now I'll make the rectangle,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.370
the half of that size.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.720
Here's a cool Figma trick.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.430
I'm going to type in one hundred,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.810
one hundred and fifty two divided by two and then hit Enter.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.030
And Figma will do the math for me.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.905
It's exactly the half of the frame.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.570
Now I'm going to place my image.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.360
You can directly read your image in Figma or you can

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.120
choose Place Image option from the shape tool.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.825
Here are a few things to look out for when working with images in Figma,

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:34.190
the photos that you get from Unsplash or other stock sides will be quite large in size.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.980
So give it a little time for Figma to think because it's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.385
uploading the image to its servers before you can place it,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.800
the image will be placed in its original dimensions.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.270
Since this image is very large,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.160
it looks super zoomed in like this.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.470
But because it's part of the frame only this,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.380
this is visible as it's huge ream to resize it.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.760
When you select an image that is filling the entire space of the frame,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.710
instead of selecting the image layer,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.615
it selects the entire frame.

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:01.310
I find this a little annoying,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.310
but it's not a big deal to select a photo layer.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.950
The obvious option is to select it in the layers panel.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.305
But the better way is to click on the image while holding a Control or Command key.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:13.715
This is a very handy trick.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:18.170
Keep it in mind to resize the photo to some useful dimensions.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.680
Let's zoom out so we can see the borders of the image.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.760
You see those blue lines,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.140
those are the borders of the image.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.750
The image is really big in comparison to the frame.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.390
That's why the borders are so far from the frame.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.585
We can grab the handles and resize our image.

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:36.950
Hold Shift while you do this to keep the proportions of the image and

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.405
image element in Figma is basically a rectangle with an image as a background fill.

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:42.620
You don't have to hold the shared.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.330
It's not going to distort the image.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.930
But in this case, I want to see the original image so I can choose

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.610
exactly what part of the image to display.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.474
If you place an image on a rectangle,

00:03:55.474 --> 00:04:01.290
it's going to become a feel of that rectangle instead of being an independent image.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.900
Since it's a background fill of the rectangle,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.910
you will have a full control over what portions of the original image to show in where.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.170
One last thing to look out for when you place an image or anything for that matter,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.040
make sure that that layer lives on that frame you are working on.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.480
Because besides that frame,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.600
it may be accidentally placed on other frames that are close by.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.795
Or it can be placed on the canvas independent of all the frames.

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:48.320
It's not on your frame, it will not behave the way you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.425
expect it to read my drag your crazy until you figure this out.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.990
This way, I wanted to cover all the possible ways that something

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.795
might go wrong and not behave the way you expect it.

00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:01.145
This is usually what causes the biggest frustration in learning anything new.

00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:04.625
Not understanding why something isn't behaving the way it's supposed to.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:06.440
So if it's acting weird to have a look at

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.080
the Layers panel and make sure it's on your frame.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.465
To drag it on the frame that your cursor or the mouse has to be on the frame,

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:16.910
overlapping the frame, then it's going to drag it inside.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.310
And if it's an eye goes outside of the frame,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.635
then it's going to drag it outside of

00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:24.500
the frame and putting on that canvas or somewhere else.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.330
All right, after we have placed our image,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.145
we wanted to show only on that.

00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:30.845
Great place holder that we have already set up.

00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:33.830
This is best done with a feature called masking.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.980
This is a cool feature that has a lot of other users to.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.405
Masking works like this.

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:41.750
You have a shape that is a mask and anything that is on top

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.275
of that shape will be visible only within boundaries of that mask.

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:48.320
In our case, we'll use this rectangle as a mask and we will

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.545
use our image as a child of this mask.

00:05:51.545 --> 00:05:56.090
This will hide portions of the image that is outside of this rectangle.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.950
To apply a mask to an object,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.705
we need at least two elements.

00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:01.265
Select the layers.

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:04.565
Once you'll select these options will appear in the toolbox.

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:07.490
This one that looks like a moon is the masking tool.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.465
Click on it.

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:10.535
Let's see what happened to our layers.

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:13.445
Figma took our selection and create a new group out of it.

00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:17.090
Within the group, then rectangle has turned into our mask.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.300
This arrow means that everything that we place above the mass

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.380
inside this group will only be visible within the boundaries of the mask.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.970
For example, let's make a circle.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.670
If we drag the circle inside the mask group, this will happen.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.225
Keep this in mind when some layer you are looking for disappears out of nowhere.

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:37.745
It might be hiding behind the mask.

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.770
Get it for mask to work.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.110
The rectangle has to be behind your photo.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.130
If it's in front and your mascot,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.050
this will happen. Look at the layers panel.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.170
It shows that the image has turned into MS,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.185
and the rectangle above it is being masked around it.

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:03.785
That's not what we want obviously to disable masking from something.

00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:08.555
Select the layer that is being used as a mask and click that,

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:10.505
that mask icon one more time.

00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:14.390
It shows that mask is applied to it, so deselect it.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.245
Now it's back to normal. Okay, back to our image.

00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:21.830
I want to size it to my liking and show the parts that

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.490
I feel are the bass basically to crop the image,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.365
keep in mind if you select the mask group,

00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:30.320
it will select the whole thing and moving it around,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.260
we'll just move the whole thing to position your image perfectly.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.030
You will need to select directly

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.985
the image layer from the layers panel or as I previously mentioned,

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:42.120
with Control, click or Command on Mac.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.750
Excellent, our images ready.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.585
Now I'm going to style my text a little.

00:07:53.585 --> 00:07:56.480
You can place your own tax in the headline when you pick your image.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.175
You don't have to worry about the paragraph.

00:07:58.175 --> 00:07:59.390
I've used a dummy tax,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.665
the famous Lorem Ipsum already have the fonts in mind.

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:06.305
I'm not choosing them based on images, but you can,

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:08.810
if you'd like to play for a displays,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.100
a beautiful typeface in modern serifs style gives a lot of class to the page.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.780
And Lato is an excellent sensory TY for any general kind of use.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.695
All right, Now that we have prepared our frame,

00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:35.480
we can start sampling our color palette to sample a color from our image.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.340
First, we need to blur our image.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.080
What this does is that it averages out that adjacent pixels and gives you

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.225
a more accurate color palette close to what our eyes are perceiving,

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:50.210
because we don't actually see those independent pixels.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:57.350
In real life, we see an average or with its shadows and gradients and all that.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.560
The color picker tool on a computer is super precise,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.485
so it grabs the color of individual pixels.

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:08.270
And individual pixel is not the most accurate representation of the overall picture.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.690
Select the image or the entire mass group in the properties panel you will see

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.215
effects option add a new effect by clicking the plus icon.

00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:17.870
By default, this will add a drop shadow,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.130
click on the drop-down to see other effect types and select layer blur.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.470
By default, this is not usually not blurred.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.215
We need a bit heavier to increase the blurry click on

00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:33.540
the Sun icon and then start increasing and stop before colder start to mix too much.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.250
24 is pretty good in this case,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.170
although this isn't an exact science,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.330
sometimes you will need much less blur,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.110
sometimes more, especially if you want to sample a color from something small,

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.940
like a blue eyes red lipstick,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.830
then you will need smaller blurry value.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.495
Otherwise, the color will mix too much.

00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:53.059
Notice how the color palette is very noticeable.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.030
We have the blue, this light brown colors,

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.620
and the dark brown Figma can pick out these colors for us with an eyedropper tool,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.200
draw a rectangle and then click on this field to change the color of the rectangle.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.705
Then select the eyedropper tool.

00:10:08.705 --> 00:10:10.610
As you hover over the image,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.470
it will pick the color from that exact pixel and paint a rectangle in that color.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.795
Repeat the process for all the other colors.

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:21.320
How many colors you will pay equal depend on the image a hand on you.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.210
You want to pick the dominant colors,

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.990
those that are undeniably visible and make up the most of the image.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.285
And any smaller colors that are quite

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:33.900
prominent include some neutral tones as well, like Grace.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.610
Now that we have our color palette,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.030
disable the blur effect on the image and start painting

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.650
the left side content in these cars and see what works and what doesn't.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.175
Let's add another rectangle on the left side as our background fill.

00:11:06.175 --> 00:11:10.375
Remember wise discovering our elements because the layer is higher in the list,

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.110
just move it down below so it's arranged as a background.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.790
You can also right-click and select Send to Back that while sand all the way to the back.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.680
If you select Send backboard instead,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.600
that will send it one layer at a time.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.275
Now let's try some background colors.

00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:32.510
Let's write this neutral colors.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.220
And let's see the Klara that goes the best with this dark brown.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:48.630
The blue does contrast very well and it can be useful for some exciting design.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.820
This brights and the color is not bad either.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.160
There I think this one is the best,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.660
really bad at color names.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.510
So I usually look it up on color sides.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.250
This one is called tumbleweed is for paragraph I can pick white collar,

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.890
although it's popping too much and competing for

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.110
the attention with a headline in such cases,

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:16.550
what I do is that I decrease the opacity of the white text around 80%.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.020
This will decrease the intensity of blood that white color and

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:26.330
also the background color will permeate a little since it has some transparency,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.225
and that will suit the background quite handsomely.

00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:32.150
We can also try that same tumbleweed on the tags,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.190
which is not a bad result at all.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.140
Although I would never do something like this.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.860
That just creates a mass out of colors instead of

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.650
intentional and natural looking color combinations.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.050
Let's check other colored backgrounds.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.890
Oh yeah, this looks gorgeous as well.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.260
Okay, so this one fills the most organic to me and

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
lets the beauty of the landscape really stand out.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.350
Plus the color is quite suitable for outdoorsy theme.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.850
Alright, very fun exercise to get you started with colors and play around with them.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.350
After you submit your work.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.495
In the assignments. After this,

00:13:23.495 --> 00:13:26.585
you'll find a link to a file that has a solution to it.

00:13:26.585 --> 00:13:30.590
Don't worry if the solution isn't exactly same as yours.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.810
There isn't just one solution to this exercise.
