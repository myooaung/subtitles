00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
well Flow has one very cool feature of never mentioned,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.620
the client billing.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.850
Clan billing lets you make money from weapons hosting.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.900
On top of what Klein pays for wet flow hosting,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.110
you can add your own maintenance fees.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.450
Weppler will take their cut and send you the rest.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.550
There's a good way to generate some nights Passive income from all the websites to create.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.570
There are some conditions are just going to a link the page so you can read it in more

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.170
detail.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.530
This is the approach that I mentioned before that some Web developers take because they can

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:39.810
host hundreds of far websites on their hosting plan and then sort of give ah,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.190
each website owner you know their own annual fee and then pocket the difference.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.770
So that's the service sort of you can provide,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.370
and you can utilize similar service within weapon.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.510
Obviously,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.230
you know the discount that you can give them on the hosting is not as big as what you would

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.420
do on others platforms,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.790
because on Weppler,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.440
each side has their own hosting,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.550
so you cannot have an account where you kind of get and put all the website inside,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.580
and then give the discounts to your clients,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.880
right?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.530
So each website will have to have the hosting.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.830
So the difference is not going to be as big as some.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.750
Some other Web designer would make it in different platforms.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.390
I myself,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.260
I don't actually do this with my clients.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.440
I don't charge them for management fees.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.150
I build a website in their own accounts usually and just have them sort off,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.480
take the project and kind of keep it.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.790
And on that project and sort of create this disconnection between me and the project.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.080
I still make myself available for maintenance or any updates or anything like that.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.920
But I like to sort of when I'm done with the project because I've worked on it so long,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.390
and I am,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.630
you know,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.230
I do.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.380
Websites mind website.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.680
Usually I like them big projects.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.550
I like through,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.920
you know,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.780
designed them,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.250
and they cannot dedicate a lot,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.380
a lot of time to eat,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.050
to make something that I'm proud off,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:06.650
and I just enjoy the process right and my style and a lot of developers and designers.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.140
They're stylish to make as many websites as possible for as many clients as possible.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.050
and then sometimes used this management fees to create a nice,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.330
healthy kind of monthly revenue from all the management fees that they're charging two

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.610
older existing lines.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.920
But that's not my style.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.940
I like websites,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.530
and I like working on websites and I love.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.610
I want them to be fine,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.470
not like a conveyor and a factory line that I just produce as many as possible.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.330
But hey,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.230
it's me.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.770
It's my personal preference.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.780
Azi many people as many for Linz Web designers there are.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.770
There are as many ways to do freelance Web design business.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.030
You will discover your own quirks and how you like to work and what sort of arrangements

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.850
you have to make.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.070
And that's the beauty off freelancing because it enables you to kind of bold your working

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.260
preferences and shape your kind of work life the way you want it.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.640
You wouldn't be able to do that in a full time job in 100 years
