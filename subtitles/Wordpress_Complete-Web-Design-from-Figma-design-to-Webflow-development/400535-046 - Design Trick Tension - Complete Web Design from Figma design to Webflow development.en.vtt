00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
design shares a lot of similarities with music.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.430
Just like designers.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.340
Musicians also use contrast trick,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.570
which can be contrast between high notes and low notes between going fast and going slow.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.960
They also use repetition,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.460
which is the rhythm off the sunk.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.030
They even use white space,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.850
which are pauses and silent parts off the music.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.880
One more technique.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.770
These two field share is called Tension in Music.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.620
That's when melody starts to pick up.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.330
Ah,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.160
and it's kind of adds to the momentum and then becomes a bit more dramatic and at some

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.090
point kind of explodes in this kill me nation in,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.780
for example,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.550
and techno music.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.820
It's kind of going to this very heavy rhythm.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.760
Attention is something that makes any creative work interesting,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.150
and it's used in other fields besides design and music.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.850
For example,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.820
in fiction,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.370
tension is called suspense.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.540
So how is tension created in design?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.620
This a square laid flat on the surface,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.420
in complete balance and in central alignment?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.310
There's no tension here at all.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.590
Nothing is happening.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.300
No drama.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.770
It's solid and grounded.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.650
How about now?

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.640
This is a different story,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.960
isn't it?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.710
The square is not laying flat anymore.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.070
it's standing on its corner,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.510
which seems like either it's going to tip over or fullback on the flat side with a simple

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.000
tilt,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.120
we have created a lot of tension.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.810
Tilting elements is one way to create attention.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.570
There's more.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.610
You can move elements to the edge of the frame or move elements out of balance or high

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.660
parts of the object.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.220
This is something we've already played with as part of the extreme cropping.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.870
The tension is one of the reasons why extreme cropping is such an interesting trick to use

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.870
.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.710
And if the extreme crop is uneven,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.140
like this movie poster,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.450
it increases the tension even more.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.260
Remember the rule of thirds Tension is exactly why this rule works really well.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.950
When objects in debt center feel stable and a little boring.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.910
Off balance placement can create more visually interesting look.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.170
Overlapping is another way to create tension.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.020
Overlapping does have other merits,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.880
like adding extra dimension because objects are layered on top of each other or because

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.540
interlocking elements tie the design together.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.090
But it also adds tension because two objects are now interacting with each other in a very

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.950
interesting way.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.120
One way to create tension and movement in design is by using diagonal or angled shapes.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.800
These sort of tension is very useful when you want to portray speed and movement in your

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.400
design.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.050
Why do diagonal shapes create tension and movement is very easy to demonstrate?

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.820
This is still image,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.290
but we can feel that circle about to roll down.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.440
That's how angles at the feeling off movement in design.
