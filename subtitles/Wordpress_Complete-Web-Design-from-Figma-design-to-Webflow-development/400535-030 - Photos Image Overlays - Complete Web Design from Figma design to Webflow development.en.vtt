00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
a great photo can do wonders for a design.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.400
I love this photo.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.310
It's beautiful.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.930
The colors are amazing.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.050
It's simple,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.840
yet looks like our fairytale.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.860
But we do have an issue in this composition.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.080
There is not enough contrast between the background and all this objects on top of them.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.580
The contrast is so low that most taxes completely unreadable.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.200
Producing a design like this is the final result is a terrible job,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.880
even though everything else is spot on and images so gorgeous.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.850
How do we fix this by using overlays?

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.910
Basically,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.560
Putin color fails on top off the image.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.390
The most common one is to put a dark overlay on it in fig ma.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.720
This means adding a black cholera fell on top of the image and adding transparency to that

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.030
feel until you get good contrast.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.680
But before it gets too dark,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.450
another method is called tinting.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.730
It's taking the photo and giving it a different color tent.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.690
To do this,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.000
you take the image and dis ach aerated to turn it into a black and white photo,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.130
and then again we add a color field.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.730
But this time,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.670
instead of black,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.150
you pick a different color.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.180
This will give the image attend off that color,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.490
but this is especially useful if you want to use brand colors in the design.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.650
It's a very handed trick.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.250
You can also apply the fix to specific places instead of the whole page.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.060
For instance,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.250
In here I've put the dark,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.590
transparent box behind their content,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.460
and I've also added the dark,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.350
transparent Grady in behind the navigation bar.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
Do you notice on and off and on again there,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.740
although just as a side note,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.450
I'm not a big fan off those black rectangles just randomly behind the content,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.860
so I avoid using them if I really know how to using big background,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.570
and it just is a very easy designing.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.760
There's not a lot of designing actually involved,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.350
like Airbnb is home page.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.160
You find an impressive photo and put your content over it in white Color creates a very

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.900
attractive looking design without a lot of effort,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.170
and in my experience,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.970
clients love it
