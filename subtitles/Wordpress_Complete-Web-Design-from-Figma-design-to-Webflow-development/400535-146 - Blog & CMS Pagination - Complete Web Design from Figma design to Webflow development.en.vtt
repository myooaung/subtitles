00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
in this video,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.410
we're going to add the pagination without splitting block cards on different pages.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.370
Every single block card would load.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.410
And when we have a lot of look post that it would make the Page Lord very slowly and

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.530
wouldn't be optimal for 20 cars,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.150
that's all right.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.050
But for 50 60 and more that is going to slow down the page considerably.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.750
Creating a pagination on collection list is as easy as taking a box in the Settings panel.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:35.580
So here we decide how many items should there be displayed per page.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.340
We want a number that is suitable for a three column grid.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
So something that is divide herbal by three like 9 12 etcetera.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.410
10 isn't good,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.810
because then you will have empty slots outside.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.550
Anything between nine and 30 is appropriate,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.860
maybe for a small block.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.990
You would want to go on a small side of the scale to create an impression that there is no

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.520
more block posts out there.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.790
But for a larger blawg,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.640
you would want to display a bit more so users find something interesting without needing to

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.750
go to the next page.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.040
You know,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.450
because clicking the next pages and obstacles.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.850
It's a little checkpoint reminding us that we need to go on with our day and stop scrawling

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.850
.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.540
So besides pagination,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.840
there are some other settings for collections lists.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.200
Let's go.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.240
If we have a look at them,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.610
filters are cool and very handy.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.500
For example,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:54.070
we could filter post by author or post created this month more.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.880
We could add extra fields for such filtering in our collection fields.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.150
Then those fields will show up here,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.760
and we would be able to filter items based on that.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.210
So,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.840
for example,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.900
one way you can do is category filter.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.300
So every time we create the block post,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.800
we would have choose a category off the block.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.180
Right?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.920
So we would say,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.460
Maybe this is about cooking.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.900
Maybe this is Spanish cuisine,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.190
Italian cuisine,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.140
French cooking,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.650
whatever.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.840
And then we would have dedicated pages for each category,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.170
right?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.880
So all the block posts about French cooking,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.680
all the block post about Chinese food and on each of this page,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.010
then we would create this filter.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.130
So show on Lee those that are categorized and have a category of French and those that have

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.770
a category of Chinese food and so on similar options applied to sorting.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.580
We can sort the order off post by many different criteria and rose again.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.960
We can create separate pages for different sort orders and then include those links on top

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.550
so users can navigate there.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:04.460
There's one last setting limiting number of items shown.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.280
This is similar to pagination,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.000
although it limits number of items altogether and adds no extra pages to display other

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.230
items of practical example of these would be similar block post suggestions underneath an

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.450
actual block post.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.260
To do this,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.400
we would add another dynamic lists underneath.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.960
We would populated with block posts and then limit items to two or three,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.500
so it only shows a few post suggestions.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.860
That's how simple and powerful this collection list settings can be.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.350
Possibilities are immense.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.200
Wants to enable pagination You get these next and previous buttons to move between the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.830
pages.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.760
As of now,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.710
we're Flow only has thes next previews Buttons.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.600
There will soon loan support for numbering the pages if they haven't already done that.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.980
But this is enough for most cases in the past,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.150
I have used those workarounds because they didn't even have the pagination support at all

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.900
the truly still improving and growing in its capacity.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.760
Don't underestimate the challenge these guys are tackling here.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.400
Until today.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.450
No other website builder has even come close to wet flows capabilities.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.240
So styling is quite easy.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.410
Just select a button,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.550
give it a background color.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:30.250
Change the tax cholera

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:50.150
if at some more spacing

00:04:50.150 --> 00:05:04.850
at some hover effect.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:14.950
Uh uh,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:27.760
Uh huh uh,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.500
I always add hover effects,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.710
two buttons and links.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.890
It's important for users to understand what's an interactive object and what's not,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.420
and hover of fact is the best way to do that.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.540
I was recently reading a biography of Steve Jobs and I read this line when he was saying

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.680
that technology has to make you feel like that.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.510
You condone Omine,

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.040
ate them.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.250
And this so frickin true.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.820
That's why simple minimalistic technology and products are always better than complicated

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.520
products that have bunch of buttons and dials on them.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.140
So whenever you build your websites and design your websites,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.450
never forget usability and never for again well,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.550
how the user is going to interact with it.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.430
So make sure if there's a button.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.560
Make sure the button has a hover effect or some sort of interaction with it so we can

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.390
understand that this thing is clickable right?

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.710
Or if there is a link,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.750
if the link does the link change,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.280
the color,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.850
does it?

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.030
Is there some sort of indicator that this is the link and you can click on this and it's

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.100
gonna take us somewhere and so on?

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.990
It's not that difficult,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.710
but it does take some paying attention and not being lazy because,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.940
you know,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.630
a lot of Web designers are quite lazy,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.430
because if there were,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.190
we're gonna have so many bad websites that drives us crazy sometimes anyway,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.280
back to pagination.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.750
So vector styling our button,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:55.010
we can apply the same class to the previous button.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.980
The class name doesn't make sense,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.450
but I couldn't think off anything that would be better.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.760
Maybe I should use pagination button.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.380
Yeah,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.360
that's a little better Release A.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.990
Like some element off the pagination.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.230
You'll get this extra option in the settings.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.530
This will show the page count,

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.900
which is sometimes a useful thing to display,

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.200
but could style this as well,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.830
if you want it.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.420
But I think this is enough and that's it.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.630
Out block grid is down.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.140
We just need to make it responsive,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.380
and we'll do that in the next video stick around
