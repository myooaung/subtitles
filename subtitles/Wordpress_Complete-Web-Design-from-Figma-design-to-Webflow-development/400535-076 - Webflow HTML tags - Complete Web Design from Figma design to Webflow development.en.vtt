00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.380
Let's start by styling our headline any new tax that we end toe our page by default,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.110
they said in aerial phones,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.440
Wouldn't it be nice if you could somehow give them a default style like make all headlines

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.440
,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.810
Poppins and all paragraph tax roboto So we don't have to style that every time we had a new

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.110
headline on a small one page like this,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.700
that's fine.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.570
Not much work,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.250
but what happens on a large Web size with 20 different pages and even more block posts?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.980
We could,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.380
of course,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.690
you CSS classes.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.480
But there is even better way to go about this.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.060
Remember the selector field?

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.140
You're already familiar with this From here We applied CSS classist or elements by applying

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.510
a class to an object were basically saving the information on styles and properties.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.160
Later,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.600
we can apply the same class to another similar object in the selector filled,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.450
the old seed says,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.050
Select a class or tax.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.750
The stag is what will enable us to set default styles on our text.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.250
So what?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.990
That is attack a tag.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.610
It's part of HTML.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.070
Whereas classes part of CSS,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.170
the tax are exactly what we have.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.940
Bean adding to our page.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.970
Dave Block is a tag name did,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.100
and the handing is a tag name.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.130
H Want and a paragraph.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.190
It's a tag named P inside html.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.270
This is how new elements are being added.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.190
Just text.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.780
It starts by telling the type of the L amenities Dave H.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.420
One p etcetera and right after it.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.340
If there is any CSS class,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.130
apply to it,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.150
then the name off that CSS class.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.860
You see how it says class equals hero section.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.250
That's exactly the class we have created manually and name did that way.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.700
So how do tax help us with setting default styles?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.080
Well,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320
just like we define a set of properties and styles off a class,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.350
we can do exactly saying for a generic HTML tack,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.070
for example,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.870
for the handing.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.330
Instead of applying a class to it and then styling it,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:29.840
we can select all H one tax from here and then style it as we usually do now.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.810
Every time we add a new hatting,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.950
the default style will be applied to it without needing to use classes.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:48.880
And just like classes,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.150
we can make a change on every single instance at once.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:03.610
Besides H one,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.070
we have more heading tax.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.800
Just click on the settings off the handing and you'll see we are all the way down to H six

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.800
.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.600
The use of this different having taxes basically the level H one should be our highest

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.040
level heading style for a secondary heading,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.850
we can use H two and so on.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.910
If you look at our designs and sigma,

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.010
we could definitely define different levels of heading from there.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.080
The heading on the hero section is the larger,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.650
so that can be the H one.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.860
The headline on the section afterwards can be H two and maybe those footer headings can be

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.020
h three our age for so if we wanted to define an age to tag,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.510
we would select it from here and again go to the selector.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.270
This time selector will show us all age two headings instead of a Tron because that's what

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.650
we have selected and we can style all aged attacks across our website.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:06.290
Now,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.880
when we select age to attack on a headline,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.610
the style will be automatically applied as a side note.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.130
Unlike classes tax,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.560
don't keep being selected so moment you're done editing and you exit element this tax

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.850
electoral go away.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.020
So if you do these and come back to the having to edit a little more now,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.370
any new ad it's will create a new class,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.150
and it won't be applied to the attack.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.510
So every time you making you added to the tag,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.970
make sure to sell acted each time until today.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.660
I keep on forgetting about this.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.110
To be able to select attack,

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.620
the class field needs to be empty.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.160
Otherwise,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.710
as you can see,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.650
it doesn't show the option to edit age to tag anymore.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.390
But there is another way to select and added the tag itself.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.660
Even if you have a class apply to the element.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.510
You can do that from here.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.430
These drop down here shows old,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.890
higher level classes and tax that you can directly select and edit.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.880
Blue is for class,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.150
and pink is for tax.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.410
For example,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.190
let's take our heading and making red,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.260
but not the tag,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.110
but just this particular instance.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.750
Off the heading.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.650
As you can see,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.470
the default H one heading is unchanged because we apply the red color using a class not

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.320
using attack.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.840
Now,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.180
if we want to add it.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.920
Our default.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.640
A Tron style off course.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.520
We can do that on the headline below,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.250
but we can also do that on the red one by selecting a higher level tag in the selector.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.650
Any changes that we make now is going to be applied to the default h one style as well,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.850
and you can see this happening in life.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.370
Another thing to point out,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.780
you'll notice the color stylist scratched out.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.090
Why is it scratched out?

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.430
It's basically wept flow,

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.660
telling us that the color property is being overridden by more specific selector.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.840
So classes are more specific sort of flight Children elements and tags are more like parent

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.450
elements.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.630
So classes override tags similar to a Children inheriting stars from the parent until we

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.260
set a specific style on the child element.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.590
Same goes here.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.020
H one tag is a higher level selector,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.850
and it will act as a default style until and more specific class overrides that style.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.260
A good example of this hierarchy is a body attack.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.000
If you look inside the navigator,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.620
you can see that the body is the biggest box where everything else goes inside.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.280
Nothing goes next to the body or in on top of it while you have body,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.550
select and go to the selector and click on body old pages.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.730
Now you can set some certain styles on these body tag that will be passed on to all the

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.760
Children elements.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.750
However,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.800
on Lee for the inheritable properties like textiles,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.770
other properties like sizes,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.170
display borders.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.160
One be inherited.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.440
You can see where Flo has already applied some default font styles.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.850
We can see that because it's highlighted in blue.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.050
What default styles can we set here,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.860
For example,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.500
We know that Roboto is our main boned on paragraphs and everything else besides headaches.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.450
So why not sat roboto here?

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.710
Also,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.450
we can set a default phone size,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.840
color and line height.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.700
This way.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.910
Every new tax we add to our website will begin with these settings and will have much less

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.970
styling to do.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.570
Of course,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.170
we're not stuck with this Values H one and paragraph tax are more specific selectors,

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.150
so they will override the settings.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.130
That's why the paragraph changed when we were editing.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.300
But the heading didn't and classes are even more specific.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.890
Selectors,

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.950
which will override all the other tax beat handing or body attack.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:56.480
Now every new tax element that we add to the page will be in roboto and in great color

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.750
unless having more specific styles.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:11.380
There are other tax weaken style,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.550
but headings and body tag is the most common and most useful.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:21.840
So in our case we have h one tag that we start just like our designs and we have styled the

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.510
body attack according to our paragraph designs.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.240
After styling the body tag,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.420
you'll notice sometimes some tax will change where you don't expect,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.140
for example,

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.500
our navigation links.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.650
They grew in size to match the 18 pixel we set for the body attack,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.480
and if we click on the phone style,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.950
we can see that these values being inherited from the body,

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.150
even though we have a knave ling class apply to it.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.570
Why is this happening?

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.580
Because originally when we styled navigation links,

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.720
we didn't have to change the phone size and line height.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.290
Whatever was set on the body by default was the same phone size we needed at the time.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:56.810
But now,

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.900
because we have changed the phone sites on the body attack,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.050
we get this.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.560
Let's style this navigation links to whatever sizes They are supposed to be 14 pixel for

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:20.150
the phone size and 16 pixel for the line height and thats much better.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.430
So to recap,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.110
we have CSS classes and HTML tax.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.840
HTML Attacks are elements themselves like paragraphs,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.430
headings,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.940
images at cetera,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.390
just like classes.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:38.170
Many HTML tax can be styled to create a general default style for those types of elements,

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.820
like all H one headlines or old paragraphs.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.740
Styling taxes,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.250
a pro habit it sex a lot of time down the line,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.220
and it's efficient and creates a cleaner coat.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.960
Highest level tag Rick and style is the body tag.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.870
If we set a phone style on the body attack and every other tax element across the website,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:01.750
not just the page will inherit that phone from the body tech until we override it with

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.300
other,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.850
more specific tags or classes.
