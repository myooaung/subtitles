00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
before we begin,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.220
just heads up that this tutorial needs a paid plan on Web flow.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.980
In this video,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.280
we're going to learn how to combat custom code inside a workflow website.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.470
Usually this is used to insert 1/3 party plugging,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.050
and you were on our page,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.960
for example,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.910
things like Calendar continents,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.950
appointment booking timers and a lot more.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.870
This time we will install a commenting,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.850
plugging on the block post page.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.600
After these,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.100
you'll pretty much know how to install any other plugging,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.170
although each plug in has their own specifications during installation.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.120
But those specifications are explained by the plug in providers themselves,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.310
usually providing video tutorials.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.170
So once you know what happens on where Flo Side,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.650
it shouldn't be difficult to get yourself around the other plug ins.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.950
The commenting plugging that will be using is called discuss.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.400
For starters,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.050
we need to create an account and discuss and get instructions from there on how to install

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.710
it in on our website.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.310
So go to discuss that.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.680
Come,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.810
that is D.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.850
I ask you,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.550
you ask dot com and click get started,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.650
then sign up.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.880
Next,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.450
you'll get to this gate asking you if you want to install it on the website.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.420
So yeah,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.440
shoes that up next.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:35.380
Some basic citing full like name and category discuss has a free version with ads and paid

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.870
packs without ATS for any website.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.510
In the beginning,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.430
free version is absolutely fine.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.760
That's what I always start with for my clients until there's a big enough traffic to switch

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.710
to the paid version,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.610
which doesn't cost much anyways.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.310
Obviously,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.850
that's for the clients to play,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.550
not us.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.930
Next,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.940
you'll get the screen to choose a platform.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.870
These platforms offer direct integrations,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.610
but wet flow isn't on the list.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.870
Well,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.920
flow doesn't usually have any direct plug and play integrations without their platforms and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.650
plug ins,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.160
where you can just click a few buttons than start using the plug in.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.310
That's expected because weapon is a little different from others.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.680
It's more like coding a website from scratch,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.430
and we can manually install the plug and with a niece.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.550
So scroll down on the bottom off this listen slack manual installation.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.460
We'll get this custom code that needs to be inserted directly on our block post page.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.750
Now let's copy this code and had to Web flow.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:37.750
We're going to add a new D block inside our container

00:02:37.750 --> 00:03:03.450
and from the Elements panel at a new element called Combat.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.120
You will instantly open up the code editor,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.160
so paste your code in here for a lot of plug ins.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.850
That's it.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.900
This is where it ends,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.120
but not for discuss.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.280
There are a couple ad it's we have to make to the code itself.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.870
First,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.090
let's see how it all looks.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.100
Note that custom code and bats Usually you cannot see inside the editor or the preview mode

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.050
on Lee on the published website.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.550
What flow doesn't run the code to make sure it doesn't clash with the designer?

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.250
On the life side,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.620
it's visible fine.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.810
That message box on top is only visible to us because we're admits off the site.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.550
It's asking us if we want to enable reactions on our side,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.650
maybe later.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.370
So that's how it's going to look like,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.750
but not yet fully functional.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.240
Right now,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.910
it's static,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.260
so it's only going to work on these particular page and every other comment that we will

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.470
make on other pages.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.040
It's going to be the same because we haven't really connected this to our CMS Let's go back

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.050
to the code and see what we need to change.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.790
If you double click on them,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.580
Bat Element,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.230
the code editor will open up.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.610
This is a JavaScript code,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.170
and inside the code there are comments that tell us exactly what we need to change first.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.950
Coleman says that we need to replace Page R L and second tells us to replace Page.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.100
Identify where we just need to make those two changes and then uncommon that section in

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.740
JavaScript.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.550
This symbols,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.620
which is slashing the star or two slashes,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.990
create comments.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.870
But that section is part of the code,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.710
so we need to Owen comment it.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.470
Otherwise,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.580
it's not going to run.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.640
It's quite simple.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.710
There are constantly wrapping inside these symbols one in the beginning,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.590
one after that,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.850
if we remove both,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.750
it will turn into functional code.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.750
You'll notice this by color change.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.350
Next we need to replace Page or Al.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.890
The Paige Geralyn needs to be dynamic.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.510
It's the euro off the particular block post.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.380
Since we're doing this on a dynamic page on top of this court editor,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.070
we have this button true and a field similar as we had inside ASIO settings.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.960
If you remember,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.800
one of the options is a slug.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.580
This is what comes after the final slash in the URL.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.230
In our case after block slash,

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.790
we can use that to create a Ural value.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.410
We just need to manually insert everything that comes in front of that slug and then add

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.270
slog right next to it so weapon will insert the rest of the euro automatically.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.950
Just make sure to put this inside single quotes that just how javascript works in this case

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.950
,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:58.350
the page identify our needs to be some unique value that each block post gets assigned.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.990
We can again use lock for this because the slug will always going to be unique for each

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.790
block post.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.440
In this case,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.600
just the slug is enough.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.250
And don't forget to wrap it inside single quotes.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.010
Just final thing to make sure inside the section below.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.790
Check if the euro off your discuss itis correct.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.280
Sometimes depending where you copied this goat from instead of your side name.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.640
It might say example dot discuss that calm.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.280
Darida.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.450
If that's the case,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.430
you'll need to replace that with a short name off your side,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.650
which you can find here inside.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.250
Discuss admin under General Tap.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:43.750
Just copy this and replace the word example with it to create a proper euro.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.170
And that's all published the changes and task.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.950
They're commenting on different block posts,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.890
works only on the life site.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.720
Preview mode is not going to show it.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.700
This was probably the most complicated plugging installation.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.830
Other plug ins are usually simpler than this.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.590
Now that you know how to do this,

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.900
all other plugging should be simple enough.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.950
If you ever get stuck,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.650
ask for help.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.210
On what floor?

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.780
Forums?

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.870
Community there is very helpful.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.670
You can even tag me on your post to get my help to my handle on the forums.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.560
Ease back.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.710
Oh,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.950
underscore shrilly.
