00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.990
What's the first thing your clients is on your profile?

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.000
Or your proposal?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.270
Your profile photo.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.460
They'll make a big decision just by looking at your profile.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.950
Photo.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.230
We all do that.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.370
Let's play a game rate from 1 to 10.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.460
How competent this guy looks like.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.710
No need to analyze.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.050
Just a first feeling from 1 to 10 how likely he is to get the job done.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.300
I'm definitely giving Kim attack.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.250
He's smiling,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.270
his dressed well.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.830
The background is pleasant.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.920
Photo looks professional Now.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.050
How about this guy?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.520
I would say three.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.950
I haven't checked anything else on his profile,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.520
but blood already Looks like he wants to scan me off my money.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.660
That's how powerful photos can be.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.550
You don't have to look handsome or pretty because it's not a beauty contest,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.430
but you have to look trustworthy and competent.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.670
So get a really nice hat shot.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.650
And don't try to save time and go on Facebook profile and grab it something from there

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.920
because most likely on your Facebook profile,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.570
you have photos that you're either,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.040
you know,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.210
looking cool,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.870
looking handsome are looking pretty,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.540
and that's not the criteria to use when getting a nice hat shot and nice profile photo on

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.160
up work.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Because clients are not looking for you to be no handsome or pretty or looking like a cool

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.670
guy.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.890
That's not what they're looking for.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.840
They're looking for a competent person,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.620
so you have to find the photo where you look trustworthy and competence or something,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.300
where you're looking directly into the camera where you're smiling in Ana,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.660
preferably on a plain background.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.610
Now it doesn't have to be a catch up in the studio.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.100
Obviously,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.680
you can be on a background off a sky ride.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.140
You can be on a background of something plain,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.800
something that is not attracting attention and detracting attention from your face.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.140
If you only had one hour to prepare your profile or not pork,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.380
spend 45 minutes on the profile photo in 15 minutes on the rest.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.180
That's how important the profile photos and come on,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.200
it's so easy.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.420
We do have phones today.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.520
Yeah,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.300
you probably have a really good smartphone.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.020
That takes amazing photos.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.810
Just find a really nice ah place.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.970
Dress well,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.130
get a haircut,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.080
maybe trim your beard and ah,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.970
get a nice head shot up.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.220
Work has an identity verification process.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.890
It's simple.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.920
You need to upload your government i d.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.700
And complete a video call with,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.950
um,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.330
once verified,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.980
you'll get this blue batch.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.450
This is an excellent way to increase trust in your profile with very little effort.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.220
Title is what's shown under your name.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.860
What designer is a descent title,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.090
but it's a little boring.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.440
That's what most people do.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.710
So nothing you will stand down with adding some extra punch is gonna go long way,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.570
for example,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.190
Expert,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.120
Web designer or Web design,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.850
pro fast and efficient Web designer.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.590
He tells a little more about you.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.700
Even though it's a self proclaimed title,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.850
it's still stand it out.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.490
Imagine there are two proposals,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.990
one says.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.870
Web designer.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.560
Another one,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.020
says expert Web designer.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.040
You'd be drone a little more towards the expert.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.790
Even better approaches to mention final results.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.660
For example,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.940
stunning website design and build top notch websites hassle free Web design to take you to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.740
stop farther.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.390
You could even mix and match this styles like expert Web designer,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.550
standing powerful websites or Web design pro top notch service.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.400
These are proposals for one of the jobs that I posted and it was a lending page job Now.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.650
How many over these job titles match what I post it?

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.040
Only one.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.400
And even he has the most important keyboard he didn't deep inside the title.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.690
I'm looking for someone who creates lending pages.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.550
How can I tell if you're the right person?

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.410
If there's no mention of lending pages in your title?

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.920
Yes,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.550
Web or present PHP developers can old build landing pages.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.450
But how do I know that I asked for landing page.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.150
You give me what press as an answer.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.870
What the hell is WordPress anyways?

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.750
I'm not a developer,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.640
a Web designer.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.140
If I was,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.710
I would build my own landing page,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.240
not familiar with your technology and lingo.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.380
Probably interpreter who needs a page for something.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.620
And even if I was familiar with the technology and new all the lingo,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.750
I would still want to find somebody who specializes in exactly what I'm asking.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.420
So if I'm asking that I need Teoh get lending page,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.300
not that I would definitely want to go for somebody who is in lynched lending page Expert

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.420
specializes only in lending pages,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.450
So if I want Facebook marketing right,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.590
maybe Facebook ads,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.950
I won't somebody who is a Facebook ad marketer and not a general digital marketer.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.960
This is bananas.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.110
What are they thinking about?

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.050
It's too easy to compete with most of the frill incense on upward.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.400
You can be the best down Web designer out there,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.690
but if you suck it selling,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.550
I'll never get to your portfolio.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.010
Up work has this future called specialized Profiles.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.130
So you have a general profile like a Web designer,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.080
and then you can have a specialized profile like wet flow designer or lending page designer

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.080
.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.440
When you apply for jobs that are looking for weapons designers,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.290
then you can use that specialize,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.350
profile and apply with it.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.250
That's much more effective than just applying as a Web designer and the needing to explain

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.540
in the cover letter that you work in wet floor,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.290
they might never get to reading your cover letter and other information that really sticks

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.970
out from the profiles is the job success score bej Onley.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.160
Four freelancers have that badge from older proposals,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.340
and one has it at 88% which is not better reassuring so instantly.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.350
These three people stand over the crowd,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.820
even though there are 15 proposals very easily.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.950
I was able to filter out most of them just by checking these patch.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.380
To get this badge and up work,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.080
you have to work with at least three different clients,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.310
so there's not a lot you can do about it.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.390
You just have to wait.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.730
But there is something you could dio.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.970
You could bring outside projects to up work to get those minimal requirements as fast as

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.550
possible.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.050
You can find people or businesses in your Net or Canada website and do a project for that,

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.510
and you could give them a large discount,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.110
or maybe even do the website for them in a for a very small symbolic prize in exchange for

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.330
doing it on up work during the whole process and up work and then giving you feedback at

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.750
the end,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.720
kind of win win situation for both of them in the beginning works for you.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.370
You'll get some traction and you'll get this minimum requirements on our pork and plus you

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.450
know they'll get a website for a very cheap price.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.700
Batch can improve your hiring rates significantly so it can be worth the trouble to go

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.160
through this whole process.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.470
If you are struggling to get clients in the beginning.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.310
In case you do consider going through this whole process I have linked in the resource is a

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.350
page from up work on how they calculate this job success score.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.250
Do you read that first so you can understand how it works?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.850
The formula is not shared to fully because it's our poor stretch secrets or it's not

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.650
guaranteed.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.880
When are you going to get it?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.030
But they give a good,

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.360
good guideline on how it works,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.560
so you can understand when to expect to get that batch.
