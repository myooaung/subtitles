00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
most people who try their life with freelance web design failed to get there.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.240
There are three great obstacles that they face,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.170
and one at a time.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.920
Each of this obstacles remove them from their journey.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.780
The great obstacle number one learning to code.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.690
Just take stand too long.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.600
Hundreds of thousands of students and roll on what design courses,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.890
but only 10%.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.650
Barely 10% make it through the end.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.400
I know this because that's what happened to me before I knew how to build websites.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.840
I was just a visual designer.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.090
I was designing the more cops a prototype off our website and I was giving this to my

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.070
client and inclined,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.570
then would give these designs to the Web developer usually award president all of her and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600
that person that would build the whole website.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.580
I realized I was living a lot of money on the table.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.790
If I could also build in our website,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.470
then I would take the whole cake to myself.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.780
So I decided to sign up for some coding classes and courses to learn Web design in terms of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.430
building a website and um started learning HTML and CSS and JavaScript and all that now

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.390
seems that already worked on really projects.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.810
And I know what mike clients real clients ask for in terms of functionality off the website

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.810
,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.850
and often they ask for some complicated and complex custom interactions and animations.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.990
So I looked into that.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
How that could be done with what I already know and how much do I have left to learn.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520
When I looked at the whole picture,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.430
I realized this was how much I have learned so far.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.170
And I thought I had this much left to learn to be able to deliver what my clients usually

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.720
ask for.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.730
But in reality,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.050
that's how much was left.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.060
So I put the whole coding thing aside until some indefinite future date.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.070
But then I bumped into a Web design toe Caldwell flow,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.790
and that changed everything.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.460
I opened it up.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.630
What?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.010
Some video tutorials within few hours on building a full website from scratch with custom

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.830
interactions,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.300
no templates and nothing,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.660
I was blown away.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.610
Love at first sight Wet flow gets rid of the biggest obstacle you will ever face time and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.040
dedication to learn how to code a website with wet flow.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.750
It's faster,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.550
smoother and miles more fun.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.800
You will learn how to build amazing websites without needing to write a single line of code

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.030
and employees in one of those lame dragon drop builders like weeks.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.840
And we believe what floor is a professional toe made for professional Web designers,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.250
not for regular people.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.180
You still need to learn it because you still need to learn how HTML and CSS Borg he's still

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.540
end up generating code.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.550
But West Flow writes it for you.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.380
After some brave students who make through the whole learning process,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.950
there awaits an obstacle.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.420
Number two they can't actually design.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.360
While it is almost all Web design courses,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.230
they're focused on the technical part,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.650
which is the coding html CSS JavaScript on all that.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.370
But the design itself is part of the graphic design field.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.200
Things like color theory,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.350
typography,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.460
photography.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.450
It's more art,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.370
and most of them they never get to learn that crucial scale.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.100
And what do most Web designers do?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.500
They use themes and templates,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.390
and sometimes it's a valley thing to do.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.730
But high paying clients don't want attempt flat side.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.030
They want a beautiful custom design that's going to put them ahead of their competition,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.200
whatever their businesses.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.090
So I'm going to teach you a graphic design.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.700
But on Lee,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.750
what's needed for web so you can learn how to design beautiful and custom websites.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.280
You don't have to be creative or have any prerequisites.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.480
Design is quite simple.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.610
That rules guidelines in a lot of hidden tricks and its finest help.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.770
To create this designs,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.400
we're gonna need to use an interface design tool.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.130
You see,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.130
great websites are not built right away.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.610
First,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.510
Yoon to design a prototype,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.520
sort of like a nun functional,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.770
drawing off the site and then you develop it for that,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.860
we're going to use the bastard on the market,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.880
which is figure MMA.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.750
It's free,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.740
easy to use,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.840
yet powerful,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.790
quite new,

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.880
but already heavily used by companies like Twitter,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.480
uber and Microsoft.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.330
It floors me that many schools and courses they still teach.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.300
Photoshopped for interface design,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.780
which here is a 1998 photo shop,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.070
is such an overkill for interface design.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.190
It's not made for it.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.970
It's a great tool,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.050
nothing against it,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.480
but it's made for photos.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.540
Hence the name Photoshopped website design you want to do with Sigma sketch.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.540
Adobe X'd not Photoshopped.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.170
You'll have design exercises and projects.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.230
You'll design company websites.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.700
You'll design a block.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.290
You'll learn the process or pro designers from writing a project brief tow wire framing to

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.140
designing the final prototype.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.660
In the final third course,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.380
you'll learn how to do successful frequency because,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.670
ah,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.680
lot of Web designers they trip on this final step.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.420
They feel very confused.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.080
They don't know how to price themselves.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.950
They don't know how to write winning proposals,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.480
how to approach clients and how to perform negotiations and all that I will teach you

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.620
secret tips and tricks of Successful for Lansing will show you the mistakes that many

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.470
freelancers make.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.540
You'll get a powerful proposal template that I created for you.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.430
You learn the secret tapes on up work,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.090
the biggest freelancing platform where I started my Web design career.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.790
And lastly,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.350
I'm gonna let you go with a gift and all some portfolio website that I designed and built

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.780
for you.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.680
So the moment you're done with this course,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.930
you're gonna have a shiny,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.020
impressive portfolio side with portfolio work from this course that is already published on

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.380
it.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.280
Most Web designers actually don't have a personal website.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.700
You will have no difficulty impressing your potential clients ombaka shrilly,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.270
and I'll be your guide on this journey.
