00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
in this video,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.930
we're going to build a small part of the hero section on Lee the background image.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.680
And to do so,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.190
we're going to learn a concept that we haven't touched the at in adapt the background

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.620
styles to start with.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.930
Let's create a new project.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.650
Web flows Free Plan on Leah loves to on hosted projects.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.240
And if you already reached their limit,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.340
which you probably did,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.800
you can delayed one of those previous projects,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680
preferably the 1st 1 the simple one.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.090
Because the chat up project,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.650
we might actually use it in one of the future videos.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:39.400
Okay,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.550
we're gonna name these t map and choose a blank template.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.250
As usual,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.450
we start with a box,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.650
which is a did block.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.210
Already used background styles to set a solid color of background feel toe are do blocks.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.260
But that's only one small part off what we can do with background staff.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.060
Just like fig.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.840
Now we can also give Grady and background feels image fails and color overlays all that is

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330
accessible by clicking these.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.670
Plus,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250
I couldn't under backgrounds.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.120
First is the background image.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.430
That's what we're going to be using in this case.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.590
Will come back to this later the next we have linear ingredient,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.470
which works in a similar way.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.140
It's fig mask,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.480
radiant to change the start and colors.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.050
Double click on this markers.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.340
You can set the angle off the Grady into In fig MMA.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.150
We used this stick that can be manually moved around,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.210
but here we have to set the angle by turning this dial or just clicking this rotation

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:59.060
controls or putting the exact degree in this field the next we have radio ingredient in fig

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.270
MMA.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.340
We are able to move the position manually by dragging the handle off the stick,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.730
but in weapon low.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.450
We can do that by changing the position on this map.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.480
In a similar way,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.060
we can change size of the Grady in from these buttons.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.050
They have explanation on how size is determined by who cares,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.550
just Fritsch them around to see what works for you.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.430
The last option is color overlay.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.750
This is mainly used to put a semi transparent color on top of images like what we did in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.180
Fig MMA.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.870
But instead of a Grady in just a solid fell for this door,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.250
we have to add an image as an extra layer in place it underneath the overlay.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:50.090
It was just like you would expect.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.640
Hide Show dragged them around.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.150
Delete.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.400
All right.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.990
In our case,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.470
we need to add a background image.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.050
We need to export the image from our figment file and then uploaded here.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.270
I'm not going to optimize it just yet,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.170
because you'll see that we're going to need to do something else with the image.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.550
First,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:25.000
by default,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.740
you're gonna get this psychedelic background on LSD because the tiling is enabled by

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.370
default.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.120
We need to remove that from here.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.320
Then we need to change the size off the image or we have this tiny image.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.610
We have three size options.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.780
1st 1 is custom that lets us give our image custom values.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.150
But that's not what we want.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.450
Do you want the image to spread and feel the entire space off the box?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.170
For that?

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.360
We need to select cover with cover.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.600
The image will resize and crop so it can fit their full space.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.320
In other words,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.030
it will cover the entire space,

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.990
and with it contained,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.420
the image will resize to make sure that all parts of the image is visible.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.750
So no matter how you change the screen dimensions or the size of the dead block,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.250
the entire May image will always be visible.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.120
This means often there will be empty gaps,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.530
so cover is the best in our case now.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.260
As you can see,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.970
the cover setting is very fluid.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.510
It adjust both the size and the cropping to make the image cover the entire thing.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.270
If it needs to,

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.730
it will stretch the entire image beyond its original size.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.930
When it comes to cropping,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.750
we have a control over on which sided crops that is control under position options.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.950
This position map is great visual way to adjust and see which one works the best.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.310
The default position,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.240
which is top life,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.160
isn't very good.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.790
That laptop that she's looking at is actually important to the story.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.230
Without the laptop in the frame,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.720
we don't know what she's doing.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.150
The image gets confusing.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.330
So given this fact,

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.350
we need to choose a position where laptop shows at all times centering might be better.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.050
This will anchor the image to the center and crop any excess on all four sites.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.380
For now,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.070
it's good when we put the content we might need to adjust,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.980
but we're forgetting one more size.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.850
The preview mode,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.010
which is the widest.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.170
We have to check there,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.730
too.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.340
This might not be visible for you,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.450
but the photo is a little blurry here.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.810
Why?

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.780
Because the image that we have exported is 1440 pixels.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.250
That's the size of our design frame in fig MMA,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.000
so larger screen sizes it will stretch,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.650
and the photo will lose quality.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.320
Right now,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.940
the full with preview that I'm looking at is 1920 pixels,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.310
which is the dimension off my screen.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.430
This is significantly larger than the 1440 so the photo stretches beyond its original size

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.430
.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.400
To fix this issue,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.850
we need to export larger image from Sigma,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.120
and we need to export something that is going to be large enough to cover most of the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.940
screen sizes.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.750
And that's usually 1920 pixels.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.610
There are obviously larger resolutions than that,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.520
but we don't have to go too crazy because that's a very small minority.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.990
And even in those cases,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.540
people who use very large print sizes they don't use their browser for with on their screen

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.350
size so often they will still shrink it and they might be see,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.150
still looking at it on the 1920 pixel size.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.860
Okay,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.750
to export larger size for our image,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.290
we can simply input the with we want in this size setting.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.310
Put 1920 followed by W for width.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.490
And that way we'll export the photo in 1920 pixel.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.780
Why,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.850
when you do this,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.060
make sure that original image that you put here is at least 1920 pixels wide.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.590
Otherwise,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.430
you're just stretching the image like spandex.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.500
And that's the same thing.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.460
What happens in West Flow?

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.350
So it's pointless.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.330
The original image that I placed in think Mom was big eye just shrank it down to position

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.620
it perfectly in the frame.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.140
All right,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.570
now we can compress this image,

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.720
so let's go to image compressor that calm or optimize Illah and it's done a great job

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.170
shrank it quite significantly.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.350
Now we can go back and upload it for our hero section,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:12.740
and that's all.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.340
We have learned how to use background styles inside weapon Oh,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.430
primarily the image setting and how to position it perfectly to make sure it stretches and

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.780
shrink.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.960
His shrinks out very well on many different screen sizes.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.230
I have skipped couple of other rarely use settings inside the background styles,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.310
but by now you already know my teaching style.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.610
I don't like to clutter your brain with things until we actually need them.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.300
We're going to continue with our hero section in the next video,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.210
so stick around.
