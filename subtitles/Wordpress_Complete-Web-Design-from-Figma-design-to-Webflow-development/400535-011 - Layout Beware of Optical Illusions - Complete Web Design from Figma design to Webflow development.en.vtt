00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
between these two horizontal lies,

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.530
just the lions,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.740
not counting their own heads,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.850
which one off this lines is longer,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.610
Just like 8% of the people.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.300
You probably went with the bottom line,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.000
but the truth is that their exact the same length thes sort of optical illusions happen all

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.460
the time.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.120
In design,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.140
you will take two objects,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.410
measure them and see that they are often exact size.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.150
But our eyes tell is that the circle is slightly smaller than the square.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.550
So what do we do in such cases?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.120
Do we go?

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.420
What are ruler says,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.060
Or do we trust our eyes?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.890
Most of the time,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.560
we're going to trust our eyes.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.100
That means if an object appear slightly smaller than its counterpart,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.790
we need to compensate for the optical illusion and increase the size slightly until the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.950
both appear the equal size.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.350
Then we're going to have to objects that appear the same size.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.820
This is more important than their actual pixel sizes because audience isn't going to get

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.960
out the rulers and start measuring.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.980
But if something looks smaller,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.320
they will find it ought.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.360
Illustrations are common graphic elements that you will use in your Web designs.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810
A lot of times these illustrations,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.420
or Aikens,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.920
are going to have very,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.750
uh,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.380
shapes.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.920
It's gonna make equal size.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910
Illustrations look very different from each other.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.300
In this example,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.850
Envelope on the Laughed looks bigger.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.810
It's overpowering the icon on the right when they are supposed to have equal hierarchy.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.370
Although their sizes are identical,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.590
they have both the same height and the same with,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.980
but the envelope has much fuller body compared to that tent.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.650
This is what designers usually referred to as the ways off the object,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.150
and heavier objects will look bigger.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.120
They will look wider or taller,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.080
so we need to manually compensate for the tense,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.260
lighter body by increasing its actual pixel dimensions.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.110
There is no rule on how much to increase.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.650
This has to be done by I increase it until they feel like equal size.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.040
Then you'll get balanced composition that feels aligned with matching sizes.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.950
These tiny little do tell us is what makes the page look like it was designed by an amateur

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.570
or a pro.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.980
Most Web designers and developers who don't have a background in graphic design or anything

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.900
designed related.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.010
They measure things by a ruler.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.850
And what happens is the results come out to be inconsistent and quite clumsy,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.230
declined or user isn't going to notice what is exactly wrong with a page.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.930
They will notice it,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.550
but they won't know what exactly is off with it,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.940
but they will fail that the page isn't quote unquote designed.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.860
Here's another very common optical illusion.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.870
This waas,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.220
one of the very first,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.850
is Unless is that I received from my design mentor.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.440
Whenever we need to put something,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.100
for example,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.210
tax inside of box,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.730
what does one usually do?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.760
Find the exact middle off the container in place there,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.450
element right in the center.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.030
The issue with this is that text feels like it's sinking.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.350
It even feels like space above the Texas larger compared to the space below it,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.970
sinking feeling isn't a good impression for any design.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.650
Instead,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.670
what we want to do is to notch the tax a little towards the top,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.950
so it feels like it's floating to remember easily.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.300
Think of it as a ship sinking ship.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.110
Not good floating ship.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.630
Great.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.510
This doesn't mean you should always nudge it up instead of aligning exactly in the middle.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.480
Sometimes it won't be necessary.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.340
It will depend on the typography,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.750
spacing and so on,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.350
just like all optical illusions.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.280
Either it appears,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.270
or it doesn't no need to fix an illusion if it doesn't exist.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.350
But if you see this sinking,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.800
the fact,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.650
then fix it.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.600
As a matter of fact,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.060
heavier looking objects will feel like they're sinking Mawr,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.420
and lighter objects will tend to feel like they're floating.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.970
It's crazy how accurate this is to a real world.
