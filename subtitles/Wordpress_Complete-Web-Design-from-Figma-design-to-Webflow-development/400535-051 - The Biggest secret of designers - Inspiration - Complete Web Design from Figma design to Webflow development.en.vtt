00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
When Pablo Picasso was looking for an inspiration for his next work,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.300
he got fascinated by African art.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.030
You used Dogan tribe mascots,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.660
his inspiration and launched himself into the Cuba style that he's most celebrated for.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.550
As you can see,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.130
the resemblance is incredible.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.150
His warg It was actually quite different before this period.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.910
Good inspiration can be equally transformational for your work.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.850
Let's say you're working on a project to design a website for a financial company.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.380
Your first instinct might be Teoh.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.140
Go on Google and look for some examples for other finance websites.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.460
But what you get here are data templates that look the same,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.480
and there's nothing inspirational about that.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.520
Why is Google bad place to search for design?

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.320
Inspiration?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.650
Because Google isn't a website that curates good design work.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.910
He has a very different purpose,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.420
and it searches and ah ranks websites in a way to show content that has bean there with

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.260
that has authority that has been there for ages than has been visited by a lot of people.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.320
And that's exactly opposite off what you want in design Inspiration,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.260
A keyword search for finance website inspiration.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.080
Let me to an article that featured websites like this and Article called it innovative and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.200
inspirational website designs.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.590
No wonder it features such data designs when the article is from 2016.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.980
That's way too old for Web design inspiration.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.890
Add to the fact that the mention websites have probably being built a couple of years prior

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.810
to the article.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.190
Also the fact that the author might not be a designer at all,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.970
and you get terrible website examples.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.380
So many beginner designers make this mistake.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.560
They look for one design inspiration in Rome places,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.500
and they start mimicking very outdated or ugly Web design work.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.630
Using quality inspiration for your projects is going to set you off for great design

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.260
results,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.420
and I'm going to teach you my favorite places to find great and beautiful Web design or

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.050
another design inspiration.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.680
One of them is dribble dot com.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.710
That's dribble with three B's.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.950
Let's do that same fence finance website search here.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.750
Here are some of the results up close.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.210
This is Miles a hat off.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.250
What we saw on Google,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.330
the design style layout and Carlos look fresh and modern here,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.400
not nineties.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600
Dribble is basically designer show and tell to contribute.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.820
You have to be invited by an existing members,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.950
so it sort of creates a level of checkpoints to keep the bad work out.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.230
The search algorithm is different from Google to hear one of the sorting parameters his

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.420
number off likes meaning.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.380
How many designers have like the work?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.240
That's a better way to tell good work than a random finance blogger picking sides based on

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.900
his taste menu of this work are just designers playing around.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.690
That means that they haven't even been turned into real websites yet,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.450
and that's an inspiration that is ahead of its time.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.390
After a while,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.070
you start following designers that you like and build a very good,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.260
personalized inspiration for yourself.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.870
You pick designers that have a steam style that you like.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.130
And future design also used these two websites to find my inspiration.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.530
Thes sides curate live websites and landing pages.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.060
If you don't know what a landing page is,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.420
it's a page on a website aware of his talents.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.050
Things can be a home page of our upside or a special dedicated pages used for marketing.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.570
I really like the sides because they are really well curated.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.300
The spring shots are well displayed,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.420
and I'm able to see the live website and check it out in more detail there.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.900
I can't even see phones that they use sizes,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.010
animations and interactions and even see other pages off the site really an excellent place

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.150
to find inspiration.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.840
My third favorite place to look for inspiration is actually Pinterest,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.750
although in Pinterest's you have to be a little more cautious.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.970
It's not curated content by designers.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.170
So just like Google,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.280
you can get quite a bit of bad apples.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.990
But I look for inspiration on Pinterest for one reason.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.040
They have some amazing search algorithm aware.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.750
Whatever image you're looking for,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.150
they can find similar styles with amazing accuracy.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.650
For example,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.510
you find a design star that you like.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.690
Click on this icon and look at that without even be specifying anything.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.410
Its surface designs that are very similar in style.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.720
You see how the examples on the right have wavy,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.590
smooth,

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.610
rounded shapes,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.970
and I just especially in this particular design,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.100
it's so similar starts uncanny here another example for a totally different style this time

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.100
.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.250
No vibrant colors around the shapes,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.600
but more photography having designs.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.990
This is a very powerful tool for a designer.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.730
A lot of times I'll find a specific style that I want,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.550
but I'm not able to see other examples off the same style because I can't put them in wards

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.250
properly.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.820
By coming on Pinterest,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.090
I can find many examples of the same style and collect several different examples for my

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.950
inspiration.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.740
Just like because so one great but a bit advanced way to book for inspiration is to look

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.930
for outside Off the Web design failed,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.460
for example.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.340
I was working on this project that was a charity website,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.340
and I wanted to build something and design something premium and a bit different and not

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.920
looking like other charity websites anywhere.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.170
I looked for inspiration.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.350
All I would get is this very common theme off sad looking African kids.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.290
That just looks very cliche.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.740
Sorry,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.240
kids,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.040
he stand.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.120
I went and looked for movie posters because movie posters are designed.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.890
Amazingly,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.320
they picked a lot of drama and tension.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.300
I found this poster of sick cario and I really like the style.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.680
I was doing this on Pinterest,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.150
which gave me more suggestions that that looks similar and then boom,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.450
these posters showed up.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.810
This gave me more concrete ideas that I could emerge a photo for person with something else

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.810
,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.570
just like Peter Dinklage is phase merging with the background scene.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.840
He's led me to create a hero section that looks nothing like a template charity side.
