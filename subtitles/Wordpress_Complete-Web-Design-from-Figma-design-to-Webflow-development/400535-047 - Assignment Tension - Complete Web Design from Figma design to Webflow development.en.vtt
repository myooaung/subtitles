00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
in this assignment,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.580
you're going to practice tension.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.110
Kneeling down tension method does take some practice,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.950
so I want you to relax and just play around.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.040
Don't worry if you're not too happy with the result,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.040
just have fun with it.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.000
That's how usually attention works out.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.110
You mess around for a while,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.450
and at some 0.1 of the version looks quite all right.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.250
There is one frame in this bigmouth file.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
I want you to design the section in a way that you create some tension in the design as

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.640
ruler to discuss.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.560
There are several ways you can create tension,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.230
for example,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.450
by use of angles.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.250
So how to use angles?

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.420
Well,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.670
remember that classic split screen layout that we usually use for such sections instead of

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.530
having it straight.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
My rectangle so we can make them slant it to add it.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.010
Any shape.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.000
Inside sigma,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650
just double click it or click edit object in the toolbar.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.470
Now you'll get this sort of view.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.750
The points on the corners off the rectangle can be dragged around.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.850
Drag them to your liking to make a slanted fact angle.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.200
When you're done,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.650
click done button in the toolbar or hit Enter.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.570
Don't forget this,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.730
because the screen is now locked in this edit mode off the shape and you won't be able to

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.050
actually click on any other element and do anything else on the page.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.780
I sometimes accidentally double click on shapes like this,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.670
which then puts me into the edit mode,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.010
and I'm not able to actually click on anything else,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.750
and I'm wondering what the hell is going on.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.470
And it's not very evident in pigment that you're in that it mode.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.480
So keep in mind if you're not able to select some element,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.770
just check on the tool part.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.400
If there is this blue button that says Done,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.950
that means you're probably in the edit mode off one of the shapes.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.260
OK,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.280
now we can use the shape as our mask,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.290
just like we usually do with this place.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.050
Greenlee out.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.190
Remember to move the rectangle behind the picture,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.490
and while you have both elements elected klieg mask icon in the toolbar,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.830
now in larger position,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.050
they image inside the mess just the way you want to,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:50.530
and that with few clicks,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.050
we already have a layout with a lot of tension.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.750
You can then change the color of the background if you like,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.650
or change the angle and position of your mask.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:18.210
Another way to create tension is to align an object on the edge.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.020
This you can only do with certain objects.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.540
For example,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.060
you could do this with a headline or some text.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.130
If it's large enough,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.650
doing this with paragraph tax will make it look like it's a mistake.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:55.250
I sometimes use this sort of edge alignment when I'm numbering steps or something like that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.250
.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.760
By the way,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.770
you can forget about the greed in this exercise.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.610
Great intention,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.270
just like reading,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.200
overlapping often go against each other.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.050
So don't worry about the great for this assignment.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.670
Also,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.640
you can create tension using off balance layout or by overlapping some elements,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.290
for example,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.350
overlapping headline with that photo or putting some elements off balance.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.880
All right,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.530
now it's your turn.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.190
You already have enough ideas how to create tension and don't forget to style.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.290
The headline and the tax and the button,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.710
and most importantly,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.480
have fun in this exercise because when it comes to tension and overlapping tricks,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.950
the best war if you're having found and kind of playing with it.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.870
So have fun and play around and see if it works out.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.960
If he doesn't don't feel too bad about it.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.970
It will come with a little bit of practice.
