00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
so that's the slider component.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.860
But that weapon low slider looks very different from our designs.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.980
Arrows are different,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.390
their placement is different,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.010
There are no navigation dots,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.600
and we are seeing multiple collards at once when on the slider element,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.750
we only see one slide at a time.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.840
But not to worry.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.450
We can actually style this lighter in a way to make it look exactly like our designs.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.240
First,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.170
let's add a space between the slider and the headline.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.420
Just like anything else.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.880
We can style the entire slider element,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.960
which again is a good old D block with a bunch of other elements inside.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.490
Select this lighter element.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.550
Give it a class and a top margin of 120 pixels.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.720
And let's get rid of this great background.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.350
It's part of the slider element to go to the background settings and change too transparent

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.350
.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.050
And let's change the collar off the arrow so we can see them.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.290
The Aikens here are text based,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.100
so if we change the text color,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.850
it's going to update the color of the Aiken's.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.170
We don't need those navigation dots,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.350
so let's get rid of it.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.710
But delighting doesn't work.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.490
Where PLO things.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.280
We don't need the slider and do it the whole thing with it.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.300
So there is another way to remove something.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.270
Select display not,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.050
And it's gone from the space time.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.950
Continue floating somewhere in a different dimension.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.080
Next,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.750
we need to build a testimonial cocked.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.860
They should be quite straightforward.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.560
We're going to drop a new did block inside one of the slides and build all the necessary

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.170
parts.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.450
Give it a class off testimonial card,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:58.050
your wife background and the same dimensions as in our designs and round the corners.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.410
Now we're gonna add the box shadow just like in fig MMA to see the settings off the shadow

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.410
,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.090
make sure to select a correct object that has a shadow applied to it.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.190
In my case,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.050
the shadow is on the entire group,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.600
not on the white card itself.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.560
Once you have the correct object selected and you will know this win a box shadow style

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.590
appears in the panel.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.410
Either go to the co tab and select a table view or check the values right from the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.320
properties panel.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.990
If you're using a shadow style like I am here,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.840
you can unlike it from the style,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.330
so you are able to see exactly what's going on inside.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.890
These are all the values we need to re create the shadow inside wet flow Fig Manuel for

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.950
have their own ways of creating a shadow.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.140
Blue is the same value and,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.560
of course,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.040
cholerae.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.570
Same,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:03:05.210
so we can easily match those Sigma has X and why which aren't present in West flow.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.370
These are X and Y offset.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.900
Basically,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.970
how shadow offsets from horizontal and vertical access Our value for AC zero.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.210
It means that the shadow doesn't offset on the horizontal axis.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.820
In other words,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.550
shadow drops on a straight line with down an angle from top towards bottom.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.470
We can define that inside buffalo under the angle.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.450
Property zero offset is as same as 180 degrees angle.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.700
The dot on the round doll shows the position we need so bottom center.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.120
As for why offset?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.000
That's if Shadow distributes from the center or if it's notched upwards or downwards a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.470
little.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.130
In our case,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.540
it is.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.850
It's notched 15 pixel downwards.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.350
Negative value would make it go upwards,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.660
but you never want a shadow that is falling upwards.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.870
It's unnatural,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.410
so that same as distance inside wept flow.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.930
I know this can be a little confusing,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.840
so just take a note or a spring shot off this there is an extra value inside.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.750
Upload the size,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.950
but you can ignore that one.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.250
As you can see,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.680
the card isn't fully visible.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.160
The slider is clipping it.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.750
That's because Slider has some default high to it.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.200
Yes,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.770
it does a hide auto,

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.010
which means it should expand based on its content.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.750
But it doesn't.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.950
That's another case off default values not being true.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.490
So type by hand.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.970
Auto one more time and hit.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.250
Enter there.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.210
Okay,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.060
now for the content.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.150
Insight that card.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.390
We have stars and the paragraph will need to export the star icons from Big Mom export all

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.820
five stars as one.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.150
Group them if it's not a single group for you and export as SPG

00:04:45.150 --> 00:05:22.450
Way

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.070
need to apply patting to the card.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.660
We have 40 pixels on all sides except the top,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.760
which just 60 pixels way Need distance from the stars,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.170
which is 30 pixels,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.360
Uh,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:49.820
and we need the author block export.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.650
These avatars says two x PNG uh,

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:02.150
let's have a new do block and organize all third details inside.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.290
First,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.450
the image thing that to text blocks.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:35.050
Uh uh

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:42.350
uh.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.810
Give it text blocks some class and style of the same way as in fig,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.260
MMA.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:57.550
Uh uh uh.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:17.300
Now we need to move the tax on the side of the avatar.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.430
How can we do that?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.910
Off course.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.910
We could take the usual path off using a flex box,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.980
but we would need an extra box for that,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.710
and it takes more clicks.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.000
A simpler option is to use float.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.690
Remember,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.300
Float under position.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.550
We have dropped down for float and clear.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.470
Open that up.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.770
There are three options.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.290
Non left and right.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.600
Float the eye conservative show what it does.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.820
Select left load.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.520
This will position the image to the left of the text.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.230
And that's all we need to adjust.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.750
Some spacing now for us next to the image.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.320
Then between image and the paragraph,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.750
which is 70 pixels.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:02.680
And finally,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.520
we need to add a little margin on top of the author name in order to center the tax with

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.350
the avatar.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:14.410
Now,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.050
let's duplicate this first line and see what we stand.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:28.260
As you can see,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.640
we're only seeing one slide at a time,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.150
but we want them to display all next to each other as they fit and slide between visible

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.620
and invisible parts.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.740
The reason we're seeing one slight at a time is to do with the with settings off the slide

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.250
element.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.360
It is set to auto,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.350
which means it's going to stretch 100% off its parent container.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.070
If we give it a fixed with,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.940
then it both shrink accordingly.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.050
So let's give it a same with as our testimonial card.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:04.860
If you notice the slide box has shrank now its as wide as the card.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.550
And now let's duplicate it.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:15.560
And there you go.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.760
Now they're aligning just like we want.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.150
Let's add margin on the right to create the separation.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:33.500
Okay,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.650
let's check the preview mode to see where we stand.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.950
We have four slides and they slide exactly the way we want them to.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.580
Except for one thing.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.600
In our design,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.350
the page shows as many cars there are as possible in the rest go off the page.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.210
But here they don't the only show inside the slither competent.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.470
So how can we change that if you select a mask element?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.490
Another D Block,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.090
where all the slides are nested.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.150
You'll notice that inside overflow settings it's set to hidden.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.300
This means all the slides that go off the boundaries off the mask.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.250
They are clipped.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.180
Actually,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.020
everything that goes beyond gets clipped,

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.560
even the shadows on the cards.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.570
If you look closer to show that we simply need to change this divisible and there you go.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.550
Now all the cars are visible,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:28.230
but there is one issue.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.090
They don't cliff.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.120
When the page ants,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.080
they expand the boundaries off the page.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.740
But we already know how to fix this.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.210
Don't way.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.910
We just need to apply the same overflow heat and style to this section,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.630
just like we did with the image off the dashboard.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.170
We even have a class for this.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.500
We don't need to change anything.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.150
Just apply the same class as we already applied in one of the sections.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.170
Excellent.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.240
Let's populate the cards with our content,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.450
and then we'll just have to take care of the arrows and that's it.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:23.110
We didn't create content for more than four testimonials,

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.350
so let's slack off a little this time and just duplicate existing content.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:35.330
There is just one thing we need to fix with the cards.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.220
Right now we have content that is all equal height.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.120
But what if we have testimonials with different lengths?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.010
The car doesn't expend because it has a fixed height.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:56.370
So let's change the high back to order so it expands based on the content in a real project

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:56.370
,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.820
it should try to control the length off testimonials.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.720
This one is fine,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.120
but when the difference between long and short card is really big,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.990
then it doesn't look very nice.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.590
Testimonials can be truncated,

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.110
meaning you can cut them short.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.310
But if your client doesn't want them to be caught,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.050
then perhaps differently,

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.050
out is needed something that stacks vertically.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.450
One such option could be Mason regretted.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.740
Okay,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.850
always looking good.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.180
If we check the responsiveness,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.050
we can see that carts act exactly as we want them to.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.360
The final thing that we need to take care off are the arrows.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:30.800
For that,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.220
we need to learn a new concept,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.550
which we're going to do in the next video stick around
