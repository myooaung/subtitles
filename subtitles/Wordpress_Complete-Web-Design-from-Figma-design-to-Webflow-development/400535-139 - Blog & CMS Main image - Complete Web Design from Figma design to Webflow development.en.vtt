00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670
in this video,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.350
we're going to add the main image and then gain Bind it with the CMS failed.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:19.980
Although this image is wider in our designs is wider than the container for the content,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.420
it's 900 pixels instead of 700.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.280
This means we can put this image inside the same container as a headline.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.070
We need a different container for it.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.070
So we're going to add a new container,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:47.000
give it a new combo class and move the image inside there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.610
There.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950
Now that's about right.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.510
In our designs.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.370
There is a certain high to the image,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.260
which makes it look more pleasing.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.190
And right now it's just growing and shrinking based on the original image that's going to

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.380
create a layout that is not uniform and in some cases,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.370
very odd looking.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.880
For example,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.150
if we upload a big vertical image that's going to fill too much off the page,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.250
pushing the text down,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.910
this is a game the same problem we faced with the author avatar,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.220
similarly adding fixed high dozen work here.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.390
Either we have to use the same solution and use the background image style instead of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.550
regular image.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.940
So let's add a new do block,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.420
give it a class and set a fixed height.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:48.990
And in the dynamic style settings,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.190
get the background image from the CMS.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.380
Don't forget to style the background image properly.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.250
Uh,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:12.120
lastly,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.950
just add a top margin to the image to match the design.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.920
Perfect.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.730
This is now uniformed for any type of whatever the former shape,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.290
off the image or the size,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.360
and it's going to be the same position and dimensions.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.570
It's just gonna look great.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.050
All right,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.850
check the validity and that's it.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.000
Up next,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.030
we'll work on the body.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.690
Stick around.
