00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
And we're back. I'm going to use rounded buttons as well.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.200
You can feel free to remix here if you want to use rectangular buttons.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.370
To make buttons round, just increased corner radius until they are completely round.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.030
For the font, it looks like they are using smaller paragraph tags,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.050
but a thicker style.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.095
Okay, that looks about right.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.735
The second button is what's called a ghost button.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.540
They sort of auto combination is a great approach because

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.614
remember what we talked about in the visual hierarchy.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:06.590
You want to guide your audience visually from one element to another.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.715
If you have two buttons next to each other and use the same style on them,

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.040
the audience won't be able to tell which one is

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.970
the primary button that leads to the primary action of this side.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.350
To create this goes button,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.350
we need to remove the color fill and add a stroke to the shape.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.770
Then change the color of the stroke.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.430
But check the grid. The buttons aren't aligned with the grid,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.660
but that's not a big deal.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.890
Button syntax elements are flexible and they shrink and grow based on the text inside.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.005
So we don't have to squeeze them into a great.

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:45.775
And sometimes it's better not to.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.840
But in this case it's quite close and shrinking buttons a little one hertz,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.700
so I'll snap those bad boys to a grid.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.025
Let's move to our hero shot.

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.080
It's quite an interesting collage.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.295
Do you notice one of the design tricks where you covered the overlapping trick.

00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:16.795
Let's create a similar art.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:21.290
We need to find and add a couple of similar photo shots like those.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.745
All right, This should do some of these images worried, but some don't.

00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:46.960
When you combine images,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.470
always remember the lesson about consistency.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.030
So combine images that are very similar in style,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.920
like these two are similar.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.720
They are not facing the camera or looking at it and the are proportional to each other.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.305
Meaning the photos were taken from a similar distance.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:05.935
You don't want to match these two together.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.895
Looks like they have nothing to do with each other.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:11.000
The right one is looking into the camera facing straight and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.590
she she's much closer to the camera and making her face bigger in size.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.670
I'll write this to look good for preferred options are quite limited generally and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.870
finding the matching style is a little more challenging. So keep that in mind.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.855
Now let's create that dotted background shape.

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.894
Just draw a circle,

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:46.255
choose a leaps from the shapes are just heat 0.

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:50.780
When you draw an ellipse hold Shift to draw a perfect circle.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.110
Then just start duplicating the circles so horizontally and

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.620
vertically to create that sort of dotted grid.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.970
Select them all. Right-click and group selection

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.940
or use the shortcut Control or Command G.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.660
When you position your dots behind the image,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.690
make sure to not have an odd overlap with an image.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.550
See how the dots are neatly sitting around the image.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.695
And try to use equal spacing.

00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:03.090
You don't want to create unnecessary tension by doing something like this.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.610
Now let's find some more cups,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.485
grains for our imaginary product,

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.715
just like the habit here and also something that we can later use down below,

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:24.815
what we're going to do is find some free mockup,

00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:29.855
a good ways to find such resources for sketch which then can be imported into Figma.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:32.750
Of course, we could search for Figma resources directly,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.700
but as this is a relatively new tool,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.440
the resources aren't as plentiful.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.480
Sketchup sources.com is one such place and also sketch repo.com.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.145
Good place. I'm thinking to use some sort of chat or team collaboration application.

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.320
As our product doesn't really matter.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.810
Anything that will fit our designs will do.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.555
I found this one previously, which is pretty good.

00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:55.880
Download and unzip.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.500
Now go to vigorous dashboard and click this Import File link.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.510
And once it's not important in just open up the file.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.100
Now before you import your file,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.485
make sure that you are not trying to import a zip file.

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.890
Because that's how usually most of the resources

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.280
that you download from internet will come in as a zip file.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:27.440
Zip file is just an SIP archive file that is compressed off the original path.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.210
If you tried to import that,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.990
this is going to happen because what do you,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.180
the only file you can import it in Figma,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.205
our sketch files and Figma file.

00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:40.610
So if it's not either of those standards not going to work.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.310
So what you need to do, you need to first

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.210
extract the file from the zip file in Mac, this is pretty easy.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.940
You just double-click on it and it will extract right away.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.455
And you'll get this file here,

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:54.320
which then will say here sketch drawing.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.180
Here, as you can see,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.920
it says zip archive in Windows,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.440
I believe it's you right-click and then there is

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.860
an extract here option or extract all something like that.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.005
Once you extract, you're going to get this.

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:07.610
White thumbnail.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:16.370
And then you double-click on it and it will implored and transform into a Figma file.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.055
And you'll get this green success.

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.620
And then right here,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.110
and then you just double-click on it and it'll open.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.970
And this how you can import any of the Sketch resources inside Figma.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.040
And to be honest,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.285
at this moment, I'm doing an update on this video.

00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:41.510
And actually a lot of Figma resources have been increasing lately.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:50.780
So you might not even need to get sketch files anymore and do explore figma resources,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:58.190
which you can find in my website that I shared a page

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.820
which is macroscale.com slash resources in I

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.540
share there are many different sites that have Figma resources directly.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.835
So you can find different websites that provide free, completely free.

00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:16.205
Do anything you want, big my resources that you can import right away with a link.

00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.110
So when you open this file,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.690
there is one thing also that can happen on my,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.745
in my case, I have a font which is Avenir installed on my computer.

00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:28.070
So it's fine and it's detecting that font.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.515
But for you, you might not have this bond.

00:08:30.515 --> 00:08:32.120
And if you don't have it,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.775
you're gonna get something like this.

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:37.640
You're going to get this banner and it will say

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.160
missing fonts and then you're going to have this yellow warning signs and then know,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.140
you'll get the length right here.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.570
If you're not getting this pop-up,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.105
you might be under right here.

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:52.895
When you click the way missing fonts.

00:08:52.895 --> 00:08:58.895
And what you need to do here is just replace this missing fonts with something.

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:01.370
So you just select whatever is missing.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.530
Select some fun from think my right away.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.710
For example, Roboto. I just do that.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.120
Borrow, do that, and just continue doing that for all of them.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.790
And then click Replace fonts.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.525
If you're not getting this pop-up,

00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:18.125
sometimes there was, there's been some Buxton Big Mama.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.280
It seems like it's been fixed,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.350
but sometimes you're not going to get this pop up.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.985
What do you do is go to this Quick Actions menu

00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:32.720
and look for all layers.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.440
And click Select all texts layers.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.735
And this will select all texts layers on these pages.

00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:44.570
And once all the texts layers are selected,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.520
you can go here in the text,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.290
and then you can click Roboto and click on it and

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.435
all the tax points will be replaced to Roboto in this case, that's it.

00:09:56.435 --> 00:10:00.020
That's how you import a sketch file into Figma,

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.970
is done a pretty good job,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.445
but you'll notice some things are a little off.

00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:08.420
Like these corners seems like it's been messed up a little. But that's okay.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.230
We're just going to grab what we need from here and we can fix those messy parts

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.625
later if we need to save this screen in the Figma file on one of the pages.

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:18.950
If you are going to reuse the same chat screen,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.240
then you can just grab it from there so you don't have to go through the process.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.645
I think this chat bubbles will be nice to use in our hero shot.

00:10:26.645 --> 00:10:31.565
Let's copy it in our document and see how are we going to use them.

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:35.090
I think I'll grab a couple of smaller ones and sprinkle them

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.330
around to create a sort of chat experience between these girls.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.010
I'll use yellow here because I'm going to put it directly on the blue background.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.210
And also change the profile photo.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.990
Hi.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.230
Hi.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.535
That came out quite nice actually.

00:13:58.535 --> 00:14:00.470
And I'm going to add that dashed line.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.745
It's enough like this.

00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:04.190
Too many elements can add to the noise.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.085
One thing I don't like though is the yellow button.

00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:09.020
It was nice and prominent before,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.840
but now that hero art has yellow in it.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.595
The button is fighting for attention and sort of trying to visually connect with the art.

00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:18.920
The shape doesn't help either at the bottom is

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.650
rounded and those message boxes around the two,

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.210
so way too much similarity,

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.460
changing the color to white should fix this issue.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.860
That's much better now the art looks at red and

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.185
the content on the left seems like it's own thing.

00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:39.865
It will sort of merging before.

00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:42.805
Now that our hero art gained a lot of visual importance,

00:14:42.805 --> 00:14:44.845
it's the focal point of the section,

00:14:44.845 --> 00:14:48.430
but a very large headline is fighting for the first place too.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.190
So either we have to increase the headline in making

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.940
Number 1 or make it smaller to give the stage to the art.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.280
It doesn't make sense to make a headline focal

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.920
point because their art is way too interesting.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.960
So headline has to become smaller.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.420
75 looks good.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.940
And increase the line height a little bit.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.640
There, that's much better. The headline is still prominent,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.780
but it's not in the way.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.725
And we have gained more whitespace and given everything more room to breathe.

00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:28.360
If you notice now the buttons look a little too oversized in comparison to the headline.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.320
So we got to fix that.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.580
Decrease the text size

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.085
in buttons as well and make sure to center them.

00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:43.675
Double-check it by eye,

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:46.130
see if it looks centered or not.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.185
Okay, Let's check our grid.

00:15:50.185 --> 00:15:52.360
Usually hero shots are part of

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.725
the background canvas and they don't need to be aligned with the grid.

00:15:55.725 --> 00:16:00.740
But in this case, I'm going to align the edge of the second image to the end of the grid.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.350
The straight line of the picture creates

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.020
a nice edge for me to align it to it with a grid.
