00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
This is Andy Warhol's work because not really a Web designer,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.140
but he's a very influential pop artist.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.080
In these Warrick.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.820
He uses a popular design trick called Repetition.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.910
It's when you take one item that might not be interesting on its own,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.680
but repeated several times.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.850
And now we have something that's more interesting.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.110
This is a page from Zendesk website.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.640
You can see here how repetition off square profiles in the same style has created a very

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.890
interesting layout.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.930
The repetition trick doesn't just apply to identical items.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.930
You can be applied to nearly everything,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.490
like color style spacing layout.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.360
Her petition off color is one that it's used quite often and can really tie the design

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.950
together.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.450
You see how the colors from the headline repeat as background colors from profile pictures

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.450
.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180
If we move below the pictures,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.790
you'll see those colors being repeated in that paragraph as well.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.440
Thes page would look much less appealing and interesting if those clothes were not repeated

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.350
anywhere else.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.780
Do you know it is one more repetition that is happening on this page?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.790
It's in the layout.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.110
Off profile shots,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.600
the position off a person,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.490
how they're edging towards the ride and their names place on the top left corner.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.850
That's a repetition of layout.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.570
I'm actually a little disappointed that esta and deep ash aren't corrupt on the right side

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.570
.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.350
Like the rest,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.950
they are glitch ing the repetition a little Because of that detail,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.000
let's have a look at another layout.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.660
Repetition.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.080
This is very common in Web,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.000
and you'll see it on so many websites.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.180
You see how the layout is being repeated.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.220
An illustration on one side had line and paragraph the line on the other side in as exactly

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.660
out.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.590
That's exactly to the repetition.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.630
Let's apply repetition into practice.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.420
Say,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.220
we've got this content from our client.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.090
It's the benefits off their services because each paragraph,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.030
with their headlines,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.570
are part of the same contacts.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.500
We can create a repetition in their layout.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.050
We can use a split screen layout splitting the screen and exact half.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.770
So on the 1/2 placing the copy and on the other,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.650
placing a full image at some images and repeating colors and it can look quite handsome

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.360
like this have repeated several items here they lay out,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.250
obviously,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.390
the repetition off collars.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.250
I'm sampling colors from the photos and repeating them on how to headlines and final the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.050
repetition off the photographer style.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.280
Old photos are in the same style,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.650
the shot from the top of some item that is laying flat on a colored background.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.550
How about other design concepts?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.550
Can you notice them?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.810
The contrast.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.450
Did I apply in contrast here?

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.580
Definitely.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.710
You'll see the contrast between the headline and the paragraph in their size,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.050
weight and color.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.500
Obviously a huge contras between left and rights plaids,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.390
one being white,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.040
another being bright color.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.440
How about white space?

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.880
There is white space everywhere,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.400
each white block where the copy Seitz has a healthy amount of white space around it to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.650
bring their tension and to the content.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.930
There's even white space within those photos.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.340
Whoever took those photos,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.680
they did a great job there from.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.110
I can sate good source linking the resources.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.240
But the reason why repetition is so powerful in design is because the way we look at the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.150
world as humans,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.700
we tried to recognize patterns on everything that we look at,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.940
and when we recognize a pattern,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.950
our brain goes a little excited.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.760
Luke Luke.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.450
It's the same flu that I saw earlier.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.680
Yeah,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.980
I am.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.140
Smart design is strongly linked to human psychology.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.630
It's not that there are some laws of physics that govern design.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.920
It's completely human centric in reality,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.140
always our designers.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.860
We are the ones who demand this repetition and white space and contrast and all those

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.150
design approaches because we already like them.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.180
You already know what looks good and what looks about.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.280
It's sort of like food.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.590
You already know what tastes good and what taste bad.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.550
You don't have to go to a culinary school,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.020
Teoh.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.220
Learn what?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.710
What tastes good and what not.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.340
And if you learn for your recipes and practice them when you cook something good,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.420
you're going to notice it,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.700
and so will everyone else.
