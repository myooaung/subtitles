Hello and welcome back.

00:05.910 --> 00:10.890
In this lecture we are going to test our sprite She actually works as we intended it to.

00:10.890 --> 00:12.990
This is very much a lean process.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.420
We've made our Sprite sheet.

00:14.520 --> 00:19.860
The next thing before we do anything else is just to make sure that it behaves exactly how we expect

00:19.860 --> 00:20.420
it to.

00:20.580 --> 00:25.950
So this lecture is all about testing your work straightaway rather than just building upon potential

00:25.950 --> 00:26.940
problems.

00:26.940 --> 00:32.850
If you just carried on producing work we'll be searching for a tool that we can you see you guys are

00:32.940 --> 00:36.440
armed with the knowledge and the key words necessary.

00:36.510 --> 00:40.400
The tools that we use in this particular lecture disappears from the web.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.980
These things do happen.

00:42.060 --> 00:48.240
And finally we will use it to test that our spreadsheet that we have made behaves as expected.

00:49.220 --> 00:55.790
Okay so as you can see here we are over on Google and the keywords that I have used are Sprite sheet

00:55.930 --> 00:56.830
animator.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.380
And as you can see a list comes up.

00:59.420 --> 01:02.130
So I have had a look at the top two here.

01:02.210 --> 01:08.240
The first one is nice and basic So we will be using that one the next one down has a few more features

01:08.240 --> 01:09.710
a few more bells and whistles.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.300
So let's go ahead and click on the top one here.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.600
So you end up going to open game art dork which is a great website.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.240
Just to check it out yourselves.

01:18.350 --> 01:24.830
And we have a you are l down at the bottom here which takes us to our sprite's sheet animator.

01:24.830 --> 01:30.470
Now I will make sure that this particular link is also in the resources against this lecture.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.860
You can also just go ahead and click on that.

01:33.260 --> 01:33.650
Okay.

01:33.650 --> 01:37.700
At this point we can go ahead and from our computer choose a file.

01:37.710 --> 01:38.860
Let's go ahead and do that.

01:38.950 --> 01:45.410
Now we can scroll down and I'm going to pick up my bouncy ball Sprite sheet that we made in the last

01:45.410 --> 01:46.200
lecture.

01:46.410 --> 01:50.600
Now as you can see it's not quite right at the moment it's flicking white and it doesn't look as it

01:50.600 --> 01:51.370
should do.

01:51.530 --> 01:54.810
So if we go down we can see we've got a sprite width and height.

01:54.830 --> 02:01.600
Now if you record my particular image was 128 128 So I'm going to have to put that in.

02:01.850 --> 02:08.600
Now there is no padding there's no space around the sprites themselves is exactly 128 128.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.630
That's absolutely fine.

02:10.730 --> 02:14.210
So we can leave all of the sheet padding at zero.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.810
Now the frame count is currently set to four.

02:16.820 --> 02:22.690
And if I recall there were 20 separate frames and the frame time this is in milliseconds.

02:22.690 --> 02:25.200
By the looks of it so this is currently half a second.

02:25.310 --> 02:31.350
If I lower it down to a hundred milliseconds one tenth of a second we get it at 10 frames per second

02:31.360 --> 02:37.040
then we go we can see bouncing down that looks good so far I can increase the zoom level just so I can

02:37.040 --> 02:40.000
see it a bit clearer and you go to see it as well.

02:40.010 --> 02:40.940
So there we go.

02:40.940 --> 02:48.110
Nice quick and easy way of testing your sprite's and making sure that they're working as you would expect

02:48.110 --> 02:48.920
them to.

02:49.680 --> 02:55.440
Okay and it's time for a challenge I'd like you to go ahead and test your Sprite sheets and after you've

02:55.440 --> 03:01.150
done that if you do come across any other utilities that you think that everybody else will enjoy yousee

03:01.170 --> 03:04.770
and perhaps it's something just simple something that will help the workflow.

03:04.830 --> 03:07.510
So you can be more and more productive.

03:07.530 --> 03:09.450
Remember do share with the community.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.160
It would be great to hear about them.

03:11.340 --> 03:15.410
And after you've done this I will see you guys in the next lecture.
