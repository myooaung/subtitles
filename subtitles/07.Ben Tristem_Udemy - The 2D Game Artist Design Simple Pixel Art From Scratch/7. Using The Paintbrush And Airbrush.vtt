00:04.470 --> 00:05.400
Hello and welcome.

00:05.400 --> 00:11.130
And by the end of this section you're going to be able to use a colour palette as well as multiple layers

00:11.370 --> 00:14.920
and make yourself a couple of flames.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.500
Here's a couple of examples that I have made.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.490
And of course I'm sure you guys will come up with something fabulous as well.

00:22.340 --> 00:27.000
Okay welcome to this lecture on the paint brush and the air brush.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.570
We are combining them because they are very very similar in fact they're quite similar to the pencil

00:32.780 --> 00:34.850
although they're closer to one another.

00:34.880 --> 00:41.420
But first of all before we get into those two brush tools themselves just want to highlight the fact

00:41.420 --> 00:44.730
that there are in fact nine brush tools.

00:44.780 --> 00:51.450
So by the end of this lecture itself we will know the pencil because we've done that already.

00:51.470 --> 00:54.590
We will know the paint brush an air brush.

00:54.590 --> 00:59.840
Now the eraser itself that is a type of brush.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.030
We've got an ink tool.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.870
We're not going to cover that this lecture.

01:02.870 --> 01:04.390
We've got a clone tool.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.120
We're also not going to have a look at that.

01:06.230 --> 01:13.270
And then we've got a blur and sharpen a smudged tool and a Dodge and Burn again.

01:13.370 --> 01:16.530
Those are all things we will take a look at later on.

01:16.640 --> 01:22.160
But for this lecture Let's have a look at the paint brush and the airbrush.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.310
So in order to demonstrate these brushes I'm going to have to have an image.

01:27.310 --> 01:31.870
So let's go ahead and create a new image 32 by 32.

01:31.870 --> 01:34.480
And I'm going to zoom in as normal.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.530
Now we're going to start at it actually with the pencil tool just to remind us what that was all about.

01:39.700 --> 01:45.890
And I'm going to set the size of this brush to probably two pixels wide.

01:45.910 --> 01:49.340
Now sometimes I have this difficulty and you will too.

01:49.380 --> 01:52.570
It can be a real pain to try and get the right number at this point.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.930
I might as well have used down arrow would have been quicker.

01:54.970 --> 02:01.000
But what I tend to do is leave the cursor flashing there and use control in a and that's command an

02:01.060 --> 02:04.930
A on a Mac and then I just type in the number I want.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.210
That's much easier than faffing around any other way.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.670
So we have are two by two here.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.190
Let's just draw a squiggly line with our pencil.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.810
Now you can see it's absolute.

02:15.820 --> 02:19.390
It snaps to each individual pixel.

02:19.420 --> 02:21.810
It's called a hard edge.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.400
And in a bit more detail.

02:23.530 --> 02:28.610
Hard edge basically refers to the brush type itself.

02:28.720 --> 02:36.580
We see it's got a hardness between 25 here and going up it treats it as absolutes it treats is black

02:36.610 --> 02:39.560
and white and nothing in-between.

02:39.580 --> 02:45.220
Now if we do the same curve at this time with the paint brush selected we could see the shortcut key

02:45.220 --> 02:51.440
is P very useful if we do the same thing here we get a slightly difference.

02:51.460 --> 02:56.350
If I go back up and down we get a slightly different out put.

02:56.380 --> 03:03.600
Now this is an absolute it's able to colour in-between the pixels and it is fuzzy on the edge.

03:03.610 --> 03:07.700
And of course this will be controlled as well by the brush type.

03:08.620 --> 03:12.820
If I make it harder than it comes out darker first time I'm going to undo that.

03:12.820 --> 03:17.370
So I've got space for my airbrush the air brush is really neat.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.040
But it is somewhat different from the.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.550
Paint brush itself.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.860
Now you might just be looking at this going well.

03:25.870 --> 03:28.910
Aren't they just faded versions of one another.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.100
Kinda.

03:30.190 --> 03:33.320
Now the pencil as I say that is absolute.

03:33.400 --> 03:38.420
But the other two have this feathering of fuzziness to them.

03:38.500 --> 03:44.950
And whilst we're talking about fuzziness and a hard edged tool you may remember back on the eraser that

03:44.950 --> 03:51.790
there was an option in the tool options for hard edge but that option does not exist for these three

03:51.790 --> 03:52.480
brush types.

03:52.480 --> 03:59.500
And the reason for that is if you were to have an airbrush or a paint brush with a hard edge it would

03:59.500 --> 04:05.860
behave exactly the same as a pencil and that would defeat the point of having the pencil tool.

04:05.860 --> 04:11.740
Now in summary with these three tools you will find that the pencil is hard.

04:11.740 --> 04:20.410
This fuzzy nurse is technically called anti-aliasing so it creates non anti-aliasing brush strokes the

04:20.440 --> 04:28.200
paint brush is intermediate is probably it is likely to be the most commonly used of this group of three.

04:28.210 --> 04:32.700
The airbrush however is the most flexible and controller Bowl.

04:32.740 --> 04:37.510
However it does give it a bit more do a bit more of a learning curve to use.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.300
Now let's just clear down our background in order to do that.

04:42.340 --> 04:48.220
I'm going to just hit the delete key and that will clear the background ready for me to draw on it.

04:48.310 --> 04:58.330
Now if I draw a n s again with the paintbrush tool we get a consistent output from our brush.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.790
I'm simply using a mouse.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.670
I'm not using any stylus.

05:02.680 --> 05:07.690
If you do have something precious sensitivity in your using that you may get slightly different results

05:07.720 --> 05:12.530
are just show that really quickly and I think it's still turned on yes it is.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.810
If I go ahead I can change.

05:15.850 --> 05:18.680
Actually that looks exactly the same so ignore me on that one.

05:18.700 --> 05:24.850
That was not a great example but the pressure sensitivity of a stylus can make a big difference.

05:24.850 --> 05:28.460
Now the airbrush itself is ever so slightly different.

05:28.480 --> 05:35.050
If I go and make that shape again initially you could say oh yeah that's just the faded version you've

05:35.050 --> 05:43.510
used a lighter colour grey or change one of the tool options so it's not laying down as much paint.

05:43.510 --> 05:50.130
However if we have a look at the tool options and alternate between the paint brush and the airbrush

05:50.380 --> 05:58.330
pee in a on our keyboard we see that the only thing that changes other than its name are the two entities

05:58.390 --> 06:06.910
at the bottom rate and flow rate as it sounds is how frequently ink is deposited or paint is deposited

06:07.420 --> 06:11.110
and the flow is how much is deposited.

06:11.110 --> 06:16.870
So the best example I can give of this is to turn the flow all the way up and click in hold and we can

06:16.870 --> 06:22.040
see it fills in that group of pixels and I click on hold again and it does the same thing.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.620
Now I've experimented.

06:23.620 --> 06:30.220
If I turn the rate all the way up to 150 It fills in very quickly and obviously there's a lot of flow

06:30.230 --> 06:32.240
there's a lot of paint coming through.

06:32.500 --> 06:37.960
If I tone that down from 150 to maybe 20 I think it was.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.840
You can see it incrementing.

06:42.780 --> 06:46.320
And again one two three four five.

06:46.500 --> 06:50.950
So you can see that it's outputting much slower than it did before.

06:51.120 --> 06:56.220
Now not to say that if you're moving the brush it doesn't deposit more ink it will do if we turn the

06:56.220 --> 06:58.300
flow back down.

06:58.450 --> 07:01.860
Then we have a much lighter line.

07:02.860 --> 07:06.660
So once again let's clear down that I'm going to hit the delete key.

07:06.670 --> 07:09.430
There we go not backspaced by the way but the least.

07:09.490 --> 07:17.230
And let's try out some quick colour picker and straight lines a recap on straight lines so I'm going

07:17.230 --> 07:22.020
to go to my foreground background colour so I can actually use some colours.

07:22.030 --> 07:24.760
I'm going to use the paint brush to lay down my colours.

07:24.760 --> 07:29.390
I'm going to set the size of the brush to eight.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.970
And let's go back to the foreground background colour.

07:33.100 --> 07:40.030
And I'm going to lay down some yellow some red some blue and some green.

07:40.030 --> 07:42.100
Probably why not.

07:42.100 --> 07:47.200
So there we go we've got a series of colours and obviously the white in the background and because we

07:47.200 --> 07:50.420
use the paint brush you can see it's faded those edges.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.520
So it looks.

07:51.730 --> 07:57.580
So it's a more smooth transition between them and you would have had far more control over that and

07:57.580 --> 07:59.920
the amount of fading with the air brush.

07:59.950 --> 08:03.600
And that's where its flexibility can really pay dividends.

08:03.610 --> 08:09.060
So as you're painting you're often already have the colour laid down that you want to use again.

08:09.070 --> 08:15.250
And if you hit the control key the cursor itself will change to a colour picker and you can pick the

08:15.250 --> 08:17.720
colours that are already laid down.

08:17.740 --> 08:24.730
Now you will notice that they will also pick the intermediate colours up as well which is incredibly

08:24.730 --> 08:30.800
useful when youre halfway between two particular colours and you want to reuse that colour.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.270
So I've got this yellow here.

08:32.290 --> 08:36.890
I wanted to fade it a bit more gradually between the red and the yellow.

08:36.910 --> 08:40.230
I could pick an intermediate colour and go along with that.

08:40.240 --> 08:46.570
And again I could do it here and I can find a purple so you can see very quickly how you can generate

08:46.570 --> 08:53.300
more colours from what you already have and have a much smoother transition between those colours.

08:53.320 --> 09:00.370
In fact from the four I laid down I now have one two three four five six seven different colours and

09:00.370 --> 09:06.660
of course the green itself the original green is completely new at this point because I just overpainted

09:06.670 --> 09:08.080
it with the New Green.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.310
Never mind.

09:09.310 --> 09:16.120
And then finally before we get on to the challenge I would like to go through with you a brief overview

09:16.120 --> 09:18.760
of the tool options them selves.

09:18.910 --> 09:25.180
So we have at the very top the tool name itself so we can see we've got the paint brush selected and

09:25.180 --> 09:28.260
then we have further down mode.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.930
Now you will see mode in several places throughout guimpe.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.780
I'm not going to dive into the details of it in this particular section.

09:36.880 --> 09:43.780
As you can see there's lots to go through and we'll get a mode more so when we start dealing with mode

09:43.780 --> 09:45.710
when it comes to lasers.

09:45.730 --> 09:53.080
The next one down is opacity and I like to think this as the strength of the brush enables you to lay

09:53.080 --> 10:00.910
down a lesser amount of green So it's a way of controlling almost if you like the flow of paint coming

10:01.000 --> 10:04.920
out now the brush type itself we can change that about.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.960
And there are loads of different types of brushes.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.340
At the moment we are just dealing with the circular ones.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.910
However there are some other shapes swell feel free to play with that.

10:15.010 --> 10:20.130
But we'll go into more customisable brushes later on in the course.

10:20.350 --> 10:28.090
Next we have some further brush options its size its aspect ratio its angle so the best way of describing

10:28.090 --> 10:32.470
sizes simply how many pixels wide something is.

10:32.470 --> 10:35.380
And that is far too wide to demonstrate anything.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.570
Some with the double click there and go back to eight.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.820
So weve got a nice circle on our screen.

10:39.820 --> 10:46.480
If I change the aspect ratio you will find that it flattens in one direction or if we go back the other

10:46.480 --> 10:53.180
way it will flatten in another direction an angle is simply going to rotate that's between.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.160
There we go.

10:54.340 --> 10:58.480
Different angles so it could be quite useful if it was an angle.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.700
Here we go 45 degrees.

11:00.700 --> 11:08.110
We can now paint at a 45 degree angle that can be useful for some stylized text for example.

11:08.470 --> 11:10.270
Further down we have dynamics.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.320
We're not going to touch that at the moment.

11:12.370 --> 11:16.030
We are using an on off switch at the moment.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.530
In the form of a mouse or a trackpad.

11:19.560 --> 11:23.340
Now that doesn't really have anything in the way of dynamics.

11:23.340 --> 11:27.110
However if we do have a stylus you can change how.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.060
Your stylus reacts by using the dynamics.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.520
And there are some hidden dynamics options there as well.

11:34.520 --> 11:38.360
Finally we've got jitter smooth stroke and incremental.

11:38.390 --> 11:43.160
And again we're not going to have a look at them in this section but we will take a closer look at them

11:43.250 --> 11:46.410
later on and armed with that knowledge.

11:46.490 --> 11:48.310
It's time for a challenge.

11:49.680 --> 11:55.080
Okay and your challenge for this lecture is to create your first game icon.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.680
And we're going to focus on fire.

11:58.520 --> 12:05.710
Use any of the tools we have learned so far and look at reference images of fire to help you out.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.840
In fact there's a good one just in the background.

12:07.850 --> 12:15.110
There's an explosion create four variations and you can either save them as separate files or indeed

12:15.140 --> 12:24.530
just for variations in one file on multiple layers and then share your four designs at 64 by 64.

12:24.530 --> 12:30.600
Of course we're going to be working in 30 to buy 32 for the main image itself.

12:30.710 --> 12:33.410
Pause a video and give that a go.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.090
Okay guys welcome back.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.840
Let's go ahead and create some fire.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.990
Now I'm just going to get rid of that mess.

12:43.990 --> 12:50.200
It's not going to help me at all discard the changes I'm going to create a new file and whips in hyatt's

12:50.200 --> 12:55.840
file I'm gonna open up the advanced options here and with the background colour I'm going to fill this

12:55.960 --> 12:58.860
in the background colours currently white.

12:58.870 --> 13:05.120
I want it to be black so let's hit the over these foreground and background colours.

13:05.200 --> 13:05.910
Excellent.

13:05.950 --> 13:14.740
Let's go to file new 32 by first to remember that and then foreground colour for the foreground is currently

13:14.740 --> 13:15.520
black.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.360
Chelsea of JS zoomed in.

13:17.470 --> 13:23.560
Now I've rotate my brush ever so slightly so I'm going to go back in and put my aspect ratio back at

13:23.590 --> 13:27.420
zero and my angle back says zero.

13:27.460 --> 13:34.870
So those two are right and I can start using this right so I have a palette that I created earlier for

13:34.870 --> 13:35.600
fire.

13:35.740 --> 13:38.680
Or indeed there is one called Fire code as well.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.290
Look at all of those.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.920
I think I'm going to use.

13:41.950 --> 13:46.810
I'm going to use my one I'm going to go for the challenge of using the one that I made earlier just

13:46.810 --> 13:49.940
to see if that is really going to work.

13:50.010 --> 13:55.810
Now let's go for foreground background colour and I've also got my black and white as well but I can

13:55.810 --> 13:56.450
pick from.

13:56.590 --> 14:00.410
So I'm going to start at the centre and I'm going to work.

14:01.930 --> 14:02.200
Yeah.

14:02.230 --> 14:03.250
That's fine.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.190
Flip those around so I can use it.

14:05.380 --> 14:08.780
So I'm going to work on the outline to begin with.

14:10.830 --> 14:11.600
Eric go.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.770
I'm using the paint brush to a wood here.

14:14.570 --> 14:17.830
And I'm going to have to have it a bit smaller than eights.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.180
Let's go for four.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.510
And of course I'm likely to need it a bit smaller afterwards as well.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.340
So there we go there's my initial flame.

14:29.630 --> 14:35.900
And we need a bit more colour in it now says go ahead and let's create in fact I'm going to need an

14:35.900 --> 14:38.930
even smaller brush size at this point.

14:38.930 --> 14:44.360
So and again don't be afraid to adjust your brush size try things out go backwards and forwards I'm

14:44.360 --> 14:49.190
going to try to airbrush at this point because I don't want to lay down so much in such quick succession.

14:49.190 --> 14:56.720
I'm going to increase my rate and decrease my flow so I can whisk across the surface.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.380
There we go.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.650
That's looking good looking.

15:00.970 --> 15:03.250
Kind of like a potion bottle at the moment.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.130
What would be a yellow potion.

15:05.290 --> 15:12.210
So amazing as your are made that far too far too dark in the middle.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.770
Let's lighten it up.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.670
That's starting to look better now.

15:18.700 --> 15:24.370
Let's go back to my palate and select something darker and keep going round and round.

15:24.520 --> 15:32.890
Now I'm going to just play with this now going to set a cap a limit of around probably five to 10 minutes

15:32.920 --> 15:33.940
but no more.

15:34.090 --> 15:39.510
And see what I'm going to be coming up with and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.080
Okay guys.

15:49.080 --> 15:49.950
Welcome back.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.660
I am liking what I've got here.

15:52.680 --> 15:56.260
I'm just going to go ahead and open the other ones that I've worked on.

15:56.400 --> 16:02.520
Now I did not use lasers for this particular one but I did use layers for these others.

16:02.550 --> 16:11.490
So just go ahead and make sure I save my work out Shall I call this I call it fire one.

16:13.210 --> 16:16.320
And I'm going to have a look at the other ones that I've made here.

16:17.390 --> 16:20.430
See Fire example one two and three.

16:20.770 --> 16:22.340
So let's bring that one up.

16:22.340 --> 16:30.130
This one bit more intense a bit more jagged a bit more exciting perhaps say a more fearsome flame.

16:30.470 --> 16:33.080
Let's go and see what else we've got here.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.150
Fire example.

16:35.150 --> 16:35.950
That was three.

16:35.990 --> 16:36.940
This one.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.110
Well it looks exactly the same.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.130
It's not these ones are on layers.

16:43.220 --> 16:47.640
So you've got a a bolt or a meteorite or something along those lines.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.540
But it's still flame like.

16:49.550 --> 16:54.890
And finally I have this one it's a bit bigger similar to the first one.

16:54.890 --> 16:55.760
It's very exciting.

16:55.760 --> 17:00.770
And look we can bind them together to have an awesome flame on top.

17:00.950 --> 17:01.700
So there we go.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.460
Those are my four designs.

17:03.470 --> 17:06.250
I'm going to go ahead now and upload those to the forum.

17:06.470 --> 17:08.980
Hope you guys have come up with some amazing stuff.

17:08.990 --> 17:10.670
Looking forward to seeing it.

17:10.670 --> 17:15.370
Remember to share so I and the other students can see what you guys have been up to.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.320
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
