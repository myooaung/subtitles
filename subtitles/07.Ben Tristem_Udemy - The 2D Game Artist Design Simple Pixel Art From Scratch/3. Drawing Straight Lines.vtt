00:04.060 --> 00:10.090
Hey guys so in this lecture we are going to focus on being able to draw straight lines.

00:10.210 --> 00:17.200
And that means we can make geometric patterns like this one in front of us here if we wanted to as well

00:17.230 --> 00:20.440
as just an ordinary straight line too.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.490
Okay so we're back over in game.

00:22.510 --> 00:29.350
And this is going to be a really straightforward one to start you off in Section 2.

00:29.350 --> 00:36.340
Let's go ahead and create a new file and go file new and the width of our image in the height.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.760
Make sure you got it set to 32 and 32.

00:39.850 --> 00:45.070
That's going to be our dimensions of the canvas and the image that we're going to be working with during

00:45.070 --> 00:46.000
this section.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.860
Now I have clocked in the corner of my eye that the background colour is currently black so when I click

00:53.890 --> 00:57.270
okay it will be black unless I go to Advanced Options.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.520
And then we have some more options.

00:59.650 --> 01:05.860
So we're going to fill with the background colour foreground colour white or transparency.

01:05.860 --> 01:09.530
So those will come up again later on when we're talking about layers.

01:09.610 --> 01:13.900
But in this particular case I I actually want to start with a black background.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.070
Why not let's be a little bit different.

01:16.090 --> 01:17.190
Let's zoom into that.

01:17.190 --> 01:20.120
I'm going to use control in the mouse wheel to zoom in.

01:20.230 --> 01:26.850
If you've got a touch capable screen you can touch and pinch to zoom and you can do the same on a track

01:26.870 --> 01:29.070
pad as we go in.

01:29.080 --> 01:34.570
And of course the good old favourite control shift in J to fill the workspace with the image.

01:34.570 --> 01:37.450
Now let's go ahead and imagine this was a blackboard.

01:37.450 --> 01:40.150
We want to create a straight line.

01:40.150 --> 01:42.750
Now the way to do this is a little nuanced.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.830
It's pretty straightforward.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.340
But there is a certain order you need to do things in.

01:46.390 --> 01:51.040
The first thing you need to do is place your starting pixel before you do anything else.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.870
Now I've got the pencil tool selected and the foreground colour is white.

01:54.910 --> 01:55.910
So let's go ahead.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.160
Click.

01:57.190 --> 02:04.380
Now we can press the shift key and then a line will appear between this starting pixel.

02:04.390 --> 02:07.390
And wherever we choose the ending pixel to be.

02:07.420 --> 02:11.000
So if I can put a straight line just there.

02:11.110 --> 02:17.770
Now another thing you can do when you're actually placing that straight line is change it by 15 degree

02:17.860 --> 02:21.700
increments by default by a once again starting.

02:21.790 --> 02:27.760
If I just hold down Shift again it'll go from the end point if I want to start again from this location

02:27.760 --> 02:29.400
where we started the other one from.

02:29.470 --> 02:35.920
I'm going to have to click first then hold down Shift and then we can find where the end point that

02:35.920 --> 02:37.080
we want.

02:37.090 --> 02:45.430
Now if I hold down control after I've done that you'll notice that that line skips in 15 degree increments

02:45.490 --> 02:53.460
all the way around a 360 degree arc so I can say that this is going to be 45 degrees.

02:53.530 --> 02:55.610
And isn't that a lot quicker than going.

02:55.620 --> 02:58.920
One two three four.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.260
When you get the point I'm sure.

03:01.300 --> 03:07.750
And then from here I can do control shift sorry I'm in control and then line up with that we can start

03:07.750 --> 03:09.470
building things up very quickly.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.530
Now when we were at eight by eight it didn't really matter is very quick to fill up.

03:14.550 --> 03:21.520
Now if we've got a thousand and twenty four pixels available to us rather than 64 so there's a huge

03:21.520 --> 03:24.070
amount more we can do this space.

03:24.070 --> 03:29.710
And of course I can now join this pixel at the top up by hoenn down shift and clicking down there.

03:30.270 --> 03:37.520
Now this is a great tool and it works with most of the available tools so when we start using the eraser

03:37.770 --> 03:41.340
the airbrush the paint brush etc etc..

03:41.460 --> 03:48.210
You can use these with this technique as well so it's not just drawing straight lines because you can

03:48.210 --> 03:50.930
use it for straight erasing too.

03:51.610 --> 03:55.880
And of course that leads us nicely on to earth challenge for you guys.

03:55.930 --> 04:03.790
So start with a 32 by 30 to canvas create a geometric pattern and I'll show you a couple of examples

04:03.790 --> 04:08.440
in a moment and export your work at 64 by 64 and share.

04:08.440 --> 04:14.980
Take care not to overwrite your work you were only doing the onesie might want to say save your work

04:15.200 --> 04:18.510
scale it exports it and clothes.

04:19.030 --> 04:25.600
And here are a couple examples using straight line tool that I have quickly knocked up.

04:25.630 --> 04:26.670
Quite cool eh.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.450
Let's see what you guys can do.

04:28.450 --> 04:30.980
Pause a video now and give it a go.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.060
Okay guys.

04:34.070 --> 04:35.060
Welcome back.

04:35.060 --> 04:38.140
Let's go ahead and create a geometric pattern.

04:38.480 --> 04:44.450
Okay let's go ahead now and do this challenge so I want a geometric shape I'm not quite sure what I'm

04:44.450 --> 04:45.980
going to go for yet.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.640
Now remember because this is 32 by 32.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.660
We have more space.

04:49.670 --> 04:53.810
But there is no centerpointe horizontally or vertically.

04:53.810 --> 05:00.230
Of course we can do a slight offset to solve that and effectively only draw over thirty one of the pixels.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.540
If we wanted that is an option.

05:02.540 --> 05:07.200
So here we have this sort of triangle thing that we've got going on here.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.770
I'm not interested in that.

05:08.810 --> 05:15.520
I'm going to go and undo those lines using control and Z because it's available to me.

05:15.530 --> 05:16.510
There we go.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.250
And let's go ahead and make something funky.

05:19.250 --> 05:26.330
I'm going to go from one corner to another and then from this corner to that and again it's is entirely

05:26.390 --> 05:32.540
up to you how you decide to do this and then you go from there to here then from here to here is starting

05:32.540 --> 05:38.930
to look more like a flag that's going to hold down control to make sure that's locked at 45 degrees

05:39.140 --> 05:41.070
which is which is great.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.460
And what it are.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.770
But this one was an ad down.

05:44.980 --> 05:46.620
So let's go back again.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.080
This is the advantage of that control.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.460
I wouldn't have mucked that up if I I'd known.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.020
So that's that dumb.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.480
Now I need to align these Some are going to click here and go all the way down.

05:58.490 --> 06:02.440
This is another great use of this tool but I'm not going to click to make a straight line down.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.040
That was it.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.620
I'll just use it for alignment and now I'm going to click.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.450
And use that to make the rest of my geometry.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.510
So I'm starting to like what's going on here.

06:14.640 --> 06:20.180
I'm going to continue play with my geometry for a bit and I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

06:21.730 --> 06:22.320
Okay.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.020
Here we go.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.920
I'm just finishing off my geometric shape.

06:25.930 --> 06:27.620
That's what I'm doing at the moment.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.820
This is actually making my eyes go funny.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.920
It's really weird as I am scanning across it.

06:33.040 --> 06:39.730
I've created a kind of an optical illusion it looks like the stairs or the zigzags are oscillating so

06:39.850 --> 06:42.100
I can't focus on that any more.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.780
How did you guys get on.

06:43.780 --> 06:47.500
What did you come up with for your geometric pattern.

06:47.560 --> 06:52.580
Please share your work in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
