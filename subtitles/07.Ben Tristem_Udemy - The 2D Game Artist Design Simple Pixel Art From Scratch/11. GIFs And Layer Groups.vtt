WEBVTT

00:04.540 --> 00:07.080
Everyone welcome back in this lecture.

00:07.080 --> 00:14.220
We are going to go over a problem you are going to experience if you try and export your work as an

00:14.310 --> 00:16.360
animated gif.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.590
There is a problem when you use labour groups.

00:19.740 --> 00:21.480
Gimped just cannot handle it.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.010
And so you have to do a bit of manual work.

00:24.060 --> 00:29.820
So let's go ahead here and create a lay a group just for example can I put a background in it.

00:30.620 --> 00:35.270
And then go ahead and create another layer as we would do eyebrows.

00:35.270 --> 00:35.810
That's fine.

00:35.810 --> 00:42.740
We can call them eyebrows and let's zoom into our work and draw a couple of eyebrows on the background

00:42.770 --> 00:45.630
let's say we were just animating the eyebrows themselves.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.970
There's our smiley face that we're doing.

00:47.990 --> 00:49.510
We've got this layer here.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.100
Now I can then go ahead and let's do it properly.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.270
Let's name this frame.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.470
Hash one.

00:58.510 --> 01:02.020
And then when I duplicate I'll get the necessary frames.

01:02.110 --> 01:04.110
Now there's nothing moving here.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.270
But that's not the issue.

01:06.280 --> 01:12.940
You're going to experience if we go ahead and try and export this as a test animation it's fine in this

01:12.940 --> 01:13.270
case.

01:13.270 --> 01:16.830
I'm going to go ahead and export now oh look like it.

01:16.830 --> 01:18.960
Everything's working as you'd want it to.

01:18.970 --> 01:24.820
However you go ahead and click export you'll get an error message like this cannot save the r.g. BE

01:24.820 --> 01:28.900
colour images convert index colour or greyscale first.

01:28.930 --> 01:37.030
This is a little bit of an issue it's caused by an gimped trying to blend those layer groups together

01:37.060 --> 01:40.140
before exporting as a frame.

01:40.270 --> 01:46.300
The quickest way of solving this or one of the ways of solving this is going in and right clicking on

01:46.300 --> 01:53.170
the frame and merging the layer group you can flatten that layer group down into a single frame.

01:53.170 --> 01:59.230
This can be a little arduous of course with many many frames so I would recommend saving your work first

01:59.260 --> 02:05.800
then saving another copy with perhaps flattened on the end of it followed by then doing this procedure

02:06.040 --> 02:15.820
so that you don't suffer any risk of losing your data or losing this deliberate separation of your items

02:15.880 --> 02:18.430
so that you can manipulate your image easily.

02:18.490 --> 02:25.660
If you get rid of this if you compress it down by making it sending it all to one layer it make it a

02:25.660 --> 02:32.960
lot harder to edit in the future and we want to avoid any situations that puts us at a disadvantage.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.200
Another option that you can do at this point is to go to the image menu.

02:38.230 --> 02:44.830
Go down to mode and you'll see there's an option for greyscale and that was one of the options in our

02:45.280 --> 02:46.570
error message that we had.

02:46.690 --> 02:52.210
Now if you've got a black and white or grey scale animation that's absolutely fine but that's not really

02:52.210 --> 02:58.330
an option would it is for me in this case if I was to go ahead and make this smiley face because it's

02:58.330 --> 02:59.920
just black and white at the moment.

02:59.920 --> 03:00.780
That's fine.

03:00.790 --> 03:07.570
However if you have got colour in their indexes greyed out unfortunately so we can't use that.

03:07.720 --> 03:13.840
So we're stuck with even doing greyscale which might not be ideal or of course we can go through and

03:14.020 --> 03:20.070
update each one of these by right clicking as I said and merging the layer group.

03:20.110 --> 03:27.070
Now this being said it's only really necessary if you're exporting as an animated gif for the purposes

03:27.130 --> 03:32.440
of working in GIMP and perhaps making a sprite sheet later on you won't have to do that.

03:32.440 --> 03:38.410
And if you can get away with go into animation and play back for your testing and when the animation

03:38.410 --> 03:41.180
playback window comes up we go ahead and click play here.

03:41.190 --> 03:44.120
Now obviously these are all going to be the same things that haven't changed anything.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.240
But if that's enough to prove your animation great.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.880
No other action required.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.790
However if you do want to share as an animated gif like the challenge asks you to then of course you

03:54.790 --> 03:59.200
will just have to bear that in mind and flatten it down to share it with us.

03:59.200 --> 04:05.710
So with that out of the way it's time for a challenge and the challenge is going to be is to pick one

04:05.710 --> 04:11.140
of the following so even the fire the bouncy ball the jumping the water splash the door opening all

04:11.140 --> 04:12.170
the frown to grin.

04:12.190 --> 04:15.090
I'm going to choose the frown to grin myself.

04:15.370 --> 04:19.060
So you're going to go ahead now and pick one of those and have a mate.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.750
It's now two seconds long.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.880
At five to 10 frames per second.

04:24.880 --> 04:31.060
Now the reason why there's a band there is you can have it running at five frames per second and it

04:31.060 --> 04:33.600
gets the job done is a great starting point.

04:33.700 --> 04:39.370
If you want to refine the nuances between the animation so it's a smoother animation.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.380
Go for the 10 frames per second.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.530
Now the difference here of course is quite stark.

04:43.530 --> 04:49.960
One's going to mean you have 10 individual images of the five frames per second whereas 10 frames per

04:49.960 --> 04:53.920
second is going to result in 20 separate images.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.860
And that might be a bit much if you're up for the challenge.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.040
Do go for it.

04:58.090 --> 05:04.990
Just remember that when you export as an animated gif you can pick unspecified frames and set it to

05:05.020 --> 05:10.670
either 200 milliseconds or 100 for five and 10 frames per seconds respectively.

05:11.080 --> 05:19.390
Finally just a word of caution no larger than 128 by 128 pixels in the animated layer that you decide

05:19.390 --> 05:20.120
to work on.

05:20.140 --> 05:25.090
It can be a lot smaller than that but this is really the maximum kambiz size and it's more for your

05:25.090 --> 05:27.800
own sanity than anything else.

05:27.820 --> 05:31.290
With that in mind pause video now and give that a go.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.280
Okay get looted a little love.

05:36.930 --> 05:38.370
Okay everyone welcome back.

05:38.370 --> 05:41.700
Let's go ahead now and I'm going to make my frown to grin.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.000
See you overing him.

05:44.150 --> 05:44.450
Right.

05:44.460 --> 05:48.240
So now that we're back overing gimp I'm going to go ahead and make myself a new image.

05:48.240 --> 05:57.600
I'm going to make mine 64 by 64 and I'm going to go through the method of creating a face by making

05:57.600 --> 05:59.250
a big blob and then a small blob.

05:59.250 --> 06:01.700
I could do the selection by fancy doing this this time.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.030
So 60 there.

06:03.070 --> 06:06.660
Oh give us a nice position or I've not got my pencil tool.

06:06.660 --> 06:07.670
There we go.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.360
And I'll be able to centre that face pretty well.

06:13.500 --> 06:18.960
Okay I'm going to change the foreground colour to white and then I think if I go for 58 I'll be able

06:18.960 --> 06:22.350
to put a blob in the middle with a nice border around it.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.040
There we go.

06:23.070 --> 06:27.390
Now of course you could go down the route of using the Ellipse select all and going down the border

06:27.390 --> 06:29.160
route entirely up to you.

06:29.160 --> 06:34.170
So I have a circle for my face and that's going to be the background there.

06:34.350 --> 06:41.090
I know I'm gonna need a layer groups of them to create that now as well and call it frame hash one.

06:41.220 --> 06:45.450
Then when I duplicate that frame I can just reuse it.

06:45.480 --> 06:51.510
Now what parts of the face is static and what is not something I can repeat.

06:51.510 --> 06:55.260
And I'm going to add this to the background just to keep things simple I don't want too many layers

06:55.260 --> 06:58.840
at this point in time and I must set my pixel depth.

06:58.860 --> 07:04.710
Sue let's and all pixel size down to 1 am going to draw the nose just here.

07:04.970 --> 07:08.340
It's not drawing lines in a room because it's selected Tom White.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.440
Silly me no.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.020
Ever so there's a nose.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.990
And I'm going from a smile to a frown.

07:14.190 --> 07:18.480
So in that case I'm going to need a layer that changes.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.800
Perhaps the mouth and then the eyebrows.

07:20.820 --> 07:24.600
So the eyes themselves are going to be the same.

07:24.600 --> 07:31.590
So in this particular case a 64 were 64 I think a size 22 note as far too big lets go for a size of

07:31.600 --> 07:33.780
maybe 14.

07:33.970 --> 07:34.560
Yeah that's good.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.070
Better size with the eyes I'm going to go blob and Blob.

07:38.130 --> 07:41.050
So the eyes themselves are not going to change.

07:41.190 --> 07:43.500
Then finally reduce that down to 12.

07:43.590 --> 07:47.350
Flip round my foreground and background colours.

07:47.370 --> 07:48.270
And there we go.

07:48.270 --> 07:52.260
Pretty much got the eyes done apart from the middle of them.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.400
What shall we do for the middle.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.060
Probably not too if I do too.

07:56.070 --> 07:58.300
They'll end up with a cross.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.140
No go.

07:59.340 --> 08:04.300
So there we go we've got a basic smile while not a smiling face as we've not got anything on it yet

08:04.620 --> 08:08.600
but now we've got the base layer done we can go ahead and create a new layer.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.840
I'm going to do the mouth and the eyebrows separately.

08:12.180 --> 08:15.870
Now thinking about it and practicing this before going ahead.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.460
Hindsight's a wonderful thing.

08:17.460 --> 08:18.950
I'm only going to use.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.880
Eyebrows are not going to model each one individually.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.150
They're going to be moving together.

08:23.150 --> 08:26.930
It doesn't matter if there is a change.

08:26.940 --> 08:32.850
Now one of the things I'm going to do again I've learned this as I was going through with this the best

08:32.850 --> 08:40.050
way of handling this particular animation type is to hide the background layer for the next one so if

08:40.050 --> 08:44.160
I go ahead and duplicate frame one everything's in place ready.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.130
That's the structure that I'm going to be working to.

08:47.190 --> 08:50.070
So I've got Let's put a mouth on.

08:50.160 --> 08:56.730
Let's set it down at one pixel so I can draw a mouth and it will just be a rough mouth at this time.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.400
Now I can't see it because that layers off.

08:59.430 --> 09:03.050
So it's going from a frown so that's draw a frown and it is there.

09:03.060 --> 09:07.220
Let's just turn those layers off so I can see what's going on.

09:07.230 --> 09:08.690
I'm going to clear the lay eggs.

09:08.700 --> 09:13.130
I've made a mistake with the delete key and then draw all the upside down mouth.

09:13.140 --> 09:13.560
There we go.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.680
So that's the frown for the mouth and the eyebrows.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.690
Well he's not going to look very happy he's going to look something along those lines.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.120
So that's the basic starting point.

09:24.120 --> 09:30.930
Now I can go ahead enable my next layer and you can see that I can no longer see the eyebrows or mouth.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.580
Now I can play about although pacitti we know that.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.410
And I could for instance hide background one that's another way of doing it.

09:37.560 --> 09:44.370
And this is a great starting point because now I can go ahead and jupe Tape frame to whilst it's in

09:44.370 --> 09:47.700
this state come back down to frame.

09:47.910 --> 09:54.390
So yeah that's made frame three come back down to frame two and put the new eyebrows in say they look

09:54.390 --> 09:58.430
a bit like that and the mouth is a bit more neutral.

09:58.620 --> 09:59.810
Something along those lines.

09:59.850 --> 10:06.210
And then finally I can check fat by just toggling background one on and off and I can say Well I think

10:06.210 --> 10:13.020
that the mouth raises up just a little bit too high on this side so I go in hard edged my eraser come

10:13.020 --> 10:17.070
back with the pencil tool and again I'm not using a stylus or anything like that for this.

10:17.240 --> 10:21.480
I'm literally just using my mouse or trackpad depending on how I'm feeling.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.690
So that is that framed.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.510
I'm happy with that I can cross check it again.

10:26.610 --> 10:27.950
Yep that's good.

10:27.960 --> 10:32.590
And now I can go up to frame three before I do anything on frame 3.

10:32.760 --> 10:37.370
I duplicate it suffering for is available then I can go on and do the mouth.

10:37.410 --> 10:40.220
So again I can make the mouth just a little bit more flat.

10:40.230 --> 10:44.230
This time go to the eyebrows make them completely neutral.

10:45.590 --> 10:46.010
There we go.

10:46.010 --> 10:46.700
I'm happy with that.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.670
Then I turn on background too and I can change between them.

10:49.670 --> 10:50.690
Perfect.

10:50.740 --> 10:52.790
Now go to frame four and repeat this.

10:52.790 --> 10:59.660
And I'm going to do that now up to 10 frayne's and then I'm going to export my animation as a gif.

10:59.690 --> 11:03.770
After checking of course and I'll be back with you guys in a few moments of the fastforward this next

11:03.770 --> 11:07.910
bit as I'm just repeating the same task a few more times.

11:09.240 --> 11:16.990
Okay so no sooner had I started I'd managed to duplicate the frame from beneath by accident.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.570
And I've overwritten though so in this case if you do something like that it's not the end of the world

11:21.570 --> 11:27.240
you can go ahead and duplicate the frame to go in and clear those frames that you've overwritten.

11:27.240 --> 11:32.940
And again this is this is great that we're on these individual layers it gives us much more scope for

11:33.030 --> 11:36.820
editing our particular image that we're working on.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.610
Now going to go ahead and play that again.

11:38.610 --> 11:44.820
Come back down to frame six and then add those eyebrows back on.

11:44.820 --> 11:47.100
I'm going to unhide background.

11:47.150 --> 11:48.830
I flew onto unhide for that.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.030
So that's going to cause me a few issues further down.

11:51.030 --> 11:52.360
There we go that's that sorted.

11:52.530 --> 11:58.710
So essentially there is a nother queue here as we're going through because I know that the particular

11:58.710 --> 12:04.370
labour group is finished the moment that I can see and I can't see here the face.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.840
So we put that on and check.

12:06.840 --> 12:11.430
We put that on check etc etc. As we go through.

12:11.610 --> 12:18.600
So as I was going through their frame for frame five of the signs I need to go into frame five and remove

12:18.600 --> 12:23.940
the eyebrows and mouth and do those An unhide the background so there we go we've got the chequered

12:24.000 --> 12:28.820
Alpher look and then I can go in and put the new mouth fenn going the wrong way.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.050
Let's make it more of a smile.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.550
Am not that much of a smile.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.700
Nope not that much of a smile that much of a smile.

12:35.700 --> 12:40.650
And then finally the eyebrows again are going to raise them ever so slightly.

12:40.800 --> 12:46.550
And then finally up at the background on that done and I can see the Labour group itself has a thumb

12:46.550 --> 12:50.480
nail against it and I can see the progression there as we go.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.850
Let's do the rest of them and I'll see you back in a few moments.

12:59.660 --> 13:00.220
And here we go.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.290
I'm just finishing it off now.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.800
I think I'm happy with that.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.170
I'm going to go to filter's animation and play back.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.190
And that has probably appeared on one of my other monitors it has.

13:11.180 --> 13:12.720
And let's just play that back.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.440
So that looks okay to me.

13:14.450 --> 13:19.730
And then to slow it down to point five of 10 frames per second because five frames per second is an

13:19.730 --> 13:25.850
a choice and that's a realistic representation of how it's working the eyebrows do go a bit funny at

13:25.850 --> 13:26.380
the end.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.400
But overall I'm happy with that.

13:28.430 --> 13:34.580
Now of course at this point in time I decide to go ahead and export it as a gif.

13:34.580 --> 13:39.980
The problem I will have I'm just going to export it and overwrite one of my test animations before we

13:39.980 --> 13:43.100
go ahead and export we will get the error message.

13:43.100 --> 13:49.760
So at this point in time it's a good idea to save your work appropriately so at this point I've not

13:49.760 --> 13:51.850
saved a slap on my wrists.

13:51.890 --> 13:57.220
Please do remember to save as your going a long time for completely forgotten in this case.

13:57.260 --> 14:02.840
So go ahead make sure you found your project folder and save it before you do anything destructive like

14:02.840 --> 14:09.890
flattening layers down someone to save miners a frown to drain an onion and replace because I'd already

14:09.890 --> 14:12.360
gone through this process to make sure it works okay.

14:12.560 --> 14:17.240
And then of course I'm going to right click and merge the Labour group right click and merge the leg

14:17.250 --> 14:19.810
group and I'm going to do that a further seven times.

14:22.130 --> 14:30.910
And after I have done that I know I can go ahead and save as and call this flattened or flatten this

14:30.910 --> 14:31.400
case.

14:31.420 --> 14:35.760
I'll just overwrite that and there we go we've got a flattened sense now.

14:35.770 --> 14:41.290
It may be more prudent to save as before you go ahead and do this destructive process just in case you

14:41.290 --> 14:43.770
in advertently Savon lose your work.

14:43.800 --> 14:50.650
I would recommend always working on an additional copy of something especially with larger projects.

14:50.650 --> 14:56.920
Finally let's go ahead now and export as our newest export is a test animation just to see how it comes

14:57.010 --> 14:59.120
out as an animation.

14:59.250 --> 15:03.940
200 milliseconds so the whole thing lasts two seconds.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.780
As per the spec of a challenge.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.690
And then finally of course is to go and open that up.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.480
And test animation too.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.860
Here we go.

15:14.860 --> 15:21.370
There we go 0 1 2 3 2 second animation of a frown to a.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.110
Bit of a crazy smile bivy end.

15:23.110 --> 15:24.150
But there we go.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.860
How did you guys get on.

15:25.870 --> 15:32.350
Remember you don't need to do that extra step of merging your layers unless you're exporting as a gif.

15:32.350 --> 15:36.600
Otherwise I hope you've enjoyed this lecture and I will see you all in the next one.
