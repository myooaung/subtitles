WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:05.810
Hey everyone welcome back.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.190
In this election we're going to focus on getting comfortable in GIMP itself.

00:10.190 --> 00:14.480
And first of all of course we need to launch guimpe So let's go ahead and do that.

00:14.720 --> 00:20.010
And when we launch guimpe for the very first time you may be presented with something like this you

00:20.030 --> 00:23.200
feel all of us are tiny windows obviously M..

00:23.500 --> 00:26.380
In a small windowed format not minimized but.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.560
And then you open it up and you go well.

00:28.770 --> 00:29.760
This is a bit odd.

00:29.810 --> 00:34.830
Now this is an extreme example because I have multiple monitors plugged in.

00:34.910 --> 00:38.870
So let me go and grab the other two windows that gimp consists of.

00:38.990 --> 00:41.500
I decided to open up on my other monitor.

00:41.750 --> 00:47.930
So here we go we have here three parts to the interface and as far as I'm aware it opens like this on

00:47.990 --> 00:49.640
most platforms as well.

00:49.640 --> 00:54.830
I tried it on my Mac and it did exactly the same and I hope it didn't take too long for gimped to open

00:54.830 --> 00:56.200
for you on my Mac.

00:56.200 --> 00:56.780
It certainly did.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.460
It took around 15 minutes.

00:58.460 --> 01:04.830
So we've got a split interface and this gives you great customization it allows you to move things about.

01:04.850 --> 01:06.260
Got multiple monitors.

01:06.260 --> 01:11.270
You could have this bit that's in the middle the main part of the program that you could have that full

01:11.270 --> 01:16.580
screen on one of your screens and all of the tools in all of your other things on another screen as

01:16.580 --> 01:21.510
well allow you to separate your interface and working on a picture and focussing on it.

01:21.680 --> 01:28.010
However this can also lead to quite a bit of confusion because along with this interface being split

01:28.040 --> 01:33.930
and spread out you've got pretty much full control over everything you see.

01:34.370 --> 01:42.370
And so let's start with what's known as the dockable dialogues or in this case these individual windows.

01:42.500 --> 01:48.710
So if we go ahead now and grab the main window of gimp and then the windows selection we can see we've

01:48.710 --> 01:50.780
got some options.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.050
And the first one I'm going to try out here is single window mode.

01:55.280 --> 01:59.990
Now a couple of reasons why I will be using that throughout the course you do not have to follow but

02:00.020 --> 02:07.450
I suggest you might want to try this unless you're used to a very splits interface like gimp has.

02:07.520 --> 02:13.810
Most programs do have a single Windows mode just to save yourself some time.

02:13.820 --> 02:20.390
Now this looks like a a mode and it's not it's more of a it's a toggle switch you click that and everything

02:20.390 --> 02:22.130
comes back into one lump.

02:22.130 --> 02:26.960
However if you take something out again and look at this it will still have a tick against it and your

02:26.960 --> 02:32.390
need to unstick it and tickets again to get it back into single Windows mode.

02:32.420 --> 02:38.870
So we have our single window mode here and at this point we can there are invisible borders in some

02:38.870 --> 02:45.330
places where you can put all things out and adjust the windows to your heart's content.

02:45.340 --> 02:52.190
Now I can see my icons around here some of them can be made larger Still if you want and we'll get into

02:52.190 --> 02:54.040
that in a few moments.

02:54.050 --> 02:59.270
So dockable dialogue Well if we go ahead and just have a look at the left hand side of the screen for

02:59.270 --> 03:07.960
the moment at the very top we've got the menu bar which exists on most devices and then we have a sort

03:07.960 --> 03:11.760
of selection of tools underneath that by default.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.970
There is the tools options.

03:14.180 --> 03:17.350
And this is our first example of a dockable dialogue.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.740
I can grab the tab at the very top.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.210
Lift it out and drop it somewhere else.

03:22.310 --> 03:26.750
And it separates it into its own little window.

03:26.750 --> 03:32.060
Now if we have a look at Windows again we can see it's still says it's in a single window mode when

03:32.060 --> 03:32.880
it really isn't.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.660
Now that should get ticked.

03:34.670 --> 03:37.320
Maybe they'll fix that and then later release.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.930
But you can see here you can drag dockable dialogues here.

03:40.960 --> 03:47.630
Sorry go ahead with the tools we can pop over there and it will snap to this part of the interface and

03:47.660 --> 03:51.050
it's true for this area over here as well.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.550
We can separate those out and recombine them.

03:54.560 --> 04:00.560
Now these two particular dialogues these dockable dialogues on the left and the right can be separated

04:00.560 --> 04:04.010
wholly or individually so we can drag the layers out.

04:04.010 --> 04:12.650
We can drag the channels out etc. etc. and these top parts here are called tabs and the tabs allow us

04:12.650 --> 04:17.050
to customize our dockable dialogues as much as we want.

04:17.180 --> 04:22.940
So you can drag a tab in with another one if you wanted to and drag it out again to your heart's content

04:23.100 --> 04:27.890
and if you wanted to stack them instead of having them next to one another so you can click between

04:27.890 --> 04:28.580
them.

04:28.580 --> 04:34.640
What you can also do is drag it's underneath or above and you have to be quite careful with the mouse.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.680
It's very difficult sometimes to get the right location but we can see the blue bar across the bottom

04:39.680 --> 04:41.630
which will put the channels underneath.

04:41.630 --> 04:45.970
And if I lift it up we get the blue bar at the top and now channels is at the top.

04:46.070 --> 04:50.750
And you can do that in any of the dockable dialogues we can do it over the left here.

04:50.780 --> 04:56.860
We can do it over the right etc etc. And now we've got three layers over on the right.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.460
Now let's bring everything back together.

04:59.870 --> 05:03.610
I'm not sure I think it was oh there we go we can split it.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.180
The other way as well that was pure accident.

05:06.190 --> 05:07.380
But there we go.

05:07.480 --> 05:14.380
As you can see it can be quite easy to get yourself in a bit of a twist if you're not careful.

05:14.410 --> 05:19.380
And this is all of course about rearranging the interface itself to your heart's desire.

05:19.630 --> 05:27.280
And this can be both a strength and a weakness depending on yourself and whether you're competent enough

05:27.280 --> 05:31.810
with the interface and comfortable enough with the interface to make sure that if you did get yourself

05:31.810 --> 05:36.940
in a pickle you can get back again next to these dockable dialogues.

05:36.940 --> 05:43.990
There is a little arrow on all of them and it will say configure this tab and that is the current tab

05:43.990 --> 05:45.440
that's open.

05:45.510 --> 05:50.290
If we just have a look at the tools options on the left hand side if we click on that we will see at

05:50.320 --> 05:57.250
the top there is an option for that particular tab that we have open.

05:57.250 --> 06:03.760
This also gives us the OPs option further down to add a tab so we could add the channels that we can

06:03.760 --> 06:10.780
see over on the right we can add one of those dialogues over on the left or any of the other options

06:10.810 --> 06:12.110
we've got underneath.

06:12.820 --> 06:16.860
We can close a tab and of course if we close the tab it disappears.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.070
Dragonball dialogues how do we get one of those back.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.390
Well there are a couple of ways we could go to the window selection go to dockable dialogues and find

06:25.390 --> 06:25.600
it.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.360
It was the tools options.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.100
It comes back it's come back over here.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.480
We can bring it back over here and boom back again.

06:32.740 --> 06:39.160
The other option of course if we went ahead and close that again is we just open up ad tab and tools

06:39.160 --> 06:41.420
options and drag it across.

06:41.740 --> 06:48.500
And of course the final way of doing this we could go to windows and see all recently closed docs.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.450
Now in this case has it would happen.

06:51.610 --> 06:56.530
It doesn't actually show me anything which is not that helpful and that might be because I'm in single

06:56.530 --> 06:57.190
window mode.

06:57.190 --> 06:58.850
If I separate that out.

06:59.010 --> 07:06.080
If we bring our tool box back across and close that and close the channel brushes we go to Windows.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.150
Recently open.

07:07.150 --> 07:07.980
There we go.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.870
Bring that back and that one back.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.940
So it's very easy to bring things back.

07:13.940 --> 07:19.610
It's very easy to rearrange this to your heart's content but it is also very destructive as well as

07:19.670 --> 07:27.260
interface because you can close absolutely everything and get stuck essentially And one of the first

07:27.260 --> 07:30.140
things before I go and destroy my interface.

07:30.730 --> 07:36.960
But I want to show you here is things like these brushes down the bottom and the lower right.

07:37.070 --> 07:43.100
They can be a bit smaller if you're trying to work out what they are and one of the options under your

07:43.100 --> 07:49.390
preview style is tiny extra small small medium large extra large enormous and gigantic if you switch

07:49.400 --> 07:50.690
it's a gigantic.

07:50.690 --> 07:55.910
You can see that these brushes are a lot bigger and that's incredibly helpful when you need to focus

07:55.970 --> 07:57.320
on some detail.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.440
But we need to have an overview.

08:00.350 --> 08:04.480
We can go to the preview size and switch it back to maybe medium.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.860
Whilst we're having a look at this we can see we can view it as a list.

08:08.860 --> 08:11.480
Viewers had grid etc. etc..

08:11.650 --> 08:15.940
And finally we've got move to screen at the very bottom.

08:16.090 --> 08:22.160
And this as it like as you can probably guess moves it to another monitor.

08:22.210 --> 08:27.760
If you've got more than one monitor attached this will display whether you've got another monitor or

08:27.760 --> 08:29.120
not.

08:29.140 --> 08:35.860
I did skip over detach tab and lock tab to Dopp detached tab is the same as clicking on brushes and

08:35.860 --> 08:36.810
dragging it out.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.430
It will just detach it straight away for you.

08:39.430 --> 08:46.870
And we can see here lock tab to dock prevents you moving it anywhere else which can be great if you're

08:46.870 --> 08:48.600
used to destroying stuff.

08:48.610 --> 08:50.820
So let's go ahead and unlock that.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.040
Pop that back over here.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.530
Well missed.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.180
There we go.

08:55.180 --> 08:56.220
That's organized.

08:56.230 --> 09:02.140
And then finally we just need the tool options back which is under window nothing under recently closed

09:02.140 --> 09:08.650
so dockable dialogue's tool options and bring it back over here and there we go we're pretty much back

09:08.920 --> 09:10.400
to how we started.

09:10.450 --> 09:15.760
And of course there may be that time that the configuration is so confusing.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.480
You've altered things and you just cannot get back to it.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.830
So let's go ahead and just close some stuff down and puts move this over here.

09:24.850 --> 09:27.130
So you've completely changed it around.

09:27.190 --> 09:32.050
You've close things down you've moved things to somewhere else and you're a bit confused and you want

09:32.050 --> 09:34.810
to get back to how it was when you started.

09:34.810 --> 09:40.750
Well we can reset the view completely in regard to the edit menu and go to preferences that are similar

09:40.750 --> 09:43.620
to tools and options on many other programs.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.170
So edit and preferences.

09:45.220 --> 09:48.230
It gives us the preferences for guimpe itself.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.370
And there are lots of options in here.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.570
Feel free to look through the mall if you'd like.

09:52.690 --> 09:57.390
However what I'm going to go down to is window management down at the bottom.

09:57.400 --> 10:04.150
Once you've gone to window management we can reset saved window positions to the default values and

10:04.150 --> 10:06.890
it says here it will happen the next time you start guimpe.

10:07.210 --> 10:09.480
Okay so let's go ahead and click okay.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.690
Close down guimpe.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.300
Open it back up again.

10:14.550 --> 10:15.340
We should find.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.990
Yes it splits into a million pieces.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.530
Now you particularly like a setting that you found in and then layout you like using you can of course

10:25.530 --> 10:31.590
go to preferences go down to window management again and save your window positions.

10:31.590 --> 10:36.810
So that's especially useful if you've got multiple monitors as well because it means that if you've

10:36.810 --> 10:43.440
put things on specific screens they will now open up there and we can see by default it will save your

10:43.440 --> 10:49.510
window positions on exit so the window positions are programmed linked not firewall linked.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.830
Sometimes in certain programs the default or the configuration that you're working with is saved in

10:55.830 --> 10:57.290
the file itself.

10:57.330 --> 10:58.640
That's not the case in GIMP.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.850
It is global.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.370
So if you make a change to your interface it will be reflected across all of your projects.

11:05.700 --> 11:09.400
Unless of course you until the save window positions on exit.

11:09.450 --> 11:13.740
In which case it will start up on whatever your save window positions are.

11:14.160 --> 11:21.240
Every time I like leaving it like that with it ticked so that when I open it up it looks the same as

11:21.240 --> 11:22.160
it looked before.

11:22.350 --> 11:25.790
And that also helps if you guys are watching that it's not changing all the time.

11:26.570 --> 11:32.840
And quickly before I go ahead and go to the challenge you will notice that under window there is an

11:32.930 --> 11:36.160
option for the tool box itself.

11:36.170 --> 11:40.780
It's a separate entity it's a little bit confusing at first but it's under the window menu.

11:40.790 --> 11:44.110
It's not a dot dockable dialogue or anything along those lines.

11:44.120 --> 11:51.560
So window tool box if you managed to delete that which you can do if your windows are separated because

11:51.560 --> 11:56.520
I brought all mine together it's unlikely I'll be able to do that without separating it first.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.970
And with that in mind I think it's time for a challenge.

12:01.170 --> 12:04.710
And the challenge is going to be to rebuild your workspace.

12:04.740 --> 12:10.410
So take a screenshot of the original interface or just write down or even take photos on your phone

12:10.710 --> 12:13.200
of the original interface.

12:13.810 --> 12:20.640
Now go ahead and play with the interface move around your tabs remove everything you can from the scene

12:21.300 --> 12:25.170
and get comfortable with the interface by rebuilding it.

12:25.170 --> 12:29.490
This will take you a few minutes of discovery and fun as you go I hope.

12:29.490 --> 12:33.410
Do have fun ones to do in these challenges and do try these challenges as well.

12:33.420 --> 12:39.810
It may seem a bit mundane to rebuild your workspace thinking are never going to destroy it but at one

12:39.810 --> 12:45.330
point in the all life in guimpe you are going to do that so let's get comfortable with it now by rebuilding

12:45.330 --> 12:45.740
it.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.260
Pause a video and I will see back in a few moments.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.340
Okay guys welcome back.

12:52.340 --> 12:57.020
Let's go ahead and rebuild our workspace by first destroying it.

12:57.790 --> 13:01.030
Okay so let's go ahead and open up guimpe.

13:02.090 --> 13:06.000
Now that guimpe is opening let's trash the interface itself.

13:06.050 --> 13:12.500
I'm going to go into or sorry out of single window mode for a moment and just close down my tool box

13:12.500 --> 13:13.970
and tools options.

13:14.940 --> 13:20.670
And my layers and patterns and come back and go back to single window mode so it's as bare bones as

13:20.670 --> 13:22.590
it can possibly be at the moment.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.430
The danger here of course is because this layout is saved with guimpe.

13:26.430 --> 13:31.890
If we come back again later on and perhaps you've moved it for some other reason that we we come like

13:31.890 --> 13:34.130
this so that is no good.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.700
Now I've taken a screen shot on my of the screens are just open that up.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.260
Brilliant that's all open up.

13:40.440 --> 13:47.160
And let's start by just adding the things that we need so I could of course go to recently closed docs

13:47.160 --> 13:52.390
and reopen them are not going to do that at this point nor am I just going to reset the default.

13:52.440 --> 13:57.160
I want to learn the interface and go through just its general manipulation.

13:57.190 --> 13:59.810
Ma jump straight to the destructive stage of course.

13:59.970 --> 14:07.200
So here we have layers so that's pop layers on and then this is just going to be reeling these off channels

14:07.560 --> 14:11.060
and then paths just happens to be that they're all in a row.

14:11.070 --> 14:13.590
And after that it was the undo history.

14:13.590 --> 14:14.760
So that's that bit done.

14:14.760 --> 14:22.080
Of course the next one we try an ADD which was the brushes says go to Windows dockable dialogue's brushes.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.330
We don't want that there we want it underneath.

14:24.330 --> 14:30.840
And this is where it can get a little bit funny as you try and drag it to the bottom of the window.

14:30.840 --> 14:36.000
In fact in this case I'm not going to be able to do it in the reason for that is it's beneath my staff

14:36.010 --> 14:38.990
bar because gimp isn't full screen so let's make it full screen.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.740
Now I should be able to Dockett just underneath.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.460
There we go.

14:42.780 --> 14:46.740
And now we've got the brushes selected we can go down and do dockable dialogues.

14:46.770 --> 14:48.470
And what was the next one Patons.

14:48.480 --> 14:53.030
I think paton's track that down.

14:53.490 --> 14:54.320
Excellent.

14:54.330 --> 14:59.840
And then the final one over this side was something called Radiance gradients.

14:59.850 --> 15:00.570
There we go.

15:00.570 --> 15:05.720
We can see that some of those do have short cuts and a lot of the things in GIMP.

15:05.720 --> 15:13.760
There are a lot of shortcuts you can see that they do have the necessary control keys in the menus itself.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.610
Okay so that's this site done.

15:15.630 --> 15:17.100
And then what do we have here.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.330
So we have our tools options and.

15:22.110 --> 15:27.540
W tools options tools options right at the top as doctor over here that's bringing it across here.

15:27.810 --> 15:35.400
Now one of the things that were missing is something called the tool box and it's not under the dockable

15:35.400 --> 15:36.320
dialogue's.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.320
Interesting.

15:37.530 --> 15:38.250
It's here.

15:38.340 --> 15:43.670
Under a new tool box control and B so are under the control can try and control the beat.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.330
There we go it's added it.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.810
And can we add lots of them.

15:46.830 --> 15:47.120
Nope.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.660
That's all is a good thing.

15:48.660 --> 15:54.720
Now it's split these two up here and you'll notice with the tool box itself you can't actually drag

15:54.720 --> 15:58.410
that about once it's placed very easily.

15:58.410 --> 16:03.030
So in this case I'm going to move the tools options so it's underneath the tool box and we've got the

16:03.030 --> 16:04.010
right width.

16:04.320 --> 16:10.020
Now just for completeness of course I'm going to go in and go to Edit preferences and I'm going to click

16:10.020 --> 16:11.330
on save window positions.

16:11.340 --> 16:16.200
You don't really have to do that if you've got a save window positions on exit ticked.

16:16.290 --> 16:18.800
But just for completeness.

16:18.960 --> 16:26.210
And I think if I switch this to brushes and this two layers that is how it would open up as she started.

16:26.220 --> 16:26.980
Brilliant.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.520
How did you guys get on.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.010
I hope you've had a bit of fun playing with the interface.

16:31.020 --> 16:36.990
I know we're not drawing yet but mastering this interface really is important early on so it doesn't

16:36.990 --> 16:42.890
hold you back when you really want to get down to the nitty gritty of creating some wonderful art.

16:42.900 --> 16:48.920
Please share your experiences with us and of course I will see you guys in the next lecture.
