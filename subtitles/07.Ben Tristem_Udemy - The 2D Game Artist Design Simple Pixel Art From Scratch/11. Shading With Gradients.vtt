00:04.110 --> 00:07.440
In this lecture we're going to have a closer look at gradients.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.990
Not only will we be able to make lovely sunsets looking like this.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.910
Change your flag to looking something like this.

00:14.100 --> 00:20.310
But also you can build up some of the items you've already done in this case the sawdust we can see

00:20.310 --> 00:25.650
I can switch it from having a gradient to background on and off because I've made that on a separate

00:25.650 --> 00:30.530
layer using the selection tools I've been able to select the internals of the sword.

00:30.600 --> 00:39.120
So I've got lots of options now to enable and disable gradient fills to have a different artistic feel

00:39.390 --> 00:42.500
based upon the same object.

00:42.810 --> 00:49.970
Okay so now we are back into given the first thing we're going to do as always is create a new file

00:50.010 --> 00:52.770
and we're going to make it 32 by 32.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.990
You probably got the hang of this by now and I'm going to zoom in.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.910
Now we need here first of all use the gradient tool.

00:59.030 --> 00:59.730
I'm going to continue.

00:59.740 --> 01:01.120
Call it the gradient talk.

01:01.140 --> 01:06.970
Its official name is the blend tool and it can be found in the tool box next to the paint buckets.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.810
It is a square that has a gradient across it.

01:09.810 --> 01:12.600
The shortcut key for that is L..

01:12.840 --> 01:19.830
We can select it in the tool box itself or indeed we can go up to tools paint tools and we can see it

01:19.830 --> 01:21.310
there as well.

01:21.690 --> 01:27.090
Once that's selected it is a tool that you were used by clicking and dragging.

01:27.090 --> 01:34.710
Much like drawing a straight line and what that does is tells it gimp where to start and end the foreground

01:34.800 --> 01:37.990
or the blend between the foreground and background colour.

01:38.190 --> 01:41.410
So if I click on the left then drag towards the right.

01:41.430 --> 01:46.880
We get a line appearing and that should go from black on the left to white on the right.

01:46.890 --> 01:53.700
If you make that line shorter then it will simply stop at that point there and continue being white

01:53.970 --> 01:55.810
from the middle onwards.

01:56.070 --> 01:58.920
Now it's not just a foreground to background colour.

01:58.950 --> 02:04.680
There are settings that we'll see in a few moments where you can have more than two colours being blended

02:04.680 --> 02:05.670
between.

02:05.670 --> 02:11.970
So one of the first things we can look at here is the tool options and as well as the normal pastie

02:12.240 --> 02:16.010
the first scene we get to is a gradient selection.

02:16.020 --> 02:20.090
Now this little box that has the gradient from black to white.

02:20.100 --> 02:27.270
If we click on that it gives us a series of presets that have already been made that you can start using

02:27.270 --> 02:32.380
straight away so we can select one like golden and once again go from left to right.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.860
Let's just try that out.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.280
Doesn't that look great.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.200
And this is an example of what I was talking about a moment ago where there is definitely more than

02:40.200 --> 02:44.190
one colour band as we go across and just like the patterns.

02:44.190 --> 02:46.980
There is a gradient tab as well.

02:47.010 --> 02:50.820
Now Mine is already there because it's part of the default set up.

02:50.820 --> 02:56.520
We've got brushes patterns and gradients down on the lower right and if we click on gradients we get

02:56.520 --> 03:03.390
the full list of ones that come preinstalled with Gimp and we'll go about editing these or creating

03:03.390 --> 03:10.650
a new one in a few moments but before we do that let's go and have a look at the rest of the tool options

03:11.250 --> 03:16.530
after the gradient presets we have the shape at the moment it sets to Laon Yes so it's just going to

03:16.530 --> 03:17.860
go straight across.

03:17.880 --> 03:23.600
If we go from one corner to another we can see it's just the linear change across the entire image.

03:23.610 --> 03:28.170
If we change that and have a look at some of the other options here we've got Bilin here.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.400
Well let's give that a go.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.960
What does that look like.

03:30.960 --> 03:38.310
Well it looks exactly the same as the last one because the by linear is going to reflect backwards so

03:38.310 --> 03:45.620
if I go to the middle and drag across we will see there a goat that it's now mirrored the other way.

03:45.690 --> 03:51.870
And if I go diagonally across we'll get a black band or a dark brown band moving across the middle.

03:52.020 --> 03:53.150
Excellent.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.860
And of course if we go back to the black and white standard unjust can pick foreground to background

03:59.250 --> 04:01.040
and just go from the middle out.

04:01.040 --> 04:05.050
Words will get a nice bandaid approach.

04:05.070 --> 04:11.370
There are many other types that we can pick from we've got radio that can be very useful if we got a

04:11.370 --> 04:16.860
black splodge in the middle with it fading out radially i.e. in a circle.

04:16.860 --> 04:18.190
From that point.

04:19.570 --> 04:22.390
And there are many others that you can play with here.

04:22.390 --> 04:26.440
There is even a spiral if you so wish.

04:26.440 --> 04:32.530
The next option down is repeating and it's greyed out on the spiral so let's go back to something like

04:32.530 --> 04:33.310
radio.

04:33.640 --> 04:41.530
And if we set that to Sawtooth we will see that it repeats over and over and over.

04:41.560 --> 04:48.760
So if I just draw myself a small line we see that it repeats itself going from black to white to black

04:48.760 --> 04:51.060
to white to black to white and over and over again.

04:51.070 --> 04:53.030
That's the nature of a sawtooth wave.

04:53.050 --> 04:58.830
It goes from one extreme to another and then defaults back to zero and starts all over again.

04:58.840 --> 05:05.200
Now the other option there apart from none is triangular wave so this will go from black to white and

05:05.200 --> 05:07.860
then back to black before it goes to white again.

05:07.870 --> 05:14.620
So if we draw a similar size line we see that we get a completely different effect to what we had before

05:15.040 --> 05:18.870
and this is true with whichever one of these you pick.

05:19.030 --> 05:24.700
If it's allowable so with linnea that's still the same sorts of thing we get stripes if we go to a sawtooth

05:24.700 --> 05:28.580
wave we're going to end up with a much harsher division between the two.

05:28.630 --> 05:32.290
And as you can see they are totally different when you look at them.

05:32.350 --> 05:37.690
Now the offset tool is an interesting one and I'm going to leave repeating turned on at the moment because

05:37.690 --> 05:45.830
you see it only offsets the first part and the numbers that are here are not pixels.

05:45.910 --> 05:49.900
They are a percentage of the line that you draw.

05:49.900 --> 05:56.160
So if I draw from one corner to the other corner we will see that we get our standard gradient.

05:56.170 --> 06:01.690
If I set that offset at around 50 percent and draw it from here to there.

06:01.690 --> 06:09.370
I'd expect it to be black all the way up to around 50 percent which it is and when it comes to repetition.

06:09.400 --> 06:16.810
If I go from here to maybe a quarter of the way across you will see that it only affects the first one.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.180
It does not affect the repetition.

06:19.180 --> 06:27.490
There are there and I personally haven't come across a real use for the offset if an offset is required.

06:27.490 --> 06:33.400
I usually bake it into the gradient change itself and we'll get onto that in a few moments when we come

06:33.400 --> 06:36.130
to making our own gradient.

06:36.130 --> 06:42.160
Now there are two final options that are devouring an adaptive soup per sampling and to be quite honest

06:42.190 --> 06:48.070
at this low resolution we are not going to really see an effect with eeva of these two.

06:48.430 --> 06:54.520
Simply put dithering is the act of including colours that aren't in the start or end to help smooth

06:54.520 --> 07:01.510
the transition between one colour and another when using the blend tool and adaptive super sampling

07:01.510 --> 07:05.300
is all about making edges less jagged.

07:05.320 --> 07:13.900
Now we are dealing with a 32 by 32 pixel image jagged edges are part of what makes pixel art look like

07:13.900 --> 07:19.720
pixel art so we're not going to be able to really see any difference with either of these two turned

07:19.780 --> 07:26.170
on the simple gradient changes are spread amongst so few pixels that dithering is not going to take

07:26.170 --> 07:34.090
in to affect at all and adapt super sampling to lower pixel counts to worry about not having jagged

07:34.090 --> 07:35.350
edges.

07:35.350 --> 07:41.810
Now the exciting part here is when you get to make your own gradient of course the first level of customization

07:41.810 --> 07:46.270
when it comes to making your own gradient is to literally change the background of foreground colours

07:46.270 --> 07:49.580
so if we go from red to blue.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.020
Oh and if I remember to switch them round there we go.

07:53.020 --> 07:57.640
So we've got a foreground of red background a blue and glow of offset back down.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.890
We can see that's already were going to go from red to magenta all the way to blue.

08:02.890 --> 08:09.880
So if I just do that now we see we get all my work that is bright so that is one way that you can create

08:09.910 --> 08:10.810
a gradient.

08:10.870 --> 08:11.830
The other.

08:11.890 --> 08:13.900
If you've created your own palette.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.120
If I go and find my fire palette that I made earlier.

08:17.260 --> 08:25.330
If I right click on a palette it will give us an option further down palette to gradients or palette

08:25.330 --> 08:27.360
to repeated gradient.

08:27.430 --> 08:33.940
So if I go ahead and do palettes a gradient with my fire we will see that in the gradients there is

08:33.940 --> 08:37.550
now one called Fire and if I just drag and test that.

08:37.570 --> 08:38.500
How cool is that.

08:38.500 --> 08:43.710
That's a gradient that I've made now by just a few clicks.

08:43.720 --> 08:48.400
Now if you want to go into some more advanced gradient editing we're going to have to use the gradient

08:48.460 --> 08:49.260
editor.

08:49.270 --> 08:51.550
Now that's not going to be included in this lecture.

08:51.550 --> 08:57.240
We've covered enough with the blend tools so far this time to cement that knowledge.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.610
Now in the form of a challenge.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.940
And in this challenge I'd like you once again to create four images.

09:04.940 --> 09:07.310
Now use existing images or create new.

09:07.310 --> 09:13.220
You can see a bit of a theme coming here by using existing images your learning how to modify existing

09:13.220 --> 09:19.880
images and repurpose them for other uses or using them just as a simple base or an outline to create

09:19.880 --> 09:20.630
new ones.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.860
Or indeed you can just create brand new ones right from scratch.

09:24.860 --> 09:31.670
Now do use gradients where you can perhaps creating shading or gorgeous backgrounds for your icons and

09:31.670 --> 09:35.830
using the selection tools can help you with localized gradients.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.060
If you want to use them there as well.

09:38.150 --> 09:39.050
So go ahead.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.540
A video now and give that a go.

09:43.070 --> 09:44.390
Okay guys welcome back.

09:44.390 --> 09:48.890
Let's go ahead and make a couple more images using gradients.

09:50.600 --> 09:56.830
Okay so for this example I am going to go ahead and load up my sword that I made in the film challenge

09:57.140 --> 10:00.520
and I assume all the way in control shift in J.

10:00.610 --> 10:05.030
So I've got these areas here where I can have some shading.

10:05.110 --> 10:10.890
Let's go ahead and see if we can use some gradients and make this maybe a little prettier.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.340
I don't know how it's going to look.

10:12.340 --> 10:18.030
Let's let's just give it a go and let's start with this golden or yellow handle.

10:18.220 --> 10:22.570
I'm going to go to my gradient so go to the tool options.

10:22.750 --> 10:28.270
And from the gradients themselves I can scroll down this list here of course within the tool options

10:28.600 --> 10:32.850
or I can go across to gradients on the gradient tab and scroll down.

10:32.860 --> 10:33.310
And I.

10:33.370 --> 10:36.940
I've seen one that I quite like it's the one we played with before golden.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.670
And so I'm going to select the right areas.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.160
I'm going to go to where it is Blade.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.180
In fact it just has blade here.

10:45.190 --> 10:50.060
Let's just call this flat shading for that is more appropriate to what we're actually doing.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.050
And this is the sword outline.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.920
Okay so we've got sword out line and flat shading.

10:56.050 --> 11:00.750
I'm going to create a new layer and I'm going to call this.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.490
I don't know what it's called hand guard.

11:05.010 --> 11:07.700
You're not sure it is name exactly what it does.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.080
Okay so who got handguard here.

11:10.090 --> 11:12.790
We've got the gradient tool the selection I'm going to use.

11:12.790 --> 11:13.910
My.

11:17.020 --> 11:22.570
I'm going to use my fuzzy select tool and make sure sample merge is turned on so I can select the yellow

11:22.570 --> 11:26.340
area underneath and then I'm just going to play with the gradient till now.

11:26.350 --> 11:32.170
I think I want it going this way diagonally across and I'm going to make sure hold down Shift and control

11:32.170 --> 11:33.980
to lock it to 45 degrees.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.860
Oh that looks pretty good.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.910
Let's try a couple of other ones.

11:37.940 --> 11:38.670
There's that.

11:38.680 --> 11:42.360
There's that how if it's really short or that's a bit strong.

11:43.490 --> 11:43.930
K.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.950
I liked that first one there.

11:47.110 --> 11:49.500
Okay that's one bit of shading done.

11:49.650 --> 11:50.730
How about the handle down here.

11:50.730 --> 11:52.730
Well we can probably get away.

11:52.730 --> 11:55.110
Can we let's just give it a go.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.010
So handle these.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.800
I really want to know what these sordin Names are called.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.500
Let's just have a look at that now.

12:03.510 --> 12:05.120
Parts of sword.

12:06.540 --> 12:10.830
Okay so it looks like looking at a description of a sword.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.940
It's called the grip and a cross guard.

12:12.970 --> 12:13.770
Okay.

12:14.040 --> 12:19.890
It seems that I wasn't too far away from handguard Let's call this grip that makes sense because that

12:19.890 --> 12:21.780
was just one interpretation of it.

12:21.930 --> 12:24.530
Let's go ahead and select this little brown area down here.

12:24.700 --> 12:30.530
And this time and see if the condensed version of that works or whether we need to do something else.

12:30.540 --> 12:35.250
I think that matches too much to the other one that we've got there.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.560
So let's fill this instead with a pattern.

12:38.580 --> 12:43.770
So we're going to pattern fill and let's try one of the wood effects.

12:43.830 --> 12:48.350
I'm not sure I like what I'm not and I'm also not sure whether that's taking as I would expect someone

12:48.390 --> 12:50.050
to fill the whole selection instead.

12:50.160 --> 12:50.630
There we go.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.530
That's better.

12:51.540 --> 12:56.080
So we've now got a nice handle based upon a fill.

12:56.370 --> 13:00.280
How about the blade itself is there anything we can do with that.

13:00.570 --> 13:06.480
Let's go ahead and find some greys or silvers in the gradient tool and see if we can make a difference

13:06.540 --> 13:09.760
using that all metallic something.

13:10.200 --> 13:19.980
Well I'm up for giving that a go at select this area down here and gradient tool let's call this new

13:19.980 --> 13:24.870
one blade this new layer that we're creating to have got a blade layer.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.390
Let's try that's all.

13:27.450 --> 13:31.230
I reckon that could work out quite well you know with that there.

13:31.650 --> 13:37.170
And then if we select the other one and do the gradient on the other side.

13:38.210 --> 13:44.210
How does that work out that could work well if we now have a background that suitable.

13:44.220 --> 13:48.960
Now I'm going to try a warmer background so let's scroll down here.

13:49.040 --> 13:53.340
I could of course create my own gradient if it's if this doesn't work.

13:53.510 --> 13:58.520
Let's try this just try incandescent and I d select everything and I'm gonna use a shortcut key control

13:58.520 --> 14:04.610
shift in a say me go into the menu and the background is there is just it just turned off.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.370
Let's try the other way.

14:07.150 --> 14:07.870
Mm.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.980
Kind of works just goes a bit too dark.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.030
So what can we do in that case we can edit this gradient.

14:14.050 --> 14:17.090
Or of course we can find maybe a more suitable one all.

14:17.110 --> 14:19.930
What about the fire one that I made earlier.

14:19.930 --> 14:21.120
Fire.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.600
Let's go across and do that.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.330
Cool.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.000
Got a funky background there for our sort.

14:27.340 --> 14:34.270
So we can see here how a simple flat shaded sword with a few gradients on it ends up looking completely

14:34.270 --> 14:40.120
different obviously its shape is still the same but it's overall feel is completely different to that

14:40.120 --> 14:42.170
of when it was just flat shaded.

14:42.370 --> 14:43.250
Interesting.

14:43.420 --> 14:48.250
And there's lots more of course you can do with gradients especially if you started using some of the

14:48.250 --> 14:50.100
other shapes as well.

14:50.110 --> 14:55.120
I'd love to see what you guys have come up with so please do show your work in the discussions and I

14:55.120 --> 14:57.390
will see you guys in the next lecture.
