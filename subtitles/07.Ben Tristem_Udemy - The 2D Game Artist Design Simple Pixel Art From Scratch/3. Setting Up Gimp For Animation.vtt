00:04.430 --> 00:08.210
Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture by the end of it.

00:08.210 --> 00:14.180
You'll be able to use a very straightforward animation like the one you can see in front of you here

00:14.210 --> 00:21.430
where we've got a few solid colours coming up on the screen and looping round in a circle.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.030
I happen to have called this one sunrise.

00:24.030 --> 00:30.100
So as you can see it's emulating the sun coming up and setting again to night time.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.440
Okay so welcome back over into guimpe in this particular lecture.

00:35.440 --> 00:43.240
We're going to discuss the animation principles how to get a basic switching of colours going on over

00:43.240 --> 00:43.980
in guimpe.

00:44.200 --> 00:49.230
So the first thing of course we need is an image which we're going to use as one of our frames.

00:49.230 --> 00:51.320
So let's go ahead and create a new image.

00:51.490 --> 00:54.790
And at this point in time I am ordered to make it eight by eight.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.670
I don't want to deal with a huge canvas or anything else.

00:57.670 --> 01:03.520
No zoom in so I can have a closer look at that and I'm going to make it a solid colour so going to go

01:03.520 --> 01:09.630
to my bucket all an under and to fill it in case of that's done dusted.

01:09.910 --> 01:12.930
Now how do we switch to a new frame.

01:12.940 --> 01:16.370
Is it a new image and how does it working gimp.

01:16.540 --> 01:25.810
Well in GIMP providing you have your first layer set up that acts as frame number one.

01:25.930 --> 01:30.550
If we go ahead and create a new layer that will act as frain two and I'm actually going to name this

01:30.550 --> 01:31.180
frame.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.800
So and the original one frame one.

01:34.810 --> 01:36.850
So I know which one they are.

01:36.880 --> 01:42.430
Now of course this does present problems if you decide to name like this if you go ahead and say No

01:42.430 --> 01:45.360
I don't want frame one to be the first frame but I want frame two.

01:45.370 --> 01:51.290
So you do have the bear in mind that if you go and juggle them like that that may cause you a few issues

01:51.320 --> 01:58.330
but even frame one in frame two just so I know that the order starts at the bottom and goes up from

01:58.330 --> 01:58.580
there.

01:58.570 --> 02:03.180
So frame one frame to frame three frame four et cetera et cetera.

02:03.700 --> 02:10.770
So frame two let's give that a colour as well as go for blue or green or something.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.930
So making sure frame two is selected to use the fill tool and fill that in.

02:15.940 --> 02:18.960
So now we have two layers active.

02:19.210 --> 02:23.150
Now there is going to be an issue with working 8 by 8.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.730
That is that the preview were about to experience is going to be tiny.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.540
So I'll show you that and then we'll go back we'll scale it up.

02:30.730 --> 02:40.130
So if we go down to filters and go down to animation on the file menu there we've got a series of options.

02:40.150 --> 02:43.480
And all we're focussed on at the moment is playback.

02:43.540 --> 02:49.690
So if we go ahead and click on playback a new window appears and it looks like there's not much in there

02:49.720 --> 02:53.980
but this is the setup we saw earlier with the bouncing ball.

02:54.010 --> 02:59.860
I can go ahead and click play and I can see alternating between frame one down at the bottom and frame

02:59.890 --> 03:00.450
two.

03:00.570 --> 03:06.610
Now is not getting the names of those it's literally just frame one and two and I've happened to name

03:06.610 --> 03:07.990
them the same thing.

03:08.150 --> 03:15.220
And this is your preview this tiny little square underneath the rewind and this is where you may come

03:15.220 --> 03:19.330
across a few issues when youre working with such small images.

03:19.330 --> 03:23.170
So Im just going to close that go to my image before I do anything else.

03:23.190 --> 03:29.700
Im going to save this so save save it in the appropriate place to whatever youre working in.

03:30.650 --> 03:31.430
So there we go.

03:31.430 --> 03:38.980
Im just saving my project there and now I can go to image and scale my image to something a bit larger.

03:38.980 --> 03:44.030
In this case Im going to go all the work to 512 so its nice and large for us to see.

03:44.030 --> 03:47.930
And then you shift control in Jay just to make it full screen.

03:48.230 --> 03:55.490
And we will be alternating between needs if we go to filter's animation and playback.

03:55.520 --> 04:01.340
We finally can see it as it is and I'm going to stop that before it hurts my eyes.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.220
Now you can play with a few things.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.450
You can detach this area.

04:05.450 --> 04:11.750
This is the image that you're playing back and can to reattach it by clicking on detach again and then

04:11.750 --> 04:12.680
down at the bottom.

04:12.680 --> 04:18.880
You can change the speed of the playback as well as how many frames per second it is.

04:18.980 --> 04:23.780
And it seems here that it tops out 72 frames per second.

04:23.780 --> 04:24.680
Fair enough.

04:24.750 --> 04:30.790
Uncommonly of course with the level of fidelity we're working with we're going to be around 10 or 12.

04:30.920 --> 04:38.240
And if you decide to work higher that's all very well but do bear in mind is often going to take a lot

04:38.240 --> 04:44.090
more work to actually get a decent animation at 60 frames per second opposed to 10.

04:44.090 --> 04:47.050
In fact I'd say take around six times more work.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.250
Okay.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.800
So we've created our animation here and we're ready to show the world.

04:53.840 --> 04:59.870
Of course you could taps your screen but that's no good really to say this as something that we can

04:59.870 --> 05:02.480
use and demonstrate to other people.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.440
Now we're not quite at the stage at the moment where we'd want to create this into a sprite sheet or

05:06.440 --> 05:06.980
anything else.

05:06.980 --> 05:11.740
We just want to share it and we can share it as an animated gif.

05:11.810 --> 05:15.880
And of course like everything we can't just go file and save with it.

05:16.040 --> 05:23.480
We need to go to exports and I'm going to go down to export as and I'm going to call this my name that

05:23.480 --> 05:28.580
I've currently got it and I'm going to change the extension at the end to G I F.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.420
Now some people call this a gif.

05:30.470 --> 05:32.110
Some people called it a jiff.

05:32.120 --> 05:37.180
I've always called a gif and I will continue doing so unless I'm corrected now.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.280
All exported images.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.720
I'm going to leave that as that's absolutely fine.

05:41.720 --> 05:48.770
But the fact I've typed in G G F on the end it will automatically switch to a gif file.

05:48.770 --> 05:54.380
If I then go in hit export it's going to give me some options and there is an important option here

05:54.410 --> 05:56.710
and that is as animation.

05:56.720 --> 06:01.590
We need to make sure that is ticked otherwise we won't get an animation.

06:01.700 --> 06:08.870
We do want it to loop forever and this is the important one that I'm going to change that oscillation

06:08.870 --> 06:12.570
that we had before between the black and the green was far too quick.

06:12.770 --> 06:17.740
So I'm going to delay the time between the frames where unspecified.

06:17.810 --> 06:24.380
We haven't specified any frame times here so we can go in here and change this from 100 milliseconds

06:24.380 --> 06:27.030
which is 10 times a second.

06:27.050 --> 06:32.100
A millisecond is a thousandth of a second so there's a thousand of them would be.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.910
So I typed in 1000 here.

06:33.920 --> 06:40.430
It would switch between black and green every second I want it to be a little quick of a map every half

06:40.430 --> 06:45.050
second so I'm going to go for 500 milliseconds and click on export.

06:45.110 --> 06:51.140
Now once I've done that I'll be able to go to my file directory and find my export.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.140
Here it is black and green.

06:53.220 --> 06:59.360
When I open it up I can see that every half second it goes to Green which is great on this black screen

06:59.360 --> 07:04.460
that I have here and of course now we've done the basics of changing those out.

07:04.580 --> 07:08.700
I'd like you to solidify that knowledge now in the form of a challenge.

07:09.570 --> 07:15.390
And your challenge for this lecture is going to be to create a short animation that cycles through at

07:15.390 --> 07:18.360
least six different solid colours.

07:19.370 --> 07:22.390
And here is an example of that happening here.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.230
So as an extension of what you've just done so go ahead.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.650
Post a video and give that a go.

07:31.220 --> 07:32.500
Okay guys welcome back.

07:32.630 --> 07:37.630
Let's go ahead now and create an extended version of what we currently have.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.760
Okay so we're back over in gimping.

07:41.810 --> 07:45.990
I want to revert back to its smaller version before I do anything else.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.750
So I'm going to go to a file and open recent.

07:50.270 --> 07:55.830
And I can open up my black green again not the gif but the one underneath it.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.950
And there we go back in.

07:57.950 --> 08:02.540
Now this could be confusing because now I've got two of exactly the same file open.

08:02.540 --> 08:07.520
I'm going to close and discard the other one and zoom all the way in so I can see what's happening so

08:07.520 --> 08:11.360
I've got two frames coming up there.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.220
That's fine.

08:12.280 --> 08:19.070
The start a frame one the bottom one and go up and create a new layer and then.

08:20.610 --> 08:23.760
It's tempting to call it frame 3 and so forth.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.270
I'm just going to go and create a couple of layers here.

08:26.310 --> 08:31.140
So how many did I say in the challenge I said at least.

08:33.530 --> 08:34.390
Six.

08:34.620 --> 08:43.910
So let's go ahead and go a couple more and go to frame 67 why not add that in there for confusion and

08:43.910 --> 08:45.070
everybody.

08:45.070 --> 08:45.600
But there we go.

08:45.830 --> 08:46.640
Let's go up to.

08:46.770 --> 08:54.760
So with frame three selected I'm going to fill it in for selected fill that in frame five selected.

08:54.770 --> 08:57.590
I can fill that in and so forth and so forth.

08:57.590 --> 09:06.140
Now obviously you could go through these in a more predictable manner maybe and go through colours in

09:06.140 --> 09:10.760
a changing fashion maybe red orange yellow green blue etc. It's a fading down.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.350
In fact you know what I'm going to do that I'm going to go to my palates.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.490
Let's make this a bit more interesting than just random stuff.

09:17.510 --> 09:22.570
Have we got the fire code that will probably be all I need.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.010
Or plasma.

09:24.110 --> 09:26.160
Again this is a great thing about palettes.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.060
I'm going to pick plasma.

09:28.550 --> 09:30.350
No let's go to fire code again.

09:31.270 --> 09:36.540
Well it's helped so that's got everything I want and I will call this sunrise because we're going to

09:36.540 --> 09:40.190
go from black and then we go to a deep red.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.760
Oh no it's kind of a blue first isn't it.

09:42.810 --> 09:48.850
There's the blue and then deep red on the next frame and then slightly warmer red.

09:49.020 --> 09:55.560
And of course if you have the inclination in time you could do this for hundreds of frames and fill

09:55.560 --> 09:59.360
in one for every single colour that is there.

09:59.370 --> 10:06.840
If you wanted to just finish this off now as we come up that's a much better sequence of colours.

10:06.950 --> 10:12.180
We're going to go ahead and this time go save has because that's not black and green anymore at all

10:12.270 --> 10:13.660
save it as that.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.760
But I'm going to call it sunrise.

10:17.160 --> 10:24.270
Now of course what I could do here is then repeat frame eight and go seven six five four duplicating

10:24.270 --> 10:26.790
them and moving them to the appropriate location.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.510
Now I'd have a sunset and sunrise.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.490
Shall I do that.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.650
Yeah let's do that.

10:31.800 --> 10:39.060
So we're at yellow here so I can duplicate a couple of times so it stays at yellow for a bit and then

10:39.410 --> 10:42.110
do the darker yellow lift that up to the top.

10:42.210 --> 10:43.210
Do the.

10:44.180 --> 10:47.490
Frame six duplicate that lift up to the top.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.530
And carry on doing this into life got them all.

10:54.490 --> 10:55.270
And there we go.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.770
So this is now going to go from black to yellow and back to black again.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.670
I hope after doing all of that do you.

11:02.680 --> 11:08.320
Bear in mind at this point in time that we are still eight by eight Some are going to go ahead and save

11:08.320 --> 11:15.160
my far before I make any other ulcerations let me go to my image and scale the image of going to turn

11:15.190 --> 11:17.130
up again to 512.

11:17.230 --> 11:22.630
And once that scaled up I'm going to make sure there's no interpolation although they're solid colours

11:22.630 --> 11:25.090
that shouldn't make any difference in this case.

11:25.090 --> 11:31.120
Now we're going to get the filters animation and just play that back and test this clip play.

11:31.150 --> 11:31.990
There we go.

11:31.990 --> 11:32.540
Really.

11:32.710 --> 11:35.540
So we go we've got it fading and fading down again.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.720
Perfect.

11:37.030 --> 11:44.290
Let's go ahead now and export that someone export it as it's come up as a gift because it's remembered

11:44.290 --> 11:51.160
the previous work I've done an export That's now I don't want this to take 500 milliseconds.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.900
This is going to have to be slightly quick.

11:52.900 --> 11:59.710
I don't need to be too quick so I'm going to go for 200 which is one fifth of a second and then I'm

11:59.710 --> 12:02.640
going to go ahead making sure everything else is done.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.560
I'm going to export that.

12:05.110 --> 12:09.140
And then I will check it as well and make sure it's all working.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.050
And of course now this is a gif.

12:11.260 --> 12:17.480
You can actually share that very easily on social or even over on the forum.

12:17.530 --> 12:22.180
And I'm looking forward to seeing what you've come up with over there so pleased to share your work.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.330
And I will see you all in the next lecture.
