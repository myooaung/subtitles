00:05.330 --> 00:07.120
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:07.130 --> 00:13.220
In this lecture we're going to specifically talk about gimp's ability to expand its functionality through

00:13.220 --> 00:16.640
the use of plugins and scripts.

00:16.640 --> 00:23.660
They help massively when it comes to improving both workflow and the functionality of gimp.

00:23.660 --> 00:30.130
Now there is an official site called registry dot guimpe dot org in this case when you go there.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.740
I would just go back a step.

00:31.850 --> 00:32.860
It will take you two.

00:32.870 --> 00:36.410
We need to complete a different much more secure solution.

00:36.410 --> 00:41.420
This is the official site they're working on that if you click on see the glossary you get a big long

00:41.420 --> 00:48.490
list of every plug in and script that's available officially through the guimpe website.

00:48.650 --> 00:55.100
However not all of these come with a an executable that you can run in it happily installs much like

00:55.200 --> 00:58.800
it did that did it automatically for us this time round.

00:58.850 --> 01:04.490
We're going to have to do it manually in order to do that you're going to have to just navigate away

01:04.760 --> 01:05.390
from here.

01:05.470 --> 01:06.650
Guimpe in the background here.

01:06.680 --> 01:10.240
We're going to have to go into your file system to do this.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.400
This is the Windows version.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.240
I'll come back in a moment and do the Mac one as well.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.830
Let me bring this down so you guys can see it as well.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.880
We need to go into where we've installed guimpe.

01:20.890 --> 01:26.120
Now most people's computers this will be on your C drive under Program Files.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.660
Once you are in your program files you should see a folder called guimpe.

01:29.750 --> 01:35.120
If you've installed gimp multiple times and have different versions you will have to pick the one that

01:35.150 --> 01:40.720
you're currently using in order to install a script or a plugin.

01:41.620 --> 01:45.520
Once we go into gimp to scan to make this full screen so we can focus.

01:45.520 --> 01:52.980
We've got two locations two separate locations that plug ins are installed and the scripts are installed.

01:53.080 --> 01:59.010
If we want to go ahead and install a plugin you'll have to go to the library or the lib folder.

01:59.320 --> 02:06.730
Go to gimp 2.0 and then the plugins folder is right there for you and this is where you put your python

02:06.730 --> 02:07.580
scripts.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.720
However the script fool scripts are in a slightly different location.

02:12.730 --> 02:18.280
Again go back to gimp to in the program file folder and go to share.

02:18.330 --> 02:26.740
When sharing share you go to gimp 2.0 and then scrips and this is where you'll put your dot see em file

02:27.280 --> 02:32.380
nice and straight forward as it's just a matter of copying the file into that location.

02:32.380 --> 02:38.650
Once you've done that you'll be able to access the plug in and scripts on all users on the computer.

02:38.650 --> 02:43.660
Now it is possible to install it privately on the user itself.

02:43.660 --> 02:48.520
Now I'm not going to show you that in this lecture because that it's a little bit more involved and

02:48.520 --> 02:49.990
in general won't be needed.

02:49.990 --> 02:55.650
However I have linked the official resource so you can use that if necessary.

02:55.660 --> 02:58.970
If you do need that which I don't think most people would.

02:59.050 --> 03:03.190
Now onto the Mac version of what we've just gone through.

03:03.220 --> 03:08.320
However one welcome over to my Mac logged in remotely so it might be a little bit sluggish but otherwise

03:08.350 --> 03:09.710
we should be good to go.

03:09.940 --> 03:15.030
So let's go through the process now of installing a plug in and script on a Mac.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.320
First of all you need to go into finder.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.640
Once you're in Finder let me make this a bit bigger.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.180
You'll need to go to your applications folder.

03:22.300 --> 03:28.000
If you're unsure of where to find this you may need to turn it on under the find the menu and preferences

03:28.450 --> 03:29.860
on the side bar tab.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.740
There's an option here to enable the applications that might not be ticked on your computer.

03:35.740 --> 03:38.820
If you do ticket you'll be able to see what I can see here.

03:39.580 --> 03:46.000
On top of that's what you can also do if the site but isn't there is go to view and make sure that the

03:46.000 --> 03:49.600
side bar is in fact turned on.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.010
Now that we've got that out the way on a Mac it's ever so slightly different programs are often very

03:54.010 --> 03:57.790
self-contained so we have to open them up to view them.

03:57.790 --> 04:00.620
So find yourself your gimp installation.

04:00.790 --> 04:04.430
Right click on it and show package contents.

04:04.450 --> 04:10.560
Now you'll be able to not navigate in to the contents folder resources.

04:10.600 --> 04:16.480
And now we can see the two files we've seen before the p.c Installation the lib and the share.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.160
And once again it's exactly the same.

04:18.160 --> 04:27.440
You go to lib gimp 2.0 and plug ins to install any Python plugins and then under the shared folder.

04:27.450 --> 04:34.710
And once again it's gimp 2.0 and then if we go down we should see scripts.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.720
And this is where you put your script file.

04:37.750 --> 04:43.770
This is a global installation still apply to all users of gimp on this computer.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.220
If you want private installation again I will link to the documentation so you can do that.

04:49.300 --> 04:55.210
However unless you are sharing your computer with someone who is very specific about what they can see

04:55.210 --> 05:01.330
when they're using GIMP then of course that won't matter at all and often you'll be using very similar

05:01.600 --> 05:03.410
plugins anyway.

05:03.730 --> 05:08.790
And of course now we know where to put our s see em and python files.

05:08.890 --> 05:14.950
I think it's time for a challenge and your challenge is going to be to install the following plugins

05:14.990 --> 05:20.020
or in this case scrips So the Sprite sheet animations tiles.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.840
And this is the link for that on the gimp registry.

05:22.840 --> 05:27.290
I will also include these links in the resources as well for you.

05:27.340 --> 05:31.690
And then finally fuse layers in the registry as well.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.340
This is where you can find it.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.490
Once you've done that of course do check that they're working.

05:36.490 --> 05:37.750
Look at the documentation.

05:37.750 --> 05:42.540
Just read what's there and it'll show you where you need to go to see whether it's install properly.

05:42.640 --> 05:46.150
Reminder here that you will have to close gimp and reopen it.

05:46.240 --> 05:52.690
If you don't close gimp you may also have installation problems when trying to copy the files over into

05:52.690 --> 05:54.460
the program directory.

05:54.520 --> 06:01.180
And finally if you do come across any other scripts and plug ins do let the community know as by talking

06:01.180 --> 06:02.090
to one another.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.830
We can all get better with Gimp.

06:04.930 --> 06:05.550
So go ahead.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.920
Pulls a video now and give that a go.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.190
OK everyone welcome back.

06:11.190 --> 06:14.130
Let's go ahead and install these two scripts.

06:16.190 --> 06:17.350
Hey and welcome back.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.470
I have already gone to the links provided.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.900
So we've got the fuse layer and the Sprite sheets.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.160
The first thing we need to do of course is download them.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.510
So I'm going to click on Sprite sheet and I'm also going to click on Fuse layers.

06:30.650 --> 06:36.790
Now they're very very tiny they are essentially text files so they will download nice and quickly.

06:37.160 --> 06:43.220
Now on the fuse level we can see here it will appear under filters combine and fuse layers and with

06:43.220 --> 06:49.130
the Sprite she animation if we read down here we can see the run menu option will be filter's Sprite

06:49.130 --> 06:51.190
sheet and create from layers.

06:51.200 --> 06:56.780
Incidentally I actually have gimp open at the moment with something I'm working on so I close that down

06:56.780 --> 06:58.280
before I start.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.340
There we go.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.650
So now that's out of the way.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.870
It's a matter of going to our downloads directory.

07:03.880 --> 07:09.560
Theirs are two files and in this case I'm going to right click and cut and then I'm going to go find

07:09.560 --> 07:13.730
the right place and paste them in now because it's a script.

07:13.730 --> 07:21.110
We need to go in to the share folder gimp to point 0 and scripts then it's a matter of pasting them

07:21.110 --> 07:22.310
in.

07:22.310 --> 07:26.780
Now I have already done this so gives me a prompt to replace the files in the destination.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.990
That's absolutely fine.

07:28.010 --> 07:32.770
Now you may have permission issues copying to this folder.

07:32.810 --> 07:33.640
In this case.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.440
Absolutely fine to continue.

07:35.450 --> 07:39.440
Give its administrator rights and you can copy them across similar.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.410
On the Mac you may be asked to type in your max password when doing that.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.960
So now those two files are in and ready to go.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.240
Let's fire up gimp again and just do the quick tests.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.630
If you happen to install a script or plug in that is actually quite big.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.510
It might take a while to start back up again but this time not not so bad.

07:58.570 --> 08:04.460
Now if I remember correctly we go to filters and I can see Sprite sheet is right at the bottom create

08:04.460 --> 08:09.440
from layers that was the Sprite she won and the one fuse Lares was under combine and I can see them

08:09.470 --> 08:12.830
both they're brilliant installed and ready to go.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.030
How did you all get on.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.940
Did you have any issues installing.

08:15.950 --> 08:20.740
If you do do reach out for some help and I will see you will in the next lecture.
