00:05.280 --> 00:06.690
Congratulations guys.

00:06.690 --> 00:12.090
We've wrapped up this section and what I've seen so far you've done tremendously well and I've been

00:12.090 --> 00:16.320
having a lot of fun coming into the community site and looking at your creations as well it's amazing

00:16.320 --> 00:19.350
to see that you come on so quickly so you've mastered the basics of pixel art.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.540
You've got the basic brush tools all down.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.560
I hope you're enjoying Mikey.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.850
I think he's doing great.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.410
It's been lots of fun so far.

00:25.410 --> 00:26.210
More to come.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.970
So one of the keys here now to embed your knowledge is just spend a little bit of time going a tiny

00:29.970 --> 00:31.840
bit of an extra mile for us.

00:31.890 --> 00:35.400
Mike is going to give you a few challenges a few ideas right now as to things you could do with what

00:35.400 --> 00:37.150
you've learned so far so good that you're making.

00:37.290 --> 00:42.630
Well you can certainly go back to the previous challenges that we've had and use your knowledge you

00:42.630 --> 00:48.180
now have in order to improve them much much more than they already are specially Section 1 Challenger.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.120
So we have black and white images back there.

00:50.190 --> 00:51.940
Let's start adding some colour to them.

00:52.050 --> 00:56.480
Now also what you can do is we've already done composing images on top of one another.

00:56.570 --> 01:03.390
But how about building up a much larger image from combining 64 by 64 images like you've been doing

01:03.390 --> 01:04.480
in this section.

01:04.510 --> 01:05.060
That'd be cool.

01:05.070 --> 01:07.350
And whatever you do is a little bit of an extra mile.

01:07.390 --> 01:10.300
How did the resources go to the Q and A and share this with us.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.290
And there's another resource I'd like to share with you.

01:12.300 --> 01:16.830
We have our life chat service so you've been going to the forum community don't get rid of TV doing

01:16.830 --> 01:18.540
a wonderful job they're really busy.

01:18.540 --> 01:23.370
The other place you can go is for a live interaction to discord server we'll put a link in the resources

01:23.580 --> 01:25.290
that will give you an invite into our server.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.560
There's a hash arts channel in there.

01:27.570 --> 01:31.710
Go into that hash channel and that's a place that you can not only share what you've just done or ask

01:31.710 --> 01:36.680
for immediate help but you could also go in there and offer the community your help and so you know

01:36.680 --> 01:41.190
you guys have just learned some basic pixel art can make you a thing and that is one of the best ways

01:41.190 --> 01:46.260
of applying your knowledge is to apply on a real project but someone else is giving you that specification

01:46.260 --> 01:47.720
for absolutely.

01:47.730 --> 01:49.580
So congratulations on what you see.
