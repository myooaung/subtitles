00:04.300 --> 00:09.920
Okay so in this lecture we're going to focus on a black and white outline outlines are important they

00:09.920 --> 00:14.440
determine what the overall shape of whatever your drawing is.

00:14.540 --> 00:20.420
And we're going to use something called the pencil tool because it allows us to be precise either having

00:20.450 --> 00:24.590
a complete black or a complete white pixel and nothing in between.

00:24.590 --> 00:27.240
Like some of the other tools we'll be doing.

00:29.490 --> 00:32.670
Okay so let's go ahead and open up guimpe.

00:32.940 --> 00:36.450
So we've got our standard interface we're comfortable with that now.

00:36.460 --> 00:42.880
However we haven't laid a pixel down on a virtual sheet yet so let's go ahead and do that.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.610
First of all we of course we do need to create a new image.

00:46.650 --> 00:51.450
And as you've probably guessed by now it's under file and new.

00:51.480 --> 00:56.650
Now when you create a new image it will default to 640 by 400.

00:56.940 --> 01:03.210
And this default itself can be changed in user preferences that we've had a brief look at before.

01:03.360 --> 01:10.070
Now in this particular case we're going to zoom right in to 8 and 8.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.510
So I'd like you to make sure that the width and the height are both eight.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.920
You don't need to do anything else.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.620
Leave this as P. X..

01:16.620 --> 01:18.470
There are lots of other things you can pick.

01:18.630 --> 01:21.510
But we want pixels which is P X..

01:21.930 --> 01:24.450
Once we've done that we can go ahead and click okay.

01:24.540 --> 01:29.130
Now you're going to struggle to actually see what's going on at the moment.

01:29.130 --> 01:35.130
So we are going to need to zoom in and manage our zoom level as we're working as well.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.530
So how do we go about doing that.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.500
Well there are a couple of ways.

01:39.510 --> 01:45.450
Obs rooming in at the very bottom of the main window there is a drop down or in this case drop up because

01:45.450 --> 01:50.400
it's at the bottom that gives you various types of different zoom levels and if we select 800 we can

01:50.400 --> 01:54.390
see that the area we're working on is still quite small.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.180
How do we get even closer.

01:56.330 --> 02:02.040
Well we can do that by going to view and we can see here there are many many options that we can pick

02:02.040 --> 02:07.910
from and we can zoom in even further if we go to the Zune menu here we can see we can revert the Zune

02:07.920 --> 02:14.660
we can zoom in using the plus key zoom in out using the minus key we can fit the image in the window.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.520
And that is what I'm going to be using here.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.630
You can also see there are some other shortcuts one through five.

02:20.640 --> 02:25.200
So if we go ahead and hit five that's still not really big enough.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.500
It's gone to twice the size it was before.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.540
We can use the plus keys to zoom in or as we saw a moment ago there's some shortcut keys which I will

02:33.540 --> 02:39.470
be using in the moment of a to the right menu and that is shift control in J.

02:39.570 --> 02:42.390
Now do check on your system that might be slightly different.

02:42.450 --> 02:45.400
It might be Command shift and J on a Mac for instance.

02:45.510 --> 02:52.030
So if I go control shift and Jay is going to fill the screen with my image.

02:52.050 --> 02:52.920
In this case.

02:53.010 --> 02:56.250
Now let's get to laying down some pixels.

02:56.250 --> 03:01.890
So our first thing to do is pick a tool and for that we're going to need to use the tool box.

03:01.950 --> 03:05.350
Now the tool box is this area on the top left.

03:05.490 --> 03:12.960
That's got lots of different options in it ranging from selection tools to colour swatches to indeed

03:12.990 --> 03:19.440
a magnifying glass and we can see there a zoom tool so we can adjust the zoom level with the Z key as

03:19.440 --> 03:21.080
well as a shortcut key there.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.780
So if you hover over it will tell you what all of these tools are.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.430
Now we need a tool let's call the pencil.

03:27.570 --> 03:33.990
So we go ahead and find that yours might be laid out slightly differently or indeed just because you've

03:33.990 --> 03:41.820
got a different sort of zoom in level or window structure than myself.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.070
So we need this one here.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.110
The pencil tool.

03:44.240 --> 03:49.230
And if we hover over at weaknesses of the pencil tool it's a hard edge and I'd show you what that means

03:49.230 --> 03:50.030
in a moment.

03:50.130 --> 03:54.290
And there's a shortcut key which is n so you can use that to work with.

03:54.450 --> 04:00.900
Now if you just go ahead and select that you will notice that your icon itself on the on the cursor

04:01.110 --> 04:06.030
now has a little pencil next to it which is incredibly useful because if you've selected some other

04:06.030 --> 04:11.400
tool perhaps the zoomed tool you'll see that it changes to a magnifying glass or a looking glass.

04:11.550 --> 04:12.420
Let's go back.

04:12.420 --> 04:17.640
I'm going to use the shortcut key here and I'll switch back to the pencil and we can see that the cursor

04:17.640 --> 04:19.200
has also updated.

04:19.500 --> 04:25.680
Now one of the things you'll discover the moment you start using it is that if you click once the whole

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
thing goes black.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.270
That doesn't give you much control.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.000
How do we have a bit more fine control.

04:32.130 --> 04:37.350
Well we need to alter the tools options and we're going to do that now.

04:37.500 --> 04:43.440
So by going to tool options underneath you can see a series of options for that particular tool that

04:43.440 --> 04:44.410
you've selected.

04:44.460 --> 04:45.330
And if we go ahead.

04:45.330 --> 04:49.380
So it's another one I'm going to go back to the zoom you can see that it changes the options underneath

04:49.680 --> 04:50.900
back to the pencil.

04:50.970 --> 04:56.370
And we've got another series of options and the one that we really care about for the moment is the

04:56.370 --> 04:59.340
size option at the moment it's set to 20.

04:59.490 --> 05:03.150
And that means how many pixels wide it actually is.

05:03.150 --> 05:08.250
So I'm going to zoom out slightly longer and use the minus key on my keyboard and you can see there's

05:08.250 --> 05:15.140
this outline in dashes that that itself is 20 pixels wide by 20 pixels tool.

05:15.180 --> 05:21.300
That's why whenever we click at the moment it fills the entire image because our image is only eight

05:21.360 --> 05:28.880
by eight so we can control this by even clicking and dragging or indeed typing in a.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.310
No.

05:29.310 --> 05:35.400
So in this case I'm going to type in the number one and once I've typed in the number one you can see

05:35.400 --> 05:40.610
that that outlined area the dashed area has turned to one individual Square.

05:40.710 --> 05:45.960
And in fact you can see there at 8 across and that is incredibly useful because now we've got precision

05:45.960 --> 05:47.380
control over our image.

05:47.460 --> 05:53.110
And I'm going to zoom back in again use and control shift and Jay rather than the menu or anything else.

05:53.430 --> 05:58.800
So we've already had a brief look at the pencil at all as in we've selected it or you change the size.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.220
But what does it actually mean.

06:01.230 --> 06:08.670
Well in this particular case it means that it's hard edged and we can see that this outline is snapping

06:08.910 --> 06:10.830
to individual pixels.

06:11.490 --> 06:17.570
The other ones if we pick another tool that's capable of laying down colour like the paint brush you

06:17.610 --> 06:22.510
short kaise pay we go ahead and select that we can see that it's me.

06:22.530 --> 06:26.040
It's not as granular it is actually quite smooth.

06:26.280 --> 06:31.800
And also when you start laying down colour in a moment or in this case black and white you'll see that

06:31.800 --> 06:38.250
it is pixel by pixel which is why we're going to use the pencil tool and if we have a look when we hover

06:38.310 --> 06:44.370
over the pencil tool we see it says hard edge painting and that means that when we lay down a pixel

06:44.430 --> 06:47.990
it does not affect the pixels next to it.

06:48.030 --> 06:50.680
So at the moment our entire image is black.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.360
And that's no good.

06:51.360 --> 06:57.290
We need it to be white and we can select the white by simply going back over to our tool box and you'll

06:57.300 --> 07:02.430
see a little black and white square and next to it will be a double headed arrow.

07:02.430 --> 07:08.430
If you click on that it will switch between the background and foreground colours which in this instance

07:08.700 --> 07:11.010
are black and white by default.

07:11.010 --> 07:13.930
Now if we change it so white is the one on top.

07:13.950 --> 07:18.290
We can now start laying down some white individual pixels.

07:18.330 --> 07:24.150
Now just to highlight what would happen if you use the paint brush tool instead to do exactly the same

07:24.150 --> 07:24.830
thing.

07:24.840 --> 07:30.460
You'll notice that it changes more than one pixel at once and produces some greys.

07:30.590 --> 07:36.390
And we don't want that we want to use just monochrome at the moment one colour or another.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.990
Or in this case black or white.

07:39.010 --> 07:45.330
So I've gone in and I'm literally using my left mouse button there clicking and filling all the pixels

07:45.330 --> 07:46.430
in black again.

07:46.710 --> 07:50.510
Now you can switch quickly between these two using the x key.

07:50.700 --> 07:56.070
If I go ahead and hit it now we can see that they're switching backwards and forwards so I can lay down

07:56.550 --> 07:58.340
white white white white.

07:58.440 --> 08:03.290
And if I've made a mistake I can hit the x key and it goes back and I can hit it again.

08:03.300 --> 08:03.980
And there we go.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.050
I can start to make a chessboard perhaps.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.590
And of course as you're laying down pixels like this it starts to become obvious that you're going to

08:10.590 --> 08:17.850
make mistakes at a time but also that you don't have much room to move in when we've restricted you

08:18.120 --> 08:19.400
to something like this.

08:19.530 --> 08:24.100
And that is good because that really gets the creative juices flowing.

08:24.120 --> 08:30.420
Now say we've created a chessboard like this I'd like you to pay attention to the top left not right

08:30.420 --> 08:35.300
in the corner but we can see the top left of the image window itself.

08:35.310 --> 08:41.100
There is a smaller thumbnail of this picture that we've been working on and that's useful that gives

08:41.100 --> 08:46.980
you an idea of what it is actually looking like because when you've zoomed into this level it can be

08:46.980 --> 08:51.320
a bit disorientating as to how the image is looking overall.

08:51.390 --> 08:58.170
And so you can quickly glance up at this tab and there you can see your small icon coming together your

08:58.170 --> 08:59.880
symbol that you're making.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.730
Now of course at some point you will want to save your work.

09:02.730 --> 09:04.430
So let's go ahead and do that now.

09:04.620 --> 09:09.480
And if you're no stranger to a computer you will realize it's under the File menu and it will have its

09:09.480 --> 09:10.880
various shortcuts.

09:10.980 --> 09:17.720
Control shift in S will do save as we can save a copy to make a duplicate and again there are tool tips

09:17.720 --> 09:19.420
every time you hover over.

09:19.590 --> 09:22.090
And in this case I just want to save the image.

09:22.200 --> 09:28.730
So when you go ahead and click save it will not use the standard layout that you're used to.

09:28.740 --> 09:30.800
It has its own layout.

09:30.900 --> 09:34.320
In this case I'm on Windows and this isn't Windows Explorer.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.430
It's a variation upon.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.640
Now of course you want to make yourself a project folder.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.000
I've already got one so I'm going to go to that.

09:41.160 --> 09:46.860
And in this case I'm going to title this chequers or something along those lines because that's what

09:46.860 --> 09:49.660
I produce and I'm going to go ahead and click save.

09:50.400 --> 09:56.050
Now if I need to open that back up at any time I can go ahead and double click that on my file system.

09:56.220 --> 10:00.740
Or of course and go file open and it will remember where I've been working.

10:00.770 --> 10:06.730
We can see chequers just here X C F and XY F is a gimp file.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.890
It's not GNP or something along those lines it's actually scaf.

10:10.050 --> 10:15.960
Now the reason to save it as a proprietary file like this and not in something like a J.

10:15.960 --> 10:21.470
Edgar appear in G is the FCF will retain all of the settings that you've made in GIMP.

10:21.660 --> 10:29.040
Whereas if you go ahead and save it as a j peg or save it as a any other type of file that isn't fully

10:29.040 --> 10:33.180
guimpe compatible you start to throw away information.

10:33.180 --> 10:35.460
So an X C.F. is a Gift far.

10:35.490 --> 10:42.000
Go ahead and open that we've actually got two images the same open at the same time and we can see at

10:42.000 --> 10:46.200
the top there are tabs that we can switch between them both the same murena in this case.

10:46.890 --> 10:51.150
So we're going to have a bit of a race on which one is the updated one if we're not careful.

10:51.180 --> 10:57.240
However we see when we open it it's tiny again so we can use control shift n.j. to zoom back in and

10:57.240 --> 10:58.130
check it out.

10:58.860 --> 10:59.600
Excellent.

10:59.610 --> 11:03.600
So that's got a good grasp of the pencil tool and working in black and white.

11:03.810 --> 11:09.660
And of course that leads us nicely up to our challenge and your challenge is going to be to create an

11:09.720 --> 11:11.880
8 by 8 image.

11:11.880 --> 11:18.180
Use only the pencil tool and use only black and white with these constraints.

11:18.180 --> 11:23.130
We're going to be able to increase our creativity because you're going to have to think carefully about

11:23.160 --> 11:26.090
each pixel you're laying on the page.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.930
And I'd like to try drawing a smiling face.

11:29.970 --> 11:30.830
So go ahead.

11:30.830 --> 11:33.290
Pulls a video now and give that a go.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.240
Okay guys welcome back.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.700
Let's go ahead and try drawing a smiley face.

11:40.090 --> 11:43.790
Okay so we left off here before with some chequers on the screen.

11:43.810 --> 11:47.720
I'm going to go up to file new and create a new image.

11:47.740 --> 11:53.300
Now it's remembered what I had before eight by eight signed just going to go ahead and click okay.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.760
Don't need to type anything in there.

11:54.760 --> 12:00.210
And it does zoom in on I'm going to use those shortcut keys control shift in Jay to zoom right in.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.390
I can see we've got pixels.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.250
Have I got the pencil tool selected.

12:03.430 --> 12:04.170
Yes I have.

12:04.210 --> 12:06.300
And black is the foreground colour.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.590
That's going to be the one that I'm going to be painting with.

12:08.590 --> 12:14.780
Now I have obviously practiced this before I am going to go ahead and just lay down some pixels to try

12:14.780 --> 12:16.830
and make a circle to begin with.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.510
So it's go ahead let's move across here.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.760
So I think that's coming across as a circle.

12:22.870 --> 12:28.070
And remember any time and this is very fortunate it's more of a happy accident than anything else.

12:28.120 --> 12:33.400
We have a look along the very top of the picture that we're creating here.

12:33.430 --> 12:35.540
We see a couple of thumbnails.

12:35.710 --> 12:40.000
And so we can have a good idea of what this thumbnails going to look like what this image is going to

12:40.000 --> 12:42.690
look like even though we're quite zoomed in at the moment.

12:42.910 --> 12:44.260
So what have we got left to do.

12:44.260 --> 12:50.560
Well it's a face that's going to have a couple of eyes and it's smiling so let's go ahead and does that

12:50.560 --> 12:53.230
look at all good question.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.290
I think that's a little.

12:54.300 --> 13:00.940
I'm going to hit X to switch the foreground and background colours and basically lay down white on top

13:00.940 --> 13:02.260
of the black again.

13:02.260 --> 13:05.740
Now I'm going to shift that smile up a little and have another look.

13:05.890 --> 13:06.310
Yes.

13:06.310 --> 13:06.940
Brilliant.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.000
Like in how that's looking somebody ahead.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.280
Go file save.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.080
Make sure you save in an appropriate location.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.430
Going to have to find my location again.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.980
I'll pop it in a folder called Black and White called smile.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.600
And then I save that.

13:21.610 --> 13:22.790
And there we go.

13:22.810 --> 13:29.590
