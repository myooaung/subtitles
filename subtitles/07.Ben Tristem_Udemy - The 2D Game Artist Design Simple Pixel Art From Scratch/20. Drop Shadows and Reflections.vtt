00:04.320 --> 00:05.340
Hey welcome back.

00:05.340 --> 00:11.070
So in this challenge we are going to combine the knowledge that we've learnt in the last lecture but

00:11.070 --> 00:13.620
also all the previous ones as well.

00:13.620 --> 00:15.450
I do encourage that you do that.

00:15.450 --> 00:21.030
It's not just about solidifying the knowledge that you've just learnt but it's also about combining

00:21.030 --> 00:24.780
that with everything you've previously gone through as well.

00:24.780 --> 00:30.300
Obviously with a focus on what you've just covered so in this particular lecture I'd like you to go

00:30.300 --> 00:37.650
ahead and make a drop shadow for one of your icons then go ahead and make a silhouette of one of your

00:37.650 --> 00:38.220
icons.

00:38.220 --> 00:41.510
Does your icon work aged just a silhouette.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.350
Then try making a reflection.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.840
You can do this in several ways.

00:47.850 --> 00:52.610
I would suggest using the layer transform and flipping it vertically.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.400
That's just one.

00:53.790 --> 00:59.240
Give it to go and then think of other uses for your selections as well.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.970
I'd love to see what you guys can come up with and how creative you can be by using the selection tools.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.800
And then finally of course I want you to share your work.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.840
Be proud of how far you've come.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.130
There's some amazing work out there.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.090
So go ahead.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.670
Balls and video now and give that ago.

01:17.990 --> 01:18.590
Okay guys.

01:18.590 --> 01:19.240
Welcome back.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.930
Let's go ahead make a drop shadow.

01:20.930 --> 01:23.200
A silhouette and a reflection.

01:24.740 --> 01:26.270
Hey so welcome back.

01:26.270 --> 01:32.090
The first thing I'm going to do is work on making a drop shadow so I'm going to go ahead and open up

01:32.090 --> 01:35.720
one of my existing pieces of work to speed things along.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.750
In fact I am going to do it to the jewel swords that we've worked on in the past and I'm going to see

01:41.750 --> 01:47.570
if I can create a drop shadow so it actually gives our objects a bit more separation from one another

01:47.570 --> 01:51.690
so that this top one is in fact casting a shadow underneath.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.910
So I'm going to select that top sword sign over the top layer is the active layer.

01:56.930 --> 02:02.300
The next thing I'm going to do is just think carefully about how I'm going to go ahead and select that

02:02.300 --> 02:03.180
sword.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.760
There are two ways that I can think of easily.

02:05.900 --> 02:10.800
One is to select all the outer space all the parts that aren't the sort.

02:11.480 --> 02:15.140
And one is to select just the sword itself with the magic wand.

02:15.140 --> 02:21.680
Both of visa with the fuzzy Select Tool and with the threshold set all the way up to two under 55.

02:21.710 --> 02:23.690
I'm going to do that one.

02:23.690 --> 02:24.630
There we go.

02:24.650 --> 02:26.520
I have selected my sword.

02:27.590 --> 02:33.110
Now that I've done that I'm going to create a new layer and call it and drop shadow.

02:33.350 --> 02:33.960
Okay.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.230
Yeah that's that's good.

02:35.270 --> 02:45.020
And then I'm going to using the blend tool I'm going to go from one side to another but not from black

02:45.020 --> 02:45.920
to white.

02:45.920 --> 02:52.250
In this case I want foreground to transparence because if I go from black to white and I have any other

02:52.250 --> 02:58.180
colour background other than white it will look like it goes from black to white.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.740
And it would look horrible.

03:00.770 --> 03:03.550
So let's go ahead and draw that across.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.430
It's more shadowed one side and not the other.

03:06.500 --> 03:11.480
If I'm going to have more of it in shadow because there's the actual shadow itself is going to be sticking

03:11.480 --> 03:11.760
out.

03:11.780 --> 03:14.290
And of course this area here is completely faded.

03:14.450 --> 03:15.970
I'm going to hold down control and snap.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.810
That's about 45 degrees.

03:18.890 --> 03:21.320
I'm not sure if that's now too dark.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.550
We should try it by adding everything back in.

03:24.650 --> 03:31.820
Of course the job shadow needs to be underneath the sword it represents but it needs to be on top.

03:31.820 --> 03:38.680
Now what I could have done here is actually have moved the selection before doing that.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.670
And named have coloured it in and then I have seen the effect live.

03:42.680 --> 03:49.340
Instead what I'm going to have to do is with the drop shadow selected a hat and make sure move the active

03:49.340 --> 03:50.750
layer is turned on.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.210
I can then move that accordingly.

03:53.470 --> 03:55.980
Now we go we've got a drop shallower Yeah.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.040
Yes that is too dark.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.280
I'm not liking that Orson.

03:59.280 --> 04:05.630
You're going to burn that layer and this time move my selection slightly south.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.940
Like that's yeah I'm liking that.

04:09.080 --> 04:14.570
And then doing the same thing and this time new layer drop shadows fine.

04:14.660 --> 04:17.300
And this time I'll be able to see what's happening.

04:17.300 --> 04:23.240
Life rather than afterwards actually that's works out wonderfully and like in that already there we

04:23.240 --> 04:25.580
go there's the drop shadow done.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.100
Now was dummy here as well.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.440
I can do a silhouette.

04:29.450 --> 04:35.420
But I'm going to do a silhouette of both swords so I need to make sure that the drop show is hidden.

04:35.420 --> 04:40.580
I don't want to include it in any of my selections and we use the selection tool again that this time

04:40.580 --> 04:42.760
would sample the fuzzy selector.

04:42.770 --> 04:45.090
But this time sample merge turned on.

04:45.290 --> 04:51.190
Then I should be able to select everything in the House Select everything at that point in time.

04:51.230 --> 04:54.380
I don't want the background.

04:54.380 --> 05:00.050
So in this case I'm going to go the other way round the selected the transparency from my image sample

05:00.050 --> 05:07.220
most off select transparent areas on and let's start the sword at the top and turn the threshold back

05:07.220 --> 05:12.540
down to I think it was on 15 by the Flash be plenty.

05:13.190 --> 05:20.660
So that's our first selection done and I wants to do in the intersection.

05:21.540 --> 05:23.310
With this one here.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.790
It's go to the source behind there and there we go.

05:27.790 --> 05:33.760
It's cut out the area they're excellent and then the final thing is to go in with the shift key held

05:33.760 --> 05:34.500
down.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.940
Select these two blank areas here and with the other layer.

05:38.980 --> 05:42.610
Those two areas there I think.

05:42.610 --> 05:48.160
I'm not sure I think I've got everything I need to invert that selection so it's just the sword selected

05:48.580 --> 05:52.870
and then I'm going to create a new layer and I'm going to call it silhouettes.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.780
Can I spell silhouettes correctly.

05:55.780 --> 06:00.740
I think that's right and let's use the fill tool to fill that in.

06:01.740 --> 06:02.500
Excellent.

06:02.740 --> 06:03.820
There's my silhouette.

06:03.970 --> 06:06.310
Now does that work as a silhouette.

06:06.310 --> 06:12.000
It's often said that if you cannot recognize what something is baia It's cellaret.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.110
Then you need to work on it's a little more.

06:15.190 --> 06:19.420
Now I don't know whether I'm using the fact that I know that's a sword.

06:19.690 --> 06:26.230
I think that does kind of look like two swords cross but I'm not sure with them cross that it has the

06:26.230 --> 06:29.610
same effect as if it was just one sword.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.330
Because obviously you can't always tell.

06:32.440 --> 06:39.880
I mean if we were doing something those space themed one sword might even look like a rocket.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.890
So I'm liking what I've got there.

06:42.890 --> 06:48.590
I'm now going to open up another image of them to save this one as I've added new layers and I can turn

06:48.590 --> 06:50.680
them on and off as I want to.

06:50.900 --> 06:55.490
And I'm going to go ahead and open up my shields.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.080
Now when I put my shield.

06:57.110 --> 06:58.140
I think.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.350
It was in the Phil challenge.

07:01.350 --> 07:02.610
There it is.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.550
Says go ahead and zoom in.

07:04.620 --> 07:08.570
So we have our shield here and then there's not going to be too much room for reflection.

07:08.700 --> 07:15.870
And I've picked something that's circular here so we might not need to do a a reflection as such.

07:15.870 --> 07:21.120
But what I'm going to do here yes I will need to flip it because we got a brighter part of the shield

07:21.120 --> 07:24.030
so in the at it otherwise it won't really look like a reflection.

07:24.030 --> 07:25.470
So let's go ahead.

07:25.470 --> 07:31.260
I'm going to create a new image and bring them in I'm going to work with a slightly taller image so

07:31.320 --> 07:32.730
I'm going to work.

07:32.920 --> 07:39.180
Sixty four thirty two I could probably get away with forty eight but we're going to zoom in and I'm

07:39.180 --> 07:44.050
going to drag the shield on to that layer and drag it on again.

07:46.340 --> 07:51.340
Through two shields on top of one another one of these is going to be the reflected shield someone to

07:51.350 --> 07:54.320
put that in and called it reflection.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.850
And then we've got the shield here as well.

07:58.370 --> 08:01.470
So we've moved the shield up he says.

08:02.420 --> 08:03.980
I've got selection turned on.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.960
Make sure you've got the right tool enabled.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.290
And then I'm going to remove the reflection down.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.690
It's going to be reflected underneath.

08:11.570 --> 08:12.170
Okay.

08:12.170 --> 08:15.750
Now that doesn't look like a reflection at the moment.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.010
We need to do a couple of other things.

08:18.200 --> 08:23.790
Now reflections often strongest closer to the object even further away.

08:23.810 --> 08:30.710
So what I could do here is with the selection tool enabled I am going to go for the rectangular selection

08:30.710 --> 08:35.200
tool and I'm just going to select all I could just do everything on that layer.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.140
That would work pretty well.

08:37.240 --> 08:42.260
If I go ahead and create a new layer so I'm jumping about a bit here because I'm thinking on the fly

08:42.710 --> 08:48.310
that we could have a reflection mask here instead.

08:50.740 --> 08:57.880
Instead of having the entire image selected I'm going to have a reflection mask thirty two by 32 and

08:57.880 --> 09:01.590
then I'm going to move the layer down.

09:01.810 --> 09:05.080
So it's on top of the other shield.

09:05.350 --> 09:07.590
That's what I wanted the first time round.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.280
I will have my foreground colour as white.

09:10.300 --> 09:16.480
I'm going to use the blend tool and go from white to transparent and start at the base of the shield

09:16.870 --> 09:23.140
to the top of the shielding and a whole damn control so that's exactly vertical and don't do that a

09:23.140 --> 09:25.510
couple of times there we go.

09:25.660 --> 09:30.840
So that's now starting to look more and more like a reflection than anything else.

09:31.740 --> 09:37.920
I'm liking the way that's looking but the reflection shield itself does need to be Flip's it's go to

09:37.920 --> 09:38.690
layer.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.370
Transform.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.680
Flip that click.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.230
There we go.

09:45.230 --> 09:47.200
That is starting to look pretty good now.

09:47.210 --> 09:53.330
The one thing of course I need to bear in mind here is that we have a background layer and if that was

09:53.330 --> 09:55.550
some some other colour.

09:55.760 --> 10:00.730
Let's go for my fire palettes that I had before.

10:00.770 --> 10:04.460
So I got it here over in the gradients I've got my fire.

10:04.620 --> 10:08.780
We'll go to Grady and I'm going to just put that there on the background.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.480
So one of the issues here.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.260
Let's see if I can get this in the right place.

10:15.210 --> 10:15.460
Yeah.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.650
I'm happy with where that gradient is now that's been a bit.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.730
I had to play around with it a little.

10:20.790 --> 10:26.370
But what I'm not do is I'm not fading into the background so I'm going to go ahead and use the arrays

10:26.370 --> 10:29.230
tool and see if I can.

10:31.430 --> 10:34.160
Get rid of what we had previously.

10:34.250 --> 10:34.840
Okay.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.990
I'm liking that short term the reflection layer off and then the background layer.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.410
Yeah that's fine.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.830
So I want to blend this out 10 nothingness.

10:45.860 --> 10:52.490
So on the reflection with the blend tool we can see that it goes to a black so I can exploit that by

10:52.490 --> 10:54.370
going to the reflection mask.

10:54.530 --> 10:59.660
And this time going to a black as the foreground fell over rather than white.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.070
So let's try that.

11:01.130 --> 11:09.140
Obviously I need to change that from the fire back to foreground to transparent and and making sure

11:09.140 --> 11:10.530
we can see that layer.

11:11.810 --> 11:12.610
There we go.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.060
That's much better.

11:15.090 --> 11:22.800
So then to lift my shield up ever so slightly so all he says didn't have the move at all so we were

11:22.810 --> 11:25.520
gonna raise that up just a little.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.270
There's a little bit of separation between the two.

11:28.340 --> 11:31.040
I like how that's come across.

11:31.040 --> 11:36.010
Does look like your reflection in a dark murky water or something along those lines.

11:36.050 --> 11:37.330
How did you guys get on.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.600
I'd love to see your creations.

11:39.770 --> 11:45.560
Please do share them over in the discussions and I as always I will see you in the next lecture.
