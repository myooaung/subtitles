00:04.300 --> 00:05.390
Hey guys welcome back.

00:05.390 --> 00:11.060
In this video we're going to learn bit all about moving our lives making sure if two or more layers

00:11.060 --> 00:13.410
are supposed to move together they do do.

00:13.430 --> 00:18.570
Unlike this one in the background here he can see how that separate from the rest of the sword whereas

00:18.590 --> 00:19.940
this one is together.

00:20.180 --> 00:23.820
And then finally we'll learn about layer transforms as you can see here.

00:23.930 --> 00:27.140
These swords are a reflection of one another.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.500
It's been flipped around horizontally.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.540
Okay welcome back over into gimp.

00:32.540 --> 00:37.010
The first thing that we want to do here of course is to have an image to work with.

00:37.010 --> 00:39.260
So go ahead create a new image.

00:39.390 --> 00:42.240
Thirty to buy first two is absolutely fine.

00:42.260 --> 00:43.010
Click Okay.

00:43.050 --> 00:44.760
And I'm going to zoom all the way in.

00:44.780 --> 00:48.200
Control shift Jay now that I've zoomed all the way in.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.720
I need something on a layer.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.750
Now we already have one layer which is the background layer.

00:53.780 --> 00:57.720
I'm going to create a new layer and call this a circle.

00:57.890 --> 01:03.770
I'm going to make myself a circle that I can use to demonstrate and I'm going to use the pencil tool

01:04.100 --> 01:07.340
in order to generate a circle on the screen.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.090
Now I'm going to create a new layer.

01:09.900 --> 01:16.100
And call this one a red circle and I'm going to change the other one to black circle.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.930
Again I'm just double clicking there to change the name.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.470
Black circle.

01:21.910 --> 01:23.250
Back onto the red circle.

01:23.290 --> 01:24.490
Making sure it's active.

01:24.490 --> 01:26.940
I'm going to go find myself a red colour.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.180
And there we go.

01:28.210 --> 01:34.630
We've got a red and a black circle and of course I can swap the order of those circles over on the layers

01:34.660 --> 01:38.200
tab and I can also move them as well.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.540
Now the easiest way of moving them is to use the move tool and that is available on the tool box.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.690
It looks like a quadruple headed arrow.

01:45.780 --> 01:48.290
If we hover over it we can see the short key.

01:50.030 --> 01:56.330
If we hover over it we see the shortcut key is M and if we go over to the tools menu it's under the

01:56.360 --> 01:59.420
transformed tools and we have move.

01:59.450 --> 02:04.340
And you can see there are loads of other tools as well that we'll get to in the future with the move

02:04.340 --> 02:07.910
tool selected where we can move the red circle.

02:07.970 --> 02:13.420
If we go ahead and click on the red circle by default we'll be able to move it individually.

02:13.670 --> 02:19.270
And if we click on the black circle without changing layer you should be able to move that as well.

02:19.280 --> 02:25.340
If you can't and it's only the red layer that's moving you may find that under the tool options you've

02:25.340 --> 02:30.630
got move the active player selected rather then pick a layer or guide.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.930
Now if you can see here the tool toggle.

02:32.930 --> 02:38.320
So between these two options and those are pretty much the only options we've got is shift.

02:38.330 --> 02:43.570
So if I hold down Shift you can see that that will toggle between one and the other.

02:44.940 --> 02:50.020
Now why would you want to move the active layer rather than just clicking on the thing you want to move.

02:50.100 --> 02:57.690
Well if you have a more complicated scene than two circles it may be far more difficult to select the

02:57.690 --> 03:03.380
leader you want especially if there is some transparency as well that does make it very difficult to

03:03.380 --> 03:04.650
select layers.

03:04.650 --> 03:10.530
Now one of the other things that I will mention at this point in time is this border that is around

03:10.620 --> 03:17.730
our layer this yellow and black border represents the layer boundary and you can turn those dashes on

03:17.730 --> 03:18.200
and off.

03:18.210 --> 03:24.660
If we go to view and show layer boundary if we disable that that will disappear.

03:24.660 --> 03:28.110
Now sometimes I like it on because I know whether layer is.

03:28.230 --> 03:30.650
And sometimes I'm happy with it turned off.

03:30.660 --> 03:37.800
The reason why it might you might want it on for instance if I go to view and turn that back on now.

03:37.830 --> 03:42.420
So I wanted to colour in some more of this layer for whatever reason.

03:42.630 --> 03:48.180
I'm going to go grab a paint brush tool change a colour ever so slightly suit and see what I'm doing.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.500
Change it to blue.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.700
Notice that there is now a harsh edge.

03:52.710 --> 03:59.100
I can't colorin the bit in the back ground that's beyond the layer boundary.

03:59.100 --> 04:04.530
Now you can have layers to larger than the cameras you're working on but it's something just to bear

04:04.530 --> 04:10.020
in mind that if you do anything that's outside of the layer boundary which usually is the boundary of

04:10.020 --> 04:10.950
the entire canvas.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.010
But here it isn't.

04:12.140 --> 04:17.850
I'll do great example here in the lower corner I can line up a circle sets off the canvas and it looks

04:17.850 --> 04:20.060
like we've got a very sharp hedge here.

04:20.110 --> 04:25.710
If I go ahead and move so I'm going to go back to the move tool click and drag.

04:25.710 --> 04:32.240
This we can see that circle is in fact intact even though it was off the canvas itself.

04:33.430 --> 04:39.190
Finally if we've got something that we really like like this black circle here bring it to the foreground.

04:39.410 --> 04:47.710
Mary GOPe if I wanted to replicate that I couldn't do that under the layer menu under transform and

04:47.710 --> 04:50.320
I can flip that horizontally or vertically.

04:50.320 --> 04:57.730
Now a circle is probably not the best way of demonstrating this because whichever way I flip this or

04:57.730 --> 04:59.950
rotate it is isn't going to work.

05:00.130 --> 05:06.100
So I'm going to delete the layers that I have currently and I'm going to grab myself the pencil tool

05:06.100 --> 05:13.480
turn not the capacity unbeing blind turning the size down to maybe two and I'm going to put a Chevron

05:13.900 --> 05:18.550
on the screen itself roughly lined up with the sensor give or take.

05:18.550 --> 05:21.050
So we've now got something with direction.

05:21.370 --> 05:26.410
Now if I wanted to I could go to layar Transform and flip that horizontally.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.360
Now that Chevron is facing the other direction.

05:29.920 --> 05:38.040
If I wanted to I could just placate the layer we've currently got and then do a flip.

05:38.060 --> 05:45.310
So in this case I'm going to transform and flip horizontally and you're wondering why I can't see the

05:45.310 --> 05:47.140
actual other Chevron.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.040
Where has it gone.

05:48.370 --> 05:53.980
Well what's happened here is I've duplicated the background layer and the background layer has transparency

05:53.980 --> 05:58.070
turned off it's got no alpha channel in order to rectify.

05:58.080 --> 06:03.640
I could do my work again but if you have accidentally put something on the background layer what you

06:03.640 --> 06:06.370
can do is right click on the background.

06:06.520 --> 06:13.150
And if we go down towards the bottom we can see that there is an option to add an alpha channel and

06:13.150 --> 06:16.590
that it will then make it no longer bold.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.810
I can do the same to the other channel as well.

06:19.870 --> 06:24.030
So add a channel of a layer there and then.

06:24.330 --> 06:24.700
Wow.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.540
You still can't see it.

06:25.540 --> 06:27.100
We're going to have to remove the whites.

06:27.100 --> 06:31.330
That's their something we use the magic wand to do that and I'm going to select the white area press

06:31.390 --> 06:36.580
delete and the white hero on the inside and press today and I'm going to do the same for the other background

06:36.790 --> 06:37.580
as well.

06:37.870 --> 06:39.220
And there we go.

06:39.220 --> 06:46.070
We've made ourselves a reflection of the original image using the layer Transform Tool.

06:46.510 --> 06:52.610
Finally you may have spent a couple of minutes aligning these two Chevrons So they're perfect.

06:52.630 --> 06:58.350
If you want them to move together so no matter what else happens they stick together.

06:58.360 --> 07:04.500
You can go up into the layers tab and next to the eye there's another box that is hidden away.

07:04.540 --> 07:12.360
If you click that box you'll see a little chain link appears and that means that layer is linked but

07:12.670 --> 07:17.970
is not linked to any thing at the moment is just linked to itself.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.370
It needs to be linked to the one underneath.

07:20.380 --> 07:27.970
So we clicked that and now if we go ahead and grab the move tool whatever we do it moves both layers

07:28.210 --> 07:31.170
together not independently.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.130
It doesn't matter which one you select.

07:33.130 --> 07:38.250
They will both move and that's true of any layers that are linked together.

07:38.590 --> 07:44.290
If you unlink a layer then it will not move with anything else that's linked.

07:45.180 --> 07:49.450
And of course that allows you to adjust something when you're happy with it in its position.

07:49.470 --> 07:57.330
You can go ahead and link it again and there's one final way of ensuring that these two layers do move

07:57.330 --> 07:58.520
together all the time.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.200
And that is to make them one individual layer.

08:02.550 --> 08:07.660
And what we can do is we can merge the layer above to the layer beneath.

08:07.710 --> 08:14.730
Making it one individual layer we can right click and if you have a look down we see there's an option

08:14.730 --> 08:16.320
to merge down.

08:16.350 --> 08:18.870
You can also do this in the layers menu.

08:19.030 --> 08:22.000
No see merge down is there as well.

08:22.170 --> 08:26.730
Now when it's merged down it basically brings the two layers together.

08:26.910 --> 08:29.130
And if you had many many more.

08:29.130 --> 08:32.390
So let's go ahead and create a couple more layers.

08:33.800 --> 08:38.110
When you merge down as we can see here and then emerge from the top one down.

08:38.270 --> 08:40.780
It only merges one at a time.

08:40.790 --> 08:43.540
You can do the entire image at once.

08:43.550 --> 08:50.300
If you wanted to but it would be very rare that you wanted to flatten absolutely everything so that

08:50.300 --> 08:53.910
you lose all of the benefits that layers have.

08:54.110 --> 09:01.080
However if you were constructing a cross like this in the first place then merging down is a deal.

09:01.210 --> 09:05.760
And of course in the next lecture will be able to hone our skills in the form of a challenge and I will

09:05.780 --> 09:08.140
see you over in that next lecture.
