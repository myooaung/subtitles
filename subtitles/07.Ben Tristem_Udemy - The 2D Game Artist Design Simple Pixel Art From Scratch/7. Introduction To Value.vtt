00:04.290 --> 00:12.590
In this video we're going to have a look at value now Val you is going to enable us to use greyscale

00:12.630 --> 00:18.170
So not only will we now have black and white but we will also have the shades of grey in between.

00:18.330 --> 00:25.320
And this gives us much more freedom than we had with just the black and white when using outlines it

00:25.320 --> 00:29.580
can improve image by giving an a sense of depth.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.620
We can have implied shadow even highlights as well.

00:33.840 --> 00:39.700
And this starts to give some shape and feel to the images that we're creating.

00:39.720 --> 00:43.400
So let's dive in now and take a closer look at value.

00:43.510 --> 00:49.770
Okay so we will start off here by having a little look at the Wikipedia article on Hugh saturation and

00:49.770 --> 00:50.580
value.

00:50.680 --> 00:57.180
Now this is quite an in-depth article and quite long I have linked it in the resources and in the video

00:57.180 --> 00:57.990
description.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.470
So please do check that out if you would like to learn more.

01:01.500 --> 01:07.920
But suffice to say value refers to how bright something is or how dark Something is with a value of

01:07.920 --> 01:11.840
1 or 100 percent being bright i.e. white.

01:11.850 --> 01:19.410
And if we tone that back down all the way back to black of course when there's no light coming off our

01:19.500 --> 01:20.490
object.

01:20.490 --> 01:26.670
So let's go ahead and play with that now by opening up gimp and finding out how we can adjust the value.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.460
So now that GIMP is open how do we go about doing this.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.150
Well there are a couple of ways of altering the value itself.

01:33.150 --> 01:33.840
We can do it.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.310
First of all from these little colour swatches the foreground and background colour if we go ahead and

01:38.310 --> 01:43.770
click on either one of those I'm going to pick the foreground colour we can see the options that come

01:43.770 --> 01:43.980
up.

01:43.980 --> 01:51.150
Give us a huge saturation and value slider all that we can use to control the value as we see as we

01:51.150 --> 01:53.110
bring that up to 100 percent.

01:53.130 --> 01:59.550
It goes bright white and it goes through all the way back down to black when it's zero.

01:59.550 --> 02:02.540
Now I prefer having something to hand straight away.

02:02.550 --> 02:09.540
So in these tool options I'm going to add another tab and that tab is going to be the colours tab.

02:09.990 --> 02:14.410
So this is brilliant We're starting to customize our interface immediately.

02:14.430 --> 02:17.750
I quite like this particular view of the tab.

02:17.850 --> 02:20.700
However there are others you can pick from as well.

02:20.730 --> 02:26.130
If we go along here we can see different versions the palette versions quite nice because you've got

02:26.400 --> 02:31.080
10 percent changes in gradient so it's nice and easy to read pick a colour and we'll use the colour

02:31.080 --> 02:32.880
picker in a moment as well.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.460
And we've got the sliders that we saw a moment ago as well.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.540
So let's go ahead now and create ourselves a new image.

02:39.540 --> 02:42.710
It's going to be eight by eight like the last lot have been.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.980
And of course we're going to zoom into that image.

02:45.180 --> 02:51.130
Now let's switch to the pencil tooled tool options and turn the size of our brush down to one.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.540
So we've got pixel level control.

02:53.750 --> 02:57.990
I don't use the excuse to switch the background colour and then back again.

02:58.070 --> 02:59.780
Excellent everything's working here.

02:59.880 --> 03:07.680
Now before we rush in and do something else let's say you've gone in and you've put in some shades of

03:07.680 --> 03:14.310
grey here there and everywhere and you want to pick a shade that you've already used before and you

03:14.310 --> 03:20.770
haven't been forward thinking enough to pick a 10 percent gradient so you can't just use it again.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.170
Well what can we do here.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.630
Well we can use what's called the colour pickup and that is a one that looks like a little pet.

03:27.630 --> 03:29.060
You can see the option there is.

03:29.130 --> 03:36.640
Oh and this is incredibly useful once you've laid down a particular shade and you want to reuse it.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.780
If we use the colour picker we can pick any of the ones that we've currently got on screen.

03:41.790 --> 03:47.940
And if you pay attention to the little colour swatch indicating the foreground colour why go ahead and

03:47.940 --> 03:48.630
select.

03:48.630 --> 03:54.230
We can see it's changed or this one and it's changed or this one this change or this one.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.670
And it has changed.

03:55.830 --> 04:01.530
So it's a very quick way of picking up colours or in his case shades that you've already laid down on

04:01.530 --> 04:02.320
the screen.

04:03.080 --> 04:10.820
Now if you completely mark up and this is non-standard anymore you perhaps you've managed to get it

04:10.820 --> 04:15.440
to green and pink or something along those lines and you don't want that.

04:15.440 --> 04:21.050
You can very quickly resets the foreground and back colour to black and white by clicking the little

04:21.050 --> 04:22.690
icon like I did just then.

04:22.880 --> 04:28.030
That's to the lower left of this foreground and background selector.

04:28.130 --> 04:34.290
Or if you want to you can simply hover your mouse over and press the key.

04:34.390 --> 04:40.730
That will also default back to black and white which is incredibly useful when you need to dive in and

04:40.730 --> 04:48.230
change that and perhaps add a splodge of black to our scenes or just press anywhere to colour in the

04:48.230 --> 04:48.790
top.

04:48.860 --> 04:49.670
Black.

04:49.670 --> 04:56.480
Now one of the things that you will notice when it comes to using shades now is it gives you more space

04:56.480 --> 05:02.630
to play with it not only gives you more variety so you can start introducing shadow and light areas

05:02.630 --> 05:08.480
dark areas and highlights as the other important thinkers you can suddenly put a layer of white down

05:08.810 --> 05:12.290
to really accent a certain part of your model.

05:12.500 --> 05:19.430
So if we do less of our picture and we've got a highlight there in the middle and if we think back to

05:19.460 --> 05:28.580
the original face that we had by using greyscale by starting to use shade completely we actually give

05:28.580 --> 05:30.080
ourselves more space.

05:30.170 --> 05:37.490
So if you think about the first head for tiny duru that looks something along these lines you cannot

05:37.610 --> 05:39.450
really use.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.630
Let's go in.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.690
Or both of them are black.

05:41.690 --> 05:42.560
That's not useful.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.880
Hover over D key.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.680
There we go.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.150
So this was the head before and where the eyes went it pretty restricted.

05:51.170 --> 05:54.870
You know they had to go here basically.

05:55.010 --> 05:56.650
And maybe the mouth here.

05:57.080 --> 06:03.640
Now when it comes to using shade we can negate the fact that it's got a border.

06:03.650 --> 06:07.510
The border becomes part of our particular.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.550
I'm going to highlight around the edge here perhaps a bit of.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.690
Shading around here.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.190
Now we've got more space to put the eyes wherever we want.

06:16.190 --> 06:19.830
In fact there is probably still a good location for them.

06:20.820 --> 06:26.930
And you can see we can get a graduated feel across our models a hero might pick that might go a little

06:26.930 --> 06:27.350
darker.

06:27.350 --> 06:30.170
Go there go a little darker again and go here.

06:30.320 --> 06:36.530
And finally go a little darker and go there and it just adds to the effect it makes it look as if our

06:36.590 --> 06:41.750
image itself has a shape to it has a gradient to it as well.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.650
And that is great.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.090
We can use it for highlights.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.530
We can use it for shadows.

06:45.590 --> 06:49.070
And now of course you guys can use it for a challenge.

06:50.060 --> 06:55.520
Okay so your challenge is going to be to create three to five more eight by eight images.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.300
So try describing man warts dog in a park.

07:00.140 --> 07:02.650
Use only grey scales and no colour.

07:02.650 --> 07:09.010
You can obviously use black and white there at the far ends of the grey scale export your three to five

07:09.010 --> 07:17.100
images as pangea's at 32 by thirty two ready for sharing and share your work so far.

07:17.130 --> 07:19.590
Pause video now and give that a go.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.580
Okay guys welcome back.

07:23.580 --> 07:28.980
Let's see what I came up with when trying to describe man walks dog in a park.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.140
Okay welcome back.

07:31.140 --> 07:33.920
So let's go ahead and see what I've come up with.

07:34.110 --> 07:37.350
And let's go and open our work up.

07:37.350 --> 07:40.140
So I have gone to the wrong place here.

07:40.140 --> 07:44.420
Bear with me a few seconds as I find the right folder.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.030
Here we go.

07:46.140 --> 07:50.490
So one of the things that we've got going on here is a bit of a mess.

07:50.490 --> 07:53.670
Now we've got two projects or two little profit.

07:54.690 --> 08:00.880
We've got two little projects right on top of one another now rather than trying to organize it in here.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.430
I'm going to try and organize it outside of guimpe.

08:06.030 --> 08:10.870
So I just closed down that dialogue for the moment and opened up a folder.

08:10.980 --> 08:15.570
So we have a black and white work that we've been working on.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.010
So black and white.

08:18.300 --> 08:24.270
And I'm going to move the black and white things that we've been working on like but Chequers the bowling

08:24.270 --> 08:32.540
ball the whole what where else was the hearts and the smile just smile which opened up and check yes.

08:32.550 --> 08:34.810
Yes it was a move that into the black and white.

08:34.980 --> 08:40.240
And this expo is all to do with the black and white as well but would pretty much done with it now.

08:40.320 --> 08:40.980
I've used it.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.870
I've exported.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.420
I'm going to get rid of that so there's no confusion now.

08:45.450 --> 08:47.400
The next one is the greyscale.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.420
So I've got my dog grey smile Grey walked free.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.690
And there we go.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.180
So let's move those it's great.

08:53.340 --> 08:59.270
And then I can go through and show you what I've done of course I've got some export stuff here as well.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.390
And I forgot to export that into its own folder.

09:03.390 --> 09:04.300
By the looks of it.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.940
So it is useful to clean up as you go.

09:06.960 --> 09:13.110
You will find that you end up with hundreds of images and it's good if they are filed away logically

09:13.110 --> 09:18.720
So if we go into greyscale I'm just going to close down the two faces I've got open there.

09:18.930 --> 09:24.840
And with gimped still open I can go in here and let's see what's the story man.

09:24.870 --> 09:31.230
So let's go for a grey smile because he's a happy man and goes for a walk with his dog in the park.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.580
So dog walk grey walk free.

09:34.620 --> 09:38.240
So this was a bit of an interesting one for me.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.180
Let's zoom in.

09:39.180 --> 09:40.140
These are all eight by eight.

09:40.140 --> 09:40.740
Of course.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.150
Let's start on the face.

09:42.150 --> 09:46.980
So this isn't probably the best you can get with with the face.

09:47.010 --> 09:50.670
It doesn't really add that much more the mouth is in a different position.

09:50.670 --> 09:56.440
And it's kind of shaded your of course assuming there's a light coming in from a certain side.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.410
But it is it does feel like a larger head than me.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.810
Black and white one now is the dog.

10:02.820 --> 10:05.310
This was an interesting one at eight by eight.

10:05.310 --> 10:07.030
Let's zoom in.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.210
There's not much to work with.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.560
How did you guys get some of this.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.410
I'm looking forward to seeing your dogs.

10:13.620 --> 10:16.170
That's probably as close as I'm going to be able to get.

10:16.170 --> 10:19.910
It reminds me of maybe a terrier or something along those lines.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.850
Let's have a look at takes.

10:22.860 --> 10:24.720
So putting shoes on this is the best.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.120
OK.

10:25.410 --> 10:27.480
Can I come up with for a shoe.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.870
Then we've got walking.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.530
And so this is a chap trying to walk.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.140
Not sure of it's come across.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.800
Well it kind of looks like someone walking.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.130
No arms though no space but arms.

10:39.300 --> 10:45.560
So that was a tricky one to get across and the tree the tree was probably the most fun.

10:45.850 --> 10:50.520
Putting all these different shades of grey in trying to make sure that it looks like it's got leaves

10:50.520 --> 10:53.490
on it and different varieties different shades.

10:53.550 --> 10:59.640
And of course you'll notice that the background itself is a white still.

10:59.640 --> 11:06.660
Now you could of course use a different coloured background or a different shaded background.

11:06.720 --> 11:12.460
And like I've done with the floor down here it makes it look like it's got some depth to the image as

11:12.480 --> 11:13.350
well.

11:13.410 --> 11:15.200
So that's my little story there.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.000
I'm now going to go ahead and post those.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.120
Over on the forum myself I hope you guys have done that as well.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.490
I look forward to seeing them and I will see you guys in their next lecture.
