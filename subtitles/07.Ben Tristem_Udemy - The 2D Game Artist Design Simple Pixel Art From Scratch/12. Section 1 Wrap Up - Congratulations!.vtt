00:04.770 --> 00:08.010
Congratulations guys you've made it through the first section.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.870
Well done for getting this far.

00:09.990 --> 00:10.500
Absolutely.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.270
And these may seem like very humble beginning beginnings but they are a solid foundation for you to

00:15.270 --> 00:15.690
build on.

00:15.690 --> 00:17.630
Hopefully you feel more comfortable with gimp's interface.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.840
Hopefully feel a little bit more comfortable with actually representing things visually even inside

00:21.840 --> 00:23.180
that very simple constraint.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.900
So if they think that my kids aren't quite as complete as they could be maybe missing features like

00:27.900 --> 00:29.590
transparency what are we going to do.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.650
Well as we progressed through the course we always ask you to revisit your previous projects you've

00:34.650 --> 00:40.290
been working on and actually apply the new knowledge you've learned whether it's using layers transparency

00:40.500 --> 00:45.180
et cetera et cetera there's lots more to learn and apply them to your previous projects as well thus

00:45.180 --> 00:46.970
improving them and your knowledge.

00:47.390 --> 00:48.160
As we're going.

00:48.270 --> 00:52.140
But notwithstanding that this is the time to share what you've already done on the forum put yourself

00:52.140 --> 00:52.590
out there.

00:52.650 --> 00:56.880
Sherry in the same space with all of the other people regardless of the fact you know you could do better

00:56.880 --> 00:58.610
later let's share it right now.

00:58.620 --> 01:02.790
Support each other by sharing if you share it makes somebody else feel more comfortable sharing and

01:02.790 --> 01:04.870
is create a virtuous circle.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.880
And the very best icons we find We'll upload to the forum and let everybody use that.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.260
So.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.520
Well let's dive on now into the next section straightaway and let's get cracking over in GIMP.
