Hey guys so inevitably throughout this course you're going to have a couple of questions.

00:08.340 --> 00:14.130
We all come across stumbling blocks and that is what the question and answer session is all about.

00:14.160 --> 00:18.750
And when you are posting a question try to remember to put against the specific lecture that you're

00:18.750 --> 00:22.550
currently taking because it helps us understand whereabouts you're having difficulties.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.110
And of course if you've got an answer even yourself if you've come up with it yourself or someone else

00:28.110 --> 00:30.860
has helped you or ask please do mark the top answer as well.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.970
So other people with a similar question can also find that answer.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.080
And also it really helps us to skim past things that have been resolved.

00:38.100 --> 00:38.630
Yes.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.960
So when you're asking a question what really helps us is to make sure that you give enough detail that

00:42.960 --> 00:46.020
we've got a chance of reproducing the issue.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.220
So if it's a question about artistic style or something then you're just going to have to phrase it

00:50.220 --> 00:51.980
the best you can but it is a technical question.

00:52.080 --> 00:57.420
It's really helpful if you give us a screen shot for example or if you just give us some steps by which

00:57.480 --> 01:01.740
other people can jump in and go oh yeah that's how they've got the problem so that we can suggest solutions

01:02.300 --> 01:03.030
to them.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.370
Hey so now would be a great time to also go ahead and show you guys are Facebook group that you can

01:08.370 --> 01:09.650
come and join as well.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.180
If you are on Facebook.

01:11.370 --> 01:17.370
Facebook dot com for Slash groups forward slash game art course join us over here.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.480
And this is just yet another place where you can share your work with us.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.670
Facebook can be a little bit more immediate.

01:23.670 --> 01:27.860
Everybody seems to use it these days for not only work but also pleasure.

01:28.050 --> 01:30.120
So you can join in the polls that we do.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.640
You can share work as we can see you here.

01:32.730 --> 01:34.080
You can ask questions.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.270
That's another thing that you can do on here.

01:36.360 --> 01:41.100
It's brilliant to see you guys wherever you want to share your work so please do come and join us now

01:41.310 --> 01:42.970
over on the Facebook group.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.070
And then of course we have our community site as well.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.000
So the other thing is that if you've got something you want to share with us that's not a question you

01:50.010 --> 01:52.990
just want to share your work then you do that as one of our discussions forum.

01:53.010 --> 01:56.820
Now the way to find that forum is there is a link against this very lecture and you can bookmark that

01:56.820 --> 01:59.800
link or keep a reference to it for later in the intersection.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.710
Then you've got a subsection for every every part of the course.

02:02.850 --> 02:05.670
So Section 1 that's where you share your work.

02:05.670 --> 02:10.280
You can embellish it with rich text and with numbers and bullets and lots of images.

02:10.350 --> 02:11.130
That's the important thing.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.120
The images we want to see though and we want you to beat the blending groups.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.190
Keep an eye on the number of posts per week on the blended group.

02:16.190 --> 02:17.280
There's going to be hundreds.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.180
See if we can beat them.

02:18.240 --> 02:18.930
Yeah.
