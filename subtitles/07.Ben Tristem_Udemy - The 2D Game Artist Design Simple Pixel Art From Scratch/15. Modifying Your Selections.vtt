00:05.150 --> 00:06.140
Hey welcome back.

00:06.140 --> 00:11.360
So in this lecture we're going to have a look at modifying our selection and how you can see here with

00:11.360 --> 00:13.130
the image on the right.

00:13.130 --> 00:20.900
We have the outline of the sword the selected and we can expand that selection to get an image like

00:20.930 --> 00:26.960
one on the right where we then fill in that surround with even a rejon Shadow or in this case a gradient

00:26.960 --> 00:28.920
fill across.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.040
Behind the sword.

00:33.060 --> 00:39.810
Another example that we can do if we start to modify our selections is take the sword again and then

00:39.810 --> 00:42.900
create a border around our sword.

00:42.900 --> 00:49.240
Now this isn't quite as fluid as drawing it by hand as you can see it's a bit more jagged.

00:49.250 --> 00:54.270
However it is a great starting point and it will also enable us to draw some perfect circles.

00:54.270 --> 00:59.390
If you need an a circular outline or indeed a border around your project as well.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.600
So let's get going now.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.340
Overing guimpe and explore modifying our selections.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.400
Okay so welcome back over into game and the first thing that we need to do here is just make sure that

01:11.400 --> 01:14.310
we've got an image open so we can work on it.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.740
So it's go ahead create a new image thirty two by thirty two.

01:17.970 --> 01:23.100
And let's zoom in so we can see everything now that we've done this we can start to play with the selection

01:23.100 --> 01:23.840
tools.

01:23.940 --> 01:29.940
Now at this point in time I'd like to introduce you to two new selection tools because we they have

01:29.970 --> 01:36.750
attachments on them that we can use to modify at the actual selection itself as we've created it.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.150
Those two are the first two items in our tool box.

01:40.260 --> 01:47.820
The rectangular select and the Ellipse select there are available also in the Tools menu under selection

01:48.090 --> 01:54.120
tools and we have here rectangle select an ellipse select and you can also see if you want to you can

01:54.120 --> 01:58.660
use the R and E keys respectively to select those stores.

01:58.740 --> 02:02.550
So let's go ahead now and select a rectangle select.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.880
Now as always with the tool options there are a series of one specific and generic to the selection

02:08.880 --> 02:09.480
tools.

02:09.540 --> 02:15.720
We've got the different modes that we've already explored previously anti-aliasing currently has a tic

02:15.810 --> 02:21.170
against it and it's greyed out that prevents us from actually turning that off.

02:21.210 --> 02:28.130
We have feathered edges feathered edges make the edges slightly blurring here essentially rounded corners.

02:28.130 --> 02:34.340
Well if you've rounded a corner on a square essentially it eventually becomes a circle as a square of

02:34.350 --> 02:35.730
course I mean a rectangle.

02:35.730 --> 02:40.920
In this case because it's the rectangle tool expand from the centre is really useful more so for the

02:40.920 --> 02:43.990
Ellipse tool than for the square.

02:44.070 --> 02:48.420
But with that turned on instead of you starting from an edge and pulling it across as we'll see in a

02:48.420 --> 02:54.270
few moments as he starts from the centre then we've got aspect ratios because he's one to one and we

02:54.270 --> 03:00.510
can fix that and if we fix an aspect ratio it will maintain that aspect ratio and if it's one to one

03:00.960 --> 03:07.270
a rectangle that has an aspect ratio of 1 to 1 so is height and width of the same is a square.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.660
Then we have position so we can modify its position on the screen and its size.

03:11.670 --> 03:15.050
Well let's stop talking about that all options themselves and explore them.

03:15.060 --> 03:23.880
Now if you click in drag with the rectangle Select Tool selected as you can see here we get ourselves

03:23.940 --> 03:29.400
a rectangle and it has some modifications that we can do to it straightaway we can go to any of the

03:29.400 --> 03:35.970
top sides or bottom all the corners and modify our selection.

03:35.970 --> 03:41.850
The corner will drag it in and out from that perspective we can use the top selection to move it's taller

03:41.910 --> 03:47.430
or shorter or one on the side to make it wider or narrower.

03:47.430 --> 03:50.490
Now there are a couple of modification keys that we can use.

03:50.490 --> 03:54.600
I'm going to clear my selection to start again with control shift and a.

03:54.810 --> 03:57.550
Also available under select none.

03:58.390 --> 04:04.120
So if I go ahead and start dragging out a now if I hold down Shift no matter what it aspect ratio currently

04:04.120 --> 04:04.660
is.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.560
You see here.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.870
It's locked to a tiny rectangle.

04:08.890 --> 04:10.970
I'll go ahead and hold shift at this point.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.360
It'll branch out to a square.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.610
I'm hoping E Yes it is.

04:16.930 --> 04:18.080
And there we go.

04:18.420 --> 04:24.670
Now if we've got some other aspect ratio perhaps twice the height as we've got here I can go ahead and

04:24.670 --> 04:27.330
hold down Shift and it will maintain that.

04:27.490 --> 04:30.700
But do make sure you click first before you hold down Shift.

04:30.710 --> 04:37.900
Otherwise you're now using the modification tool on the Select Tool to add a selection rather than a

04:37.900 --> 04:40.150
modification of the selection.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.050
Confused.

04:41.050 --> 04:44.730
Very easy to get confused when using a modifier key.

04:44.740 --> 04:49.960
The does two things depending on if you've clicked something first or not and then a clear that selection

04:49.960 --> 04:54.100
straw another rectangle roughly the right size as it was before.

04:54.100 --> 05:00.220
Now if I click and start moving this but now hold down Shift it will maintain the aspect ratio that

05:00.220 --> 05:02.310
it had previously.

05:02.410 --> 05:08.470
If I hold down control when I'm starting the selection it will appear from the centre.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.790
Now this I find more useful.

05:10.810 --> 05:17.050
If we use the circle so let's go ahead and try that the circle select another hole down.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.020
You can see I've started from the centre of our image.

05:20.140 --> 05:24.920
Now I just hold down control it will now expand from the centre.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.900
Or certainly where I clicked from which is close to the centre.

05:28.120 --> 05:32.980
And if I hold down Shift as well it will lock itself to a perfect circle.

05:33.100 --> 05:38.290
So if you need to actually draw a circle this is a great way of going about it.

05:38.290 --> 05:43.110
Nakasi Over on the tool options we get a similar set of options as well.

05:43.120 --> 05:49.880
Now there's one final way that I want to discuss modifying your selection in this particular lecture.

05:49.890 --> 05:57.040
Although there are some more afterwards as well that will cover later on we have the select menu.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.200
Now this is going to modify the selection directly.

06:00.220 --> 06:03.960
We've got obviously the different types that we can pick from.

06:04.150 --> 06:12.980
But here there's three and so I want to draw your attention to shrink grow and border the others.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.940
In this particular section I personally don't find they work too well at this low resolution.

06:22.390 --> 06:28.180
So let's focus on shrink if we go ahead and click on shrink it gives us the number of pixels that we

06:28.180 --> 06:29.410
want to shrink it by.

06:29.410 --> 06:32.960
And I could type in a safe for there and press.

06:32.970 --> 06:33.770
Okay.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.660
And we can see Strunk the selection accordingly.

06:36.790 --> 06:43.300
And this can be great if you're trying to create a shadow or perhaps some other effects or even just

06:43.360 --> 06:45.710
the selections to begin you need to make it smaller.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.810
And it uniformly does it around the entire thing.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.920
Now you can also make it larger by going to the next home which is grow.

06:53.920 --> 07:01.420
And if we also grow by four pixels there's no guarantee it's going to go back to how it was before.

07:01.630 --> 07:06.970
That's something important to remember especially if you're shape's not a regular shape like the circle

07:07.030 --> 07:08.590
I've got in front of me.

07:09.230 --> 07:14.480
The last one is incredibly useful if he wants an outline around your selection.

07:14.630 --> 07:21.560
If you go to select and go to border what we can see is we can have a border around our selection and

07:21.710 --> 07:26.520
a select set one pixel in this particular case and click okay.

07:26.690 --> 07:33.950
And we can see that it's got a one pixel border starting from the outside inwards for our selection

07:34.010 --> 07:41.660
and then you could grab something like the blend tool and have an outline like so and this is incredibly

07:41.660 --> 07:48.190
useful if you've used perhaps the fuzzy selects all in order to select something like our sword which

07:48.200 --> 07:49.070
I could do here.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.850
I could go and open up the saw.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.030
We've been working on.

07:52.190 --> 07:56.240
I can zoom in because see here this is something I've been playing with.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.390
I'm going to turn it off for the moment.

07:58.490 --> 08:03.300
And what we can do is find a sword itself on the layers.

08:03.350 --> 08:10.690
Remember that selections go over layers we can see here actually I have done if I turn everything off.

08:10.850 --> 08:11.270
There we go.

08:11.270 --> 08:16.970
I have actually done this I've created a border around my selection itself.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.580
I can go ahead here and put a gradient in.

08:18.590 --> 08:24.670
I'm going to create a new layer to do that on and I'm going to call it gradients or even sword gradients.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.890
It's important to get your naming sword breeds.

08:29.060 --> 08:32.920
And now I can draw a gradient across my sword like so.

08:32.980 --> 08:40.280
And of course that could be amazing for a place holder or even just for an effect such as something

08:40.280 --> 08:47.180
being selected like this sword here or a shadow in the background or in this case it didn't make a shadow

08:47.660 --> 08:51.200
more of a colourful background for us sword.

08:52.580 --> 08:58.580
Finally whilst were playing with the selection tools I want to have a quick look back at the circle

08:58.580 --> 09:04.520
all the Elipse select or even the rectangle select all and have a closer look at what anti-aliasing

09:04.610 --> 09:06.370
does and doesn't do.

09:06.410 --> 09:12.950
I'm going to create a new file for this one and zoom in and if I go ahead and just go to my ellipse

09:12.950 --> 09:16.940
tool and draw an ellipse or even a circle it doesn't matter.

09:16.940 --> 09:25.010
Now if I go ahead and grab let's say the blend tool here and pull it across we see that areas outside

09:25.010 --> 09:31.300
of that selection have been shaded in by undo that and let's use the fill bucket instead.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.670
You'll see that it is has the same sort of effect.

09:34.730 --> 09:41.120
So areas outside of that selection are being effected and that's what anti-aliasing does.

09:41.270 --> 09:45.340
Now I can't just turn that off in the tool options.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.360
Just can't do that.

09:46.370 --> 09:53.360
I have to do a new selection so if I go to elipse select again and this time turn anti-aliasing off

09:54.050 --> 09:58.830
and draw another circle roughly the same size as the previous one.

10:00.060 --> 10:07.400
And now go ahead and use the gradient tool or the filled soul or even if we've got another tool.

10:08.510 --> 10:13.830
Like the pencil tool we can fill that in precisely or even the paint brush.

10:13.850 --> 10:21.890
If I was to go ahead and once again create another circle at anti-aliasing was turned off I need turned

10:21.890 --> 10:24.380
on to make this example it's turned back on.

10:24.530 --> 10:30.840
And this will make the edge softer essentially but it also applies to things like the paint brush tool

10:30.860 --> 10:36.530
we see that that also has an effect because it goes outside of that selection tool.

10:36.530 --> 10:41.270
If we were to go ahead and use the pencil tool which has a hard edge I don't know whether it would have

10:41.270 --> 10:42.350
a similar effect.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.080
It indeed does.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.890
See you do need to watch out for that.

10:45.890 --> 10:52.580
If you are using the selection tools to make a very precise selection because where we're working with

10:52.580 --> 10:57.950
a low pixel count like we are you have to be careful that you're not modifying pixels outside of the

10:57.950 --> 11:00.820
selection unless you really intended to.

11:02.030 --> 11:07.640
Okay so we've learnt some more about selecting and in the next lecture I'll be asking you to use those

11:07.640 --> 11:12.970
newfound abilities in a challenge and I will see you in that next lecture.
