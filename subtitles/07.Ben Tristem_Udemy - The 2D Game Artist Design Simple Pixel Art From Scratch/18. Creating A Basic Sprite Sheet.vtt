00:04.380 --> 00:05.700
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:05.700 --> 00:10.330
In this lecture we're going to go through making a sprite's heat like the one you see in front of you.

00:10.470 --> 00:14.210
Now this is obviously an animation type spreadsheet.

00:14.250 --> 00:20.490
However the same principles can be used for static game objects and you elements as well later on.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.930
So let's go over into him now and get going.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.930
Hello everyone and welcome.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.880
Over into guimpe the first thing we need to do is just get a little bit of a head start on ourselves

00:31.210 --> 00:33.540
and go and get a.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.840
An animation that we've already done that we can start combining.

00:36.850 --> 00:39.120
I'm going to go off and find one myself.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.400
I'm going to use that bouncing ball that you saw a few moments ago.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.220
Here we go.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.170
I found that there I found the one before the merge.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.840
I could do that one or the merged one.

00:48.850 --> 00:51.710
Now give me less work to do if I have merged.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.550
But keep the elements separate.

00:53.590 --> 00:58.810
Otherwise I only use the emerged one in this case just to keep things nice and straightforward.

00:59.140 --> 01:02.830
So the first thing to work out is what size the sprite's are going to be.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.730
Now I'm going to use this whole thing as it's individual sprites.

01:06.730 --> 01:07.870
That's absolutely fine.

01:07.870 --> 01:14.470
This image here and I can see up at the top It's 128 by 128 in the description.

01:14.470 --> 01:20.920
Now if you can't see that you can go to image and canvas size and that will give you the size of the

01:21.040 --> 01:22.510
image as well.

01:22.510 --> 01:27.640
So there we go up 128 by 128 and we have 20.

01:27.640 --> 01:32.030
I think if I got background the background copy in and it counts up to 18.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.350
So we've got 20 there.

01:33.370 --> 01:40.840
Well let's go ahead and do a bit of maths here so we've got 20 lots of 100 and twenty eight.

01:41.110 --> 01:48.910
So in that case we could have a 128 look I've got to write 20 there so we can have a 128 by whatever

01:48.940 --> 01:55.130
it happens to be along the top here which would be 20 times 128.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.340
Think it's 2500 or something.

01:58.370 --> 02:01.420
Yes two thousand five hundred and sixty.

02:01.430 --> 02:06.860
Now bearing that in mind what we're going to have to do here is have that large us that's going to be

02:06.860 --> 02:09.050
4000 and 96.

02:09.140 --> 02:14.710
Now if you had an image is not going to look like that it's going to be very long and not very high

02:14.720 --> 02:18.840
and that's going to be difficult to read as a human especially when it's in thumbnail form.

02:19.010 --> 02:24.290
So that gives us a couple of options and using the trick before where we just increase one and decrease

02:24.290 --> 02:25.400
the other.

02:25.400 --> 02:34.070
We can get to a sensible size so if we went to two five six here this would be 2048 and five 12 would

02:34.070 --> 02:36.710
be 1 0 2 4.

02:36.800 --> 02:42.040
Now there's an option here that's going to be this aspect ratio roughly and that's fine.

02:42.050 --> 02:46.830
That's the same shape as my screen so that's a good orientation to work with it.

02:47.030 --> 02:52.490
We can't go anything in between if we flip those around it's just going to be more like an A4 sheet

02:52.490 --> 02:55.460
of paper import trait rather than landscape.

02:55.580 --> 02:59.500
So we know the size now of the new image that we're going to make.

02:59.660 --> 03:02.450
That's going to become our Sprite she says.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.880
Close that down and go over into guimpe.

03:05.060 --> 03:11.780
Now that we've done that we can go to new and it's gonna be a thousand and twenty four by five hundred

03:11.810 --> 03:12.830
and twelve.

03:12.830 --> 03:15.350
So we've got our new image ready to go.

03:15.410 --> 03:22.490
Now if you've not got all of your images in a layered group now would be the time to do that.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.830
Now do remember to drag them in an appropriate order because obviously at this point in time we don't

03:27.830 --> 03:32.250
want to reorder them and move them across and have to move them around later on.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.160
So here you can see inputting background copy in my background but I need to make sure it's in the right

03:37.160 --> 03:39.910
place and then just bring them up from there.

03:39.910 --> 03:42.230
Now this is going to take me a few moments to do.

03:42.230 --> 03:46.360
It's important and I'll see you guys back in a few seconds.

03:46.430 --> 03:48.710
So there we go we've got everything sorted now.

03:48.710 --> 03:54.170
Grabbing the lower group itself we can go over to our new image and drop it in.

03:54.200 --> 04:00.500
Now we can see that if we expand that layer group we've got everything across and really to a range

04:00.500 --> 04:01.520
how we want.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.730
Now it's going to be a bit of a pain in the backside to try and arrange this.

04:05.750 --> 04:12.550
You can go to the move tool and making sure in this case move the active layer is turned on find no

04:12.560 --> 04:18.650
one drag it try and a line at the very top you dont know whether thats aligned properly so you zoom

04:18.650 --> 04:21.600
in and try and work it out.

04:21.650 --> 04:23.510
Is it aligned properly I have no clue.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.760
No its not so you go in and tweak it.

04:25.970 --> 04:32.510
And that can be a real pain to try and do is much easier actually when you have smaller sprites because

04:32.510 --> 04:36.950
you dont have so many degrees of freedom here of your pixel out.

04:36.950 --> 04:40.160
It takes quite an effort to try and get it back in place.

04:40.160 --> 04:47.660
However what we can do is use the great system that's built in to guimpe And then just have it so we

04:47.660 --> 04:52.090
can just drag and snap it to that grid in order to see the grid.

04:52.250 --> 04:58.340
We need to first turn it on so we go to view and show the grid we can see there is a grid across our

04:58.370 --> 04:59.480
image here.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.190
Wow okay that is going to be too small can we adjust that grid.

05:03.200 --> 05:10.100
Yes we can under the image you can configure that grid so grids in two separate plays weve got show

05:10.100 --> 05:12.330
grid here under the view menu.

05:12.530 --> 05:17.330
And then weve got image and configure a grid and theres one more option for the grid we'll get to in

05:17.330 --> 05:18.530
a few moments.

05:18.710 --> 05:26.270
So if we go to configure grid Elwyn now we can set the spacing to 128 by 128.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.970
And click okay.

05:28.200 --> 05:33.520
Now we have ourselves the right size squares and our objects.

05:33.540 --> 05:36.090
They don't quite snap into them yet.

05:36.120 --> 05:41.690
So if you turn unsnapping says go to view and snap to grid.

05:41.970 --> 05:47.640
Once that's done it is merely a matter of arranging it interview appropriate location grabbing the next

05:47.640 --> 05:51.600
one and placing it down there and just carrying on.

05:51.630 --> 05:54.090
And before you know it you filled up your grid.

05:54.090 --> 06:03.910
Now if my calculations are correct with 20 we will end up filling in all of these and up to here I think.

06:04.020 --> 06:10.570
So these ones here will all end up be well they'll all end up being wasted space.

06:10.650 --> 06:14.020
Now it's worthwhile noting that we can place them.

06:14.040 --> 06:19.410
If you need to rearrange them because it is quite easy at this point to accidently click the wrong thing

06:19.410 --> 06:21.320
and drag it to a different place.

06:21.330 --> 06:22.710
If we're not careful.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.800
So now we've got that out of the way.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.660
You are armed with the knowledge you need to create a sprite sheet.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.340
It's time for a challenge.

06:32.340 --> 06:38.010
I would like you to go ahead and make your first spy cheat so finish off the work that we're currently

06:38.010 --> 06:43.260
doing and then finally of course when you're done please do share it with us so we can see how you're

06:43.260 --> 06:46.900
getting on Paul's video now and give that a go.

06:49.830 --> 06:51.040
OK everyone welcome back.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.210
Let's go ahead now and do the challenge of finish off our Sprite sheet.

06:55.550 --> 07:01.190
Okay so now we're back over and Jim before I do anything else I'm going to go ahead and save them a

07:01.190 --> 07:05.040
save as and then find the appropriate location for me.

07:05.090 --> 07:09.150
Now this is going to be is this is the bouncy ball.

07:09.490 --> 07:15.560
So I'm going to call this the appropriate lecture name which in this case is 17 a first year MP and

07:15.560 --> 07:17.740
then I'm going to call it bouncy ball.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.080
Sprite sheet.

07:22.390 --> 07:26.110
It's explicit what it actually is or spight sheets must were in them.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.200
But my letters in there we go.

07:28.590 --> 07:34.600
So now what I can do is I can actually do pick a layer or guide because I know the order of these things

07:34.690 --> 07:38.110
they're going to be on top of one another and there's no transparency.

07:38.140 --> 07:42.910
The topmost one here is the last one side and go and place that with the calculation.

07:42.910 --> 07:51.010
I did a moment ago into the last cell phone to call these cells the last grid space and then it is just

07:51.010 --> 07:57.220
a matter of dragging and dropping and because we don't actually cover up where these appeared in our

07:57.280 --> 08:00.250
image is going to be really quick to do this.

08:00.250 --> 08:06.730
Now if you were filling up your Sprite sheet you may have to exercise a bit more caution when doing

08:06.730 --> 08:13.030
this because at some point you'd end up covering it up and it's just fortunate that this square here

08:13.390 --> 08:18.670
actually has this look just this corner of the previous images that I can draw.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.740
Literally click on and drag.

08:20.830 --> 08:26.530
And if you want to make things clearer of course you can turn off the background itself so you can see

08:26.530 --> 08:27.240
that corner.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.880
I'm dragging here to the appropriate location.

08:30.010 --> 08:36.440
And it's so much quicker once you've got this grid here to just snap them all into place.

08:36.460 --> 08:42.340
And that was very very quick to do that I think there was about a minute or two and probably quicker

08:42.340 --> 08:44.770
if I wasn't talking through the process as well.

08:44.770 --> 08:51.190
So I'll go ahead and save that file because the final thing that I can do here is go ahead and go file

08:51.640 --> 08:56.140
export as and I'm going to export it as a P N G.

08:56.140 --> 09:03.940
Now shortly we'll have a discussion on file types because there are lots out there and it does matter

09:04.210 --> 09:05.520
what you use.

09:05.530 --> 09:10.090
You can use lots of different ones but it is important that we get the right one.

09:10.270 --> 09:12.450
But for the moment that's all we need do.

09:12.520 --> 09:19.210
I'm going to export my sprite sheet so now it's a PRNG it's in a format that you can share places.

09:19.210 --> 09:24.430
I hope to see yours over on the forum and I will see you all in the next lecture.
