Hey you guys welcome to Section Two in this section we're going to really expand on the knowledge that

00:09.070 --> 00:13.350
we learnt in Section 1 and we're also going to expand the work space.

00:13.360 --> 00:17.680
We've got we're going to go from 8 by eight to 32 by 32.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.140
Now with this extra space we still have to make sure we're constrained and we've got more creative freedom

00:23.140 --> 00:23.440
now.

00:23.530 --> 00:28.690
But the first thing we're going to do is learn about specifications whether they're given to you by

00:28.930 --> 00:33.910
someone you're working with or for all their self-imposed specifications.

00:33.910 --> 00:41.920
It helps hone your work in so you don't flood out and do tons of stuff that isn't on spec very easy

00:41.920 --> 00:46.080
to do especially when you're in that moment of creativity.

00:46.120 --> 00:50.830
Now after we've done that we can really get into the nitty gritty of this section where we're going

00:50.830 --> 00:57.550
to learn how to create in-game buttons icons like special abilities you might have at the bottom of

00:57.550 --> 01:00.900
an RPG or perhaps an avatar in the top corner.

01:01.030 --> 01:06.550
And then finally you're going to be able to produce something like the App Store icon to Torres area

01:06.820 --> 01:12.860
where you've got a low pixel art style icon to advertise your game.
