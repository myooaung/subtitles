Hello everybody and welcome to this section on animation.

00:09.110 --> 00:14.420
Now we're going to be doing Sprite based animation rather than a bone based animation.

00:14.420 --> 00:20.090
So we're actually going to be drawing and manipulating the art ourselves rather than relying on some

00:20.120 --> 00:23.510
underlying skeleton to do the movement for us.

00:23.510 --> 00:26.080
And that gives us lots of creativity.

00:26.330 --> 00:34.040
So we're going to be bringing art to life and I'm really excited because art is often a stationary object

00:34.130 --> 00:40.490
and this gives us an opportunity to really show off how something should behave or even just to give

00:40.520 --> 00:44.530
a little more nuance to our scene that we've created.

00:44.550 --> 00:47.570
Now we're going to make some simple animations obvious.

00:47.590 --> 00:54.470
The animation can get very very complex as we go and we're going to stick with that low resolution that

00:54.470 --> 00:58.710
we've had before mainly for our own sanity rather than anything else.

00:58.820 --> 01:04.160
We're going to do something like simple switching so switching colours on and off or a light switch

01:04.160 --> 01:07.220
or blinking LCD that sort of animation.

01:07.250 --> 01:13.250
Following on from that we can do something like a geometric progression like waves and clouds.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.630
Those are going to be great fun to do.

01:15.950 --> 01:20.640
Then we're going to go on to a flickering light of flames and perhaps even have a look at how that might

01:20.640 --> 01:23.840
effect the environment that light is in as well.

01:24.140 --> 01:31.400
And then finally an explosion saw something that's dynamic and changes over time quite considerably

01:31.400 --> 01:33.770
from its original state.

01:33.770 --> 01:40.940
And then finally of course we need once we've created this animation to get it into a form that is exportable

01:41.030 --> 01:47.090
and in portable into other programs so we'll be making our own Sprite sheet that we can then import

01:47.120 --> 01:48.770
into a game engine.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.150
I hope you're excited.

01:50.150 --> 01:53.290
I am and I will see you in the next lecture.
