Hey so if you're running at a high resolution higher than 14 40 P Or you're just struggling to see the

00:11.460 --> 00:17.150
icons in GIMP when you first start it up then this lectures for you if you're absolutely fine.

00:17.150 --> 00:21.540
You can see everything clearly then skip forward to the next lecture.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.570
So let's have a look now at my laptop screen.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.280
That's in for case.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.940
Go for a resolution.

00:28.950 --> 00:34.550
And when I open it up and launch guimpe things are just a little bit crazy.

00:34.560 --> 00:40.020
And let's just let's load up now if we take a quick look in the top left.

00:40.110 --> 00:42.930
You see that the icons are tiny.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.980
I can hardly see them.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.860
And if we zoom in on the top right.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.360
Going to have to zoom in here.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.190
These icons are minuscule.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.420
I can not get there with my mouse.

00:53.430 --> 00:57.590
This makes the whole program of course completely unusable.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.000
High resolutions.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.740
However there are a couple of ways we can solve this.

01:04.530 --> 01:09.410
Right so using the high resolutions may lead to help.

01:09.510 --> 01:11.690
I can not see my icons.

01:12.270 --> 01:17.620
So what we're about to discuss in some people's minds will be quite techie quite geeky.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.550
I've grown up with tech all my life.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.450
So sometimes it's hard to slip back into a complete newbie.

01:23.460 --> 01:29.790
You're just using a computer and you don't know the ins and outs particularly around things like resolution

01:29.790 --> 01:30.300
et cetera.

01:30.450 --> 01:36.120
If you do have a friend and you are of course struggling with GIMP if you do have a high resolution

01:36.120 --> 01:44.040
screen if you are struggling and you don't feel that you can do anything in this yourself do ask for

01:44.040 --> 01:50.430
help even from a friend or even someone in the community as well we've got lots of people more than

01:50.430 --> 01:51.640
willing to help you out.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.920
So don't stall at this point if you can't use GIMP because it's super high resolution.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.600
Do shout out for help.

01:57.600 --> 02:04.720
And with that in mind let's dive in now to the details of using GIMP at high resolutions.

02:04.740 --> 02:08.650
Now of course if you can see orion's Feel free to skip this lecture.

02:09.060 --> 02:15.690
Now this is mainly for 14 40 PE and higher resolutions especially when youre running guimpe on something

02:15.690 --> 02:17.990
with a small screen like a laptop.

02:18.120 --> 02:25.220
I had a Microsoft Surface a few months back and I found with that gimp was quite hard to use because

02:25.220 --> 02:32.250
it is a very high resolution screen and it was only 12 inches in a cross so that was quite difficult.

02:32.250 --> 02:39.940
Now there are three main options open to us and this will vary from platform to platform as well.

02:39.990 --> 02:43.570
The third one is going to be Windows specific.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.010
Lower your resolution.

02:45.120 --> 02:52.480
Now this is not an ideal solution but it can solve the issue and you can carry on using game.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.470
Now one of the issues you might have is that it looks a bit fuzzy or it looks a bit wonky think circles

02:58.470 --> 03:00.110
are no longer circles etc..

03:00.480 --> 03:05.300
That might be something you may have to deal with if you just lower your resolution.

03:06.250 --> 03:10.360
You could try using a different guimpe theme design for Heidi.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.730
Now I've not found one that works for me.

03:13.750 --> 03:19.450
If you guys do please do share it with the community so we can use that theme and perhaps even feature

03:19.450 --> 03:21.930
it here on the course as well.

03:22.210 --> 03:26.220
And then the final one is actually editing the registry in Windows.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.280
Now this is something that should be done with caution whenever you do.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.040
But it's not particularly difficult.

03:31.080 --> 03:38.650
Now within five minutes I had guimpe working again because it tells windows Hey I know how to work on

03:38.650 --> 03:40.000
a high BP screen.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.930
And so it just literally magnifies.

03:42.940 --> 03:51.010
So you do end up with GIMP being slightly blurred re in terms of its interface now you do have to obviously

03:51.070 --> 03:52.890
be careful with the graphics program.

03:52.900 --> 03:58.930
If you start to make things blurry but at least you can see your icons even if they are a tad blurry

03:58.930 --> 04:01.900
not as sharp as they were when they were tiny.

04:02.170 --> 04:02.910
Right.

04:02.980 --> 04:04.420
If you do choose Option three.

04:04.410 --> 04:08.120
I just want to show you where a couple of things are on the system.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.450
Okay so let's have a look.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.080
Our file system here.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.700
Now it may vary depending on the installation and version of Windows that you have.

04:15.790 --> 04:22.870
But GIMP does install itself in the program's files directory by default under gimp too and in there

04:22.930 --> 04:29.140
it can get confusing you can search around for a bit but the area you want is the bin folder and the

04:29.200 --> 04:30.280
executable.

04:30.280 --> 04:37.270
The program itself is guimpe dashed two point eight that is the one that you're going to need when you

04:37.270 --> 04:40.270
follow along the instructions and I hear you scream.

04:40.270 --> 04:42.370
Mike you have not given us an amedure ructions.

04:42.430 --> 04:46.810
I'm not going to personally give you the instructions someone else has already written these down.

04:46.870 --> 04:52.990
They've written it down for a program called PhotoShop you might have heard of that and it works with

04:52.990 --> 04:54.250
GIMP just as well.

04:54.370 --> 05:00.940
And that is this guy here Dan and to Nellie and to you and Lee or something along those lines.

05:00.940 --> 05:05.760
Not sure about serration of his name but he's got an issue here with Adobe.

05:05.800 --> 05:13.990
This particular solution works with any program that doesn't feel some work properly on a high resolution

05:13.990 --> 05:14.800
screen.

05:15.070 --> 05:19.500
So do go ahead and follow this if you feel like going down the route.

05:19.510 --> 05:20.500
That's the one I took.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.450
It worked wonderfully for me.

05:22.450 --> 05:26.260
It made guimpe usable again on my laptop.

05:26.320 --> 05:32.200
And don't worry about copying down the you are in the top I've included a link in the description for

05:32.200 --> 05:38.910
this video and also in the resources itself so feel free to go along and try this.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.750
Do remember your editing your registry.

05:40.750 --> 05:47.860
If you do and take care whilst you are in there okay everyone I hope you have found that useful.

05:47.860 --> 05:51.520
If you're running gimp on a high resolution screen.

05:51.730 --> 05:58.820
Now if you do find a different way of managing Gimp I do know that in a future version I believe two

05:58.820 --> 06:02.670
point ten were on two point eight point twenty at the moment I think.

06:02.670 --> 06:10.690
Two point ten is going to enable us to use GIMP natively high resolutions without any workarounds.

06:10.810 --> 06:14.220
But until that comes out we will have to use some form of workaround.

06:14.260 --> 06:20.520
If you find a theme do share it with us and the community so we can all use it.

06:20.570 --> 06:26.470
And if you have any other suggestions of course do shout and let us know.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.590
And now you can see your icons in GIMP.

06:29.590 --> 06:35.790
It's time to start getting comfortable in the interface and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
