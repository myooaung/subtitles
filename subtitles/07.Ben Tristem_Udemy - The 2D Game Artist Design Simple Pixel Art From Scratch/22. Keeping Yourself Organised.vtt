00:04.690 --> 00:06.460
Hey everyone and welcome back.

00:06.490 --> 00:12.910
In this lecture Regan to be talking about keeping yourself organized in front of us we have a sort of

00:12.910 --> 00:16.710
semi organized folder that I have been working on.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.660
Now I will hold my hand up and say I tend to be quite good when I'm in a program making sure things

00:22.660 --> 00:25.040
like layers are named appropriately.

00:25.240 --> 00:31.080
However outside the program I can be a little bit disorganized as you can see here some things are in

00:31.080 --> 00:31.940
folders.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.990
Some things are not.

00:33.010 --> 00:37.450
They're not really categorized some have numbers at the beginning some are just names.

00:37.450 --> 00:39.310
I mean what is going on here.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.760
Am I clear.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.910
A couple of weeks you know might pass and I have a look at this folder and if I'm not sure what's going

00:45.910 --> 00:46.530
on.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.160
Well it's no good is it.

00:49.330 --> 00:52.540
If I don't know what's going on no one else is going to.

00:52.780 --> 00:57.050
Now it is important when we're talking about keeping yourself organized.

00:57.070 --> 01:03.450
We are talking about an ideology that will change depending on who you're working with what project

01:03.450 --> 01:04.580
you're working on.

01:04.780 --> 01:08.300
So naming especially naming that's the one of the key things.

01:08.350 --> 01:12.840
If you don't know what fire one fire 2 5 3 and 5 4 mean.

01:13.090 --> 01:17.650
Well I'm guessing there are fire but it doesn't tell me anything else doesn't tell me anything about

01:17.650 --> 01:19.240
their size at the moment.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.680
That's one of the things it also would get a bit silly if I have 50 different fires.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.600
I wouldn't know what any of them were.

01:25.720 --> 01:33.130
If one said raging fire and one said ALL fire or explosion you know something more descriptive than

01:33.130 --> 01:34.690
just the word fire.

01:34.700 --> 01:42.060
And these are things that obviously will develop and grow as you create more and more art work.

01:42.060 --> 01:48.430
Now I as I said Nay my layers as I create them because I find that if I don't know what the layer is

01:48.430 --> 01:51.950
when I'm looking there it can be quite hard to tell by the thumb now.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.570
So naming them there you get a real impactive you haven't named That's mishu When you working on a particular

01:58.600 --> 02:01.040
image with multiple layers on it.

02:01.390 --> 02:08.260
However keeping your folders tidy means that when you come back to your projects later on you know exactly

02:08.260 --> 02:09.870
what's going on.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.770
Now there are several things going on here.

02:11.770 --> 02:15.190
I've got a mixture of the gimp files themselves.

02:15.190 --> 02:18.670
Unfortunately they don't have a preview option.

02:18.670 --> 02:25.840
You can install some plug ins which allow you to see gimp files but that's not across all operating

02:25.840 --> 02:30.550
systems and I've also got some of my renders my final outputs.

02:30.550 --> 02:35.740
My exports all jumbled in together and then I've got sectioned challenge.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.040
Well that doesn't mean selection challenge.

02:38.060 --> 02:43.150
Oh not Section challenged my my mistake selection challenge grading challenge feel challenged bottom

02:43.150 --> 02:46.990
hard all that I'll be coming up soon that's just getting ready for it.

02:47.170 --> 02:50.250
And this one has fiery examples.

02:50.260 --> 02:57.010
And then we have a lection number as well going along with it so there's a bit of a discontinuity between

02:57.010 --> 03:01.960
what's going on here and what we're seeing is actually something that you should embrace and that's

03:01.960 --> 03:06.950
the fact that things will change as you progress through a project.

03:07.080 --> 03:12.450
So obviously at some point I've found that just naming it is fine for what I've been working on.

03:12.460 --> 03:18.370
However later on I've decided that it will be more appropriate to have the actual lecture number along

03:18.370 --> 03:20.860
with it so I know what it relates to.

03:20.860 --> 03:27.270
Of course I haven't updated any of the previous stuff which is kind of less a bit of a mess here.

03:27.580 --> 03:35.620
And part of that mess I assure you is it goes I want to demonstrate what can happen as a project progresses

03:35.890 --> 03:38.160
and there is some truth in that as well.

03:38.230 --> 03:46.060
I am not totally tidy when it comes to working on projects although I try my best to be and I know that

03:46.060 --> 03:48.700
some of you out there are going to be right on the ball with this.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.110
You want things to be named appropriately.

03:51.130 --> 03:57.250
You're the sort of person that everything has a place and everything is in its place as well.

03:57.250 --> 04:01.250
I am a bit of a halfway house sometimes I am sometimes I'm not.

04:01.270 --> 04:04.800
And this folder itself is not too bad at the moment.

04:04.930 --> 04:10.360
I recognize there's a problem that's why I've come in and produce this lecture specifically on making

04:10.360 --> 04:12.340
sure you keep yourself organized.

04:12.340 --> 04:19.420
It enables you to work much much better and it also enables you to work better in a group of people.

04:19.450 --> 04:24.430
You're not always going to be working by yourself now when you're working with a group you will have

04:24.430 --> 04:30.460
to accept that naming and filing will be group focussed rather than personal focussed.

04:30.460 --> 04:33.350
So whereas you might just name things how you feel about it.

04:33.460 --> 04:40.570
You will decide as a group if you are working in a group that say all the fires end up in a folder called

04:40.570 --> 04:47.820
fire rather than just leaving them as empty like this without any folder structure.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.810
Now I would advise that you dont go ahead and create a folder unless you've got something to put in

04:52.810 --> 04:59.200
the folder and certainly don't go nesting folders within folders within folders because that bit just

04:59.200 --> 05:02.130
becomes as bad as leaving everything in one area.

05:02.290 --> 05:04.040
Now if you've named some.

05:04.310 --> 05:07.330
Really really well you can search.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.600
So obviously I've got things called fire I can go ahead and search for something called fire.

05:11.810 --> 05:17.600
And fortunately I got some exports here that line up with these so I can have a glimpse at what they

05:17.600 --> 05:18.320
might be.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.120
I don't know whether they line up with them.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.920
It's been too long since I looked at this and I know they do line up with them but there is a possibility

05:24.920 --> 05:30.050
that you end up with something with the same name and there's actually something completely different

05:30.050 --> 05:35.420
so it's worthwhile making sure that you have descriptive naming and then you can just search for it

05:35.420 --> 05:37.990
doesn't really matter where it's stored at that point.

05:38.060 --> 05:44.960
But more importantly if someone else is working with you they understand what that firewall is as well

05:45.200 --> 05:47.350
and perhaps how it's going to be use.

05:47.340 --> 05:54.350
There's a lot you can give across with simple naming but descriptive naming rather than just fire one

05:54.350 --> 06:01.100
fire to fire three so for instance fire one could say fire three is definitely a fire ball so that could

06:01.100 --> 06:06.220
be changed straight away fire for we call it raging fire.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.600
I mean fire one is more like a candle flame.

06:10.640 --> 06:16.210
I don't know what tooth tooth shaped fire EFTPOS for fired so there's lots of different options.

06:16.220 --> 06:23.330
But as long as you know and understand what they are that's great and then taking a step a little further

06:23.330 --> 06:30.450
from this just the naming here is embracing deleting the old An out of date work.

06:30.590 --> 06:38.290
Now one could also argue here that these PND that I've created are now useless.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.240
I've used them I've publish them.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.150
I've shown people on the forum.

06:42.250 --> 06:48.660
I've shown them in the chat I've used them so should they still be there because they are a cache.

06:48.680 --> 06:54.740
They are an export of these particular files and if they just go ahead and sit there.

06:54.740 --> 07:00.560
The question is why when you can get the information back again and this may lead you to update one

07:00.560 --> 07:05.450
of these files and forget to explore and end up uploading the wrong information.

07:05.450 --> 07:09.340
I see this so much with someone ends up uploading something.

07:09.390 --> 07:12.890
That's the old version and then they go oh sorry sorry sorry.

07:13.070 --> 07:15.430
So in do embrace deleting things.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.970
I've got some examples here.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.430
I'm quite happy on these fira examples.

07:19.430 --> 07:23.250
Just go ahead hit the delete key and.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.130
Oh is gone.

07:25.160 --> 07:25.970
There we go.

07:25.970 --> 07:30.880
So I've now gotten rid of that do embrace deleting your old and out of date work.

07:30.980 --> 07:37.520
And this goes on when you start working and producing your old your own portfolio.

07:37.710 --> 07:42.610
When you're putting together a portfolio you only want it to contain your best stuff.

07:42.620 --> 07:47.780
You certainly don't want to bore the person you're looking out with hundreds of different things only

07:47.780 --> 07:51.140
include in the portfolio the stuff that you want to show off.

07:51.140 --> 07:52.880
Not absolutely everything.

07:52.880 --> 07:53.540
The key.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.420
The best stuff and keep pure old stuff.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.400
In this case don't delete it keep it.

07:58.400 --> 08:03.800
Be proud of how you've progressed as you develop yourself as an artist.

08:03.800 --> 08:11.060
It is important to refer back because your progress will often be gradual and it's very easy to miss

08:11.300 --> 08:17.240
and think you haven't progressed but then you look back and perhaps only a few weeks or even days ago

08:17.420 --> 08:22.850
you would have improved dramatically so keeping yourself organized isn't difficult.

08:22.850 --> 08:27.220
It does require a bit of self-discipline as you go.

08:27.350 --> 08:33.290
And of course that leads us nicely on to a challenge and your challenge if you haven't already guessed

08:33.290 --> 08:40.580
it is to tidy up your files and folders and one question I'd ask is are things named appropriately.

08:40.580 --> 08:47.750
Have you got a situation like me where I've got a mixture of numbers dictating where the lectures are

08:47.750 --> 08:49.310
and then some are just names in there.

08:49.310 --> 08:51.860
Some of my files themselves.

08:52.220 --> 08:56.160
Well what does fire one two three four five six you know infinitum.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.770
How what does that actually mean.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.230
Is it descriptive enough.

09:00.040 --> 09:05.260
And then is there anything that is now redundant and can be deleted is there something you tried and

09:05.260 --> 09:11.180
it just turned out to be in your mind rubbish or something you tried and it's just left there.

09:11.230 --> 09:14.430
Is it now cluttering up your work environment.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.450
If it is get rid of it.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.530
Don't be afraid of that delete key.

09:18.610 --> 09:19.050
Go ahead.

09:19.060 --> 09:22.560
Pause a video now and tidy up your files and folders.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.940
Hey guys welcome back.

09:27.950 --> 09:32.890
So let's go ahead and see what I've done to tidy up my files and folders.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.900
And here we go.

09:34.900 --> 09:39.570
Here is my tidied up folder structure for the moment.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.520
There is a final thing that I need to do here Matt.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.490
Just put the numbers 11 on here.

09:45.670 --> 09:52.870
So I still do have a bit of a mixture going on some of them can not be linked to an individual lecture

09:52.870 --> 09:54.360
like the jewel swords.

09:54.370 --> 09:56.190
That was one issue I came across.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.160
I was thinking wow how do we solve that.

09:58.370 --> 10:00.130
It's just one file at the moment.

10:00.130 --> 10:05.920
You probably end up in something like a weapons folder or something along those lines rather than having

10:05.920 --> 10:07.780
a number against it eventually.

10:07.780 --> 10:13.120
Now the rest of them I've named them with numbers because that's how my projects is developing.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.040
I'm creating this course you have.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.310
You guys are following along.

10:16.450 --> 10:20.010
And so each one of these represents particular lectures.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.570
And that's how I want to structure mine.

10:22.570 --> 10:30.940
So as I said before it does depend on the project that you're doing as the outcome of your file names.

10:31.030 --> 10:38.430
Now there was one thing that cropped up and it made me realize that Renaming something can have disastrous

10:38.430 --> 10:39.150
effects.

10:39.190 --> 10:47.450
So if I am now going search my game my icons for a fire where there were four there are now only two.

10:47.470 --> 10:52.590
And the reason for that is because I've renamed some of them with flame.

10:52.960 --> 11:00.000
But if I wanted to keep the fire in there so if I search for fire it definitely comes up.

11:00.100 --> 11:06.880
What I would need to do is go ahead enough upon of course include some going to go fire dasch candle

11:06.880 --> 11:12.280
flame and in here are more so going to go fire dasch all.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.250
Now you could argue at this point.

11:15.270 --> 11:21.080
Well if I've done that for those Should I also have fired dash for the other ones.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.020
Analysis as such.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.430
Fire we get all four again.

11:23.430 --> 11:24.280
Brilliant.

11:24.300 --> 11:28.330
So should I have fired that raging fire fire abeche fireball.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.260
Maybe.

11:29.270 --> 11:29.850
Maybe not.

11:29.850 --> 11:33.360
I'm going to leave it is simple at the pot as possible at the moment.

11:33.360 --> 11:39.510
I am happy with raging fire and fireball so those things are all named so that if I search for fire

11:39.720 --> 11:41.880
I can find them easily.

11:41.880 --> 11:47.550
How did you guys get on do you come across any naming inconsistencies that you had your directory in

11:47.550 --> 11:48.970
a complete state.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.100
Now it's all nice and tidy.

11:51.210 --> 11:56.780
It would be really interesting to see what you are naming your folders and your files.

11:56.880 --> 12:02.100
And please do share that with us as well because it's nice to see what other people are doing so we

12:02.100 --> 12:04.810
can all learn from each other as we go.

12:04.830 --> 12:10.380
Make sure you let us know over in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
