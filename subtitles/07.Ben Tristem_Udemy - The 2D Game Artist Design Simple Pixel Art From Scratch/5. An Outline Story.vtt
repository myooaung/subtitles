00:04.560 --> 00:09.130
HAYES So in this video we're going to go ahead and recap on some of the knowledge you've already gone

00:09.130 --> 00:10.890
through just to solidify it.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.540
And also filling in the background colour.

00:13.540 --> 00:16.950
So a few things that will help speed up your work flow.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.430
So let's go ahead.

00:18.430 --> 00:20.670
First of all creating a new image.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.590
Remember there are short cut keys.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.220
You don't have to use them.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.300
Some people prefer them.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.130
Some people do not.

00:26.130 --> 00:31.180
Some people don't have the right keys on the keyboard in some particular cases with shortcuts as you'll

00:31.180 --> 00:34.290
see in AIF potentially in a few moments.

00:34.300 --> 00:39.790
So let's go ahead and create a new image this time because crimpers opened up a fresh it's not remembered

00:39.790 --> 00:43.230
the previous state of eight by eight some going to have to type that in.

00:43.540 --> 00:48.480
And of course zoom in and I'm going to use the fill screen with controls shift and J.

00:48.610 --> 00:52.580
It's filled in the screen we need the pencil tool so let's go ahead and select that.

00:52.690 --> 00:56.380
And we got the foreground colour and background colour as black and white.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.570
So that's all good.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.570
And we need the size the size doesn't need to be 20 needs to be one.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.700
And we can see that it's one pixel each and we can start colouring in.

01:06.940 --> 01:10.910
I call it colouring and it's just really blacking in and it anyway.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.670
So say you've made a drawing like this and it's just wrong you want to reset everything.

01:16.690 --> 01:22.940
One of the tools in your arsenal of course is pressing the x key and switching to the background colour.

01:22.960 --> 01:27.580
And in this case because the background colour is white we can use it to kind of erase what was there

01:27.580 --> 01:28.310
previously.

01:28.480 --> 01:34.390
Now this would be a real pain if you had to do the entire lot or certainly an image much larger.

01:34.390 --> 01:38.240
So is there a way we can go ahead and clear everything.

01:38.260 --> 01:43.050
Yes there is and there's also a way that we can fill with just the foreground or background colour.

01:43.050 --> 01:44.520
So there's lots of options.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.960
Let's do the clearing everything to the background colour first.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.810
Now do notice that I've got the background colour set to black.

01:52.790 --> 01:56.190
Which is fine when I go back clear it down.

01:56.270 --> 02:00.570
It will go back to the background colour which is black.

02:00.710 --> 02:08.720
So we go to edit and down here there are a couple of options clear fill with foreground colour and fill

02:08.720 --> 02:10.710
with background colour.

02:10.730 --> 02:17.020
Now callier is the one that you might not be able to do on certain machines especially laptops.

02:17.030 --> 02:20.920
I know a couple of laptops I've used in the past don't actually have a delete key.

02:21.050 --> 02:25.760
I'm not talking about the backspace key but the one actually has the e l written on it.

02:25.850 --> 02:27.470
That is the delete key.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.760
If I go ahead and select it in the menu here we can see that it fills in black.

02:31.850 --> 02:38.180
If I press X to switch back the foreground and background colours Now the background colour is white

02:38.240 --> 02:40.430
and I press delete on the keyboard.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.190
It goes white as expected.

02:43.210 --> 02:49.870
Now this is ever so slightly different than how it would behave on other layers.

02:49.870 --> 02:55.410
Now we have not discussed layers yet and were not going to look at them in this particular section.

02:55.420 --> 03:01.270
However if you glance over to the right hand side of my screen we will see a tab called layers and we

03:01.270 --> 03:03.290
will see it says background on it.

03:03.400 --> 03:12.340
So when you press the delete key or go to Edit clear on any other layer it will actually clear everything

03:12.340 --> 03:14.950
it won't just fill it in with the background or foreground colour.

03:15.070 --> 03:22.300
So in that case you would have to use either control plus the full stop or the period key or control

03:22.300 --> 03:23.250
and the comma key.

03:23.260 --> 03:30.010
As we can see that and if I hover over our canvas that's the sort of digital paper that we're working

03:30.010 --> 03:32.690
with here and press control and comma.

03:32.770 --> 03:37.720
It will fill it in with the foreground colour and control and full stop or period.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.390
We'll fill it in with the background colour.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.500
So there's lots of options there.

03:41.530 --> 03:48.070
As you're working to be able to flip and just remove everything you've been working on and start again.

03:48.220 --> 03:51.990
Occasionally I do dig myself in a hole and just end up manually deleting it.

03:52.090 --> 03:57.440
Or maybe I'm just tweaking something and I just don't like it so I'll just scribble out the rest.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.390
That is absolutely fine.

03:59.410 --> 04:05.110
8 by 8 but it was much larger I would stick to the other tools to speed up my workflow.

04:05.410 --> 04:08.100
Now finally I've mentioned it before.

04:08.140 --> 04:13.590
It's a happy accident but every take a glance at the top of our canvas.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.560
We have a little tab you don't see anything at the moment cause I haven't drawn anything.

04:17.560 --> 04:23.800
However if I draw something on there we can see that is reflected up in that tab and that's useful for

04:23.800 --> 04:29.410
keeping an eye on what you're doing as well as being zoomed in.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.210
It's great to zoom out and zoom back in.

04:31.210 --> 04:36.280
We don't have to do that in this case because of his happy accident that we can have a good appreciation

04:36.280 --> 04:41.770
of what that thumb now what the icon is going to be looking like when it's smaller as well as it when

04:41.770 --> 04:42.520
it zoomed in.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.760
What are we zoomed in at on my particular screen.

04:45.760 --> 04:51.880
Ten thousand five hundred and thirteen percent which is quite zoomed in.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.080
Now we're armed with this extra knowledge.

04:54.100 --> 04:59.230
It's time for another challenge where we're going to go ahead and tell a story.

04:59.290 --> 05:06.250
And of course that's where these little thumbnails on the tabs as you create new pictures is going to

05:06.250 --> 05:07.710
help somewhat.

05:08.140 --> 05:16.120
Okay so as already hinted we are going to tell a short story so we're going to create three 8 by 8 images

05:16.540 --> 05:22.390
and once again were only going to use the pencil tool so we get that clear distinction between the pixels

05:22.390 --> 05:28.150
themselves and of course because we're using the pencil tool at the moment with all the default settings

05:28.330 --> 05:34.150
it's going to either be black or white depending on what setting we've picked the foreground and background

05:34.150 --> 05:35.440
colours.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.670
Now try describing a person loves bowling.

05:39.670 --> 05:46.180
And if you are struggling with any of these I would really encourage you to remember your reference

05:46.210 --> 05:50.920
images now reference images are used in art all the time.

05:50.920 --> 05:57.300
Some people say it is cheating or a plague even as far as plagiarism but it really isn't.

05:57.310 --> 06:03.360
If you're using So if you're truly using something as a reference image it means your referring to it

06:03.370 --> 06:04.960
to help out your work.

06:05.020 --> 06:10.780
If I was to go off and draw an elephant for instance I would not try and do it from what's in my head.

06:10.810 --> 06:14.780
I'd go find a picture of an elephant as a starting point.

06:14.890 --> 06:21.220
Further down the line I might go back to what's in my head after I really learnt how that object or

06:21.250 --> 06:25.180
animal or whatever you're doing really looks like.

06:25.180 --> 06:33.160
So go ahead pause a video and try describing using these icons were creating person loves bowling.

06:35.080 --> 06:35.730
Okay guys.

06:35.740 --> 06:36.420
Welcome back.

06:36.550 --> 06:41.310
Let's go ahead and in a short story using 8 by 8 images.

06:41.380 --> 06:44.340
Let's try and describe a person loves bowling.

06:45.140 --> 06:50.960
Okay so before I get into the nitty gritty of creating eight by eight I can't I just had a quick refresher

06:51.200 --> 06:57.320
by going on google and simply typing in some key words person icons silhouette or person.

06:57.340 --> 07:02.730
Like an outline just get an idea in my head about what I what I really want to do.

07:02.730 --> 07:06.930
And as you can see there's an absolute ton of options that you've got here.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.920
And of course all of these are quite high resolution.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.440
We are only dealing with 8 by 8 pixels.

07:12.470 --> 07:14.710
So it needs to be relatively simple.

07:14.780 --> 07:22.010
And in this case I really like this guy on the right who is walking again to the right.

07:22.060 --> 07:27.810
I quite like that and that's the one I'm going to be modelling as I'm going through in GIMP.

07:28.130 --> 07:33.260
Okay so in front of us we have my squiggle that I did earlier and I'm going to use that shortcut key

07:33.260 --> 07:38.210
we've just learned which is control and full stop or period to make everything white.

07:38.270 --> 07:43.370
I like doing that rather than just hitting the delete key because you're you're really telling Gimp

07:43.640 --> 07:45.350
I want it to be white.

07:45.620 --> 07:52.010
Whereas if you're doing celek sorry Ed it's clear you're really saying I want it to be cleared and that

07:52.010 --> 07:53.630
is ever so slightly different.

07:53.630 --> 07:58.690
I prefer to be exact in my method and say I want it to be the background colour.

07:58.700 --> 08:03.510
In this case it's white so we've got a person walking so we need a head.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.730
So go ahead and stick your head and neck which was fortunate.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.080
And we go down and we've got one leg forward and one leg back.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.350
Will this work at all.

08:16.630 --> 08:21.520
This one kind of comes down and this one goes out forward.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.520
It's kind of working.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.440
And again it doesn't have to be perfect at this point.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.480
Is there anything else we can do to make this better.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.750
Wow.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.390
How about making the head a bit larger.

08:34.390 --> 08:38.140
I don't know whether this will work or not but it's certainly worth trying.

08:38.140 --> 08:41.350
Looks like it does look more like a person now.

08:41.530 --> 08:43.330
That's like a person with no chins.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.800
Perhaps if I get rid of that an add.

08:48.190 --> 08:49.410
Oh dear.

08:49.570 --> 08:54.760
It's challenging it really is when you're confined but it really makes you think about what you're trying

08:54.760 --> 08:56.310
to achieve.

08:56.410 --> 09:00.780
And again at the moment I'm not too convinced by looking at the larger version.

09:00.820 --> 09:06.760
However looking at the smaller version I'm quite happy or how that actually looks.

09:06.760 --> 09:14.940
So I'll just stick with that for my person and I'm going to go away now and produce loves and bowling.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.040
So let's go.

09:16.450 --> 09:19.470
And I'll see you guys back in a few moments.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.490
Okay and welcome back.

09:22.490 --> 09:29.910
So I have been busy beavering away with these pixels here and so I've got a person for love.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.210
I've gone for a heart.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.120
Who would have guessed.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.500
I suspect that many of you did too.

09:35.670 --> 09:40.280
Bolling Well I've I thought about pins and I thought Now I like the bowling ball.

09:40.430 --> 09:44.600
And so I've done the circle that we saw with the smiley face earlier.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.730
And but this time I've got the three dots in there.

09:47.780 --> 09:52.720
Now this does rely on a bit of context to recognize what it is.

09:52.730 --> 09:56.590
And we all know that we're thinking about someone loving bowling.

09:56.720 --> 10:03.440
And if you didn't know that's one of the dangers of creating something like this is that you may think

10:03.500 --> 10:11.930
that this person is in love and they're going it might be as a smiley where the person is just pouting

10:11.930 --> 10:16.080
their lips or just wondering or pondering the mysteries of the universe.

10:16.190 --> 10:20.830
There could be lots of interpretation and to get into this.

10:21.780 --> 10:26.940
And fundamentally this is one of the limitations that you start approaching when you're dealing with

10:26.940 --> 10:29.490
just black and white images.

10:29.550 --> 10:31.720
You can do an outline you can do a silhouette.

10:31.800 --> 10:37.200
But when it starts coming to the detail some of it will obviously get lost.

10:37.200 --> 10:44.430
And if you were doing let's say a bitter fruit if I just drew a circle and didn't colour it a green

10:44.430 --> 10:50.520
or red or any other colour orange you wouldn't know if it's an orange or an apple or tomato or what

10:50.640 --> 10:53.430
ever it is important to.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.960
Try to avoid contexts where you can.

10:57.020 --> 10:59.340
But in this case I like the bowling ball.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.610
I'm going to leave it like that.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.640
And those are my three icons.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.660
All done.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.220
How did you guys get on.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.170
I hope you really enjoyed this.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.010
I certainly have.

11:10.010 --> 11:16.610
It's really invigorating being confined to such a small space really got me thinking about where those

11:16.610 --> 11:17.760
pixels are going.

11:17.810 --> 11:23.530
And each one of them is really important and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
