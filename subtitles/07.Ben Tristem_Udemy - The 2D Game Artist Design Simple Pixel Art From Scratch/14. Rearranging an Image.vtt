Hey guys welcome back.

00:05.610 --> 00:08.940
So it's time to test your knowledge in the form of a challenge.

00:08.970 --> 00:13.070
I'd like you to use the skills you've just learned to create a new game icon.

00:13.470 --> 00:19.560
Consider moving your players to recompose an existing image or indeed go ahead and create something

00:19.590 --> 00:20.710
brand new.

00:21.090 --> 00:27.720
Link layers when necessary remember that will save you a lot of time later on and share with us your

00:27.720 --> 00:31.720
new game like pause video now and give us a go.

00:33.580 --> 00:34.910
Okay guys welcome back.

00:35.050 --> 00:39.060
Let's go ahead now and create a new game icon over in guimpe.

00:41.290 --> 00:43.140
Okay so we're back over in game.

00:43.150 --> 00:49.750
And the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and open up a file that I've worked on before because

00:49.750 --> 00:53.790
I want to take my sword and I want to put two swords crossed.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.050
Kate let's zoom on in.

00:56.050 --> 00:59.880
Now the first thing I'm going to do is actually link these two layers together.

00:59.890 --> 01:01.820
The sword and the blade.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.280
So there we go they're linked together going to move them about just to make sure they are linked.

01:06.280 --> 01:06.880
Excellent.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.430
So that's the first stage done.

01:09.430 --> 01:13.380
It does mean if I move one I'll happily move the other.

01:13.430 --> 01:17.630
Now I need to duplicate what I can currently see.

01:17.710 --> 01:25.150
Now I do have an option here to merge my blade down into my sword so it becomes one object and I am

01:25.150 --> 01:26.140
tempted to do this.

01:26.140 --> 01:31.310
I've got a backup of this file anyway so if I don't like that later on I can always restore it.

01:31.330 --> 01:37.080
So I think I am going to do that so we don't need them really linked together if we didn't need to.

01:37.180 --> 01:43.870
But I'm going to merge that down so that it is now just one item.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.110
The next thing I'm going to do is duplicate that layer.

01:47.110 --> 01:53.680
Now if I hadn't have done that I would have found that I'd need to duplicate both the layers to get

01:53.710 --> 01:55.510
the same result back.

01:55.540 --> 02:02.220
Now that I've got my sword copy I'm going to call this one sword behind.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.160
So one's in front and one's behind.

02:05.460 --> 02:13.290
And I need to flip that round horizontally so I'm going to go to my layer options and go down to transform

02:13.320 --> 02:16.100
and I'm good to flip that horizontally.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.190
And there we go.

02:17.340 --> 02:23.400
Now you will notice straightaway because the because of the order that we have the sword that's supposed

02:23.400 --> 02:29.000
to be behind is currently in front some good to shift my order for the layers.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.430
And there we go.

02:30.450 --> 02:35.880
Now I do on my swords to be linked together so if I decide to move one the other one will happily move

02:35.880 --> 02:43.260
along with it I'm going to save my file has at this point thinking about it I'm going to go back down

02:43.260 --> 02:47.990
to my game my hands and I'm going to call this jewel swords.

02:48.270 --> 02:49.860
I'm going save it in that fold.

02:49.860 --> 02:50.580
So there we go.

02:50.580 --> 02:56.500
I've saved that and in fact that saved me the trouble of having to recover the other sword later on.

02:56.580 --> 02:57.210
But there we go.

02:57.210 --> 03:02.970
I've got one on top of the other now there are a couple of things I can do here to help myself out.

03:02.970 --> 03:09.390
I could create maybe a drop shadow behind if I wanted to I could change the background.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.840
I mean white is okay.

03:12.010 --> 03:14.110
Be nice to have a shield or something in the background.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.600
I feel that's going to come in a future election so let's not worry about that.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.490
So there we go.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.180
I've brought my source together.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.650
I've got transparency there as well.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.600
Should I require in the game.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.680
And there we go.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.180
I'm quite happy with that.

03:28.320 --> 03:28.910
Yeah.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.760
Are there some other things that I could do.

03:30.990 --> 03:35.870
Quite possibly but I don't want to spend all day doing this on such a straightforward day Mike.

03:36.060 --> 03:42.720
Again just a reminder here that as you're creating these yourself don't spend too long on each individual

03:42.720 --> 03:49.470
one at this point in time you should really be focussed on producing a quantity so you get to practice

03:49.470 --> 03:56.670
your skills over and over again later on when we get some more detailed work getting that detail right

03:56.940 --> 04:00.580
is going to become more and more important.

04:00.590 --> 04:05.300
A quick couple of commonsense checks we've got both the highlights facing upwards.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.140
That's fine.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.950
I'm liking how this is looking.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.030
How is ewell's LOOKING.

04:09.030 --> 04:09.660
PLEASE SHARE.

04:09.660 --> 04:13.600
Over in the discussions and I will see you in the next video.
