WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:05.890
Hey so welcome back over into guimpe.

00:05.900 --> 00:11.580
And we are going to talk about the selection tools but what exactly is selection.

00:11.600 --> 00:18.050
Well the selection tools themselves are designed to select regions on your active layer so whatever

00:18.050 --> 00:21.600
layer we've currently got selected there is nothing at the moment.

00:21.620 --> 00:25.660
We don't have an image so let's go ahead and just add that straight away.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.720
Again 32 by 32.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.860
And I'm going to zoom all the way in.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.230
So anything is active on this layer.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.190
We can select.

00:34.190 --> 00:40.310
Now each of the tools have their own properties but they also share a number of options and features

00:40.310 --> 00:46.160
in common much like all of the brush tools do the selection tools have a series of options that are

00:46.160 --> 00:47.900
similar amongst them.

00:47.930 --> 00:54.740
So once you've selected a particular region it allows you to work on that selected area without affecting

00:54.830 --> 00:56.630
the rest of your image.

00:56.650 --> 01:01.520
And that can be incredibly useful when you want to use some of the other tools maybe a gradient feel

01:01.520 --> 01:06.920
or even just colouring something in you don't want to go over the edge so to speak you want to stay

01:06.920 --> 01:09.350
within the virtual lines.

01:09.350 --> 01:10.160
Now would you believe it.

01:10.160 --> 01:17.480
There are a total of seven different selection tools and they are the first seven icons in the tool

01:17.480 --> 01:24.230
box ranging from the rectangle select all all the way across to the foreground selector.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.980
They can also be found under the Tools menu under selection tools and we can see there.

01:29.100 --> 01:35.720
They've also all of them except foreground Select have a shortcut key associated with them as well.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.090
Now in this particular lecture we're not going to do all seven Don't worry that will completely overwhelm

01:41.120 --> 01:42.950
everyone including myself.

01:43.100 --> 01:48.950
We are going to focus on the fuzzy select and the by colour select.

01:48.980 --> 01:54.650
Now the other ones some of them won't be very good at all in this entire section because we're at such

01:54.650 --> 01:55.750
a low resolution.

01:55.760 --> 02:01.360
They're either going to be difficult or really don't have a suitable effect.

02:01.460 --> 02:08.390
The intelligence is in the foreground select really need more pixels to work out what is part of the

02:08.390 --> 02:09.770
foreground and background.

02:09.920 --> 02:17.320
When you have just a low pixel count at 32 by 32 it's just not got enough information to do the separation.

02:17.390 --> 02:23.230
The rectangle selects an ellipse select will visit very soon the free select again because we're at

02:23.230 --> 02:24.760
such a low resolution.

02:24.770 --> 02:30.060
It's actually quite difficult and time consuming to draw around each individual pixel.

02:30.170 --> 02:33.130
So we're not going to use that in this section either.

02:33.470 --> 02:39.140
So we are going to focus our efforts on Fuzzy and the buy colour selection.

02:39.140 --> 02:43.030
Now the fuzzy select You may recognize there's a magic wand.

02:43.040 --> 02:51.420
In other programs it enables us to select contiguous colour and that's based upon a threshold.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.560
Now if that doesn't make any sense to you at the moment don't worry it will go through.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.580
What that means in a moment.

02:56.630 --> 03:02.990
So I'm going to select a brush size of eight and I do want a pencil for this just so it's a hard edged

03:02.990 --> 03:08.760
tool and I'm going to create a couple of black marks on our canvas.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.960
So there we go we have a smiley face.

03:10.970 --> 03:13.820
Now what does a contiguous selection mean.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.240
What it just means adjacent and continuous.

03:17.240 --> 03:24.020
So in this particular case if we were to go and use the Fuzzy's Select Tool on either of these three

03:24.020 --> 03:32.780
black blobs over the eyes or the mouth there we will see that it selects only the area that's connected.

03:32.780 --> 03:41.020
It doesn't select the other to the by colour selects will select everything that is the same colour.

03:41.030 --> 03:47.060
Now just like the fill tool that we've already played with these two options these two selection tools

03:47.330 --> 03:51.070
have a threshold and it's currently set to 15.

03:51.140 --> 03:53.220
If we wanted to be absolutes.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.890
So the only things that were exactly black and next to each other were selected.

03:58.070 --> 04:04.160
Then we could Tomer all the way down to zero or if we wanted to be a bit more loose and select more

04:04.160 --> 04:07.010
of the surrounding image we could turn it up.

04:07.010 --> 04:12.980
Now I found that these two tools in particular are quite useful when working with low pixel scenes like

04:12.980 --> 04:16.690
the ones we're working on now if we have a look over at the tool options.

04:16.790 --> 04:23.830
There is a mode and there are four options we can toggle between the first one.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.100
Is replacing the current selection.

04:27.110 --> 04:33.440
Now what this will do is as you select a new area of your image it would select what was previously

04:33.440 --> 04:34.900
selected.

04:34.910 --> 04:39.840
Now when we've got only two colours in our scene it's not going to make sense to use the by colour.

04:39.860 --> 04:44.840
In this case demonstrate it but we can use the Fuzzy's Select Tool and select one of the eyes we see

04:45.110 --> 04:49.990
the hashed or dashed edge around our particular selection.

04:50.330 --> 04:54.620
If we want to use the next one along we can add other selections to it.

04:54.740 --> 04:57.210
So we clicked that we can add the next guy.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.870
And these are now both selected.

04:59.870 --> 05:05.710
Now you can also use the shortcut key shift in order to enable additions.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.770
Now we can hold down Shift and click the mouth and it's selected.

05:09.860 --> 05:13.850
Now the next one along is subtraction.

05:13.850 --> 05:17.760
So Whoops we've selected the mouthfull You've selected something incorrectly.

05:17.780 --> 05:24.890
We can go ahead now and hold down control or indeed just select that particular icon and go through

05:25.250 --> 05:28.360
and remove the eyes for instance.

05:28.430 --> 05:29.240
Brilliant.

05:29.240 --> 05:36.170
Now that we have the mouth selected what we can do is demonstrate that only the selection is affected

05:36.170 --> 05:37.490
by another tool.

05:37.520 --> 05:43.730
So we go ahead and let's say grab the fill tool I'll pick a different colour say red We can click and

05:43.730 --> 05:49.230
it will fill only the mouth area and only the area that's selected.

05:49.310 --> 05:53.520
If I was to click anywhere else it would not do anything.

05:53.630 --> 05:58.310
Now that selection is persistent across multiple layers.

05:58.340 --> 06:05.570
So if I go and create a new layer and call this mouth Watts We can then do is again with that layer

06:05.570 --> 06:09.150
selected fill in that area and I'm just going to do it blue.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.700
So it stands out.

06:10.700 --> 06:11.800
And there it go.

06:11.870 --> 06:17.420
And if we have a look just at that layer a by itself the mouth lay We can see that we've coloured in

06:17.420 --> 06:24.430
an area that's completely separate using the outline of another drawing on another layer.

06:24.470 --> 06:30.380
Now inverting the selection is something that's incredibly useful and I use a lot.

06:30.380 --> 06:36.180
So so we're just working on this mouthfull layer here and we want the rest of the area now selected.

06:36.260 --> 06:43.910
But our mouth the selected there is an option to invert it's under the select menu and we can see here

06:43.910 --> 06:50.480
we've got invert and at the shortcut there is control and if we do that now the rest of our image is

06:50.480 --> 06:52.590
selected and the mouth is not.

06:52.640 --> 06:58.490
We can tell that even though it looks very similar that is because the border of the entire image now

06:58.490 --> 07:00.180
has that dashed edge around.

07:00.900 --> 07:06.240
If I go ahead and create a new layer again and I'm going to call this back ground cause now we've got

07:06.240 --> 07:11.080
two layers called background but that's not a problem at the moment.

07:11.190 --> 07:16.530
And I'm going to select let's say Green if I now click on that background we will see that it fills

07:16.530 --> 07:20.900
everything in in the by the disable the mouse mouse mouth.

07:20.940 --> 07:26.080
We will see that that area is now left completely clean and transparent.

07:26.190 --> 07:30.300
Now that doesn't just work with the filter tool it works with every other tool as well so if I was to

07:30.300 --> 07:34.590
go ahead and grab the pencil tool pick another colour are not going to go that bright pink.

07:34.710 --> 07:37.610
And now you can see as I'm colouring in.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.050
The area that's not selected is not affected by it at all.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.380
Now there are a few other tool options.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.820
Let's go have a look at those.

07:46.820 --> 07:53.480
I'm going to go back to the fuzzy Select Tool and go to the tool options now anti-aliasing is one of

07:53.480 --> 07:54.510
the options here.

07:54.710 --> 08:01.160
This isn't going to really make that much difference at a low pixel count like the one we currently

08:01.160 --> 08:02.280
have.

08:02.330 --> 08:06.130
It's to do with making edges less jagged.

08:06.170 --> 08:12.740
In this case is always going to be a jagged edge because we're working at such a small pixel level.

08:12.860 --> 08:19.160
Will come across instances later on where this does matter whether it's turned on or off.

08:19.160 --> 08:24.350
When you make the initial selection once we've made a selection if we go and change any of these options

08:24.350 --> 08:31.200
it does not apply to the current selection we'd have to do a new selection for it to apply.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.270
Now the feather edge is an interesting one.

08:34.340 --> 08:37.150
I'm going to turn off anti-aliasing for the moment and turn on Feather edges.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.760
It turns on a radius.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.720
Now this has got a radius of 10 that might be too much.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.540
Let's go over to the mouth layer and just have a look at what it will do.

08:46.550 --> 08:48.590
Now we've got some tracks selected at the moment.

08:48.590 --> 08:53.330
I'm going to go back to just replacing the current selection on the mode and I'm going to select our

08:53.330 --> 08:58.010
mouth and we can see here that it's changed the shape of the selection.

08:58.010 --> 09:04.040
It's brought it in slightly with a radius you probably guessed it of 10 pixels that should be roughly

09:04.040 --> 09:12.530
20 pixels across which it does look like if I set that to something like five that entire area will

09:12.530 --> 09:13.370
get selected.

09:13.370 --> 09:20.000
But you can see it's not an exact selection it has feathered it in a radius around a sensor point.

09:20.060 --> 09:25.940
And if we turn up a little maude's as let's say 50 and we'll see that a very small a much smaller area

09:25.970 --> 09:27.440
has been selected.

09:27.440 --> 09:33.530
Now I don't usually use the feather reges because I don't feel like I've got a lot of control over what

09:33.530 --> 09:37.970
it's doing I understand what it's doing but it doesn't give me always the control that I want.

09:37.970 --> 09:44.720
If you've got a rounded object however this is a perfect way of bringing different colour gradients

09:44.720 --> 09:45.260
coming in.

09:45.260 --> 09:51.500
For instance going to term feather edges off now select transparent areas as you probably guessed if

09:51.500 --> 09:57.690
were on the mouth area and we go ahead and select it enables us to select the area that is transparent.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.880
Otherwise we could not select an area with transparency.

10:01.880 --> 10:07.520
And again this would be the same as having the mouth selected and inverting in this particular case

10:08.150 --> 10:13.460
sample merged again very similar to the filter or you'll notice as we go through that some of the tool

10:13.460 --> 10:16.400
options continue to repeat themselves.

10:16.400 --> 10:24.200
Now if I was to go on and turn the background layer back on and have sample merge turned off and a different

10:24.200 --> 10:30.890
layer other than the background layer selected I cannot select these eyes with sample merged turn on

10:31.220 --> 10:33.380
essentially flattens the image.

10:33.380 --> 10:39.430
So now I can select those eyes because it will select anything that's currently visible.

10:39.500 --> 10:46.040
If I turn on the background layer it'll enable me to select this current green area at the top.

10:46.040 --> 10:52.670
Now if I wanted the green area in the lower left to also be selected I could hold down Shift and select

10:52.670 --> 10:53.330
it.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.090
That's one way of doing it.

10:55.100 --> 11:01.340
Alternatively I could have use the by colour selection and just selected the colour.

11:01.470 --> 11:03.860
You see it's selected everything but the mouth there.

11:03.860 --> 11:07.940
That's because it's selected the transparent area behind.

11:08.090 --> 11:12.980
So let's make sure sample merged is turned on because we just changed the tool and click.

11:12.980 --> 11:19.210
And here we go we select the entire green area at the top and the green area at the bottom.

11:19.250 --> 11:22.950
Regardless of that they are actually being selected.

11:22.970 --> 11:27.910
Now the final thing I'd like to cover before we get onto a challenge is moving your selection.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.660
So let's go ahead and I'm going to just hide everything else I've done so far.

11:31.670 --> 11:38.450
But the background layer and let's say I've gone ahead and selected this I can do that now.

11:38.600 --> 11:45.330
Now once I've selected a particular set of pixels I can move that selection.

11:45.710 --> 11:51.610
So with that I can hold down the old key and you'll notice on the cursor a little move icon appears

11:51.620 --> 11:52.970
and it is little.

11:52.970 --> 12:00.650
It's a four headed arrow and then I can move my selection to another location so I can create a nose.

12:00.830 --> 12:02.790
That's exactly the same proportion.

12:02.900 --> 12:09.640
And then grab another tool like the pencil tool and just colour that area in.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.310
And wow we've covered quite a bit to do with the selection till now.

12:14.470 --> 12:18.800
Let's go ahead and solidify that knowledge and apply it in a challenge.

12:19.200 --> 12:19.490
Okay.

12:19.510 --> 12:25.060
So your challenge for this lecture is to create forcillo where it's using the selection tools that we

12:25.060 --> 12:26.470
view so far.

12:26.470 --> 12:32.080
Now you can use existing images or if you want to really test your skills create some new ones some

12:32.080 --> 12:38.230
new game icons and improve the silhouettes with detail and the end goal of this is going to be to make

12:38.230 --> 12:45.310
a place holder like in an inventory where you have a weapon or ability that is not yet acquired in the

12:45.310 --> 12:46.130
game.

12:46.230 --> 12:52.000
An example for that might be a hint that there's a sword to be collected or a sword slot on your character

12:52.270 --> 12:54.490
and it might look something along these lines.

12:54.490 --> 12:59.690
Of course this artistic style is entirely down to yourself and how you approach it.

12:59.710 --> 13:00.160
Go ahead.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.460
Pause a video now and give that a go.

13:04.630 --> 13:05.310
Okay guys.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.280
Welcome back.

13:06.280 --> 13:11.540
Let's go ahead and make a place holder for a weapon or ability that is not yet acquired.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.740
Okay so we left off somewhere around our smiley face.

13:14.740 --> 13:18.850
Let's go ahead now and create that inventory item.

13:18.880 --> 13:24.130
I'm going to go ahead and create one from scratch because I need a sword that's a slightly different

13:24.130 --> 13:25.020
size.

13:25.090 --> 13:31.480
So let's go ahead and create a new image 32 by 32 that's absolutely fine I'm going to zoom in and I'm

13:31.480 --> 13:33.400
gonna use all the tools we've learned so far.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.990
But the first thing I'm going to start with is a pencil tool and I'm going to draw a rough outline.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.880
Now I want my sword to start and end.

13:41.890 --> 13:43.020
It doesn't matter if the colours.

13:43.030 --> 13:47.020
In this case start and end with some space around it.

13:47.140 --> 13:48.560
So I'm going to have the.

13:48.600 --> 13:54.070
Handle is called a handle with a sword it's probably got a proper name but I'm not aware of.

13:54.070 --> 14:01.040
I'm holding no shift in control here to snap it to 45 degrees and let's have the sword come out and

14:01.040 --> 14:02.220
maybe here.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.920
And the same cross here a line.

14:06.950 --> 14:14.160
Yes this is all the way down and the same here so we can build up are our object very quickly in this

14:14.160 --> 14:14.780
manner.

14:16.240 --> 14:22.140
Now because we're focussed on making the sword as simple as possible.

14:22.150 --> 14:26.580
I can go through in a moment some of these areas I'll be able to fill in others.

14:26.590 --> 14:27.300
I will not.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.260
So these are areas that have sort of white chequers in between.

14:32.260 --> 14:35.440
I'm not going to be able to fill those in easily.

14:35.560 --> 14:42.070
So I'm just going to do those manually but these larger areas of the blade I will be able to do that

14:42.070 --> 14:48.100
some are going to grab the fill tool and fill those two areas in now other filter all has gone to something

14:48.130 --> 14:53.620
I had previously and go to the foreground colour fill and fill that in.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.270
Why is it not filling in fully.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.200
Because the pastie is turned all the way down.

14:58.220 --> 15:00.600
Love these mini challenges as they come up.

15:00.790 --> 15:08.620
Okay so there's my sort of outline if you will and I create a new layer and I'm going to call it what

15:08.620 --> 15:10.330
shall we call this bezel.

15:10.600 --> 15:17.050
And I'm going to make myself a light border and then a dark border and it's just going to simply go

15:17.050 --> 15:26.440
around the very edge of my image and create a lip if you will to frame the rest of our model.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.110
Now I'm going to go round here.

15:28.150 --> 15:32.850
I'm going to make it a bit darker those two colours are a little bit similar.

15:33.190 --> 15:34.590
I don't think that's going to matter actually.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.700
By the time we start filling it in with further details.

15:37.960 --> 15:43.300
Okay so we've got a basic selection they're going to go back to the background and where's the selection

15:43.300 --> 15:43.600
tool.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.030
There we go.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.010
I'm going to select that area there and using.

15:47.260 --> 15:53.760
Let's use the airbrushed tool at this point point and I have a lighter colour and a larger brush that's

15:53.760 --> 15:55.650
going to find a larger brush.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.950
There again whole sets that should be enough.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.290
To draw half of this a bit lighter.

16:03.290 --> 16:06.500
Now there are other methods you could use to do that.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.200
That's absolutely fine for me at the moment.

16:09.200 --> 16:15.000
Now the final thing that I want to do is use the inversion for control and I.

16:15.200 --> 16:21.050
Now all this white area is selected and I'm going to go back to the fill tool and turn down the capacity

16:21.050 --> 16:24.920
again and use one of these patterns that I found.

16:25.250 --> 16:32.000
Now be great initially to have a colour laid down so let's lay down a colour and then using the pattern

16:32.000 --> 16:33.110
fill on top.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.620
We can start adding a bit more detail.

16:36.140 --> 16:42.440
Now I don't like how this sword is currently looking I think it's too dark on one side and matches the

16:42.440 --> 16:43.550
border too much.

16:43.670 --> 16:48.010
So I'm going to again go control and I need to flip the selection background.

16:48.150 --> 16:49.980
I grab the airbrush tool again.

16:50.270 --> 16:55.820
Very useful tool that and I am going to use a slightly different colour.

16:56.090 --> 16:59.120
And let's pick there perhaps.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.510
Again this is all a little bit of guesswork as well as a go.

17:04.430 --> 17:08.200
And obviously you can fine tune these things as you go as well.

17:08.270 --> 17:10.340
So that is coming together really well.

17:10.340 --> 17:12.380
I'm liking how that's working.

17:12.380 --> 17:16.050
Is there something else I could do to my image.

17:16.490 --> 17:24.190
Now I could invert the selection again and I have a slightly darker border around the sword now.

17:24.290 --> 17:30.500
So I don't destroy anything in a perhaps in in an ideal world I would have used more layers as it was.

17:31.010 --> 17:35.170
But let's add a shadow layer and call it shadow.

17:35.390 --> 17:41.090
Try to remember to name things as you go and name them appropriately especially just to get into a good

17:41.090 --> 17:47.690
habit even if it is a throw away item it is very easy I do it myself am I forget to name things.

17:47.690 --> 17:53.390
But then sometimes a throwaway item or what you think is a throw away item ends up not being.

17:53.390 --> 17:56.200
So this is going to be a shadow layer so we need a dark colour.

17:56.600 --> 18:03.860
And let's turn the value down search is just darker now because we're selected on the outside and this

18:03.890 --> 18:06.320
inside area is not selected.

18:06.380 --> 18:12.050
I can essentially go he says that it is currently selected only to invert that selection and try again.

18:12.080 --> 18:12.980
There we go.

18:12.980 --> 18:17.610
I can now add a shadow behind my sword.

18:17.620 --> 18:22.190
Now I don't know if that's going to work at all or whether it's going to look incredibly messy it might

18:22.190 --> 18:23.360
look messy.

18:23.360 --> 18:28.250
So I'm going to select that using the pencil all this time and make a half shadow.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.360
How does that look.

18:29.530 --> 18:33.260
Sume in and out and just have a quick look.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.450
You know what that looks rubbish.

18:36.470 --> 18:37.190
Absolutely rubbish.

18:37.190 --> 18:38.060
I don't like that idea.

18:38.060 --> 18:41.960
So because it's on a separate layer this is the beauty of non-destructive workflow.

18:42.080 --> 18:48.230
I can either just clear the liar and try a different approach or just go ahead and click delete and

18:48.230 --> 18:50.690
it just goes and I can start afresh.

18:51.500 --> 18:57.390
I'm going to leave mine like that for the moment I'm happy as that has an initial place holder.

18:57.410 --> 19:02.950
How did you guys get on please share your place holders over on the discussions.

19:02.950 --> 19:05.410
And I will see you guys in the next lecture.
