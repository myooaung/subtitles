00:04.760 --> 00:08.900
Hey you guys are welcome to this lecture aren't working to a specification.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.550
Now it is not as dull as it first sounds.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.410
There's lots of little gems in here.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.610
So you're probably already thinking about specification as in what size it is what colours you're going

00:19.610 --> 00:21.480
to use etc. etc..

00:21.560 --> 00:28.260
But there's something that's more important than that and that is your own internal specification.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.000
Now not only is that going to save you time but it can save you a lot of effort.

00:33.140 --> 00:38.690
If you're not working to an internal specification then you're going to end up wasting your time and

00:38.690 --> 00:42.560
spending effort on something that perhaps doesn't need it in the first place.

00:42.710 --> 00:47.630
So by the end of this we're going to be learning how to generate your own specification.

00:47.700 --> 00:54.710
If you think about straying outside a specification it means that you're probably doing work now that

00:54.710 --> 00:59.690
doesn't have any bearing on the final project that you're working on now.

00:59.720 --> 01:07.160
Making consistent icons within your game or anything else that you're working on is going to be important

01:07.400 --> 01:14.990
and a specification can help with that with even colour themes with sizes with levels of detail.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.630
What the icons are going to look like etc. etc..

01:17.630 --> 01:23.710
There's lots of things but being consistent when you've got a group of icons is very important.

01:24.050 --> 01:31.520
Now understanding some of the specification choices that you can make can also change the other ones

01:31.520 --> 01:32.980
that you can possibly pick.

01:32.990 --> 01:39.720
So if you go ahead and say you wanted something realistic Well how are you going to do an area of effects

01:39.730 --> 01:40.620
spell.

01:40.630 --> 01:46.130
Realistically some of them just don't work in certain context.

01:46.230 --> 01:53.870
Now really good resources Good both Google and Apple for the Android in IAW system have very very detailed

01:53.870 --> 02:00.110
specifications for how apps should look on their mobile devices and that's to give a consistent feel

02:00.110 --> 02:07.190
from app to app and make people feel safe essentially in a place as they're going through.

02:07.190 --> 02:09.640
And this is important in your game as well.

02:09.680 --> 02:15.920
If you don't have that consistency across the style consistency across the game it'll just look like

02:16.010 --> 02:20.420
loads of different things have all come together in one place and that's just no good.

02:20.420 --> 02:25.280
We want to avoid that and get that under our belts right from day one.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.670
So let's talk about binary choices.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.270
What are binary choices.

02:29.270 --> 02:35.930
Well there's simply this or that not some in between or anything along those lines.

02:35.930 --> 02:42.230
So we've got a list of about six items I think is that we're going to go through now to give you an

02:42.230 --> 02:46.950
idea of specifications and I will add some of my own at the end as well.

02:46.970 --> 02:49.580
So looking real or is Icon sized.

02:49.580 --> 02:57.470
This is a design choice that you can make at any stage you can try both is looking real when it's small

02:57.500 --> 02:59.210
more difficult than making it look.

02:59.240 --> 03:03.320
I'm convinced there's lots of choices you can go through with that too.

03:03.410 --> 03:07.310
All three in appearance so is something coming out.

03:07.310 --> 03:13.210
Is there a fist coming out towards you like that or is it just a fist like that looking up.

03:13.310 --> 03:18.800
So there's lots of different options you can have when laying out your icons and they can give you a

03:18.800 --> 03:19.640
different feel.

03:19.640 --> 03:24.740
Of course if you choose to do one maybe a 3D one where it comes bursting out.

03:24.740 --> 03:31.310
Then if you've got a flat looking khonsari 2D looking like then it's going to stand out as different

03:31.310 --> 03:32.450
from the other ones.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.060
Transparency other parts of the image see through.

03:36.230 --> 03:42.140
Now this can have a big impact because if you can see what's behind your icons that can change the whole

03:42.140 --> 03:44.070
feel of how it's laid out.

03:44.120 --> 03:50.270
Or perhaps part of your icon sticks out from with in sort of its frame that it worked.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.490
It sat in now shading.

03:53.690 --> 03:57.170
We've got flat shading all the way through to realistic.

03:57.200 --> 04:03.350
Now we are basically talking about whether or not you go for that realistic look when it comes to texturing

04:03.350 --> 04:08.330
your image does it look like it's a real piece of wood or does it look like it's a cartoon piece of

04:08.330 --> 04:08.780
wood.

04:08.780 --> 04:12.350
Of course there can be any degree of freedom in between.

04:12.390 --> 04:17.780
But if you make one extreme or the other it certainly makes it easier to know what your output is going

04:17.780 --> 04:18.560
to be.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.510
Square edged rounded square or even down to a circle.

04:23.510 --> 04:30.350
Now these are choices design choices that you need to make early on because that's square and then on

04:30.360 --> 04:37.650
that circular ultimately has different proportions when you're making the item in the middle of that.

04:37.700 --> 04:42.140
That frame essentially and finally axis of symmetry.

04:42.920 --> 04:43.820
Or mirroring.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.060
It doesn't have to always be symmetry.

04:46.070 --> 04:52.950
Now this can be incredibly important and can convey a structured feel to your to your icons.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.190
However it can be incredibly restrictive as well.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.680
But of course you can take elements of these.

04:58.790 --> 05:05.400
So it is rather in this case it's a choice of whether you go for an axis of symmetry or not at all.

05:05.630 --> 05:10.460
And of course one of the other things you can do that's not on this list because it's not really about

05:10.700 --> 05:18.410
your decisions on your design it's more about you at this point in time especially if you're a beginner.

05:18.500 --> 05:23.640
We don't want you really really focussing hours and hours on one image.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.920
You're not going to be able to produce great work if you spend hours on one image.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.890
I'm sure there's one of you out there that can do.

05:30.080 --> 05:35.600
But if you practice with many many many images then you're going to be able to output far more you're

05:35.600 --> 05:39.520
going to learn a lot quicker as you produce more and more work.

05:39.710 --> 05:43.670
There's a fable about Potter but I'm not going to go through that right now.

05:43.670 --> 05:50.120
Now what I tend to do personally is I set myself a time limit and it should go ahead and set it on my

05:50.120 --> 05:53.360
watch or whatever and say 10 minutes or so.

05:53.390 --> 05:56.400
Especially early on when you're making icons like this.

05:56.480 --> 06:01.210
Ten minutes is all it takes to get a good Icom out there and that's it.

06:01.250 --> 06:07.820
Later on you can revisit that and spend another 10 20 30 minutes tidying up once.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.150
That's one of your chosen icons that you want to go for.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.730
So produce many produce lots fail fast and you'll get there.

06:17.150 --> 06:22.760
Now breaking your rules we've just set a load of specifications out there and rules are meant to be

06:22.760 --> 06:24.420
broken right.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.610
Kind of.

06:25.610 --> 06:31.760
There are there is always some leeway but you can have break little things whilst keeping the general

06:31.760 --> 06:32.660
principle.

06:32.720 --> 06:38.070
So if you've got symmetry it doesn't have to be perfect symmetry or perfect mirroring.

06:38.090 --> 06:41.580
There can be some difference in your icon itself.

06:41.630 --> 06:48.050
However if the general feel of it is there then it will be consistent with all of your other icons that

06:48.050 --> 06:48.560
you produce.

06:48.650 --> 06:53.360
If you just completely throw the rule book out the window then you going to be inconsistent because

06:53.360 --> 06:59.060
you're not going to be working to that specification anymore and slip into your special ops too far.

06:59.060 --> 07:03.860
This is what I've just said slipping too far from your specification is going to lead to inconsistency

07:03.890 --> 07:08.650
and your iKON's won't look like they're part of a single group.

07:08.690 --> 07:13.200
Finally Consistency is important with a collection now.

07:13.220 --> 07:16.360
You might have thought that I've just said consistency several times.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.660
I hope it's sinking in.

07:17.770 --> 07:24.560
It is incredibly important when you're creating a collection or working on a larger project that everything

07:24.590 --> 07:27.200
fits together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

07:27.200 --> 07:32.450
You might not know where they all go at the moment but at least let's get them the right side up so

07:32.450 --> 07:34.060
the image is facing upwards.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.340
In that analogy.

07:35.550 --> 07:40.850
Okay so now that we've had a good chat about working to a specification I'm like you guys now to think

07:40.850 --> 07:46.360
carefully about your specification and we're going to do that now through the form of a challenge.

07:46.730 --> 07:53.230
Okay so your challenge is going to be to write down six binary constraints so the things that you're

07:53.240 --> 07:54.460
going to pick from.

07:54.640 --> 08:01.080
A yes or no this or that and pick one from each category.

08:01.100 --> 08:06.040
Once you've done this of course Congratulations you'll have a specification.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.490
And of course I would like to know what that specification is so we can hold you to it as you go through

08:10.490 --> 08:11.400
your projects.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.940
Let us know what you have picked.

08:14.420 --> 08:20.410
Okay so just a reminder now of the six binary constraints that we've come up with there.

08:20.480 --> 08:26.390
Over here on the side and if you want to use all or none of them feel free to do so.

08:26.390 --> 08:27.540
We don't mind at all.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.480
But remember whatever you pick.

08:29.540 --> 08:34.150
That's what you're going to be sticking to for the rest of this particular section.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.940
Balls of video now and give that a go.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.310
Hey you guys welcome back.

08:40.430 --> 08:42.200
So what did we choose.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.990
Well in this case I have chosen to go for an icon.

08:46.190 --> 08:52.130
That gives me more options with things like area of effect 2D or 3D.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.650
I'm going to go for more of a 3-d appearance.

08:54.710 --> 08:58.510
Transparency are parts of the image see through me.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.370
This is good to be.

08:59.390 --> 09:06.010
Yes I do want to have some transparency in my image shading flat through realistic.

09:06.020 --> 09:09.050
I'm going to go for flat rather than realistic.

09:09.050 --> 09:15.440
That means that I can probably have more flat colours through flatulence throughout my work for undoing

09:15.470 --> 09:19.480
which will also hopefully speed up my process as well.

09:19.550 --> 09:27.010
Square rounded circular we are going to go four square and then finally access the symmetry or mirroring.

09:27.140 --> 09:32.660
No we're not going to have that as a rule that has to be stuck to or certainly not.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.530
If you are that's great.

09:34.550 --> 09:36.380
What I've chosen is my choice.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.030
What you've chosen is yours.

09:38.060 --> 09:43.180
Do you remember to share that in the discussions and I will see you guys in the next lecture.
