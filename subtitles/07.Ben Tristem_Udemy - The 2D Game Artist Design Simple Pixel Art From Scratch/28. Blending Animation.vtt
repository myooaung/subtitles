00:04.370 --> 00:05.750
Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:05.750 --> 00:12.620
Before we get to this final challenge I do want to show you one quick tip that will drastically increase

00:12.650 --> 00:14.890
your speed of productivity.

00:14.900 --> 00:20.170
Now I've been thinking about this and some things it works on and some it doesn't it will work on our

00:20.180 --> 00:23.710
particular scene in front of us now but it might not work with other ones.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.760
I'll show you both cases.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.510
I can duplicate the letter because I'm happy with it.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.610
I'm now on frame 2 I'm going to hide.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.470
Frame one from existence.

00:32.510 --> 00:40.130
I'm just going to hold to these flames ever so slightly so we've got a bit of basically two frames to

00:40.130 --> 00:43.360
go between and I'll do the candle as well.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.720
Just make it shift over slightly there.

00:46.730 --> 00:51.770
Now if we go and just check this we can literally fake the animation by switching between the two legs.

00:51.770 --> 00:52.160
There we go.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.430
That's changing backwards and forwards.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.810
Now there's an option in under the filters under the animation section to use blend.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.440
And I think this is going to work really well in this instance.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.900
Now blend enables you to add far more frames in between everything else.

01:07.970 --> 01:13.250
So intermediate frames I could go here and put maybe four in it's going to start literally in between

01:13.250 --> 01:14.060
these two frames.

01:14.060 --> 01:15.390
Put another four in.

01:15.530 --> 01:21.380
And I'm going to select Loopt as well and that will help blend the last frame with the first frame.

01:21.470 --> 01:27.950
So it will loop around in a circle and we go ahead and click okay blend animation Elise Lees in these

01:27.950 --> 01:31.100
three sources so we can't do it with what we've got in front of us.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.520
Here we go to need.

01:33.270 --> 01:35.820
Three layers three layer groups certainly.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.830
So I'm going to enable that one so I can see what that looks like.

01:38.910 --> 01:41.460
Go to the flame and do a couple more alterations.

01:41.460 --> 01:46.020
Again these are only rough and ready to see what we can get out of this.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.330
And there we go.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.830
So that should be plenty for this to go on.

01:49.830 --> 01:54.500
We can now go to our filters animation and blend an intermediate frames.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.890
This is going to create by the way a new image which is great.

01:58.890 --> 02:01.170
It means it's not going to destroy what you've got.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.450
You can see with those three it's managed to stick frames in between.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.370
Now what has it actually done.

02:07.680 --> 02:14.130
Well if we have a look at the original one and go back to animation and playback we will see that.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.840
Well unfortunately it's a little hard to see.

02:16.860 --> 02:22.110
So what I will do here and I encourage you to do this as well certainly save your work before you do

02:22.110 --> 02:24.970
it and then go to view.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.890
Sorry go to impeach scale image.

02:28.920 --> 02:33.480
Make sure interpellation is turned off and you can turn this up to a sensible size.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.340
Now you may get air a memory error when you try and do this.

02:39.020 --> 02:39.610
I didn't.

02:39.610 --> 02:40.430
That's good.

02:40.430 --> 02:42.780
So now it's a little larger when we go to.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.160
Filter's animation and play back.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.300
It's a little bit easier to see.

02:48.530 --> 02:53.600
So here's our original one you can see it's quite jerky and of course it's only three frames so I'm

02:53.600 --> 02:55.900
not expecting it to be super smooth.

02:56.090 --> 03:01.250
However with very little work this extra one that we've done that we're also going to have to scale

03:01.280 --> 03:03.950
up to the same size for comparison.

03:03.950 --> 03:10.370
Now if we go ahead and get animation and play back on this hopefully it will look a lot smoother and

03:10.370 --> 03:13.960
we can see there because we've got a lot more frames.

03:14.540 --> 03:21.080
It's blending between them and it's also as I say smoother but this does mean we can then increase the

03:21.080 --> 03:24.870
playback speed accordingly because we've got more frames to play with.

03:25.010 --> 03:30.620
And since we got about three times the amount of frames that's play three times the speed now there's

03:30.620 --> 03:36.400
really not enough information in those three frames to make a decent blend.

03:36.410 --> 03:42.320
But you can see how this can be built upon to extend your existing animation and make it potentially

03:42.320 --> 03:43.790
better.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.810
The other thing that I will show you at this point is where it does fail.

03:47.810 --> 03:52.640
So if I go ahead and open up something I've worked on previously that bouncing ball would be a good

03:52.670 --> 03:53.330
example.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.710
Here we go.

03:54.920 --> 04:02.060
Now I've got a series of frames here I've got 20 frames in total if I go ahead and just apply that filter

04:02.090 --> 04:04.100
under animation blend to here.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.560
It doesn't matter whether it's looped or not.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.940
I'm going to turn that off for this moment because I don't want it looping.

04:09.020 --> 04:12.530
It goes from the top it bounces down and then lands on the floor.

04:12.560 --> 04:18.260
Intermediate frames even at one intermediate frame I don't want to slow it down too much.

04:18.260 --> 04:22.550
We get an interesting effect happen let's go to animation and playback.

04:22.640 --> 04:30.110
You'll see that's the first frame flickers Now that of course can cause you some issues especially with

04:30.110 --> 04:32.120
an animation like this.

04:32.120 --> 04:37.190
Otherwise the rest of the animation is quite good because now we can turn it up to maybe 20 frames per

04:37.190 --> 04:40.400
second and have a smoother image.

04:40.400 --> 04:46.070
Now is not ideal because you're still not having an in-between in between the other frames it's literally

04:46.070 --> 04:51.920
blurring between them and we can see that as we go through the image themselves you can see you've got

04:51.920 --> 04:53.870
some that are blurred and they're not.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.080
And then they are in then they're not.

04:56.090 --> 05:00.090
So just give us a bit of a a motion blur to something moving.

05:00.200 --> 05:06.260
However your mileage may vary depending on what you're producing and what your end animation is going

05:06.260 --> 05:07.650
to be.

05:07.700 --> 05:12.740
With that in mind there is not going to be a challenge with this one because I want to get you straight

05:12.740 --> 05:18.100
in to the end of section challenge and I will see you in the next lecture.
