So we thank you so much for joining us.

00:07.150 --> 00:11.890
Who would be interested in one of udemy top instructors I think up with Michael here to design you this

00:11.890 --> 00:12.550
guimpe course.

00:12.550 --> 00:17.050
My job is a behind the scenes role to make sure that the learning journey makes sense and is just right

00:17.050 --> 00:19.130
for a complete beginner like me frankly.

00:19.210 --> 00:24.160
And I've teamed up with an expert who is going to be I'm going to be your main instructor on this course

00:24.160 --> 00:27.220
I've been doing art for many many years now and I really enjoy it.

00:27.250 --> 00:32.550
And one of the best things is seeing anybody doing art and especially like Ben here.

00:32.620 --> 00:37.880
If you start from absolutely nothing it's amazing the transformation that you guys can actually achieve.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.400
We really love to see that nagging.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.840
It's not a poor man's second choice to Photoshop.

00:41.830 --> 00:43.210
It is a community driven project.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.250
It's open source but it's completely free.

00:45.250 --> 00:49.180
There's no ongoing costs you and there's a lot of extensions and add ons available out there.

00:49.180 --> 00:53.370
So once you get over the initial hump of getting familiar with it and getting to know how to use it.

00:53.410 --> 00:55.360
Superpowerful tools a good choice.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.020
Investing your time in learning gimp So Mikey what's next.

00:59.020 --> 01:04.270
Well transformation that you're going to achieve is wonderful but what we want is you to share that

01:04.270 --> 01:05.730
transformation with us.

01:05.740 --> 01:09.590
We highly recommend that as you're taking this course you do develop your skills.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.800
You actually share the work that you do with us and the community is wonderful to see you guys have

01:14.800 --> 01:19.120
progressed through the course and we really find what you get out of the course is related to what you

01:19.120 --> 01:20.940
put in effort that extra effort.

01:21.190 --> 01:25.470
So if you've got questions about questions if you want to know how to ask questions how to get help.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.790
There's a video towards the end of the section that tells you all about that.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.540
Just get cracking get started.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.350
First would be our best suggestion.

01:31.510 --> 01:31.830
Yes.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.800
And finally for those out there.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.520
These are becoming more and more common.

01:35.590 --> 01:42.630
High resolution screens for K screens and above you may have to tweak gimp settings to make it readable.

01:42.770 --> 01:48.070
So again at the end of this section we've made sure that you guys are covered as well there with a special

01:48.070 --> 01:52.350
lecture on high resolution screens and that applies made them to pieces right.

01:52.390 --> 01:57.070
Yes Windows is not very good with high resolutions so there's elektra at the end of this section if

01:57.070 --> 01:57.490
you need that.

01:57.490 --> 02:01.850
