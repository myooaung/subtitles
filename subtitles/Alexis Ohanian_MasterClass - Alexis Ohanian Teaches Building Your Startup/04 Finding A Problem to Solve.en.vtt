00:07.640 --> 00:11.180 align:middle line:84%
 I'm definitely guilty
of carrying around--

00:11.180 --> 00:12.950 align:middle line:84%
back in the day it
was a notepad, now

00:12.950 --> 00:16.730 align:middle line:84%
it's just a notes section of
my smartphone-- full of things

00:16.730 --> 00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that piss me off,
because chances are,

00:20.060 --> 00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
if you're upset by something,
there is a good business

00:24.470 --> 00:25.440 align:middle line:90%
opportunity there.

00:25.440 --> 00:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25.940 --> 00:29.090 align:middle line:84%
If it's a product experience
that frustrates you,

00:29.090 --> 00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
if it's something
that just isn't just

00:32.119 --> 00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
working as well as
it should, there's

00:34.580 --> 00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
probably a chance to
build something better.

00:37.130 --> 00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't always mean
it's a great business,

00:41.870 --> 00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
but it definitely
gets you to start

00:43.400 --> 00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
thinking about areas where
you can improve and get you

00:46.310 --> 00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in a mindset where you're
looking for things to solve.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty common
that your customers

00:52.910 --> 00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
or potential
customers don't even

00:54.830 --> 00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
know the right solution
for their problem.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, they all
have great quotes about people

01:02.570 --> 01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
wanting, was it, faster
horses and not an automobile.

01:06.620 --> 01:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

01:08.690 --> 01:12.470 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing quite like a
founder that has thought deeply

01:12.470 --> 01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
about a problem, talked
to and can really

01:15.020 --> 01:17.570 align:middle line:84%
empathize with
potential customers,

01:17.570 --> 01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and is able to really
engineer something

01:19.280 --> 01:21.080 align:middle line:90%
that is noticeably better.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then I still
meet founders who say, look,

01:23.850 --> 01:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I just can't--

01:24.620 --> 01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an ideal person.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I
don't believe you.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I don't think
you're trying hard enough

01:33.320 --> 01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think you've
really spent the time

01:36.470 --> 01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
understanding what people
need, because there

01:40.340 --> 01:44.677 align:middle line:84%
is no shortage of things
that need to be improved.

01:44.677 --> 01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It's about realizing what
you're going to work on,

01:46.760 --> 01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to commit
a decade of your life to,

01:49.220 --> 01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and then how to
actually get started.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Most good ideas have
lots of competitors.

02:03.090 --> 02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Or at least they
have other versions

02:06.630 --> 02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that are less good
already out in the market.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
You should be aware
of it, you should

02:10.800 --> 02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
listen to your
customers, you should

02:12.300 --> 02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
listen to their customers,
but pay no attention

02:15.360 --> 02:16.345 align:middle line:90%
to what they're doing.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
If you've spent the
time in the market,

02:17.970 --> 02:19.680 align:middle line:84%
if you spent the time
talking to customers,

02:19.680 --> 02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
if you've done the
diligence-- yeah,

02:21.180 --> 02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
even a cursory Google
search or Twitter search--

02:24.120 --> 02:26.650 align:middle line:90%
you'll know other competitors.

02:26.650 --> 02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But it is rare that I
get turned off in a pitch

02:30.970 --> 02:33.230 align:middle line:90%
just because competitors exist.

02:33.230 --> 02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And so pay attention to
your competitor's customers.

02:36.610 --> 02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Don't pay attention
to your competitors.

02:38.660 --> 02:41.217 align:middle line:84%
And remain focused on building
the best products you can

02:41.217 --> 02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
for the users you have
today and then the ones you

02:43.300 --> 02:44.175 align:middle line:90%
want to get tomorrow.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So product market fit
is one of these cliches

02:53.190 --> 02:55.885 align:middle line:90%
you'll hear a lot in tech.

02:55.885 --> 02:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It's an important one, though.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that
you have a good fit

03:00.010 --> 03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
between the product you've built
and the market that wants it.

03:03.070 --> 03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
That is, people like
what you're building.

03:05.950 --> 03:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Clear signs of product market
fit are high retention numbers.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So that after 30 days, you know,
15%, 20%, 30% 40% of people

03:15.490 --> 03:17.230 align:middle line:90%
are still using your app.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.790 align:middle line:90%
The higher the better.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, I've
had startups where,

03:20.770 --> 03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
30 days after creating an
account, 95% of those users

03:26.530 --> 03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
are still there using the
app, which is extremely high.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But there are more subtle
examples of product market fit,

03:34.210 --> 03:34.930 align:middle line:90%
too.

03:34.930 --> 03:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Organic growth.

03:36.470 --> 03:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So organic growth is
basically word of mouth.

03:39.340 --> 03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The idea that your business
can grow without paying for it.

03:42.940 --> 03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Your business grows
because people just

03:45.040 --> 03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
love talking about it.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the business
itself gets more valuable

03:49.060 --> 03:51.020 align:middle line:90%
the more people share it.

03:51.020 --> 03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start seeing
new sign-ups, new users,

03:56.350 --> 03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
new customers that
are just coming

03:58.780 --> 04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
via organic word of
mouth, you don't even

04:01.480 --> 04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
know where they come from,
they're just clearly coming

04:03.760 --> 04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
without a destination, they're
going directly to your website,

04:06.290 --> 04:08.082 align:middle line:84%
these are all really
good signs that you're

04:08.082 --> 04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
finding product market
fit because customers

04:10.630 --> 04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
care enough to share
whatever it is you're doing.

04:14.060 --> 04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And believe me,
that matters a lot.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, consider today how many
infinite distractions there

04:21.290 --> 04:21.790 align:middle line:90%
are.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.590 align:middle line:90%

Anyone who's willing to give you
a little bit of their attention

to build that community early

04:32.470 --> 04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
because they are going to
be such great evangelists.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's such
a clear indication

04:36.910 --> 04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're finding
product market fit when

04:39.130 --> 04:41.945 align:middle line:84%
you have these random
strangers on the internet who

04:41.945 --> 04:43.570 align:middle line:84%
are excited about
what you're building,

04:43.570 --> 04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
who are committed to
it, who are buying it,

04:45.370 --> 04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
who are telling their
friends, and that's special.

Understanding community,
especially your community,

04:57.720 --> 05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
has always been more
art than science,

05:00.460 --> 05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
but only recently are we
understanding the true value

05:03.240 --> 05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
of a community and being
able to really quantify

05:05.760 --> 05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
the impact that it has
on the bottom line--

05:08.160 --> 05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
on sales, on
retention, on growth.

05:11.710 --> 05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
These are all levers that can
directly connect to community

05:15.060 --> 05:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's a powerful thing.

05:18.010 --> 05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So I actually think
in a world now where

05:21.600 --> 05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
it's getting easier and easier
to get a V1 of the product

05:24.780 --> 05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
out there, building a community
first, finding community market

05:29.220 --> 05:33.030 align:middle line:84%
fit, is going to be one of the
hallmarks of an entrepreneur

05:33.030 --> 05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
over this next phase,
because that is now

05:35.850 --> 05:37.860 align:middle line:90%
actually the really hard part.

05:37.860 --> 05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Because building community
is not easily scalable.

05:42.180 --> 05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It requires community
building work.

05:44.130 --> 05:46.980 align:middle line:90%
It requires empathy and time.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.165 align:middle line:84%
It requires you to be kind of
a party host or a community

05:50.165 --> 05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
leader or however
you want to frame it.

05:51.790 --> 05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's not something
you can just automate away.

05:53.970 --> 05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The good news is it's never
been easier because there are so

05:58.230 --> 05:59.910 align:middle line:90%
many places to build community.

05:59.910 --> 06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people who
are primed now to participate.

06:03.910 --> 06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to
understand what they're saying,

06:06.780 --> 06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
what their problems are,
what their hopes are in order

06:10.230 --> 06:12.430 align:middle line:84%

what you're going to build

06:12.430 --> 06:13.597 align:middle line:90%

grab a notebook, however

than you think.
