00:07.290 --> 00:09.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the advantages
to being an entrepreneur

00:09.900 --> 00:16.930 align:middle line:84%
is you get to have a vision
that few other people have.

00:16.930 --> 00:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And you will spend years helping
other people see that vision.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That's getting investors.

00:22.810 --> 00:23.980 align:middle line:90%
That's recruiting people.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
That's scaling the
business, growing customers,

00:26.020 --> 00:27.620 align:middle line:90%
all those things.

00:27.620 --> 00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And along the way,
you're going to see--

00:31.300 --> 00:33.160 align:middle line:90%
or maybe not see--

00:33.160 --> 00:35.560 align:middle line:90%
adjustments to that trajectory.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.456 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have moments where

00:40.456 --> 00:43.330 align:middle line:90%
you know something is right.

00:43.330 --> 00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You know something
needs to happen.

00:46.030 --> 00:48.580 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it in your bones.

00:48.580 --> 00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you don't advocate
for it as well as you can.

00:51.850 --> 00:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe everyone else
in the boardroom

00:55.960 --> 00:58.820 align:middle line:90%
feels a very different way.

00:58.820 --> 01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're confronted
with those decisions,

01:01.310 --> 01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to do that--

01:03.500 --> 01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to do
that hard work on yourself

01:07.160 --> 01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
to figure out where are
you willing to compromise

01:10.790 --> 01:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and where are you willing
to just sort of relent

01:12.980 --> 01:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and where you're not.

01:14.810 --> 01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
one of the things

01:16.880 --> 01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I work on from day
one with founders

01:19.310 --> 01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is understanding those
values, understanding their

01:22.970 --> 01:26.240 align:middle line:84%
why so that when they
are in that boardroom

01:26.240 --> 01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and they are the only voice
arguing to do something

01:29.570 --> 01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that they know is
the right thing

01:31.530 --> 01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but everyone else in
the room is opposed,

01:34.230 --> 01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
they have the conviction,
they have the courage,

01:38.070 --> 01:45.252 align:middle line:84%
they have the words to
know that at some point,

01:45.252 --> 01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
you will come back to reflect
on your career and the things

01:47.710 --> 01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
that you've done, and there
is no greater gift to yourself

01:54.160 --> 01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
than to know that
when confronted

01:57.550 --> 02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
with those hard decisions, you
did what was right for you.

02:01.630 --> 02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
You did what was
right for your values.

02:04.150 --> 02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You did what was
right for you to be

02:08.630 --> 02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
able to tell your kid or someone
you care about that you did

02:15.140 --> 02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
the absolute best you could.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
The sooner you can get
comfortable with speaking

02:19.770 --> 02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
up and advocating
for those things

02:21.210 --> 02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that you believe in
that are to your vision,

02:23.160 --> 02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
the better off the
business is going to be.

02:25.530 --> 02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
One of Reddit's co-founders
is revealing how he plans

02:28.890 --> 02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to contribute in this
fight against racism.

02:31.290 --> 02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Alexis Ohanian is a father
of a two-year-old daughter

02:34.080 --> 02:34.860 align:middle line:90%
with his wife.

02:34.860 --> 02:36.120 align:middle line:90%
That's Serena Williams.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
He resigned from Reddit's
board of directors on Friday,

02:39.270 --> 02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and he urged the
board to replace him

02:41.130 --> 02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
with a Black candidate.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
He also promised to donate
future gains on his Reddit

02:45.450 --> 02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
stock to initiatives that
support the Black community.

02:48.910 --> 02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I ultimately resigned
from the board of Reddit

02:51.880 --> 02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
have a very clear story

02:58.030 --> 03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to tell my daughter
when she asked me why,

03:03.470 --> 03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and why maybe I
hadn't done it sooner,

03:08.060 --> 03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and why communities
existed on that platform

03:12.140 --> 03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that were hateful, and
why I hadn't done enough

03:19.610 --> 03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
or done anything
sooner to that point.

03:21.890 --> 03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be able to
say, at least, upon reflecting

03:27.190 --> 03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
on my decision to ultimately
step down, that I had used

03:32.120 --> 03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
the power and
privilege that I had

03:33.920 --> 03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and used it to hopefully
start some dialogues,

03:37.940 --> 03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
hopefully start
creating some change,

03:41.090 --> 03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
to both symbolically take myself
out of a position of privilege

03:46.880 --> 03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and a company that I had created
to be replaced by someone who

03:54.500 --> 03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
could perhaps better advocate
for positions that I wasn't

03:58.520 --> 04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
successful in advocating
for, to ultimately

04:02.390 --> 04:07.070 align:middle line:84%
shine a spotlight on thousands
of communities that Redditors

04:07.070 --> 04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
themselves as well as myself
wanted to see removed,

04:11.240 --> 04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
wake of George Floyd,

04:13.010 --> 04:14.660 align:middle line:90%
because they were hateful.

04:14.660 --> 04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't you have,
if you'd wanted

04:16.250 --> 04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
to, just said we're going to
add a Black person to the board?

04:20.089 --> 04:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Did you have to step down?

04:22.170 --> 04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I think there is something
symbolic about someone

04:26.240 --> 04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
in my position
stepping aside as a way

04:29.510 --> 04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
to say, we're not just
going to make sure that you

04:34.010 --> 04:35.150 align:middle line:90%
have a seat at the table.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give up my seat
so that you can have it.

04:38.030 --> 04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I hope it makes boardrooms
all across the country

04:41.030 --> 04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
look around the table and
say, who are we serving?

04:44.030 --> 04:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Who is our community?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
A month after I resigned,
thousands of hate communities

04:48.980 --> 04:50.240 align:middle line:90%
were banned.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I was relieved, frankly.

04:52.670 --> 04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I was happy to see
the position filled

04:55.160 --> 04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
by a Black candidate,
Michael Seibel, who

04:57.980 --> 05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is a great guy who I've happened
to know for a long time.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
I realized, OK, here

05:06.470 --> 05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
is a chance for me to
really clearly get right

05:10.760 --> 05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
with myself and those
future hard questions

05:14.900 --> 05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
from my daughter
about what I did

05:20.250 --> 05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and all the things I didn't
do and didn't fight for well

05:23.030 --> 05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
enough and wasn't able
to successfully stop

05:25.790 --> 05:28.320 align:middle line:90%
until I resigned.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
be sure that everything

05:31.170 --> 05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I did going forward could
be fully in lockstep

05:37.410 --> 05:38.460 align:middle line:90%
with my values.

05:38.460 --> 05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had come
to a point in my career

05:41.160 --> 05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
where I should be able
to offer these things.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And if I get myself
in a situation

05:46.230 --> 05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
where I can't, I need to
know it's time for me to go.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.610 align:middle line:90%

05:54.610 --> 05:58.080 align:middle line:90%


05:58.080 --> 06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
The reason my venture
firm is called 776

06:00.680 --> 06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
is because 776 BCE was the year
of the first Olympic Games, so

06:06.050 --> 06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
ancient Greece.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They had the greatest athletes
from all over the world there.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's a story--
it's a true story--

06:13.780 --> 06:15.710 align:middle line:90%
of the very first event.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.500 align:middle line:90%
There was a chef.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
He gets off his shift
somewhere near Olympia, Greece.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
He shows up at the
Olympics and competes

06:25.240 --> 06:26.548 align:middle line:90%
in the first-ever event.

06:26.548 --> 06:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It was a foot race.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.510 align:middle line:90%
And he wins.

06:28.510 --> 06:29.620 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

06:29.620 --> 06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the exact thing that
legends are made from in sport.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is a great
story, but he was only

06:38.110 --> 06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
competing against the
athletes, the Greeks invited.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.070 align:middle line:90%
And those were only Greeks.

06:45.070 --> 06:47.050 align:middle line:84%
They were only people
from the known world.

06:47.050 --> 06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And worse, women
were not even allowed

06:49.780 --> 06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
to watch the Olympics back then,
let alone participate in them.

06:53.030 --> 06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So here at the start,
at the seminal moment

06:55.960 --> 07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
of what is arguably the most
equitable thing on the planet,

07:00.280 --> 07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
the Olympics, the
Olympic Games, you

07:02.980 --> 07:06.520 align:middle line:84%
had this original
sin of ignorance.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about
my own career in tech

07:10.370 --> 07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and I think about
the success I've

07:12.220 --> 07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
had, when I think
about the best founders

07:14.650 --> 07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that I've invested in,
celebrating all of that kind of

07:18.610 --> 07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
feels like
celebrating that chef.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Because as great as his
story is of just showing up

07:24.550 --> 07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
at the Olympics and winning
the first-ever race,

07:28.170 --> 07:30.060 align:middle line:90%
he still wasn't the greatest.

07:30.060 --> 07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
He was just the greatest
who got the invite who

07:32.070 --> 07:33.870 align:middle line:90%
was there on the starting line.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And if I think about
my purpose and where

07:36.990 --> 07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to be spending my time
for the rest of my years,

07:40.320 --> 07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
it's doing the work to not just
invest in the greatest founders

07:45.540 --> 07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
but to really do
the work to find

07:48.240 --> 07:50.783 align:middle line:84%
and be aware of my own
blind spots in doing that

07:50.783 --> 07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and build an
organization that can

07:52.200 --> 07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
be as resourceful as
possible to find greatness

07:55.650 --> 07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
wherever it is so
that we're not still

07:57.600 --> 08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
celebrating the same Greek
cook at the end of the day.

08:01.270 --> 08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're watching
this and wondering,

08:03.540 --> 08:07.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, Alexis, how do I get
you to invest in my startup,

08:07.300 --> 08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, everything I've
just told you is the framework.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
that we look for.

08:12.610 --> 08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We especially love investing
at the early stage.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're very
comfortable in taking

08:16.930 --> 08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
a pitch that's as simple
as a rough prototype

08:19.690 --> 08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
or even a really
well-formed memo or deck.

08:22.450 --> 08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
We're capable of investing when
it's just you as a solo founder

08:26.680 --> 08:27.925 align:middle line:90%
with an idea.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's really it.

08:30.070 --> 08:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Have a great idea.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Start building it.

08:33.330 --> 08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Build your community.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Build your minimum viable
product, get it started,

08:38.190 --> 08:40.314 align:middle line:90%
and then come pitch me.

08:40.314 --> 08:43.176 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

08:43.176 --> 08:49.870 align:middle line:90%


08:49.870 --> 08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hello there.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.944 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see you.

08:53.944 --> 08:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Are we good?

08:55.290 --> 08:56.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

08:56.830 --> 08:57.330 align:middle line:90%
All right.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So the folks at
MasterClass asked me

08:59.220 --> 09:01.320 align:middle line:90%
to create a logo for my class.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.180 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

09:04.180 --> 09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
If you've learned anything
during this class,

09:06.580 --> 09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
it is not really about
taming the internet

09:09.580 --> 09:11.020 align:middle line:90%
or controlling the internet.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.825 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] As a founder,
you want to control.

09:14.825 --> 09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But when confronted with the
reality of actually bringing

09:17.200 --> 09:19.617 align:middle line:84%
your idea to the market, you
realize you can't control it.

09:19.617 --> 09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And so as I'm thinking of
what a logo or a mascot

09:22.540 --> 09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
or whatever for this
would look like,

09:24.670 --> 09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of that
famous Japanese artist--

09:29.770 --> 09:31.240 align:middle line:90%
what was his name--

09:31.240 --> 09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Hokusai, obviously-- who has
that fantastic tsunami wave

09:36.280 --> 09:37.450 align:middle line:90%
woodblock art.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I got my happy
little waves here,

09:39.400 --> 09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
maybe a couple of happy little
bubbles because it's a strong--

09:42.160 --> 09:43.390 align:middle line:90%
it's not a tsunami.

09:43.390 --> 09:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just a big wave.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people love using--
and I use it too-- the rocket

09:47.620 --> 09:49.810 align:middle line:90%
ship metaphor for startups.

09:49.810 --> 09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I actually think it should
be more like a surfboard.

09:52.990 --> 09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
because you aren't actually

09:58.480 --> 09:59.740 align:middle line:90%
in control of anything.

09:59.740 --> 10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And as much as a founder wants
to be the one dictating where

10:05.620 --> 10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
a company goes, what
it does, you're not.

10:08.550 --> 10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
You're at the mercy
of the market.

10:10.930 --> 10:12.397 align:middle line:84%
You're at the mercy
of the timing.

10:12.397 --> 10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You're at the mercy of
so many other things.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And the sooner that
you realize that you

10:16.510 --> 10:20.260 align:middle line:84%
need to focus on the things
that are within your control

10:20.260 --> 10:23.287 align:middle line:84%
and solve those problems and
ignore the things that aren't

10:23.287 --> 10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
in your control, or at
least learn from them

10:25.120 --> 10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and then don't try to change
them, the better off you'll be.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Build that surfboard as you go.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Track the very
best people you can

10:32.380 --> 10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to get on that
surfboard with you.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.040 align:middle line:90%
And good luck.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We need more people out there
willing to jump on that wave

10:38.830 --> 10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and create something a
little better for all of us.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.402 align:middle line:90%
Surfing!

10:46.402 --> 10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

10:49.270 --> 10:51.000 align:middle line:90%
