00:07.140 --> 00:09.750 align:middle line:84%
 For almost two decades,
I've been telling people

00:09.750 --> 00:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that online communities are just
as real as offline communities.

00:13.860 --> 00:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So many of us are making
relationships, sometimes

00:16.590 --> 00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
with total strangers, online
in communities where they're

00:20.370 --> 00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
falling in love,
sharing stock picks,

00:23.340 --> 00:25.440 align:middle line:90%
building businesses together.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.570 align:middle line:90%
That is the new normal.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And what the
internet has enabled

00:29.820 --> 00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
is disparate people
all over the world

00:32.189 --> 00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
to come together
in communities that

00:34.320 --> 00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
cross all kinds of
geographies and sort

00:36.630 --> 00:38.350 align:middle line:90%
of traditional boundaries.

00:38.350 --> 00:39.655 align:middle line:90%
And this is an exciting thing.

00:39.655 --> 00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're a creator, if you're
an entrepreneur, if you're

00:42.030 --> 00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
someone who has an idea, you
are more likely than ever

00:45.840 --> 00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to find a community that
actually already has

00:48.810 --> 00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
this same problem or this same
ambition or this same desire.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And only in the
modern era, thanks

00:55.170 --> 00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
to the advent of online
communities at scale,

00:58.630 --> 01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
can we actually see the
power of that and track that.

01:01.470 --> 01:07.010 align:middle line:90%


01:07.010 --> 01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think eight years ago,
I was one of the first checks

01:10.270 --> 01:11.320 align:middle line:90%
into Patreon.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, Kickstarter
was a pretty good way

01:15.990 --> 01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
to raise money for a project.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But what creators wanted
was recurring revenue.

01:21.810 --> 01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I loved about this
idea was friends of mine who

01:26.370 --> 01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
were creators, who just wanted
to know that their rent would

01:29.520 --> 01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
get paid every
month, didn't have

01:31.620 --> 01:33.270 align:middle line:90%
a recurring source of revenue.

01:33.270 --> 01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But like a good history
major, I realized, okay,

01:36.090 --> 01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
the Medicis solved this
problem during the Renaissance.

01:38.670 --> 01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
They were just a
ludicrously wealthy family

01:42.420 --> 01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that could make sure
to pay Michelangelo's

01:44.250 --> 01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
bills for a few years
while he painted a ceiling.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.780 align:middle line:90%
This can work on the internet.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need one
really wealthy family.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You could have millions of
regular folks, all chipping

01:54.000 --> 01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
in a dollar a month,
a few dollars a month,

01:56.370 --> 01:58.050 align:middle line:90%
to this creator.

01:58.050 --> 02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, Patreon
kicked off this creator economy.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And for almost the last
decade now, it has thrived.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it means a new
generation of entrepreneurs

02:08.520 --> 02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
will be able to make a living
on their terms, creating.

02:12.990 --> 02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that you can
have someone in Oklahoma who

02:15.330 --> 02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
does a cappella renditions
of video game theme songs

02:19.890 --> 02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
who can make a living without
ever having to go to LA,

02:23.010 --> 02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
without ever having to get
an agent, without ever having

02:25.560 --> 02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
to sign a deal, just making
content that they genuinely

02:29.730 --> 02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
love for an audience that
genuinely loves the content.

02:33.300 --> 02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's a perfect example of
how entrepreneurship is not

02:37.110 --> 02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
just I think what a lot of us
thought 30 years ago, which

02:40.260 --> 02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
was, oh, that's
starting a company.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's, oh, I
want to be a creator.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The starving artist cliche
exists, because usually when

02:48.870 --> 02:51.312 align:middle line:84%
people heard that you were
into the arts or creative,

02:51.312 --> 02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
they just sort of feel bad
for you and be like, gosh,

02:53.520 --> 02:55.410 align:middle line:90%
I hope that works out.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Now we're seeing a new path.

02:57.600 --> 03:01.863 align:middle line:84%
And it's one more example of
just how broad the definition

03:01.863 --> 03:03.030 align:middle line:90%
for entrepreneur has gotten.

03:03.030 --> 03:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great thing.

03:04.200 --> 03:11.180 align:middle line:90%


03:11.180 --> 03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I made some headlines
for wearing a CryptoPunk

03:14.420 --> 03:17.392 align:middle line:90%
to the Met Gala.

03:17.392 --> 03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very particular
one that I bought for my wife,

03:19.850 --> 03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
because I saw it, and
I was like, oh, this

03:21.560 --> 03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
looks just like my wife.

03:22.350 --> 03:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to buy it for her.

03:23.090 --> 03:24.620 align:middle line:90%
She'd really like this gift.

03:24.620 --> 03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The CryptoPunk was really
one of the original use

03:27.320 --> 03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
cases of art in this
new medium called

03:30.020 --> 03:32.390 align:middle line:90%
NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens.

03:32.390 --> 03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
EXPERT: Digital collectibles
or digital creations

03:34.670 --> 03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
that, if you want to
claim ownership of it,

03:36.710 --> 03:38.810 align:middle line:90%
you need to its digital record.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
 A formidable opportunity
for these artists

03:41.300 --> 03:43.100 align:middle line:90%
to commercialize their work.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
They're able to attach smart
contracts to their work, which

03:45.830 --> 03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
govern the ways in which the
works are sold and resold.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Now some
people are baffled by this.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.240 align:middle line:84%
They recoil against
the whole concept

03:53.240 --> 03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that there is a real
art market online now.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But that just begs the question,
what is culture anyway?

04:00.380 --> 04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
If I asked you what one of
the most important paintings

04:03.560 --> 04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Western world was, you
might say, the "Mona Lisa."

04:07.430 --> 04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people from all
over the world go to the Louver,

04:11.420 --> 04:15.170 align:middle line:84%
wait in line, spend a ton
of money and a ton of time

04:15.170 --> 04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to go look at a painting.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean no disrespect
to da Vinci.

04:18.200 --> 04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not his best work, but
it's certainly his most famous.

04:22.270 --> 04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, no one cared
about the "Mona Lisa"

04:26.490 --> 04:28.918 align:middle line:90%
until it became a meme.

04:28.918 --> 04:29.460 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.020 align:middle line:90%
You can look this up.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
That painting was in
the Louver for hundreds

04:33.360 --> 04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of years and no
one cared, until,

04:36.690 --> 04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in the early 20th
century, it got stolen.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And a bunch of Parisians
were all sitting around

04:40.890 --> 04:42.600 align:middle line:90%
their cafes going, oh no.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.920 align:middle line:90%
The "Mona Lisa" was stolen.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Wait, what happened?

04:45.330 --> 04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have Twitter, but
it was a sensation around Paris.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the "Mona
Lisa," it got stolen.

04:50.610 --> 04:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of it.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.800 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing painting.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.670 align:middle line:90%
It was stolen.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.860 align:middle line:90%
They found it-- spoiler.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
They brought it back to the
Louver and a meme was created.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
now everyone had

05:00.690 --> 05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to see this painting
that was stolen.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here we
are, 100 years later,

05:05.340 --> 05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and every one of
us, including you,

05:07.890 --> 05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
are convinced this
has always been

05:09.690 --> 05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important paintings

05:11.520 --> 05:13.150 align:middle line:90%
of Western civilization.

05:13.150 --> 05:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But no one cared until
it became a meme.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we consider just for
a moment that most of what

05:19.590 --> 05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
we know as culture has,
for hundreds of years,

05:22.710 --> 05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
been dictated from
institutions that have decided

05:25.800 --> 05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
this is important, because
they put it in a museum

05:29.280 --> 05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
or they put it in a textbook,
culture, it turns out,

05:32.470 --> 05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
has never actually
come from the top down.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That's an artificial construct.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
It's always come
from the bottom up.

05:37.710 --> 05:41.440 align:middle line:84%
When it was a cave painting
on a wall, it was bottom up.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And so with the rise of
NFTs, right now, today, we're

05:46.980 --> 05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
seeing an advent
of a new medium.

05:48.750 --> 05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
The NFT is no different
from oil on canvas.

05:52.140 --> 05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The technology itself
is novel and special.

05:55.710 --> 05:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But what makes it
really unique is

05:58.380 --> 06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that it captures the
attention of a community.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It creates culture
from the bottom up.

06:03.210 --> 06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
excites an entire generation

06:08.440 --> 06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
of creatives who now
get to understand

06:11.110 --> 06:14.530 align:middle line:84%
a value for their work that the
digital world had previously

06:14.530 --> 06:15.670 align:middle line:90%
ignored.

06:15.670 --> 06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if you created
something in the digital age,

06:18.700 --> 06:22.670 align:middle line:84%
it was instantly shareable
all over the world.

06:22.670 --> 06:24.508 align:middle line:84%
And so how could you
get value for it?

06:24.508 --> 06:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a commodity.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a JPEG that millions
of people could see.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And you never got any
attribution or any revenue.

06:29.830 --> 06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And what's wild is
that that dynamic,

06:32.980 --> 06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the blockchain,
has changed forever.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, to the
folks who are like,

06:40.500 --> 06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
well, I can just right click
and save as on your JPEG

06:44.520 --> 06:45.450 align:middle line:90%
and now I own it.

06:45.450 --> 06:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha--

06:46.830 --> 06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I will say, well, friend,
think of how many times

06:51.230 --> 06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that "Mona Lisa" has been copied
and reproduced on t-shirts,

06:55.430 --> 06:57.740 align:middle line:90%
on wallpapers, on wherever.

06:57.740 --> 07:02.385 align:middle line:84%
Has that made the "Mona Lisa"
less valuable or more valuable?

07:02.385 --> 07:05.180 align:middle line:90%


07:05.180 --> 07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this new technology now
brings all of the best parts

07:09.070 --> 07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
of the digital world--
which are infinite scale,

07:11.180 --> 07:12.640 align:middle line:90%
zero reproduction cost--

07:12.640 --> 07:14.398 align:middle line:84%
with all of the
benefits that came

07:14.398 --> 07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
from the physical world, when
you could actually prove,

07:16.690 --> 07:18.700 align:middle line:90%
this is the one original.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And now all these
millions of copies

07:20.830 --> 07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
actually make this one
original way more valuable.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the
earliest days of this.

07:25.510 --> 07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
We are still in the weird
and messy and bizarre stage

07:29.290 --> 07:30.640 align:middle line:90%
of this new medium.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.850 align:middle line:90%
But the dollars are real.

07:33.850 --> 07:37.630 align:middle line:84%
The creators that are building
and innovating on this

07:37.630 --> 07:38.770 align:middle line:90%
are very real.

07:38.770 --> 07:40.632 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
even wait to see

07:40.632 --> 07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
what happens over the
next 5 to 10 years,

07:42.340 --> 07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
because it epitomizes
why community

07:45.710 --> 07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
matters, because you're
able to get thousands,

07:49.490 --> 07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands of people,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
all in their digital
Parisian cafes,

07:54.770 --> 07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
excited about and talking
about some special piece of art

07:59.360 --> 08:00.950 align:middle line:90%
that's captured their attention.

08:00.950 --> 08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And now everyone participating
can actually monetize,

08:05.390 --> 08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
can actually get the value
out of that attention,

08:07.940 --> 08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
which has never been
possible on the internet.

08:11.430 --> 08:12.450 align:middle line:90%
So I dare you.

08:12.450 --> 08:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Go rethink the boundaries
around what you think is real.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Expand your horizon, and
the number of opportunities

08:18.960 --> 08:21.860 align:middle line:90%
will increase exponentially.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
