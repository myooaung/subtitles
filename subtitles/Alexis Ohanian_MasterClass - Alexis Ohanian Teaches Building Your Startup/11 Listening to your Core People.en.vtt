 As an entrepreneur, the
people in your circle are vital.

00:14.684 --> 00:16.309 align:middle line:84%
The people you spend
the most time with

00:16.309 --> 00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
are naturally going to have an
impact on everything you do,

00:20.150 --> 00:21.860 align:middle line:90%
professionally and personally.

00:21.860 --> 00:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
greatest assets I got

00:24.920 --> 00:29.270 align:middle line:84%
was having a pair of parents
who both showed me a way

00:29.270 --> 00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
to do entrepreneurship,
with my dad, who weathered

00:33.090 --> 00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
some pretty tumultuous times
as a small business owner,

00:36.610 --> 00:38.460 align:middle line:90%
especially at a travel agency.

00:38.460 --> 00:43.418 align:middle line:84%
And from my mom I got an
unflappable conviction.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I still remember
the day I told her

00:45.210 --> 00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that I was not
going to law school

00:47.610 --> 00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and instead I was going to
start a startup and I needed--

00:50.820 --> 00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I needed an idea, I
needed a co-founder.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was
that I was starting

00:55.770 --> 00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
a business and her
immediate reaction was, that

00:59.550 --> 01:00.690 align:middle line:90%
sounds great.

01:00.690 --> 01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you have in mind?

01:03.840 --> 01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
That gave me the conviction
and the self-assuredness

01:06.570 --> 01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to know that even if
it was a total failure,

01:09.870 --> 01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
they would still love me,
they would still support me,

01:12.120 --> 01:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and things would be fine.

01:13.350 --> 01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I feel so grateful
for the fact that I

01:16.050 --> 01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
had folks in my life like
my mom and my dad who

01:20.340 --> 01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
gave that bit of foundation
that I see has played out

01:24.150 --> 01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and is responsible for
everything I've accomplished.

01:26.910 --> 01:30.295 align:middle line:84%
And I realize how lucky I
am to have that foundation.

01:30.295 --> 01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And I realize a lot of people--
maybe you watching this--

01:32.670 --> 01:33.300 align:middle line:90%
don't.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for the fact
that the conversations

01:36.570 --> 01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
around everything from
mental health to career

01:41.100 --> 01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
development to just
physical wellness

01:44.100 --> 01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
are becoming more
and more common

01:45.780 --> 01:48.285 align:middle line:84%
in business, because
the more people

01:48.285 --> 01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
are able to talk about
it, the sooner they're

01:50.160 --> 01:54.220 align:middle line:84%
able to do the work, and every
one of us has work to do,

01:54.220 --> 01:55.930 align:middle line:90%
myself included.

01:55.930 --> 01:58.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have access
to those resources,

01:58.120 --> 01:59.530 align:middle line:90%
take full advantage of them.

01:59.530 --> 02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, it's one more
challenge for you to overcome,

02:03.280 --> 02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
one more thing that you
can absolutely get through.

02:06.490 --> 02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
But know that the
work that you're

02:09.449 --> 02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
doing on your business,
the work that you're

02:13.680 --> 02:16.590 align:middle line:84%
doing to build these networks
and make an effort to surround

02:16.590 --> 02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
yourself with people who are
additive to your life, right,

02:20.400 --> 02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
will have a huge impact
on your outcomes,

02:23.580 --> 02:25.065 align:middle line:84%
both professionally
and personally.

02:31.830 --> 02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I get asked a lot
to be a mentor.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell
founders is, I am not

02:37.530 --> 02:39.100 align:middle line:90%
the right mentor for you.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
I don't believe

02:42.600 --> 02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
the person you need right now is
someone who's five years or 10

02:46.260 --> 02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
years ahead of you.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.070 align:middle line:90%
That's helpful, for sure.

02:50.070 --> 02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's someone who's like one
or two years ahead of you.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.720 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just CEOs, right?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
This could be a
head of marketing

02:56.250 --> 03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
who wants to develop her
skills and be ready for a role

03:00.240 --> 03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that they aspire to
by connecting them

03:02.610 --> 03:06.750 align:middle line:84%
with a CMO who's a few
years ahead in their career.

03:06.750 --> 03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And that pairing is actually
where I see tremendous value.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the advice
that I could give you,

03:13.140 --> 03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
if I'm five, 10, 15 years
ahead of where you are,

03:16.590 --> 03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
is only so relevant.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
There are things-- believe
me, don't go turning off

03:21.020 --> 03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
this MasterClass-- there are
plenty of things I can tell you

03:23.520 --> 03:24.903 align:middle line:90%
that are relevant and valuable.

03:24.903 --> 03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you're getting
down to the nitty gritty

03:26.820 --> 03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and the tactics and you're a
CEO at a stage in your business

03:29.790 --> 03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
where you're just breaking
into heavy growth,

03:32.310 --> 03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
you're experiencing
real-time problems

03:35.130 --> 03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that only someone who is
basically at the same stage

03:39.990 --> 03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
with can truly empathize
with and truly give you

03:42.720 --> 03:45.420 align:middle line:84%

they've just gone through it

current market,

03:47.310 --> 03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
in this current environment
where things change so rapidly.

03:51.550 --> 03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And so having a team
around you to keep

03:55.050 --> 03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
you honest in that
regard is so valuable.

03:57.030 --> 03:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it can
come from investors,

03:59.820 --> 04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
it can come from advisor who
are further in their career

04:03.360 --> 04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
than you are, but we
really love seeing folks,

04:06.720 --> 04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go out of our way
to pair up folks, with peers

04:09.450 --> 04:10.950 align:middle line:90%
and folks just a step ahead.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And just generally
speaking, I advise

04:13.860 --> 04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
folks, whether they're
founders or my sisters,

04:16.980 --> 04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to surround themselves
with people who

04:19.140 --> 04:20.594 align:middle line:90%
challenge them to be better.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Founding a company
with someone really

04:29.090 --> 04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
is at that level of
intimacy and responsibility

04:32.330 --> 04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a decision
to make lightly.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
When you make that
decision, you've

04:38.000 --> 04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
got to treat it basically
like a marriage.

04:41.030 --> 04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I know there's lots
of founders who--

04:44.540 --> 04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
they come together because
they were friends in college

04:47.120 --> 04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and they think, okay,
we get on pretty well,

04:52.370 --> 04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
we've known each other
for a little while,

04:54.120 --> 04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
we should start a
company together.

04:55.740 --> 04:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And that alone is--

04:58.560 --> 04:59.640 align:middle line:90%
okay, that's necessary.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
You should get along well,
but that's not sufficient.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions
I'll ask as an investor

05:06.600 --> 05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
is about specifically what
types of work or projects

05:09.750 --> 05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
have you done together.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
What have you done that
demonstrates your ability, not

05:14.910 --> 05:17.910 align:middle line:84%
just to like hang out
a fraternity together,

05:17.910 --> 05:19.662 align:middle line:84%
but actually build
something together?

05:19.662 --> 05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
What are some
examples where you've

05:21.120 --> 05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
had conflict and able
to reach a conclusion

05:23.760 --> 05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and were you both okay
with that conclusion?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get to
a good answer with that

05:29.760 --> 05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and have everyone
be excited by it,

05:31.860 --> 05:34.030 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a bad time.

05:34.030 --> 05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So, when choosing
a business partner,

05:37.260 --> 05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
certainly look for people who
fill in gaps that you have.

05:41.730 --> 05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Someone who complements
your skill set

05:43.830 --> 05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
is a great asset to look
for in a business partner.

05:49.020 --> 05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Also as important is someone
who shares your values.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen founders in
situations where the skill

05:55.770 --> 06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
set is perfectly complementary--
one sophisticated, savvy, sort

06:00.780 --> 06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
of business leader, One
sophisticated tech leader.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And, ostensibly, it's great.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.520 align:middle line:90%
This is peas and carrots, right?

06:08.520 --> 06:10.290 align:middle line:90%
They complement each other well.

06:10.290 --> 06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But if their values don't align,
it will eventually come apart.

06:14.940 --> 06:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Because one year in, five years
in, 10 years in, 20 years in,

06:20.640 --> 06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
you're making decisions
about the business

06:23.400 --> 06:26.100 align:middle line:90%
that are much more holistic.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about a kind of vision
for what the opportunities are,

06:30.480 --> 06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
what the risks are, and if there
isn't alignment on the values,

06:35.940 --> 06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
founders are going to
make different decisions

06:38.130 --> 06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and eventually you're going
to see that divergence.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the sooner
founders can sync up

06:43.620 --> 06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
about what their values are and
what their personal lives are

06:46.320 --> 06:48.695 align:middle line:84%
and what they feel are their
responsibilities as business

06:48.695 --> 06:51.835 align:middle line:84%
leaders, the better, because
having that kind of alignment

06:51.835 --> 06:53.835 align:middle line:84%
is what makes long-term
partnerships successful.

06:53.835 --> 06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

06:58.830 --> 07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a co-founder,
it's still very worth

07:02.370 --> 07:05.425 align:middle line:90%
having comrades, so to speak.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.753 align:middle line:84%
I know we talked earlier about
having peers and folks who

07:08.753 --> 07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
are sort of at
your level or where

07:10.170 --> 07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
you want to be in another
couple of years in your group.

07:12.540 --> 07:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Same concept.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Solo founders can
get the benefit

07:15.600 --> 07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
of the emotional
support of a co-founder

07:17.970 --> 07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
without actually
having a co-founder.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So do the work,
draft up what looks

07:22.830 --> 07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
like a personal board of
advisors, and choose people--

07:28.710 --> 07:30.270 align:middle line:90%
three, four, five of them--

07:30.270 --> 07:32.370 align:middle line:84%
who you know will
always be there

07:32.370 --> 07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
as a source of
unvarnished truth,

07:34.950 --> 07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
who's looking out for
your best interests,

07:37.150 --> 07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and who makes you want
to be a better person.
