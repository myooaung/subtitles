00:03.332 --> 00:07.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07.140 --> 00:09.390 align:middle line:84%
 I always used to tell
founders to not care

00:09.390 --> 00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
about press because that
itself was not a goal.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's still true,
but what has changed

00:16.530 --> 00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
is that as media becomes more
broad and a more accurate

00:20.670 --> 00:24.180 align:middle line:84%
reflection of just
internet sentiment or sort

00:24.180 --> 00:29.035 align:middle line:84%
of community sentiment, it
actually gets more valuable.

00:29.035 --> 00:29.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to be careful.

00:29.910 --> 00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's still more important
to build a great business,

00:32.640 --> 00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
but the value of
having the zeitgeist

00:36.180 --> 00:40.020 align:middle line:84%
aware of and excited by what
you're doing is increasing.

00:40.020 --> 00:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:46.620 --> 00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not telling you
to spend all of your time

00:49.290 --> 00:53.960 align:middle line:84%
on social media, but I'm
kind of telling you that.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the skills
that will serve you

00:56.990 --> 01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
well is understanding
these trends and patterns

01:02.570 --> 01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
the zeitgeist, the spirit
of the times online,

01:05.720 --> 01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
especially in your
industry because that's

01:08.720 --> 01:11.832 align:middle line:84%
going to help you anticipate
the kind of messaging you're

01:11.832 --> 01:13.040 align:middle line:90%
going to do for your product.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.207 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help you
understand how to communicate

01:15.207 --> 01:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to potential hires.

01:16.190 --> 01:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help you
identify opportunities

01:19.340 --> 01:24.488 align:middle line:84%
to post a really funny meme
that will go viral that millions

01:24.488 --> 01:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of people will see.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.488 align:middle line:84%
That'll get them excited
about whatever you're doing.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
This new generation of CEOs,
the ones who are just getting

01:30.530 --> 01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
started now, they
have to live in this.

01:33.740 --> 01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so a decade ago I was
telling founders, hey,

01:37.520 --> 01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, be aware of
a story in the media,

01:40.700 --> 01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and use that as a peg that you
can tie your story to, right?

01:44.330 --> 01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
If there's a ton of people
talking about return to work

01:47.600 --> 01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and the future of the office
and whatnot sort of thing

01:50.360 --> 01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that's going on right
now because of COVID,

01:52.700 --> 01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
if your startup fits into that
narrative in some way, shape,

01:55.500 --> 01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
or form, that's a
story peg you can

01:57.320 --> 01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
use to get someone more
interested in whatever you're

01:59.750 --> 02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
doing because they'll see the
relevance and the connection.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.600 align:middle line:84%
The same thing, though, happens
on the internet every day

02:05.600 --> 02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in a cycle that
moves so much faster.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this could
literally be a meme that

02:10.610 --> 02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
is tweeted and then goes viral
and is forgotten four hours

02:14.360 --> 02:15.210 align:middle line:90%
later.

02:15.210 --> 02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you can identify
it, use that as the peg.

02:19.130 --> 02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
See that as a way to tell your
own story in addition to it

02:23.360 --> 02:25.490 align:middle line:90%
or maybe remixing it.

02:25.490 --> 02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
That's how you ride that wave.

02:27.350 --> 02:35.800 align:middle line:90%


02:35.800 --> 02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2009, I was
asked to give a TED

02:38.290 --> 02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the power
of the internet

02:40.250 --> 02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and, in particular,
social media,

02:42.890 --> 02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and so I used this
story about Greenpeace.

02:46.780 --> 02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
They were really concerned
about the humpback whales

02:50.230 --> 02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to do something
to raise awareness

02:53.080 --> 02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
for the whaling expeditions
that were happening in Japan.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
So they created an online poll.

02:59.290 --> 03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of these names were
really erudite and thoughtful,

03:04.030 --> 03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and then there was
Mr. Splashy Pants.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, they put that
name up just as a joke.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
They weren't expecting
anyone to vote on it.

03:11.770 --> 03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
internet, and as soon

03:15.460 --> 03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
as Reddit found out about
that whale, they got excited.

03:21.630 --> 03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
We even changed the logo.

03:23.070 --> 03:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I doodled a version of Splashy--

03:27.150 --> 03:27.900 align:middle line:90%
to his friends.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Pants to you--

03:30.210 --> 03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and then really
got people fired up

03:32.790 --> 03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
because Greenpeace saw
the initial poll numbers,

03:36.480 --> 03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and they thought
there was a problem.

03:40.580 --> 03:43.428 align:middle line:84%
They actually threw
them out because they

03:43.428 --> 03:44.720 align:middle line:90%
weren't happy with the results.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.700 align:middle line:90%
73% for Mr. Splashy Pants?

03:46.700 --> 03:47.690 align:middle line:90%
This can't be.

03:47.690 --> 03:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So they reset the poll, and
sure enough, Mr. Splashy Pants

03:51.860 --> 03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
won again.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a great victory
for that whale.

03:55.430 --> 03:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
next was surprising.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Because Greenpeace
had tried, you know,

04:02.460 --> 04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
to undo this first
attempt, it only

04:05.310 --> 04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
galvanized the online
community even more

04:08.190 --> 04:10.920 align:middle line:90%
to rally behind Splashy.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
hundreds of thousands,

04:14.040 --> 04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
and soon, millions
of people were

04:16.019 --> 04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
learning about this whale,
and the naming events,

04:19.200 --> 04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately, the
plight of these humpback

04:21.630 --> 04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
whales that it actually
forced the Japanese government

04:24.720 --> 04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
to halt their
whaling expeditions,

04:27.540 --> 04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and all because Greenpeace
tried to stop this silly whale

04:33.370 --> 04:35.723 align:middle line:90%
and its name from flourishing.

04:35.723 --> 04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they learned
from that and what

04:37.390 --> 04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I hoped everyone in
the crowd would realize

04:40.060 --> 04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
was that we've only
had perceived control

04:43.360 --> 04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
over the narrative.

04:44.830 --> 04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
The reality is on social
media no one has control.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The gatekeepers
are not in control.

04:51.740 --> 04:56.170 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to decide to
vote, to share the things

04:56.170 --> 04:57.650 align:middle line:90%
that we care most about.

04:57.650 --> 05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And the sooner you can
lean into that, the better.

05:01.090 --> 05:08.300 align:middle line:90%


05:08.300 --> 05:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Incumbent press-- you know,
"Wall Street Journal,"

05:11.540 --> 05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
"New York Times,"
business television--

05:14.270 --> 05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
still is important but
with very specific goals.

05:20.150 --> 05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I always tell founders to
work backwards from their goal

05:23.480 --> 05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
when doing press or
any kind of outreach.

05:25.940 --> 05:29.103 align:middle line:84%
If your goal is to
drive more customers,

05:29.103 --> 05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
that determines where
you're going to go

05:30.770 --> 05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and where you're going
to spend your time.

05:32.520 --> 05:36.350 align:middle line:84%
If your goal is to help open up
the door to new hires, right,

05:36.350 --> 05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
it's going to affect
where you choose to go.

05:38.870 --> 05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And these legacy institutions
still have a great brand value.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But as there are more
and more alternatives

05:45.830 --> 05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and more and more competition
for the incumbents,

05:48.410 --> 05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
their authority
and their influence

05:50.570 --> 05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is going to wane if for no other
reason than a company launching

05:56.360 --> 05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
this year and especially
next year and the year

05:58.850 --> 06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
after that can so perfectly
curate all the people

06:03.380 --> 06:05.660 align:middle line:90%
it wants to talk to, right?

06:05.660 --> 06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
If they're launching, you know,
the plant-based chicken nugget

06:11.250 --> 06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
company of the future, knows
its audience very well,

06:15.750 --> 06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
knows exactly who
reaches that audience,

06:19.830 --> 06:21.660 align:middle line:84%
knows exactly the
people who reach

06:21.660 --> 06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that audience who are also into
plant-based foods, who are also

06:26.850 --> 06:31.590 align:middle line:84%
into fitness, who are also--
you could carve and dice

06:31.590 --> 06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
out a, quote,
unquote, media list

06:36.000 --> 06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to a tremendous
degree of specificity

06:39.030 --> 06:41.078 align:middle line:84%
and then go outreach
to exactly who you want

06:41.078 --> 06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
to talk to in exactly
the way that you want

06:42.870 --> 06:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to talk to each one
of them and build out

06:46.390 --> 06:47.710 align:middle line:90%
a very specific campaign.

06:47.710 --> 06:51.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

06:51.480 --> 06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
 (SINGING) It's on you
what you going to do.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.142 align:middle line:84%
 You're inevitably
going to get bad press.

06:56.142 --> 06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
take it personally,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.130 align:middle line:90%
especially if you're like me.

06:59.130 --> 07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
need to forget about it

07:02.670 --> 07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I coach plenty of
founders through this.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
The first time it
happens, it stings so much

07:08.520 --> 07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
because your company
is so personal to you

07:11.100 --> 07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that you take it as an affront,
almost like it's a kid.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's always the same
process where, like, we

07:17.280 --> 07:18.630 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge it happened.

07:18.630 --> 07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I remind the founder,
look, it's not you.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It's about the company.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You are not the company
at the end of the day.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is
some good feedback

07:27.270 --> 07:28.470 align:middle line:90%
in that negative press.

07:28.470 --> 07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's take it for
what it's worth

07:30.030 --> 07:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and forget about it, right?

07:31.710 --> 07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
That news cycle is going to
move on within 12 hours--

07:34.770 --> 07:36.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean 24 hours tops.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is the new normal,
and that's not slowing down.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's only going to
increase as there

07:41.730 --> 07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
are more and more sources, as
we get more and more fragmented,

07:44.550 --> 07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and as the news
cycles just continue

07:46.080 --> 07:48.100 align:middle line:90%
to speed up faster and faster.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the overarching
theme that's still very true

07:51.330 --> 07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
is build genuine personal
relationships with folks.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Do good work, and
talk about it openly.

07:58.470 --> 08:01.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a chance to create a
new story or a new relationship

08:01.260 --> 08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
or new content every
minute of every day.
