ALEXIS OHANIAN: It starts
with an idea, maybe just

00:25.600 --> 00:27.700 align:middle line:90%
a kernel of an idea.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.930 align:middle line:90%
But life gets in the way--

00:28.930 --> 00:31.060 align:middle line:90%
school, work, family.

00:31.060 --> 00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We're busy people,
constantly on the move.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.040 align:middle line:90%
But you can't shake it.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the last thing on your
mind when you go to bed,

00:38.590 --> 00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing that you
think about in the morning.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And deep down, you think,
I've got something here.

00:44.050 --> 00:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:46.820 --> 00:48.405 align:middle line:84%
But what are you
going to do with it?

00:48.405 --> 00:51.315 align:middle line:90%

01:02.790 --> 01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm Alexis Ohanian,
co-founder of Reddit.

01:05.370 --> 01:07.002 align:middle line:90%
While I was a senior at UVA--

01:07.002 --> 01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, it's
really not about me.

01:08.710 --> 01:10.877 align:middle line:84%
It's about you guys on the
other end of the monitor.

01:10.877 --> 01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
 --sold the company, came
back to Reddit in 2014 as exec

01:14.340 --> 01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
chairman to help lead
a turnaround, left.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
REPORTER: Ohanian
says more diversity

01:19.200 --> 01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is in the best interests of
Reddit, and the tech industry

01:21.960 --> 01:22.860 align:middle line:90%
more broadly.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.250 align:middle line:90%
 --then began investing.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
 --wanted to discover
the next Alexis Ohanian,

01:26.520 --> 01:29.062 align:middle line:84%
hand them a check, and have them
create something even bigger

01:29.062 --> 01:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and even better.

01:30.090 --> 01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The next Alexis Ohanian
is actually your own child.

01:34.150 --> 01:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
Business dad life.

01:38.250 --> 01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
color works for me.

01:41.220 --> 01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
In this class, I'm going
to teach you everything

01:43.470 --> 01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I've learned as a CEO and
an investor in multiple

01:47.910 --> 01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
billion-dollar companies, so
that you can go from your own

01:50.640 --> 01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
idea to actually
executing your dreams.

01:53.490 --> 01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm the right person to
teach this class, because few

01:56.040 --> 01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
have both founded and scaled
world-changing companies,

01:59.700 --> 02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and also been among the
earliest investors in dozens

02:03.450 --> 02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
of startups, 30 of which are now
multibillion-dollar companies.

02:09.699 --> 02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
In the Industrial
Revolution, you

02:12.250 --> 02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
needed to open a factory
to change the world.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
In the internet revolution,
you only need to open a laptop.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
If there's an aspiring CEO
out there watching this,

02:22.450 --> 02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I would want her to know
that starting a company

02:24.790 --> 02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
is one of the highest-leverage
ways to change the world.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I am sure
of is, wherever you are,

02:32.570 --> 02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
whatever your
circumstances, you are

02:35.350 --> 02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
capable of building an
incredible business.

02:38.140 --> 02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You are capable of being a
very successful entrepreneur.

02:41.650 --> 02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced that there
are great ideas everywhere.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
There are people capable of
executing on those great ideas

02:48.610 --> 02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, and I hope
you will take the lessons

02:51.460 --> 02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
from this my own experiences,
my ups, my downs, my successes,

02:55.450 --> 02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and my failures, to do
even better than I did.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, I want you
to do this, because then,

03:02.620 --> 03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
when you are successful, I
want you to tell me about it,

03:05.440 --> 03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
so that I can then brag
about all of your success

03:08.440 --> 03:10.460 align:middle line:90%
and claim all the credit for it.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.040 align:middle line:90%
That is all I want out of this.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I really deeply believe
that my purpose, for however

03:15.940 --> 03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
many decades I get to do this,
is to help another generation

03:21.310 --> 03:23.740 align:middle line:90%
do even better than I did.

03:23.740 --> 03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
As an investor, I'll clue you
in on what I'm looking for,

03:27.040 --> 03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
what gets me excited.

03:28.510 --> 03:32.023 align:middle line:84%
I'll teach you the steps to
get funding for your business.

03:32.023 --> 03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I want to teach you how
to find the right idea

03:33.940 --> 03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and steer you away
from the bad ones--

03:36.100 --> 03:39.190 align:middle line:84%
what would immediately turn
me off in a pitch meeting.

03:39.190 --> 03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll let when to accept
failure, when to pivot,

03:42.190 --> 03:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and when to hit the accelerator.

03:44.230 --> 03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll teach you how to deal
with setbacks and haters

03:46.930 --> 03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and competition--
although if there's

03:49.000 --> 03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
one thing I can't teach you,
but that you're really going

03:51.760 --> 03:54.760 align:middle line:90%
to need, it's determination.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Back in the really
early days of Reddit,

03:57.160 --> 04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
we took a big
meeting with Yahoo.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
We sit down with this executive.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.320 align:middle line:90%
He's got his whole team there.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.827 align:middle line:84%
I get into the pitch,
and he pauses me,

04:05.827 --> 04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
and he says, just wait a second.

04:07.160 --> 04:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

04:07.870 --> 04:10.480 align:middle line:90%
How big is Reddit anyway?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So I told them, it's
tens of thousands

04:12.550 --> 04:13.550 align:middle line:90%
of users at this point.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It was still really
small, but it was growing.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.019 align:middle line:90%
And he says--

04:17.019 --> 04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] you guys
are a rounding error,

04:21.490 --> 04:23.110 align:middle line:90%
compared to Yahoo.

04:23.110 --> 04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, what are you
even doing here?

04:25.540 --> 04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The meeting did not
go well after that.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But I felt a certain kind
of motivation from it.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.755 align:middle line:84%
I printed out a
piece of paper that

04:32.755 --> 04:33.880 align:middle line:90%
just had a few words on it.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It said, "you are
a rounding error."

04:37.360 --> 04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that
paper every single day

04:40.600 --> 04:42.070 align:middle line:90%
when I showed up to work.

04:42.070 --> 04:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me so much life.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I know I would not be the
entrepreneur that I am,

04:47.740 --> 04:49.520 align:middle line:90%
had he not done that.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And so my advice
to you is, look,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you're going to come
across haters in all forms.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't take it
personally, and use it

04:56.140 --> 04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
as motivation for
when times get tough.

04:58.180 --> 05:00.970 align:middle line:90%


05:00.970 --> 05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll also be talking about
corporate responsibility.

05:04.420 --> 05:08.627 align:middle line:84%
Founders today are so much
more sophisticated than I was.

05:08.627 --> 05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I meet CEOs now who, from day
one, even when they're 22,

05:13.090 --> 05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
realize that what
they're building

05:14.860 --> 05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
has massive
repercussions and will

05:18.160 --> 05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
have a big impact on
future generations.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And they take that
responsibility seriously.

05:23.620 --> 05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The very best founders,
the most successful CEOs,

05:27.670 --> 05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
to think about,

05:30.100 --> 05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
how will my company fit
in to the broader society

05:33.580 --> 05:35.050 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to shape?

05:35.050 --> 05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I look at it through
a very simple lens.

05:37.610 --> 05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
When I am explaining this
hard decision to my daughter,

05:41.290 --> 05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
when she's grown up, am
I proud of the answer?

05:45.140 --> 05:47.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the test.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So this class isn't just
for business people.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
This class isn't even
just for entrepreneurs.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
This class is for
anyone who's looking

05:54.570 --> 05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
for opportunities to take an
idea and bring it to fruition.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean
just for the next Reddit.

06:02.740 --> 06:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
This could be for an
amazing nonprofit.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
This could be for
an amazing movie.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
This could be for an
amazing fill-in-the-blank.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Ideas without execution
are worthless,

06:12.720 --> 06:14.790 align:middle line:84%
but so many of
the best practices

06:14.790 --> 06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
of modern entrepreneurs are
applicable to someone in just

06:19.110 --> 06:20.670 align:middle line:90%
about any field.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.860 align:middle line:84%
The playing field
has been leveled.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.470 align:middle line:90%
All links are created equal.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

06:27.850 --> 06:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm Alexis Ohanian, and this
is my MasterClass class.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
