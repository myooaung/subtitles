[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03.304 --> 00:07.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07.080 --> 00:09.120 align:middle line:84%
 For a lot of folks who
might be great product

00:09.120 --> 00:12.900 align:middle line:84%
creators, great visionaries,
great designers,

00:12.900 --> 00:14.940 align:middle line:84%
great community
builders, they may

00:14.940 --> 00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
have no experience whatsoever
in hiring or management

00:18.750 --> 00:20.440 align:middle line:90%
or any of the other things.

00:20.440 --> 00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And so hiring becomes a skill
that a lot of first-time CEOs

00:26.670 --> 00:28.290 align:middle line:90%
will need to learn.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I don't
have a secret for you.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Hiring well, hiring
quickly, very hard to do.

00:37.130 --> 00:38.390 align:middle line:90%
There is no hack.

00:38.390 --> 00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
how to hire well.

00:40.850 --> 00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It's also how to
source well and how

00:43.070 --> 00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
to interview well and
then how to onboard well

00:45.620 --> 00:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and how to develop talent well.

00:47.210 --> 00:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And in an environment
like today,

00:50.210 --> 00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
where the very best people
have all the leverage,

00:54.710 --> 00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
you really, really have
to make a commitment

00:57.350 --> 00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to doing recruiting
and hiring well.

00:59.210 --> 01:01.940 align:middle line:84%
People can now work
from everywhere.

01:01.940 --> 01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
running off a playbook

01:03.800 --> 01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that we've used for a few
years in modern business, when

01:06.740 --> 01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
it was a physical office space
that everyone showed up at.

01:10.430 --> 01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
You're joining hundreds
of thousands of other CEOs

01:14.240 --> 01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
right now to create
a new playbook

01:16.760 --> 01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
for how to create culture
and develop people

01:19.250 --> 01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in a remote-first world or in
a flexible-office world, which

01:22.880 --> 01:24.258 align:middle line:90%
is very different.

01:24.258 --> 01:29.780 align:middle line:90%


01:29.780 --> 01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, founders will start
with their networks, people

01:33.500 --> 01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
they've worked with before,
they're high conviction about.

01:36.740 --> 01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking,
though, you'll

01:38.210 --> 01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
run out of amazing
people pretty quickly.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.320 align:middle line:90%
No offense to your network.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.445 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they're all great.

01:43.445 --> 01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But let's face it, Fred, you
know, not the ideal hire.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Good guy.

01:50.470 --> 01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Not the top performer you
want on the team, right?

01:52.990 --> 01:55.150 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

01:55.150 --> 02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
You will start to find ways
to see where the talent is

02:00.170 --> 02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and, frankly, start
aggressively reaching out.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Things like Twitter
have actually

02:06.730 --> 02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
become a new kind of
resume, because it's

02:08.860 --> 02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
a place for people,
in their work lives,

02:11.770 --> 02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
things they care about,

02:13.810 --> 02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to show off the work they're
doing, to build an audience,

02:17.830 --> 02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
build a following that helps
them with a reputation.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
countless people who

02:21.700 --> 02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
found their job opportunities
through a Twitter DM.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And now you're
ultimately going to be

02:27.580 --> 02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
looking around and
saying, okay, but how do

02:30.310 --> 02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
we start to build this process?

02:31.780 --> 02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
How do we start to
understand who we want?

02:34.010 --> 02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I am convinced of

02:38.830 --> 02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the job postings
of the future are content.

02:43.810 --> 02:46.225 align:middle line:84%
No one realized it,
because in the past,

02:46.225 --> 02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
a job posting was one of
millions on monster.com.

02:50.560 --> 02:55.573 align:middle line:84%
It was just a note in the void
full of millions of other notes

02:55.573 --> 02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that looked just like
it saying, here's a job.

02:57.490 --> 02:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Here's what we're about.

02:58.780 --> 03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
For a role this important,
you wouldn't just

03:02.680 --> 03:08.647 align:middle line:84%
draft a quick job description,
turn it into a paper airplane,

03:08.647 --> 03:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and throw it off a
building in New York City

03:10.480 --> 03:12.327 align:middle line:84%
and hope you find
a great person.

03:12.327 --> 03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of the
equivalent of just tweeting

03:14.410 --> 03:16.240 align:middle line:90%
something into the ether today.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you would take time
to make the content, the text.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.830 align:middle line:84%
You'd be really
intentional about actually

03:23.830 --> 03:25.390 align:middle line:90%
what you're asking for.

03:25.390 --> 03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
You definitely would
not ask for a CV,

03:28.120 --> 03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost, because
that's not really relevant.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And the signal it
sends to talent

03:34.330 --> 03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is, I am just like all the
other paper airplanes floating

03:38.080 --> 03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
around New York City that
doesn't actually really care.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
In an environment where
everyone is doing something

03:43.420 --> 03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
the same way, being
demonstrably different,

03:47.080 --> 03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
it gives people something
to want to talk about.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It makes them want to
retweet that job posting.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It makes them want to
send it to a friend.

03:54.130 --> 03:57.358 align:middle line:84%
It is that kind of intention
that resonates with people.

03:57.358 --> 03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it goes back to
creating that relationship,

03:59.650 --> 04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
creating that
community from day one.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And if I could tell you could
get 10 times better results

04:04.900 --> 04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
from an application that you
actually put an hour into

04:08.530 --> 04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to really make it pop,
to tell a great story,

04:10.840 --> 04:13.627 align:middle line:84%
to be really thoughtful,
to be really transparent,

04:13.627 --> 04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you should take that
deal every single time.

04:15.460 --> 04:21.730 align:middle line:90%


04:21.730 --> 04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The first 10
employees you hire are

04:24.220 --> 04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
going to define the
culture for the company

04:26.770 --> 04:28.750 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of time.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's actually
that high stakes.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I don't
want to know about your CV.

04:34.510 --> 04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you
should be asking, either.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
An ideal hire needs to be
willing to help build the plane

04:39.820 --> 04:41.290 align:middle line:90%
while you're flying it.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a
different type of person.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
The idea of "this is
not my job" really

04:46.720 --> 04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
can't exist at an
early-stage startup,

04:48.910 --> 04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
everyone's responsibility,

04:51.220 --> 04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
because everyone is
wearing too many hats.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the nature of it.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
When you're making those
important early hiring

04:56.950 --> 04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
decisions, the right person
can have a huge impact.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, when you
finish this in post,

05:02.530 --> 05:04.240 align:middle line:90%
you should animate this, okay?

05:04.240 --> 05:07.150 align:middle line:90%
So your company starts here.

05:07.150 --> 05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And the time goes
this way, all right?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.460 align:middle line:90%
So a company's starting here.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Company's growing, doing well.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Okay, things are moving along.

05:15.850 --> 05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
You make that important
decision to help the business

05:19.240 --> 05:22.487 align:middle line:84%
and you have a lot more
leverage early on than later.

05:22.487 --> 05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
this is because you

05:24.070 --> 05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
make that decision and
even just the smallest

05:27.400 --> 05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
impact on the trajectory
of the business

05:29.860 --> 05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
actually has a
really big outcome

05:31.630 --> 05:33.100 align:middle line:90%
by the time you get over here.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Because over time now, you're
on a much different trajectory.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.642 align:middle line:84%
Whereas let's say you
put that off until later.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Plodding along, plodding
along, plodding along.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then finally make
that same decision.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you've waited so
much more time, you now,

05:46.540 --> 05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
with the same
decision, have not had

05:49.870 --> 05:53.180 align:middle line:84%
nearly as big of a trajectory
impact on the business.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So make that decision
as early as possible.

05:55.930 --> 05:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Reward those early employees.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Compensate them well.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, you won't
have the cash to do it.

06:01.810 --> 06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
But that's why equity exists.

06:03.610 --> 06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Find ways to properly
incentivize them

06:06.760 --> 06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
for the long term and it
will be totally worth it.

06:09.550 --> 06:15.555 align:middle line:90%


06:15.555 --> 06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you hire the
wrong person, then that's okay.

06:17.930 --> 06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You're going to hire the
wrong person all the time.

06:20.490 --> 06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's just
the wrong role.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was the wrong
expectations set.

06:24.740 --> 06:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily mean
the person was a bad person,

06:27.110 --> 06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
just it's the wrong hire.

06:29.330 --> 06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
What's so important,
though, out of respect

06:32.600 --> 06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
for all the folks on your team,
out of respect for the person,

06:37.110 --> 06:38.940 align:middle line:90%
make that decision swiftly.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Help them move on.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Do it in a great way.

06:41.310 --> 06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And keep moving forward
and learn from it.

06:44.100 --> 06:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But you don't do your team any
good when you have someone who

06:49.470 --> 06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to be there,
someone who then can start

06:51.750 --> 06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to promote a kind of toxicity
and negativity and things that

06:55.110 --> 06:56.280 align:middle line:90%
just don't--

06:56.280 --> 06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
they hold everyone back.

06:57.390 --> 07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then your team
starts resenting you,

07:00.750 --> 07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
as a leader, for your inability
to execute on the thing

07:03.390 --> 07:05.432 align:middle line:84%
that they all know needs
to happen, that you know

07:05.432 --> 07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
needs to happen.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And look, the good
news is if you

07:08.190 --> 07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
are struggling
with that decision,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.740 align:middle line:90%
you're not a psychopath.

07:11.740 --> 07:12.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.600 align:middle line:90%
You're not a psychopath.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
High correlation between
CEOs and psychopaths, though.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.380 align:middle line:90%
But you're not one of them.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what it does
mean is now you

07:22.530 --> 07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
need to put the time
in to coach yourself up

07:25.890 --> 07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
with how to have those
hard conversations, how

07:28.230 --> 07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to sort people through
performance review work

07:30.570 --> 07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and performance
improvement plans

07:32.190 --> 07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately potentially
letting someone go.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And so do that out of
respect for everyone

07:37.980 --> 07:39.982 align:middle line:84%
involved as soon as
you can because it's

07:39.982 --> 07:41.190 align:middle line:90%
going to be the right choice.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.523 align:middle line:90%
You're never going to regret it.

07:42.523 --> 07:45.090 align:middle line:84%
In six months, in a year,
when you reflect back on it,

07:45.090 --> 07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
the only thing
you're going to think

07:46.590 --> 07:48.173 align:middle line:84%
is, gosh, I wish I
had done it sooner.

07:48.173 --> 07:55.380 align:middle line:90%


07:55.380 --> 07:58.515 align:middle line:84%
When we started our venture
capital firm, Seven Seven Six,

07:58.515 --> 08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
we knew we wanted to do
everything differently.

08:01.330 --> 08:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And that all
started with hiring.

08:02.910 --> 08:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We did something that's
actually atypical in venture,

08:06.180 --> 08:08.430 align:middle line:90%
which is open applications.

08:08.430 --> 08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem very special
until you realize that VC

08:11.910 --> 08:14.040 align:middle line:90%
is a very insular industry.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority
of people all

08:16.020 --> 08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
come from within
the same networks.

08:18.430 --> 08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one study showed
that 40% of all VCs

08:22.740 --> 08:26.460 align:middle line:84%
graduated from
Stanford or Harvard.

08:26.460 --> 08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
As someone who wasn't in
that group, but certainly

08:29.880 --> 08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
feels a responsibility to
get the very best working

08:34.049 --> 08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
at our firm, we tried
a different approach.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
We announced it on Twitter.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
And we developed applications
that were holistic,

08:41.429 --> 08:43.710 align:middle line:90%
didn't ask people for their CV--

08:43.710 --> 08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
because let's face it.

08:44.710 --> 08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't ask founders
for their resumes.

08:47.130 --> 08:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Why should we ask
members of our own team?

08:49.440 --> 08:50.520 align:middle line:90%
We asked for essays.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
We asked for explanations of
not just experiences, but also

08:54.450 --> 08:55.270 align:middle line:90%
potential.

08:55.270 --> 08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to get
over 1,200 applicants, which

08:58.320 --> 09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
for a brand new
firm isn't too bad.

09:01.440 --> 09:05.348 align:middle line:84%
We got some pretty
interesting results.

09:05.348 --> 09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
You see this kind of
creativity that doesn't just

09:07.390 --> 09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
show up on a resume,
because you're

09:09.070 --> 09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
asking questions that don't stop
with the sort of bare minimum,

09:13.660 --> 09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
but actually push applicants
to go a little further to talk

09:16.240 --> 09:18.790 align:middle line:84%
about the why in their own
lives and their own stories.

09:18.790 --> 09:56.590 align:middle line:90%


09:56.590 --> 09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
ALEXIS OHANIAN: This is exactly
what we could have hoped for,

09:59.860 --> 10:02.470 align:middle line:84%
but nothing we could
have predicted.

10:02.470 --> 10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Of those 1,200
applicants, over 82%

10:06.040 --> 10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
considered themselves
underrepresented in tech.

10:10.170 --> 10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think this really
speaks to the power of hiring

10:14.340 --> 10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
for a broader purpose,
and being willing to break

10:17.850 --> 10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from the common examples of
expertise or credentials,

10:23.610 --> 10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and actually getting
to talent that

10:26.970 --> 10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to have an approach
that's unorthodox, that's

10:29.580 --> 10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
unconventional, but
exactly what you

10:32.100 --> 10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
need in a business like this.
