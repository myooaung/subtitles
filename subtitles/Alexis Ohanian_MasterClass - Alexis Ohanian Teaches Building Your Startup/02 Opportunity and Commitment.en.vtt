 Wait, did we do the clap?

00:01.450 --> 00:03.825 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, I want to
make sure everything's synced.

00:11.810 --> 00:14.478 align:middle line:84%
So Tom Friedman has this book
and this pretty well-known

00:14.478 --> 00:15.770 align:middle line:90%
quote about, the world is flat.

00:15.770 --> 00:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking
about globalization.

00:17.990 --> 00:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know for a fact,
one, the world is a sphere.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I know we got a flat-Earther
thing going on the internet.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But let me be clear,
folks, world is a sphere.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.590 align:middle line:90%


00:28.590 --> 00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
The world wide web, however,
is actually flat, really

00:32.940 --> 00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
does create a kind of level
playing field for ideas

00:37.980 --> 00:39.900 align:middle line:90%
that makes my career possible.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
As an entrepreneur,
as an investor,

00:41.740 --> 00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the only way I can
show up in Boston

00:45.540 --> 00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
with a laptop and an
internet connection

00:48.270 --> 00:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and go on to build something
that now hundreds of millions

00:51.270 --> 00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
of people all over the
world use, like Reddit,

00:53.430 --> 00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is because that playing
field was laid out for me.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know it is
still a fraction

00:59.820 --> 01:04.019 align:middle line:84%
of the potential greatness that
we missed out on for thousands

01:04.019 --> 01:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of years of civilization
when the best ideas didn't

01:07.470 --> 01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
necessarily win because of
all the structural problems,

01:11.250 --> 01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
because of all the gatekeepers,
because of all of the things

01:13.800 --> 01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that we know can hold
a great idea back.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The playing field, of course,
structurally in our society,

01:20.820 --> 01:22.080 align:middle line:90%
is not a level one.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I know that I had
advantages just

01:24.120 --> 01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
by being able to walk into
a room, as a 6 foot 5"

01:27.480 --> 01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
white dude, and get
taken seriously always.

01:31.470 --> 01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The internet is not this magic
wand that all of a sudden

01:34.200 --> 01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
solves all of society's
very real problems.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But it does provide
a gateway and it

01:40.950 --> 01:44.252 align:middle line:84%
does provide a chance
for you to take an idea

01:44.252 --> 01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and build something and reach
an audience that you wouldn't

01:46.710 --> 01:48.130 align:middle line:90%
have been able to reach before.

01:48.130 --> 01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And learn things you wouldn't
have been able to learn before.

01:51.330 --> 01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And actually bring to
fruition ideas that

01:55.350 --> 01:57.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe would have been snuffed
out in their earliest days

01:57.880 --> 02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
if you had to go through
and get someone's authority

02:00.930 --> 02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
or permission or sign-off in
order to bring them to life.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's great
for entrepreneurs.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It's great for artists.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.185 align:middle line:84%
It's great for
creators of all types.

02:10.185 --> 02:16.480 align:middle line:90%


02:16.480 --> 02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
There is a cliche that
floats around venture capital

02:19.360 --> 02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
that I hate, which is that
there's too much money

02:22.390 --> 02:24.970 align:middle line:90%
chasing too few good ideas.

02:24.970 --> 02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And I hate it because I know
for a fact that it is not true.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And the only people
who say that are

02:31.150 --> 02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
people who do not have
networks of great founders.

02:36.130 --> 02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
By great founders,
I mean someone

02:38.110 --> 02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
who is incredibly compelling,
someone who deeply understands

02:41.560 --> 02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the market and can
empathize with customers,

02:44.290 --> 02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and is capable of getting
something created.

02:46.810 --> 02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not ultimately
the one building it,

02:48.700 --> 02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
but someone who
can recruit them.

02:50.890 --> 02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
If you maintain great networks
of great founders, what you'll

02:54.850 --> 02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
find is that there are amazing
ideas birthed every single day.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the business of
finding people and identifying

03:03.160 --> 03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
people and their great ideas
before anyone else realizes

03:06.790 --> 03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that they're a great
idea, and then putting

03:09.070 --> 03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
my reputation, my
teams' time, our money

03:12.880 --> 03:16.510 align:middle line:84%
into helping that CEO bring
that idea to fruition.

03:16.510 --> 03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
We'll get done shooting this,
I will look at my phone,

03:20.350 --> 03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and see a dozen more
great ideas in my inbox

03:23.920 --> 03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
from founders who
I'm excited to meet.

03:25.750 --> 03:31.900 align:middle line:90%


03:31.900 --> 03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Creating something
online today is

03:33.670 --> 03:38.117 align:middle line:84%
as low cost as it has ever been,
and it's only getting cheaper.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about the
cost of you starting something

03:40.450 --> 03:42.980 align:middle line:90%
today, it's really time.

03:42.980 --> 03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It's making the decision
to say, you know what?

03:45.730 --> 03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put off
binge-watching Netflix tonight.

03:49.390 --> 03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sit down and really
think through this business.

03:52.780 --> 03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
mocking up wireframes.

03:55.270 --> 03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
talk to customers.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do the work
to better understand

03:59.500 --> 04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
what I'm building
and then get started

04:01.170 --> 04:02.170 align:middle line:90%
on actually building it.

04:02.170 --> 04:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So time, increasingly, is
the most valuable input

04:08.440 --> 04:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to getting a startup started.

04:10.270 --> 04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The costs in everything
else continue

04:13.240 --> 04:14.860 align:middle line:90%
to fall thanks to technology.

04:14.860 --> 04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And the resources that you
have, where you invest that time

04:19.000 --> 04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
into learning, like
this MasterClass,

04:21.910 --> 04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
continue to get
better and better.

04:23.890 --> 04:30.600 align:middle line:90%


04:30.600 --> 04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
What I thought
was massive growth

04:33.380 --> 04:38.370 align:middle line:90%
15 years ago is a blip today.

04:38.370 --> 04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Companies or ideas, when
they find real traction,

04:42.100 --> 04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
now grow much, much faster.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
When you really dig into
where the internet is going

04:47.490 --> 04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
with Web 3 and crypto,
you start to see it then

04:50.550 --> 04:52.530 align:middle line:90%
on a whole other scale.

04:52.530 --> 04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
You aim for massive growth
by relentlessly focusing

04:55.890 --> 04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
on building something
that people want

04:57.750 --> 04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and, ideally, something
that people love.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
If they want it
badly enough, they'll

05:01.860 --> 05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
likely want to share it.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is a prerequisite
for massive growth

05:05.400 --> 05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that, frankly, few
founders ever even achieve.

05:07.980 --> 05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
We invest in a company
called Axie Infinity,

05:11.040 --> 05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and they grew to $100 million
in revenue in a single month--

05:17.430 --> 05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
$100 million in
revenue in a month.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
it's so eye-popping

05:22.170 --> 05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
is because you now have this
intersection of hundreds

05:24.810 --> 05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people
all over the world online

05:27.060 --> 05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and then now the rails for
money, thanks to crypto,

05:32.370 --> 05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and you connect
those two and we're

05:35.640 --> 05:38.322 align:middle line:84%
going to start seeing growth
on an even bigger scale.

05:38.322 --> 05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
The kind of holy
shit numbers we're

05:39.780 --> 05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about
today are actually, again,

05:42.930 --> 05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
going to seem kind of
boring in 15 more years.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
So hang on.

05:47.790 --> 05:55.010 align:middle line:90%


05:55.010 --> 05:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Anyone watching
this should think

05:56.810 --> 06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
through their commitments,
their responsibilities first.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you can put
yourself and your family

06:04.310 --> 06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
in a place where
this is a viable path

06:08.570 --> 06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can't stop
thinking about this idea

06:11.330 --> 06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and you really need it
to, exist then all right.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.190 align:middle line:90%
All right, go for it.

06:16.190 --> 06:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But being an
entrepreneur is a lot.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.900 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say it's
exceptionally hard work.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.550 align:middle line:90%
My sister's a nurse.

06:25.550 --> 06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I would last maybe a
week doing that job.

06:31.010 --> 06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
There are harder jobs and
harder careers, for sure.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
That said, the mindset
you have to get into to be

06:40.490 --> 06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
an entrepreneur, the
commitment you have to make,

06:42.590 --> 06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
it's a bigger existential
one because you cannot leave

06:46.880 --> 06:49.630 align:middle line:90%
the job at the end of the day.

06:49.630 --> 06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have decisions where

06:51.240 --> 06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
you decide to forego time with
friends, time with family,

06:56.100 --> 06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
time with your partner,
time for yourself.

06:59.790 --> 07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The people who have to
do it, we're all a little

07:04.770 --> 07:06.300 align:middle line:90%
broken in some way.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.220 align:middle line:90%
We just have to.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
If you know I have to
do this, if you really

07:10.710 --> 07:13.080 align:middle line:84%
are laying awake at night
thinking about this,

07:13.080 --> 07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
it really is the first thing
you wake up to in the morning,

07:15.660 --> 07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you probably are
the kind of person

07:17.490 --> 07:18.660 align:middle line:90%
who should be doing this.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I hope a big
part of this course

07:21.210 --> 07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
gives you not just the
strategies and the tactics

07:24.000 --> 07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to be successful, but also
helps you with the gut check of,

07:27.990 --> 07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
is this something I
want to commit to?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
For those who just
know it in their bones,

07:31.870 --> 07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
this is what they have to
do, that's the thing you

07:34.210 --> 07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
got to listen to.

07:36.230 --> 07:37.000 align:middle line:90%
