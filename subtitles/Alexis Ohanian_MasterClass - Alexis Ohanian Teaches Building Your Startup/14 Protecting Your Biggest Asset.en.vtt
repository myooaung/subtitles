 I really hope we end
this work-life balance myth

00:13.050 --> 00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
because it has become very
clear that there really is no

00:19.500 --> 00:20.790 align:middle line:90%
boundary.

00:20.790 --> 00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The reality is these things are
one in the same and it's more

00:24.990 --> 00:30.180 align:middle line:84%
about finding a balance
between taking care of oneself

00:30.180 --> 00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and then taking care
of the everything else.

If you want to be a
great entrepreneur,

00:38.910 --> 00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
you have to take care
of yourself every bit

00:41.760 --> 00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
as much as you take
care of your business.

00:44.010 --> 00:47.903 align:middle line:84%
That's the balance that I'm most
interested in trying to create.

00:47.903 --> 00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the balance that we're
interested in supporting

00:50.070 --> 00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
for our founders.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I've certainly
spoken out on things

00:53.190 --> 00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
like hustle porn, which
was a term I coined mostly

00:57.930 --> 01:01.720 align:middle line:90%
to lampoon this content--

01:01.720 --> 01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
you'll find it on social
media-- that really it lionizes,

01:06.090 --> 01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
it exaggerates, it
celebrates absurd work.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is, you know,

01:16.990 --> 01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
posting about how successful you
are by celebrating how hard you

01:24.730 --> 01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
are grinding is not
something I have ever

01:28.240 --> 01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
seen a really successful
entrepreneur actually do.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the most successful
entrepreneurs I've ever known

01:38.350 --> 01:40.660 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who
work the hardest

01:40.660 --> 01:45.205 align:middle line:90%
at trying to find that balance.

01:45.205 --> 01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, not between
work and life,

01:46.580 --> 01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
but between self and the
needs of others, however

01:49.580 --> 01:51.230 align:middle line:90%
broadly defined.

01:51.230 --> 01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I think,
the challenge for you

01:56.240 --> 02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
because you will not be
your best self for others

02:02.600 --> 02:06.710 align:middle line:84%

of yourself and vise versa.

I'm convinced that there
is going to be a smarter

02:16.350 --> 02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
generation of entrepreneurs--
hopefully you watching this--

02:19.620 --> 02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
who understand that those
boundaries need to exist

02:23.070 --> 02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and who need to do the
work to create systems,

02:26.880 --> 02:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to create process, to
create good habits that

02:30.060 --> 02:31.950 align:middle line:90%
allow for both to flourish.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.650 align:middle line:84%

your entire career trying

to find that and it's
going to ebb and flow.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.760 align:middle line:90%

are probably some
of the most basic.

Even being able to do an
inventory of my calendar week

02:48.810 --> 02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to week, month to month,
quarter to quarter

02:51.750 --> 02:55.020 align:middle line:84%

literally how much time

02:55.020 --> 03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm spending with my family,
for myself, versus with my team.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Just even doing an
audit of your calendar.

03:04.140 --> 03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted, we've built our
own software into Seven Seven

03:07.140 --> 03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Six to make this very easy, but
before that I was still just

03:09.900 --> 03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
using my own calendar just to
look Sunday mornings to get

03:14.460 --> 03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
a sense of, like, what the
hell did I do this last week.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Have I been spending enough
time with my daughter?

03:20.460 --> 03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Have I been spending
enough time for myself?

03:22.560 --> 03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Have I been spending enough
time on the things that mattered

03:25.060 --> 03:26.520 align:middle line:90%
most during the work week?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I challenge every
entrepreneur as early

03:28.890 --> 03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
in the process as
possible to start

03:32.250 --> 03:34.260 align:middle line:90%
to do this kind of inventory.

03:34.260 --> 03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Because even at its
most basic level,

03:36.600 --> 03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
knowing where you're
spending time in your workday

03:39.330 --> 03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to make you
better as an entrepreneur,

03:41.880 --> 03:43.963 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make you
better as a person.

03:43.963 --> 03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
only way you find out

03:45.630 --> 03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that you've been spending most
of your time this past week

03:48.120 --> 03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
on the wrong things or stuck in
meetings that are not actually

03:51.330 --> 03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
pushing forward your
real goals or objectives.

03:54.090 --> 03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And so doing a regular
audit of one's time

is really one of the
best things you can do,

03:58.630 --> 04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
not just as an

weird just saying that.

looking out for myself

a life with an equal partnership

was work and it was growth.

But then becoming a dad
just is such a humbling

04:53.610 --> 04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
experience because you realize
all those things you thought

04:57.090 --> 05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
were important just really
aren't that important.

When I see the success
that my partner has,

09:13.280 --> 09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that Serena has at
whatever she does,

09:15.980 --> 09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
it is a win for us
as a family unit.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.298 align:middle line:84%
And selfishly, also, it
just makes me really proud

09:21.298 --> 09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
woman that I'm spending

09:23.090 --> 09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
the rest of my life with.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Marriage is not for
everyone, but if you

09:26.840 --> 09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
want to go down
that path, it then

09:28.610 --> 09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
makes sense to marry someone
who you can learn from,

09:33.650 --> 09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
to marry someone who pushes
you to be your best self.

09:37.370 --> 09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
You can't marry my
wife, so hands off.

09:41.690 --> 09:46.763 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that I
really admired that I saw early

09:46.763 --> 09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in our relationship,
even before the marriage,

09:48.680 --> 09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
was when Serena is off the
clock, she is off the clock.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.795 align:middle line:90%
That is-- work is over.

09:53.795 --> 09:56.888 align:middle line:90%

09:56.888 --> 10:01.100 align:middle line:90%


10:01.100 --> 10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And the focus is on the dinner
we're having or now, obviously,

10:05.270 --> 10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Olympia.

10:06.230 --> 10:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is a muscle that
I am still developing.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.678 align:middle line:90%
I still-- I get the--

10:11.678 --> 10:12.902 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

10:12.902 --> 10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I get the tingle where
I'm just like, God,

10:14.660 --> 10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I really want to check
my phone right now.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But I catch myself
because I realize, no, I'm

10:19.280 --> 10:20.960 align:middle line:90%
here with Olympia right now.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.360 align:middle line:90%
This is my priority.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.600 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm here to do.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go do this the best
I can so that when I am back

10:27.770 --> 10:29.360 align:middle line:90%
working I'm locked in.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.890 align:middle line:90%
On the count of three.

10:30.890 --> 10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

10:35.810 --> 10:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

10:36.980 --> 10:39.659 align:middle line:90%
She's gone.

10:39.659 --> 10:42.560 align:middle line:90%

10:42.560 --> 10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So bottom line is,
if you really want

10:45.140 --> 10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
to be a successful entrepreneur,
you want people around you

10:49.250 --> 10:54.530 align:middle line:84%
at the office and at home who
can still keep it 100 with you.

10:54.530 --> 10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Finding that balance
between the people who

10:58.100 --> 11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
you know you need in
your life professionally

11:00.860 --> 11:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and the people you know
you need in your life

11:02.780 --> 11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
personally is so important.

11:06.370 --> 11:07.000 align:middle line:90%
