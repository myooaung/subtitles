00:03.283 --> 00:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07.040 --> 00:09.680 align:middle line:84%
 It is definitely
possible to build

00:09.680 --> 00:11.690 align:middle line:84%
a wildly successful
business that

00:11.690 --> 00:15.820 align:middle line:84%
is aligned with making
the world suck less.

00:15.820 --> 00:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing more
and more industries now--

00:19.300 --> 00:21.190 align:middle line:84%
climate in particular
is one that

00:21.190 --> 00:23.500 align:middle line:84%
continues to be
a place where I'm

00:23.500 --> 00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
looking to make big investments
where I know I'm not only

00:25.930 --> 00:29.050 align:middle line:84%
going to generate great
returns for my investors

00:29.050 --> 00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but also help unfuck our
planet, as my buddy Chris

00:33.920 --> 00:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Sacca describes it.

00:35.450 --> 00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing more and
more opportunities now,

00:39.170 --> 00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
in part because the
technology has arrived

00:41.870 --> 00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
but also because of
the impending doom that

00:45.860 --> 00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
has motivated so many of
our best and brightest

00:48.650 --> 00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to say, look, this
is a problem I need

00:50.870 --> 00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to spend the rest of my
life trying to solve,

00:54.110 --> 00:55.760 align:middle line:90%
and that's an exciting thing.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
More and more founders
are looking not just

00:57.770 --> 01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
at the ultimate business
outcome of the companies they're

01:01.610 --> 01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
starting but also
the societal outcome.

01:04.670 --> 01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think this
is, in a way, generational.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
We have, for the first time
ever, a generation, Gen Z,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that has grown up on
the connected web.

01:16.250 --> 01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
They've grown up in the
shadows of the platforms

01:20.060 --> 01:22.760 align:middle line:90%
that my generation created.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They've seen the good,
and they've seen the bad,

01:26.660 --> 01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and they have a fundamentally
different outlook.

01:29.570 --> 01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't have to
compromise your values in order

01:31.790 --> 01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
to be successful.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And actually understanding your
values as early as possible

01:38.180 --> 01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
isn't just good for
future cofounder issues.

01:42.410 --> 01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's also good because it
aligns your company early on.

01:45.830 --> 01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It makes that recruiting process
I talked about earlier even

01:49.040 --> 01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
more effective because the
people who are thinking

01:52.100 --> 01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
about joining and certainly
the ones who do join

01:54.590 --> 01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
are now not just
subscribing to the job.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
They're also subscribing to the
values and the mission of what

02:00.830 --> 02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
an organization is doing.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's so easy
to roll your eyes at this

02:05.780 --> 02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
because I would have when I was,
like, 21 starting out as a CEO,

02:10.070 --> 02:11.820 align:middle line:90%
but it matters.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It really does and
now more than ever

02:13.910 --> 02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
because all of the leverage
has gone to talent.

02:18.290 --> 02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Individuals have all
of the power when

02:21.770 --> 02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
they come to the
negotiation table

02:23.240 --> 02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
when deciding whether to
take one job or another.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding
your values,

02:27.890 --> 02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
understanding your why
as an organization,

02:29.810 --> 02:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and having a North Star which
is as bright as we will help

02:34.310 --> 02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
unfuck the planet is
a really great reason

02:37.010 --> 02:39.557 align:middle line:84%
to get someone to come and work
and give some of their best

02:39.557 --> 02:41.765 align:middle line:84%
years to helping support
this mission and this cause.

02:41.765 --> 02:48.410 align:middle line:90%


02:48.410 --> 02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So many of the best practices
for entrepreneurship

02:51.110 --> 02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to startups
and for-profit companies

02:54.590 --> 02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
are also applicable more
than ever to nonprofits,

02:59.120 --> 03:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and we're seeing this.

03:00.410 --> 03:04.130 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing more and more of
a startup or entrepreneurial

03:04.130 --> 03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
mindset being applied to some
of the best nonprofits that

03:07.520 --> 03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
are getting formed
in the last decade.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things we're
doing with Seven Seven Six

03:11.570 --> 03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
is actually applying our model
for investing in startups

03:16.640 --> 03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
toward investing in nonprofits.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The same attributes we
look for in a great founder

03:22.190 --> 03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of a for-profit startup are the
same attributes that we look

03:26.120 --> 03:29.450 align:middle line:84%
for in a great
nonprofit founder--

03:29.450 --> 03:30.230 align:middle line:90%
same ones.

03:30.230 --> 03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases,
the technologies

03:32.180 --> 03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're both using are
becoming more and more similar,

03:36.020 --> 03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and the advice that
we give actually

03:38.480 --> 03:41.840 align:middle line:90%
starts looking kind of familiar.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
You think about a
inefficient company

03:45.470 --> 03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that you want to disrupt
as a startup founder.

03:47.990 --> 03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
You're probably thinking
about a lot of bloat.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about a
lot of ineffectiveness.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about probably
not a lot of technology.

03:57.350 --> 04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
An up-and-coming
nonprofit is looking

04:00.260 --> 04:03.647 align:middle line:84%
at an incumbent nonprofit
in much the same way,

04:03.647 --> 04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and what that means is
they're understanding

04:05.480 --> 04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
how technology can make
every dollar more effective.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
They're understanding
that they have

04:09.860 --> 04:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to bring real accountability
to their donor base.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
The internet is
cutting out middlemen,

04:15.320 --> 04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
cutting out overhead, and able
to create a direct relationship

04:19.010 --> 04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
between the cause that you care
about or maybe the person who

04:22.130 --> 04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
needs the money, the support,
whatever you want to call it,

04:25.560 --> 04:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and the donor.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
That level of intimacy
and transparency

04:29.870 --> 04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
applied to everything.

04:31.670 --> 04:37.700 align:middle line:90%


04:37.700 --> 04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
One company that's trying to
make the world suck a little

04:40.160 --> 04:42.170 align:middle line:90%
less is called DroneSeed.

04:42.170 --> 04:43.865 align:middle line:84%
We chose to invest
in them because

04:43.865 --> 04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the entrepreneurial
techniques they are using

04:45.740 --> 04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
are the same ones
I advocate for.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
When DroneSeed pitched
Seven Seven Six,

04:50.720 --> 04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
they had a very clear problem
they were working to solve.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Our forests are burning.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
These forests provide a
really important resource.

05:00.410 --> 05:01.730 align:middle line:90%
They don't just look pretty.

05:01.730 --> 05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
They also convert
a whole ton of CO2

05:04.430 --> 05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
into oxygen. We
need oxygen to live.

05:08.300 --> 05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
There is a real problem as
more and more wildfires are

05:12.170 --> 05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
happening and they are
getting worse and worse

05:14.420 --> 05:17.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're destroying one
of the best chances we have

05:17.030 --> 05:20.015 align:middle line:90%
to keep this planet livable.

05:20.015 --> 05:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a good, attention-grabbing
problem, right?

05:23.330 --> 05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Currently, the very best
ways to reforest a site

05:26.420 --> 05:28.310 align:middle line:90%
is remarkably manual.

05:28.310 --> 05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
people shoving a stick

05:30.950 --> 05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
into the ground, doing
backbreaking work

05:33.380 --> 05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to plant seeds, oftentimes
at really high altitudes

05:37.730 --> 05:39.890 align:middle line:90%
or with really steep terrain.

05:39.890 --> 05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a horribly inefficient
and dangerous way to do really,

05:43.760 --> 05:46.598 align:middle line:84%
really important and,
ultimately, valuable work.

05:46.598 --> 05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the problem
set that DroneSeed looked at.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
How can they do a much more
efficient, scalable job

05:52.730 --> 05:55.430 align:middle line:90%
for this really important task?

05:55.430 --> 05:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And they had a clear goal.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.737 align:middle line:90%
Key result was straightforward.

05:59.737 --> 06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They could derive the real
value of their business

06:01.820 --> 06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
by generating
carbon-capture credits.

06:05.630 --> 06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
With 8 million acres
planted globally each year

06:08.480 --> 06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and 7 million acres in the
US alone lost to wildfire,

06:13.520 --> 06:15.390 align:middle line:90%
that is not sustainable.

06:15.390 --> 06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So here you have a clear
and present problem

06:18.080 --> 06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
with a significant
and clearly outlined

06:20.450 --> 06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
market opportunity
and a clear reason

06:24.350 --> 06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
to build a very viable business.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Grant showed up with
quite a bit of expertise,

06:30.840 --> 06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
not just in engineering
proprietary drones but also

06:34.850 --> 06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the software to run those
routes and, finally,

06:38.210 --> 06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
their own innovative way
to do the seed delivery.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It lets them do things that
humans alone could never

06:44.300 --> 06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
do in a fraction of the time
for a fraction of the cost.

06:48.830 --> 06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And so while it's never a good
feeling when forests burn,

06:53.090 --> 06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
every time it happens now,
this is an opportunity

06:56.030 --> 06:57.450 align:middle line:90%
for their business.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And when compared to the
traditional means of doing it,

07:00.440 --> 07:03.010 align:middle line:90%
it's infinitely better.

07:03.010 --> 07:08.000 align:middle line:90%
