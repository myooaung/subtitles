00:07.050 --> 00:10.050 align:middle line:84%
 We know the business
adage, word of mouth

00:10.050 --> 00:11.308 align:middle line:90%
is the best form of marketing.

00:11.308 --> 00:12.100 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard it.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to go to
business school to learn it.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We take it for granted
because it's so obvious.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And only in the
modern era, thanks

00:19.890 --> 00:23.350 align:middle line:84%
to the advent of online
communities at scale,

00:23.350 --> 00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
can we actually see the
power of that and track that.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Because this was
always the case.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
If I had a nice blacksmith
in town who I really liked,

00:31.200 --> 00:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I would tell a buddy
of mine, hey, you

00:32.850 --> 00:35.010 align:middle line:84%
need to go get your
sword repaired,

00:35.010 --> 00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
you should go to
Fred's Blacksmith Shop.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Word of mouth was a really
compelling form of advertising.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And that blacksmith
wasn't going to be

00:42.300 --> 00:46.532 align:middle line:84%
able to buy an ad in
the newspaper [LAUGHS]

00:46.532 --> 00:48.240 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
exist yet, because we

00:48.240 --> 00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't have the printing press.

00:49.780 --> 00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But today, every one of us
has our own little printing

00:53.040 --> 00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
press in our pocket where we
can authentically and genuinely

00:56.550 --> 00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
spread the word about
our local blacksmith

00:58.590 --> 01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
or our favorite startup,
and other people will see it

01:02.040 --> 01:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and can easily amplify it.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And now that we're starting to
understand and really measure

01:06.690 --> 01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that, we are going to
see an entirely new way

01:09.840 --> 01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that every CEO is going
to think about community.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.900 align:middle line:84%
The internet has drastically
changed the relationship

01:15.900 --> 01:16.830 align:middle line:90%
to the customer.

01:16.830 --> 01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Social media was the
first wave of this change.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And the realization
every company has now

01:21.840 --> 01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
had to go through is that
your customers are everywhere.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Your customers are talking
about you everywhere.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And your choice is simple--

01:30.000 --> 01:33.180 align:middle line:84%
either ignore them, bury
your head in the sand

01:33.180 --> 01:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and hope that it just takes care
of itself, or engage with them.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Learn from them.

01:40.140 --> 01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Empathize with them.

01:41.740 --> 01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to keep
trying to do the former,

01:45.300 --> 01:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going to
have a really bad time.

01:47.460 --> 01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
You have an imperative,
now more than ever,

01:50.280 --> 01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to engage with every single one
of your customers-- good, bad,

01:53.190 --> 01:54.030 align:middle line:90%
ugly--

01:54.030 --> 01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
where they are and
in a way that shows

01:57.240 --> 01:59.682 align:middle line:90%
that you actually give a damn.

01:59.682 --> 02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you like how I tied the
blacksmith thing together?

02:01.890 --> 02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure where
I was going with it,

02:03.120 --> 02:04.453 align:middle line:90%
but I feel like I brought it in.

02:04.453 --> 02:10.970 align:middle line:90%


02:10.970 --> 02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
think every company needs

02:12.980 --> 02:15.980 align:middle line:84%
a great logo or a
mascot in particular,

02:15.980 --> 02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
but they do need some kind
of personality or depth.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's absolutely
the case for anything

02:22.520 --> 02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
that's consumer-facing,
but increasingly

02:25.130 --> 02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
the case for any business,
even a B2B-type business

02:28.520 --> 02:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that's servicing
other businesses,

02:30.470 --> 02:34.490 align:middle line:90%
because we are storytellers.

02:34.490 --> 02:38.780 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we want to
find points of connection

02:38.780 --> 02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and be able to relate to
everything in our world,

02:41.430 --> 02:44.210 align:middle line:84%
including, increasingly,
even companies and brands

02:44.210 --> 02:45.680 align:middle line:90%
that we use and care about.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And now that social media is
ubiquitous and everyone is

02:49.040 --> 02:51.725 align:middle line:84%
fighting for every
last bit of attention,

02:51.725 --> 02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
more work that you put
into humanizing your brand,

02:54.320 --> 02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
into humanizing your business,
making it more relatable--

02:56.750 --> 03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's as you a founder
personally or through some

03:01.370 --> 03:03.320 align:middle line:90%
avatar you create--

03:03.320 --> 03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
it goes a long way
towards creating

03:05.060 --> 03:08.873 align:middle line:90%
yet another moat of brand.

03:08.873 --> 03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
ALEXIS OHANIAN (VOICEOVER): I
used to draw a unique design

03:11.290 --> 03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
on the Reddit logo every day.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
And there's a story behind that.

03:15.100 --> 03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It provided just a tiny bit
more connection with my own mom.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
My mother got sick while
I was starting Reddit.

03:22.510 --> 03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
She was diagnosed with
terminal brain cancer.

03:24.820 --> 03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
 And that, in
many ways, guided--

03:29.080 --> 03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's guided my
entire life, but especially

03:32.320 --> 03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
that period of my life leading
Reddit, and ultimately selling

03:36.070 --> 03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
it, et cetera.

03:37.520 --> 03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the little joys
I gave her and myself really

03:43.240 --> 03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
was by doodling these little
stories in the logo of Reddit

03:48.850 --> 03:49.960 align:middle line:90%
up in the corner.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So that every morning,
she would have something

03:52.210 --> 03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to go look at that was just fun
and sometimes a little silly,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.000 align:middle line:90%
sometimes a little weird.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have something to
talk about that wasn't just

04:00.610 --> 04:02.080 align:middle line:90%
the chemo or the treatments.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And she came to really
look forward to this

04:05.170 --> 04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and would give me ideas
for different storylines

04:07.390 --> 04:08.120 align:middle line:90%
that we could do.

04:08.120 --> 04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was awesome to have this
little artistic collaboration

04:12.610 --> 04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
with my mom during those final
years, that also, it turns out,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.909 align:middle line:90%
entertained millions of people.

04:18.909 --> 04:25.330 align:middle line:90%


04:25.330 --> 04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
surprise and delight

04:26.890 --> 04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
is something that I've
just always been obsessed

04:29.350 --> 04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
with, because on the
internet, in particular,

04:33.820 --> 04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
people's expectations
are just so low.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
a huge advantage,

04:39.820 --> 04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
because when
expectations are low

04:41.500 --> 04:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and you come in and really
delight people, oh man,

04:44.890 --> 04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
that happy zone in between of
that low expectations meeting

04:48.550 --> 04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
with really great experience
creates a lifelong customer.

04:53.420 --> 04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when you
emailed contact@reddit.com

04:57.700 --> 04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
with a customer
support question,

04:59.620 --> 05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
for the first four
years of the company,

05:02.410 --> 05:05.050 align:middle line:90%
you got a response from me.

05:05.050 --> 05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
As a founder and CEO, one of
the highest leverage things

05:08.500 --> 05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you can do is send a thoughtful
and supportive reply to someone

05:14.170 --> 05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
with that signature
that says Founder, CEO.

05:17.530 --> 05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Once I got in the
mood to be like,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to do
some feedback emails,

05:21.100 --> 05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I would immediately start
with the most recently sent

05:24.400 --> 05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
few emails so that those
people, those lucky folks,

05:28.390 --> 05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
would get essentially
an instant reply.

05:31.660 --> 05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you build
up a lot of confidence

05:35.020 --> 05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
with your users, a lot of
confidence with your customers.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And then when
things do go wrong--

05:39.610 --> 05:40.360 align:middle line:90%
and they will.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You'll make mistakes-- you
will have earned trust.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.340 align:middle line:90%
You'll have earned respect.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
You'll have earned the
benefit of the doubt.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Take some time to
actually think through,

05:50.290 --> 05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
what are some ways that you
can surprise and delight

05:52.540 --> 05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
your own customers?

05:53.620 --> 05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
What are some ways
that you can rethink

05:56.650 --> 06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
what actually delivers value
to the people who you serve?
