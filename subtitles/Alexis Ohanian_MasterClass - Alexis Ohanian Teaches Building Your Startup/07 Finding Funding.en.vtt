enough time for this one?

00:02.070 --> 00:02.718 align:middle line:90%
I, like--

00:02.718 --> 00:04.260 align:middle line:84%
CREW: Can you do it
in a few minutes?

00:04.260 --> 00:04.800 align:middle line:90%
 I'm going.

00:04.800 --> 00:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:05.250 --> 00:05.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Today, the ways
to get fundraising

00:14.580 --> 00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
are rapidly changing
because everything

00:17.940 --> 00:22.605 align:middle line:84%
from crowdfunding to crypto
token offerings to even laws

00:22.605 --> 00:24.480 align:middle line:84%
are evolving right now
that allow more people

00:24.480 --> 00:25.590 align:middle line:90%
to be able to invest.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
universal truths

00:27.240 --> 00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
that are going to hold up
no matter how you do it.

00:29.370 --> 00:34.008 align:middle line:84%
My transition from CEO to
investor has been eye-opening.

00:34.008 --> 00:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It is much easier to be the one
on the other side of the table

00:38.310 --> 00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
with the money, deciding whether
or not to invest in a founder,

00:41.970 --> 00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because I know what it's
like to be on the side asking

00:45.540 --> 00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
for an investment and be told
no time after time after time.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of fundraising.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.220 align:middle line:84%
There is not a single founder,
there's not a single CEO

00:56.220 --> 01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
out there, who has not been
told no more times than yes.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
And that's the nature
of startup investing.

01:05.459 --> 01:07.385 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of fundraising.

01:07.385 --> 01:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's the nature of
being an entrepreneur, which

01:09.510 --> 01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
is getting really
comfortable hearing "no."

01:12.210 --> 01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I think about

01:14.190 --> 01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
as an investor is, how I
can, as quickly as possible,

01:19.440 --> 01:25.500 align:middle line:84%
cut through all the noise and
understand what a CEO wants

01:25.500 --> 01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
me to see about a product
or a market or a business

01:29.220 --> 01:30.390 align:middle line:90%
opportunity?

01:30.390 --> 01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've got some
sort of best practices

01:32.430 --> 01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that I'll go into
with you about that.

01:36.420 --> 01:40.260 align:middle line:90%


01:40.260 --> 01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Simply getting in
front of people

01:42.180 --> 01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
has become so much easier
thanks to social media.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And there is a non-trivial
number of deals that get

01:49.080 --> 01:52.958 align:middle line:84%
pitched via Twitter
DM or email or--

01:52.958 --> 01:54.000 align:middle line:90%
you can go down the list.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.142 align:middle line:84%
Some founders have gotten
very creative with the ways

01:57.142 --> 01:58.350 align:middle line:90%
that they have pitched folks.

01:58.350 --> 02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But what's more
important, especially

02:01.110 --> 02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
in an environment
with lots of noise,

02:03.210 --> 02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
is finding ways to
create strong signal

02:05.820 --> 02:10.479 align:middle line:84%
that attract investors to
whatever it is you're building.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And so how do you do that?

02:12.330 --> 02:15.690 align:middle line:84%
One tried and true method is,
as we've talked about earlier,

02:15.690 --> 02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
simply shipping something,
getting something

02:18.930 --> 02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that is in the hands of
customers, that gives people

02:21.240 --> 02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
a chance to talk about
it, is a surefire way

02:24.600 --> 02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
to have your first step into
that fundraising conversation.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I've had companies that I've
found literally on my Twitter

02:32.790 --> 02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
feed that I was so excited
by, I reached out to the CEO

02:36.390 --> 02:38.340 align:middle line:90%
to want to schedule a meeting.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
This happens more
often than you think.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can cold email.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.130 align:middle line:90%
You can cold DM.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But know that you're
going to be sending

02:46.200 --> 02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
a message into an inbox that's
full of hundreds or thousands

02:49.800 --> 02:50.675 align:middle line:90%
or tens of thousands.

02:50.675 --> 02:53.133 align:middle line:84%
Undoubtedly, we're going to
see more and more opportunities

02:53.133 --> 02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
for founders to break in.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing software
platforms emerge.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing more and more
conferences emerge that are

02:59.250 --> 03:00.750 align:middle line:90%
geared towards pitching.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
You should never pay
to pitch, by the way.

03:03.660 --> 03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The folks who will
charge you money in order

03:06.150 --> 03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
to pitch your startup to
a room full of investors

03:08.820 --> 03:10.080 align:middle line:90%
are charlatans.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Do not pay anyone to
pitch your startup.

03:13.420 --> 03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Instead, look for opportunities,
demo days, just general startup

03:18.730 --> 03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
events, where you
can have the chance

03:21.490 --> 03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to get five minutes on stage
talking about your business,

03:24.370 --> 03:25.690 align:middle line:90%
talking about your aspirations.

03:25.690 --> 03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to
break in is shipping,

03:29.200 --> 03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
building something great,
because that reputation is

03:32.650 --> 03:33.680 align:middle line:90%
what opens doors.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what unlocks
your way into investors.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.900 align:middle line:90%
It's proof of execution.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
It's actually showing
what you've built,

03:40.960 --> 03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
the happy customers you have,
the growth you've gotten.

03:43.660 --> 03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And as the cost
of getting started

03:45.940 --> 03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
gets cheaper and cheaper, as
the opportunities and methods

03:49.300 --> 03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to receive funding
get easier and easier,

03:51.430 --> 03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have more and
more ways to kick things off.

04:00.242 --> 04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're meeting
with an investor,

04:01.700 --> 04:03.367 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going
to get more, like,

04:03.367 --> 04:04.700 align:middle line:90%
30 minutes to an hour.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
That meeting is probably
going to involve a pitch deck.

04:08.420 --> 04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But you're still going to
want to be able to clearly

04:10.940 --> 04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and concisely, right up
front, explain the problem.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
What is the thing that you're
ultimately going to solve?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Then prove that the
market is big enough.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
sizing your market,

04:21.680 --> 04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
investors want to see
something that is easily

04:23.900 --> 04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
a multi-billion
dollar opportunity so

04:26.120 --> 04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that your business is going
into a market that is big enough

04:29.870 --> 04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
for the value of your company
to one day be worth billions.

04:33.620 --> 04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
We invested in a high protein,
low carb bagel business

04:37.960 --> 04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
recently that was making the
case for engineering a solution

04:44.230 --> 04:48.775 align:middle line:84%
to refined carbs,
bread products that we

04:48.775 --> 04:51.740 align:middle line:90%
know have a huge market today.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
We love our refined carbs
in the United States.

04:54.340 --> 04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you can bottom-up
size that pretty cleanly.

04:57.370 --> 04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And so then the pitch
is a really clear one.

04:59.770 --> 05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
If our product is
superior, if people

05:02.260 --> 05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
will demand an alternative that
is both plant-based and also

05:06.370 --> 05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
low in carbs and
high in protein,

05:08.650 --> 05:11.230 align:middle line:84%
we can win a material
portion of this market.

05:11.230 --> 05:12.680 align:middle line:90%
This market's already big.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we win 1% of it, here's
how much money we make.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.288 align:middle line:84%
And here's how big
our business is.

05:18.288 --> 05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what you've got to get
across in the first few minutes

05:20.830 --> 05:21.760 align:middle line:90%
as a founder.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear problem, a
clear need, and a huge market

05:32.740 --> 05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
One thing you might be
tempted to do is use jargon.

05:37.010 --> 05:38.540 align:middle line:90%
That is a mistake.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
That is automatically
a red flag for me

05:41.600 --> 05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
as an investor because
I want to hear something

05:43.850 --> 05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
explained to me in as
plain English as possible.

05:46.940 --> 05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'll even catch myself on
the other side of the table

05:50.330 --> 05:53.090 align:middle line:84%
occasionally dropping
jargon just because it's

05:53.090 --> 05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
more efficient, right.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.798 align:middle line:84%
Using an acronym
like "MVP," right,

05:57.798 --> 05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
we talked about earlier--
minimum viable product.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, yes, jargon has
a place in industry

06:02.930 --> 06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
because it helps experts
quickly describe complex ideas

06:06.710 --> 06:09.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's not worth
[CHUCKLES] using all the time

06:09.980 --> 06:11.637 align:middle line:90%
to spell out a long phrase.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But in a pitch
meeting, you need to be

06:13.220 --> 06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
able to clearly and
concisely explain

06:15.080 --> 06:16.880 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing
in plain English

06:16.880 --> 06:18.630 align:middle line:90%
that anyone can understand.

06:18.630 --> 06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I meet a
founder who thinks

06:21.290 --> 06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that using a bunch
of jargon is a way

06:24.440 --> 06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to maybe impress an investor
about their expertise,

06:29.000 --> 06:30.680 align:middle line:90%
it's a bad sign.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.228 align:middle line:84%
And it's something to be avoided
because ultimately, you're

06:33.228 --> 06:35.270 align:middle line:84%
going to need to be able
to explain this business

06:35.270 --> 06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
every single day to every
single person you meet,

06:38.540 --> 06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a potential
hire, a potential customer,

06:41.450 --> 06:42.950 align:middle line:90%
or a potential investor.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going
to be industry experts.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to be able to
be compelling in as few words

06:47.720 --> 06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as possible while still
making it understandable.

06:50.690 --> 06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes to
the presentation itself,

06:53.060 --> 06:53.720 align:middle line:90%
it's funny.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to see a trend.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I actually love it
when founders just

06:58.760 --> 07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
come with a memo to read ahead
of time because we ultimately

07:03.980 --> 07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
end up creating a
memo on our side

07:06.620 --> 07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
so that we have something
internally to memorialize

07:08.870 --> 07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
the deal, to debate the
deal, to learn from the deal.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And the memo format
actually works really well.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you can really
efficiently in,

07:17.360 --> 07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
like, a page explain all the
things that we talked about

07:20.330 --> 07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
earlier, I actually find it to
be a really nice alternative

07:23.180 --> 07:25.070 align:middle line:90%
to a PowerPoint presentation.

07:25.070 --> 07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
That said, 95% of the pitches
we get are those slides.

07:29.330 --> 07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And for the time
being, that's probably

07:31.370 --> 07:33.410 align:middle line:90%
going to be the dominant medium.

07:33.410 --> 07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And it does help when
identifying founders

07:38.450 --> 07:39.350 align:middle line:90%
with taste.

07:39.350 --> 07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, finding design talent
to make that beautiful pitch

07:41.870 --> 07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
deck's actually a
lot easier than it

07:43.370 --> 07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
was even five or 10 years ago.

07:45.500 --> 07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But I care more about
the design of a deck

07:49.920 --> 07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
when I'm being pitched something
that is consumer-facing

07:53.490 --> 07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
or where design is
really important.

07:55.950 --> 07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, we get to
invest in rocketship companies

07:58.590 --> 08:00.930 align:middle line:90%
like Stoke.

08:00.930 --> 08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're Stoke and you're
building reusable rockets,

08:04.200 --> 08:07.842 align:middle line:84%
I don't care as much about
the aesthetics of your deck

08:07.842 --> 08:10.050 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately what's
going to make your business

08:10.050 --> 08:11.850 align:middle line:90%
successful is not taste.

08:11.850 --> 08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if you're pitching me
something that's like a better

08:16.230 --> 08:20.020 align:middle line:84%
brand, like the bagel company
I talked about earlier,

08:20.020 --> 08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
it's really important to
be able to show instantly

08:23.160 --> 08:24.570 align:middle line:90%
that you have good taste.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And a well-designed presentation
is a great way to do that.

08:27.690 --> 08:30.498 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

08:30.498 --> 08:33.780 align:middle line:90%


08:33.780 --> 08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Your presentation style
matters as a founder.

08:36.270 --> 08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
But what we're looking for
is that you're compelling.

08:39.929 --> 08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's different from
being outgoing or charismatic.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It's compelling.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a demonstration
of a kind of confidence

08:50.160 --> 08:54.097 align:middle line:84%
and self-assuredness about your
market, about your product,

08:54.097 --> 08:54.930 align:middle line:90%
about your customer.

08:54.930 --> 08:57.300 align:middle line:90%
You can convince someone--

08:57.300 --> 09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
not just us as investors--
you could convince someone

09:00.120 --> 09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to come work for you,
leave their comfortable job

09:02.430 --> 09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
at Google, earning
oodles of money,

09:05.250 --> 09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to come work on an
early-stage, risky startup.

09:08.070 --> 09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I usually ask them
to explain why

09:10.920 --> 09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
they want to spend the
next decade or more

09:13.380 --> 09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
of their lives working
on this business

09:16.830 --> 09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
because it gives me a chance
to then hear them talk

09:19.680 --> 09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
through their why and also
start to get a sense of just

09:23.820 --> 09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
how obsessed they are with the
market, just how empathetic

09:27.630 --> 09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
they are with the customer.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And it also, I think,
resets the relationship

09:35.040 --> 09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
because people like talking
about themselves, [CHUCKLES]

09:39.060 --> 09:41.030 align:middle line:90%
especially founders and CEOs.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this question is
valuable for a lot of reasons,

09:43.470 --> 09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
not the least of which,
it sort of resets

09:45.410 --> 09:46.470 align:middle line:90%
the whole conversation.

09:46.470 --> 09:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we do
get into the pitch

09:48.200 --> 09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
or we do get into the deck, it's
a more relatable conversation.

09:52.610 --> 09:55.604 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

09:55.604 --> 09:58.600 align:middle line:90%


09:58.600 --> 10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
As an investor, some
obvious red flags for me--

10:01.810 --> 10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a little nervous
saying them because now--

10:03.900 --> 10:06.190 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] now founders
will be able to trick us.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.210 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

10:07.210 --> 10:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Some obvious red flags--

10:08.890 --> 10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
when a founder is really
combative and defensive

10:11.680 --> 10:12.550 align:middle line:90%
about their idea.

10:12.550 --> 10:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, there's a fine
line between confidence

10:16.090 --> 10:18.662 align:middle line:84%
and self-assuredness
and defensiveness.

10:18.662 --> 10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's important because
you want the former.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't want the
latter because it's

10:22.450 --> 10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
an indication of how the founder
is going to be once we actually

10:25.150 --> 10:26.480 align:middle line:90%
start working together.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Our job as investors
is not to be a manager.

10:29.110 --> 10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not to be a boss
in any way whatsoever.

10:31.610 --> 10:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's a bad
indication if a founder

10:34.120 --> 10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
is so insecure about
their ideas that they

10:36.160 --> 10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
get defensive and combative
in a pitch meeting

10:38.800 --> 10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and could mean
that they're going

10:40.480 --> 10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to have the same tendencies
with members of their team,

10:43.070 --> 10:44.900 align:middle line:90%
subordinates, et cetera.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that I look
for, especially when there

10:48.730 --> 10:53.690 align:middle line:84%
are multiple founders,
is, who is the CEO?

10:53.690 --> 10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And I ask this question often
in meetings when maybe it's

10:58.190 --> 11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
not 100% clear because I want
to see how both people respond.

11:03.470 --> 11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to see how
the CEO responds.

11:05.690 --> 11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to see
how the non-CEOs respond

11:10.190 --> 11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
because you can see a lot
from that body language.

11:12.620 --> 11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And in these very early stage
companies, a lot of the roles

11:16.190 --> 11:17.540 align:middle line:90%
are pretty messy.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Founders might have the
tendency to say, look, we don't

11:19.880 --> 11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
want to figure that out yet.

11:21.060 --> 11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to figure it
out at the next round.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.580 align:middle line:90%
That almost always fails.

11:25.580 --> 11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And usually, in nearly
every circumstance

11:29.570 --> 11:34.960 align:middle line:84%
as a condition of us investing,
we need to know who the CEO is.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then,
like one out of 1,000,

11:37.960 --> 11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
a co-CEO situation can work,
maybe one out of 10,000.

11:41.740 --> 11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's rare.

11:43.030 --> 11:45.522 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're asking that
question of who is the CEO,

11:45.522 --> 11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
part of it's just to see, like,
is the other person looking

11:47.980 --> 11:49.360 align:middle line:90%
really resentful right now?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Or are they both
answering the question,

11:51.700 --> 11:53.140 align:middle line:90%
like, yes, I'm the CEO.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.887 align:middle line:90%
We've seen that happen before.

11:54.887 --> 11:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's something
you absolutely

11:56.470 --> 11:58.030 align:middle line:84%
want to have sorted
out before you

11:58.030 --> 11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
get in front of an investor.

11:59.320 --> 12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And everyone on the founding
team needs to be OK with it.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Another obvious red
flag as an investor

12:06.160 --> 12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is when you can tell a
founder is bullshitting you.

12:09.400 --> 12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's much better as
a founder to just say I

12:14.880 --> 12:17.820 align:middle line:90%
don't know in that situation.

12:17.820 --> 12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically game over
if the answer you're giving

12:24.650 --> 12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is just made up or if the way
that you arrived at that answer

12:29.180 --> 12:32.610 align:middle line:90%
is clearly not well thought out.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So earlier, we talked
about market sizing.

12:34.970 --> 12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't care what the
business is, if you show up

12:38.120 --> 12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and, in a pitch, say that you're
going to have 90% of the market

12:41.940 --> 12:43.880 align:middle line:90%
one day, you're full of shit.

12:43.880 --> 12:44.930 align:middle line:90%
You may not know it.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
It may not be
intentional, right?

12:46.490 --> 12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
You just are
overzealous and excited.

12:49.340 --> 12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And great, like, those are good
attributes to have as a CEO.

12:53.630 --> 12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But you haven't tempered them
and done the diligence to say,

12:56.660 --> 12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, is this even possible?

12:58.970 --> 13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
You haven't watched
this MasterClass

13:00.530 --> 13:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and haven't realized like,
OK, that seems overzealous.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's
unfortunately an easy way

13:06.470 --> 13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss a founder
because if you're not

13:08.870 --> 13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be that rigorous about
something as fundamental as how

13:12.710 --> 13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
big this business could be and
do a basic market sizing, like,

13:16.790 --> 13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
you're not really
willing to do the work.

13:19.730 --> 13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
It is more popular than ever
to be an entrepreneur, which

13:23.300 --> 13:24.750 align:middle line:90%
is a great thing.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
But there are lots of people
who just want to play house.

13:27.410 --> 13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They just want to pretend like
they're being an entrepreneur.

13:30.660 --> 13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
can quickly dismiss folks on

13:34.730 --> 13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is something as simple as
that because if you haven't

13:38.360 --> 13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
done the work to get these
really fundamental things

13:41.210 --> 13:44.313 align:middle line:84%
right, you're probably not
that serious about actually

13:44.313 --> 13:45.230 align:middle line:90%
being an entrepreneur.

13:45.230 --> 13:46.340 align:middle line:90%
You just like the idea.

13:46.340 --> 13:49.243 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

13:49.243 --> 13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've laid
all that out for you,

13:50.910 --> 13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
take 10 minutes to think
about how an investor would

13:53.520 --> 13:55.606 align:middle line:90%
hear your pitch.

13:55.606 --> 13:56.106 align:middle line:90%
