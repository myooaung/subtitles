 There's this model
of the Stanford grad,

00:03.900 --> 00:07.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, perfect grades,
4.0 their whole lives,

00:07.590 --> 00:10.770 align:middle line:84%
starts to start up, and
ostensibly has all the quote,

00:10.770 --> 00:13.090 align:middle line:84%
unquote pedigree
that it might take.

00:13.090 --> 00:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as they get
punched in the face, which

00:16.830 --> 00:19.770 align:middle line:84%
is a daily occurrence
as a CEO, it's

00:19.770 --> 00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
almost like there's a
short circuit that happens.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.440 align:middle line:84%
They've spent their
entire career in education

00:25.440 --> 00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
understanding how systems
work and then doing

00:29.190 --> 00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
whatever is necessary
to check all the boxes.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The problem is,
entrepreneurship, starting

00:35.280 --> 00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
anything, has no syllabus.

00:37.740 --> 00:41.244 align:middle line:90%
There's no professor.

00:41.244 --> 00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
There is only the
cold, harsh reality

00:44.130 --> 00:47.100 align:middle line:84%
of the market saying,
more often than not,

00:47.100 --> 00:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't actually want this.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not my quote, but
one of the greatest minds

00:59.540 --> 01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
of this century
once said, "sucking

01:03.500 --> 01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is the first step to being
sort of good at something."

01:07.590 --> 01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
This is actually from a cartoon
called "Adventure Time,"

01:09.990 --> 01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
but I find it to be
a really nice quote

01:12.330 --> 01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that sums up the
mindset needed to be

01:15.690 --> 01:17.280 align:middle line:90%
a successful entrepreneur.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Any time anyone is
doing any new thing

01:21.300 --> 01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be bad at it, even

01:22.890 --> 01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
if they have every possible
sort of inherent advantage.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, they might
be slightly less bad,

01:30.960 --> 01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
but everyone is still bad when
learning and doing a new skill.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There is no blueprint and
so that kind of resilience

01:38.850 --> 01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and ability to adapt is what
really separates successful

01:42.840 --> 01:44.816 align:middle line:90%
founders from ones who aren't.

01:51.490 --> 01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Failing fast is a
crucial requirement

01:54.760 --> 01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
of starting a startup
because you don't have time

01:58.810 --> 02:00.730 align:middle line:90%
to fail slowly.

02:00.730 --> 02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Failing slowly means your
company is going to fail.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
luxury of time.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
If something's not
working, you have

02:08.110 --> 02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that quickly
and try something else.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do has to
be about failing quickly

02:14.740 --> 02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
to find that product market
fit that I spoke of earlier

02:17.860 --> 02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and find the thing that an
investor wants to invest in.

02:22.370 --> 02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And so running these little
experiments and failing fast

02:25.540 --> 02:26.560 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And it really starts to
define great founders.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And you see it happen
in the first few months.

02:31.490 --> 02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think,
for some founders who

02:34.270 --> 02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
have had a whole career
of academic success,

02:36.820 --> 02:39.340 align:middle line:84%
like I talked about earlier,
they actually struggle.

02:39.340 --> 02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when I say
fail and fail fast,

02:43.420 --> 02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that's anathema to
everything they've

02:45.220 --> 02:47.110 align:middle line:90%
done their entire lives, right?

02:47.110 --> 02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Failure was never
an option in school.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Failure is a way of
life as an entrepreneur.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You might be there watching
and thinking, well,

02:55.730 --> 02:57.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Failing is not fun.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.640 align:middle line:84%
That is a demoralizing
thing to do.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And you, Alexis, you know,
you've come a long way.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Failure is probably
easy for you to deal

03:06.480 --> 03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
with because of all
the success you've had.

03:08.500 --> 03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, there is a
much greater risk to my failing

03:12.540 --> 03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
on a new idea today for
exactly the reason you said.

03:16.180 --> 03:19.023 align:middle line:84%
And there's that proverb about
the tree falling in the woods

03:19.023 --> 03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and if no one's
around to hear it,

03:20.440 --> 03:21.780 align:middle line:90%
does it really make a sound.

03:21.780 --> 03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
If a company or a
product launch fails

03:25.740 --> 03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and no one's there to see
it, does it really fail?

03:29.590 --> 03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the advice I
give to you, and what

03:32.400 --> 03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I wish someone had told me
when I was starting Reddit,

03:35.130 --> 03:39.960 align:middle line:84%
was that it's the biggest
advantage in the world

03:39.960 --> 03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to be starting out because
you can fail 100 times

03:43.600 --> 03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and no one's going to care
because no one's going to know.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, by definition,
you are still starting out.

03:49.260 --> 03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And once you can get over
that psychological hurdle,

03:52.110 --> 03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
it's actually really
liberating because the novice,

03:55.590 --> 04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the neophyte, someone starting
out has infinite room to fail.

04:06.690 --> 04:09.250 align:middle line:90%
So pivoting is some jargon--

04:09.250 --> 04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
again, I don't know who
came up with this one, but--

04:12.270 --> 04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
basically it means changing your
plans, changing your approach,

04:15.840 --> 04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
adapting your business
in a pretty material way.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be as drastic
as having an idea that

04:21.060 --> 04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
would let people order
food from their cell phone

04:23.250 --> 04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
so they wouldn't
have to wait in line

04:24.880 --> 04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and then turning that into the
front page of the internet.

04:27.570 --> 04:30.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty drastic pivot
that we went through early on

04:30.360 --> 04:31.380 align:middle line:90%
at Reddit.

04:31.380 --> 04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So that original company
was called My Mobile Menu,

04:34.590 --> 04:36.580 align:middle line:90%
or MMM for short.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Very proud of that name.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, after a year
of talking to customers,

04:42.510 --> 04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
doing all the things that
I thought I needed to do,

04:45.930 --> 04:49.200 align:middle line:84%
we had a lead investor
tell us, you know,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll invest in
anything but that idea

04:51.210 --> 04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was a pretty
direct pivot.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
The market does not usually
tell you that clearly,

04:56.490 --> 04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
go work on something else,
but in this case it did.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we were
just starting out

05:01.290 --> 05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and we had an investor that we
really respected who we really

05:04.770 --> 05:05.640 align:middle line:90%
wanted to work with.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And we said, fine.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's
try something new.

05:09.630 --> 05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
There is no easy answer to when
is the right time to pivot,

05:14.010 --> 05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
but there is a difference
between just losing

05:17.280 --> 05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
faith in your existing idea and
leaping to a new better idea.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And a strong pivot is an
example of the latter.

05:26.430 --> 05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, if you're
going to pitch investors,

05:30.610 --> 05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to pitch them
in the midst of a pivot.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You still want to
have some clear story

05:36.900 --> 05:38.370 align:middle line:90%
for what you're doing and why.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
There is no shortage
of pitches out there

05:40.620 --> 05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that come through to
an investor's inbox

05:43.530 --> 05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
or ultimately gets to
sit down in front of them

05:45.990 --> 05:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and tell them their idea.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
this narrow window

05:49.860 --> 05:52.028 align:middle line:84%
to teach an investor
something new,

05:52.028 --> 05:54.070 align:middle line:84%
leave them feeling like
they learn something new.

05:54.070 --> 05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the advantages
to having pivoted

05:57.300 --> 05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
at some point in
your startup's career

05:59.310 --> 06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
is you naturally get
a chance to say, look,

06:01.470 --> 06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I was an expert at X and
by building this business I

06:05.160 --> 06:09.330 align:middle line:84%
actually was surprised
by Y. And that motivated

06:09.330 --> 06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
us to adapt our business
to go do this other thing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

06:13.170 --> 06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And we invested in a company
that had a good core idea

06:16.020 --> 06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
but realized they had an
even better one called Papa.

06:20.810 --> 06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
What it does is take, you know,
maybe college-age students

06:26.690 --> 06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
who are looking for extra work,
looking to make some money, who

06:30.110 --> 06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
are interested in maybe one day
becoming health care workers

06:34.070 --> 06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
or just empathetic caring
people who can then, per hour,

06:39.200 --> 06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
spend time with
isolated seniors.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

06:44.812 --> 06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Now in the past, this might
have been volunteer work,

06:47.020 --> 06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out loneliness
is a real epidemic.

06:49.810 --> 06:53.620 align:middle line:84%
There's 11,000 people retiring
every day in the United States.

06:53.620 --> 06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So what Papa realized
early was there

06:56.230 --> 06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of people who wanted
to be able to call up a Papa

06:59.440 --> 07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
pal because maybe they
lived out of state

07:01.240 --> 07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and just have someone who was
trusted be able to come in

07:04.150 --> 07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and check up on their relatives.

07:06.370 --> 07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But what Andrew, the CEO,
realized pretty early

07:09.610 --> 07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
into the business, it was
an even bigger opportunity

07:12.220 --> 07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
for health plans.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
These health plans
desperately wanted ways

07:16.600 --> 07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to get their members to
have healthier outcomes.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, in fact,
selling to health plans

07:22.540 --> 07:24.760 align:middle line:90%
was a much bigger opportunity.

07:24.760 --> 07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But if he had started out trying
to close health plans that

07:29.410 --> 07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
have a much larger sales cycle
that could take months or even

07:32.890 --> 07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
years to close, he may not have
shown enough product market fit

07:36.100 --> 07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
early on.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It may have just gotten
stalled out in bureaucracy,

07:39.010 --> 07:41.380 align:middle line:84%
but he opted for the
most pragmatic path

07:41.380 --> 07:42.790 align:middle line:90%
as soon as he could launch.

them to the world

happened, and they
eventually really

07:55.690 --> 07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
shifted the focus of
the business there,

07:57.550 --> 07:59.110 align:middle line:90%

08:40.299 --> 08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
got some of the best
production teams

08:42.100 --> 08:44.080 align:middle line:90%
in the world making our shoes.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's repurpose fabric.

08:45.850 --> 08:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's take our team and say,
okay, we have a few weeks.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's make the most comfortable,
highest quality, breathable

08:52.480 --> 08:55.120 align:middle line:90%
mask we can.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, another startup
might have thought, well,

08:57.680 --> 09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
let's just cut costs and
just try to bunker down

09:01.840 --> 09:03.280 align:middle line:90%
until the pandemic is over.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But the kind of founders that
I get most excited to invest in

09:06.040 --> 09:07.610 align:middle line:84%
are like Waqas
and Sidra who say,

09:07.610 --> 09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
okay, what are the
resources we have available?

09:09.730 --> 09:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We already used this
fabric to produce

09:12.520 --> 09:14.260 align:middle line:90%
the lining for our shoes.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And is there a way that
we can repurpose it

09:16.480 --> 09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
into a beautiful, elegant,
comfortable, breathable mask

09:18.880 --> 09:20.530 align:middle line:90%
that people will want too?

09:20.530 --> 09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go to our
community and say look,

09:24.920 --> 09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
we're not trying to
sell these as a way

09:28.300 --> 09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
to take advantage
of the pandemic.

09:29.890 --> 09:31.307 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
trying to sell them

09:31.307 --> 09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
to help a bunch of the most
vulnerable New Yorkers.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.565 align:middle line:84%
I gave them the first,
I think, 10 grand.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I'm going to
make sure 10 grand worth

09:37.690 --> 09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of these masks go to my
friend Collin's nonprofit.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what
to wire the money

09:42.940 --> 09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
and you've got your first order.

09:45.100 --> 09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes a
special type of founder

09:50.640 --> 09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to be confronted by a global
pandemic that threatens

09:55.440 --> 10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
the fundamentals of the entire
business, stare it in the eyes,

10:00.090 --> 10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and say, okay, our
turn to figure out

10:02.700 --> 10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
a way to adapt to this,
our turn to figure out

10:04.890 --> 10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
how we keep giving something
of value to our community.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.713 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what you want
to get behind as a founder.

10:09.713 --> 10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
in a matter of weeks

10:12.180 --> 10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
was engineer some
really impressive masks

10:14.640 --> 10:16.860 align:middle line:90%
that sold in record numbers.

10:16.860 --> 10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It is a testament to their
resourcefulness in the face

10:22.470 --> 10:24.105 align:middle line:90%
of global catastrophe.

10:24.105 --> 10:27.396 align:middle line:90%

10:29.280 --> 10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Where your business
ends up in 10 years

10:31.650 --> 10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily going
to be where you think.

10:34.650 --> 10:37.200 align:middle line:84%
You should, as a
visionary leader,

10:37.200 --> 10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
have some North
Star for where you

10:39.930 --> 10:41.250 align:middle line:90%
believe the business will go.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
That's going to rely a
lot on your instincts

10:43.320 --> 10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and a lot on the time that
you spend thinking about it.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Take a minute to think about
a time in your personal life

10:48.530 --> 10:50.100 align:middle line:84%
or your professional
life when you've

10:50.100 --> 10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
had to pivot, when you've
had to change your game plan

10:53.850 --> 10:55.230 align:middle line:90%
and adapt.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I think if you take
a moment, what you'll realize

10:57.750 --> 11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is that you've done it before
and you can do it again.
