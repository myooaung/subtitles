In my mind, it means

As simple as that.

Here is a very

00:44.420 --> 00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
entrepreneurship is as simple

and you're wondering, am I
too old to start a startup?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
The answer to that
is, no, you're not.

01:04.970 --> 01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
would be a good time

01:06.800 --> 01:09.830 align:middle line:84%

with this myth or this fantasy
the 20-year-old founder is

This whole website

01:48.680 --> 01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
is just sort of a
social experiment

01:50.060 --> 01:51.935 align:middle line:84%
to see what would happen
if a bunch of people

01:51.935 --> 01:54.080 align:middle line:84%
were free to voice their
own opinion online.

02:00.635 --> 02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
think Reddit would have avoided
a lot of mistakes that we made.

02:03.260 --> 02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I think we would have been far
more effective and successful.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are things that I
know I did while growing Reddit

02:08.900 --> 02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
that I look at today
and I'm like, gosh,

02:09.949 --> 02:11.157 align:middle line:90%
that was a terrible decision.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is where you have
experience but you're not

Now I love that phrase
because it is alliterative,
