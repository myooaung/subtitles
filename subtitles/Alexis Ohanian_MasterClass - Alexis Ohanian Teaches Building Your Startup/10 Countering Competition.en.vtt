00:00.000 --> 00:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07.410 --> 00:10.320 align:middle line:84%
 Competition is an
inevitable byproduct

00:10.320 --> 00:11.460 align:middle line:90%
of starting a business.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And the sooner you
accept that, the better.

00:13.980 --> 00:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I know I personally took
all of my competition way

00:18.730 --> 00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
too personally for years
when starting Reddit

00:22.480 --> 00:24.800 align:middle line:90%
because it was--

00:24.800 --> 00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
felt like an attack on my kid.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Now that I have a kid,
I realize starting

00:28.670 --> 00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
a startup is definitely not
the same as having a kid.

00:31.580 --> 00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But those feelings are
totally reasonable.

00:36.230 --> 00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The danger with focusing
too much on your competition

00:38.600 --> 00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is that you're not actually
spending time innovating

00:41.360 --> 00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and actually solving problems.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best skills
that you can develop

00:45.680 --> 00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
is understanding you should
just ignore your competition.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
You should maybe pay attention
to what they're doing,

00:53.660 --> 00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
pay attention

00:55.280 --> 00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
to what their customers say
about what they're doing.

00:58.550 --> 01:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But don't obsess over
them because if you do,

01:01.950 --> 01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
creating anything new.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be too
busy copying the things

01:06.770 --> 01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing
and really limiting

01:10.820 --> 01:12.195 align:middle line:84%
the upside for
your own business.

01:12.195 --> 01:19.670 align:middle line:90%


01:19.670 --> 01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
In the early days of Reddit,
we had a competitor called Dig.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Our approaches seemed
pretty similar.

01:26.380 --> 01:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You submit a link, other people
vote on it, they comment on it.

01:30.730 --> 01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
What's the differentiator?

01:33.820 --> 01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we kept
asking ourselves was,

01:36.820 --> 01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
why are people going
to keep coming back

01:39.520 --> 01:42.340 align:middle line:84%
to Reddit every day,
especially when they could go

01:42.340 --> 01:45.518 align:middle line:90%
to Dig or so many other places?

01:45.518 --> 01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
There were times
when yeah, candidly,

01:47.060 --> 01:49.293 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking
way too much about what

01:49.293 --> 01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
they were doing because
they were the market leader.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.870 align:middle line:90%
They had VC funding.

01:52.870 --> 01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
They were based
in Silicon Valley.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We were this tiny startup,
didn't have any funding,

01:56.950 --> 01:58.450 align:middle line:90%
based in Boston then.

01:58.450 --> 02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I spent
more time than I

02:01.710 --> 02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
would have liked to thinking
about their business

02:04.350 --> 02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and how they were acting and
how we should be reacting.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
And it was a year
in that I realized

02:09.509 --> 02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
no, we need to be building
our products the way that's

02:13.950 --> 02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
best for our
customers, and really

02:16.020 --> 02:20.472 align:middle line:84%
understand what their users
weren't happy about in order

02:20.472 --> 02:22.680 align:middle line:84%
to make better decisions
about what we were building.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

02:23.850 --> 02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I realized as long
as Dig was one home

02:29.520 --> 02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
page, one front page of
the internet, so to speak,

02:33.720 --> 02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
it could only apply to a
certain number of people.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.230 align:middle line:84%
There was always going to
be a ceiling because what

02:40.230 --> 02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is a good front page for me
isn't necessarily a good front

02:43.350 --> 02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
page for you and isn't
necessarily a good front

02:46.170 --> 02:47.920 align:middle line:90%
page for someone else.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So we knew we had to
build a platform that

02:50.070 --> 02:52.800 align:middle line:90%
was built on communities.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we created
a way for the site

02:56.310 --> 03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to naturally scale beyond that
idea of just one front page.

03:00.810 --> 03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Today, tens of thousands of
communities exist on Reddit.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Each one has its own front page
that each community believes

03:08.580 --> 03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
is the front page for them.

03:10.870 --> 03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
We knew deep down that this
was an important enough

03:13.500 --> 03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
distinction, and what
our communities actually

03:17.640 --> 03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
wanted was a chance to
have autonomy over that

03:20.970 --> 03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
because these weren't just
sections of a newspaper.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.200 align:middle line:90%
These were real communities.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Each one had its own
culture, its own language,

03:27.880 --> 03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
its own in jokes, its
own sort of hierarchy.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And that ended up making
all the difference.

03:35.180 --> 03:41.290 align:middle line:90%


03:41.290 --> 03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
My dad's been a travel agent
his entire working life.

03:45.430 --> 03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And around the time
I was in high school,

03:47.890 --> 03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
he decided to start
his own travel agency.

03:50.470 --> 03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So I got to see
entrepreneurship firsthand.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I helped him build his website.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I was his IT guy, helped him
get this little agency up

04:00.040 --> 04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and running in
Taneytown, Maryland.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
He had one employee.

04:04.090 --> 04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
They worked really hard.

04:05.690 --> 04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
They had a great business.

04:08.550 --> 04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, then the
dot come boom happened.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Online travel agencies started
emerging and started drinking

04:16.890 --> 04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
all of the milkshake of small
travel agencies like my dad's.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.830 align:middle line:90%
And I watched this.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Every day, coming
home from work,

04:25.320 --> 04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
he would get more and more
upset at the evening news

04:28.830 --> 04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
reporting on the dot
com boom and talking

04:31.560 --> 04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
about how all these websites
were stealing market

04:34.890 --> 04:36.360 align:middle line:90%
share from what he was doing.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And a byproduct of
that were the airlines,

04:39.630 --> 04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
which used to pay a
commission to travel agents,

04:42.300 --> 04:46.170 align:middle line:84%
started reducing their fees
consistently, consistently,

04:46.170 --> 04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
until basically, until zero.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And I remember--

04:49.680 --> 04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I still remember my dad
telling me the day that--

04:54.060 --> 04:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I forget which airline.

04:55.050 --> 04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
The day that one of the airlines
had reduced his commissions

04:58.410 --> 05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to zero, which was the way
that travel agents made

05:01.200 --> 05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot of their money--

05:02.460 --> 05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
it's basically how they
made their money back then--

05:05.060 --> 05:08.000 align:middle line:90%
he sent a fax to them.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he knows how
often I like telling this story.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
He sent a fax back to them that
just simply said, fuck you.

05:14.990 --> 05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So I like imagining
someone receiving

05:17.450 --> 05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
a fax that simply had
a handwritten fuck you

05:20.630 --> 05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
signed by my dad.

05:22.700 --> 05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
To his credit, though,
he adapted his business.

05:27.140 --> 05:28.177 align:middle line:90%
He still runs it.

05:28.177 --> 05:29.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to get him to retire.

05:29.510 --> 05:31.468 align:middle line:84%
I think he's finally
going to retire this year.

05:31.468 --> 05:32.690 align:middle line:90%
But he weathered the storm.

05:32.690 --> 05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Dad was not in a place to
start learning kind of code

05:35.510 --> 05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and building his own
online travel agency.

05:37.820 --> 05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But instead, he realized
where he provided value,

05:41.720 --> 05:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was particularly
for business travelers who

05:45.170 --> 05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
didn't have time but wanted
a concierge-type experience,

05:48.810 --> 05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and then leisure travelers
who really wanted their hand

05:51.470 --> 05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
held for a really
special type of getaway.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
he found his niche.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.450 align:middle line:90%
That's where he persevered.

05:56.450 --> 05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
it's not a business.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be taking over.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's a business that
provided for his family.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the face of all
kinds of disruption,

06:08.780 --> 06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
he found a way to
deliver in an industry

06:12.950 --> 06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
where there were not a lot of
people that were able to adapt.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
There aren't many travel
agencies left out there.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proud that
his is one of the few.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.630 align:middle line:90%


06:23.630 --> 06:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I hope this is a lesson for you.

06:25.290 --> 06:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
focusing on your customers

06:28.820 --> 06:30.590 align:middle line:90%
and ignoring competition.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's also about the
inevitability of it.

06:33.530 --> 06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
All those feelings, whether they
are of rage or just frustration

06:38.840 --> 06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
that competition exists
or is drastically

06:41.330 --> 06:43.790 align:middle line:84%
shaping your industry,
it's a part of the process.

06:43.790 --> 06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
can take that energy

06:45.770 --> 06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and funnel it into
your own improvement

06:48.050 --> 06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and your own
success, the better.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.270 align:middle line:90%


06:53.270 --> 06:56.072 align:middle line:84%
I really hope that fuck you fax
makes it into the final cut.

06:56.072 --> 06:56.780 align:middle line:90%
MAN: Oh, it will.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.330 align:middle line:90%
 Great.
