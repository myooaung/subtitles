INTERVIEWER: How
important is execution?

00:01.710 --> 00:04.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04.750 --> 00:07.615 align:middle line:84%
 Execution is really
not that important.

00:07.615 --> 00:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I'm just
[BLEEP] with you.

00:08.990 --> 00:12.350 align:middle line:90%

00:12.350 --> 00:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16.200 --> 00:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Execution is everything.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Ideas alone are worthless.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
What ultimately makes or
breaks a successful business

00:23.400 --> 00:26.580 align:middle line:84%
comes down to the nitty
gritty of execution.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
A relentless focus
on getting things

00:29.460 --> 00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
done, on prioritizing
the most important work

00:32.189 --> 00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and deprioritizing everything
else in pursuit of building

00:35.250 --> 00:36.540 align:middle line:90%
something really special.

00:39.830 --> 00:43.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43.130 --> 00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So the MVP is a weird
acronym clearly created

00:46.490 --> 00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
by people who are
not into sports.

00:49.610 --> 00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It does not mean
most valuable player.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It means minimum viable product.

00:54.020 --> 00:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is something--

00:54.980 --> 00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who coined
it-- but in startup land,

00:57.410 --> 01:04.190 align:middle line:84%
this is the idea of the most
basic version of your product

01:04.190 --> 01:06.140 align:middle line:90%
that solves a problem.

01:06.140 --> 01:07.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes it viable.

01:07.340 --> 01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the jankiest, earliest
version of something

01:10.190 --> 01:11.895 align:middle line:90%
that just works well enough.

01:11.895 --> 01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
you can put in front

01:13.520 --> 01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of customers or users or
potential clients or partners

01:16.970 --> 01:18.050 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

01:18.050 --> 01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they can
click around with it,

01:20.040 --> 01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
it does some basic
functionality,

01:22.040 --> 01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and it gets you some
idea of whether or not

01:25.700 --> 01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
you're on the right track.

01:26.930 --> 01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the best case scenario
is you have an MVP built,

01:29.900 --> 01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
you get it in front
of users, and they're

01:31.670 --> 01:33.260 align:middle line:90%
willing to pay you money for it.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
case of Instacart

01:35.540 --> 01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I was an early investor when
this company was literally

01:39.290 --> 01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
two drivers hired
off a Craigslist

01:41.600 --> 01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and you could open the
app, place and order,

01:44.180 --> 01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and then one of those
two Craigslist drivers

01:46.040 --> 01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
would get a notification
on their phone,

01:47.870 --> 01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
head over to the Safeway,
fill out your order,

01:50.600 --> 01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to
your destination.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.430 align:middle line:90%
 Hey, Chris.

 Hey.

01:53.930 --> 01:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:54.470 --> 01:55.580 align:middle line:90%
 Here's your groceries.

01:55.580 --> 01:56.120 align:middle line:90%
 Perfect.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was Instacart,
not even 1.0.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.610 align:middle line:90%
0.1.

02:01.610 --> 02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was the minimum viable
product that showed us, look,

02:05.900 --> 02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
this isn't just someone
who has an idea.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
Hey, grocery delivery
should be a solved problem

02:10.669 --> 02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
as easy as just using
your smartphone.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.362 align:middle line:84%
The thing worked
and that was enough.

02:15.362 --> 02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was enough to say,
great, here's some money.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's go build this into a
multibillion dollar business

02:19.790 --> 02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
one day.

02:20.290 --> 02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's special
when you're actually

02:23.630 --> 02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
putting something in a potential
investors hand that works.

if behind the scenes or Wizard

of Ozing it-- obviously,
don't lie to anyone--

02:32.360 --> 02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
but that difference of that
aha moment that a great MVP

02:38.120 --> 02:39.650 align:middle line:90%
provides is everything.

02:46.460 --> 02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
A founder today has
more and more leverage

02:50.930 --> 02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
than they did a
decade ago because so

02:53.390 --> 02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
many of the different components
of even getting a business set

02:56.240 --> 02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
up have been automated
or semi-automated

02:59.450 --> 03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
through software, or simply
just made more efficient, right?

03:04.430 --> 03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Even something like payments.

03:06.470 --> 03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
When we started right in 2005
and I made our first storefront

03:10.940 --> 03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
where we sold merch, it was a
very convoluted process just

03:14.810 --> 03:16.993 align:middle line:84%
to get a PayPal
button on the website

03:16.993 --> 03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
so that people
could make payments

03:18.410 --> 03:20.060 align:middle line:90%
that way to buy a T-shirt.

03:20.060 --> 03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Today, within seconds, you
can take a line of code

03:23.300 --> 03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and immediately start
accepting payments online.

03:25.850 --> 03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a powerful
change that has

03:29.690 --> 03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
made it so much easier
for entrepreneurs

03:31.490 --> 03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to get started and start
collecting revenue.

03:33.350 --> 03:35.223 align:middle line:84%
You don't even actually
have to write code

03:35.223 --> 03:36.140 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do this.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.670 align:middle line:84%

03:40.910 --> 03:41.720 align:middle line:90%
a prototype.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's just simply
being able to convince someone

03:45.350 --> 03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
to co-found this company
with you who can help build

03:48.830 --> 03:50.990 align:middle line:90%
the actual software prototype.

something with software.

so many of the best
resources for execution

your execution is successful

It's also making sure you're
working on the right things

and being really good at
prioritizing what matters most.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're talking
about improving a product,

04:52.620 --> 04:55.980 align:middle line:84%
there's 100 things you
could do at any given time.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
In software, we
prioritize these.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.643 align:middle line:90%
So, P0.

04:59.643 --> 05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask me, but we
start counting with zero.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the most important thing.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
P0 things on the product plan
are the most important things

05:07.170 --> 05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that need to get done
on the fastest timeline.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks out, we set
goals for the team.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Those are P0 items.

05:14.310 --> 05:15.690 align:middle line:90%
What about P1 items?

05:15.690 --> 05:16.530 align:middle line:90%
P2 items?

05:16.530 --> 05:17.550 align:middle line:90%
P3 items?

05:17.550 --> 05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Now you see a sense of
prioritization in the product

05:20.070 --> 05:20.580 align:middle line:90%
plan.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.372 align:middle line:84%
Everything that doesn't
make the cut there,

05:22.372 --> 05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
basically you'd love to do it,
but it's just not a priority.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
You want to remember it, but
not work on it right now.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We can use this actual
MasterClass as an example.

05:32.160 --> 05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
The P0 priority here is to
actually finish and launch

05:36.000 --> 05:37.170 align:middle line:90%
this MasterClass.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
The P1 would be the
marketing campaign

05:39.390 --> 05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that we do around the
MasterClass launch.

05:42.570 --> 05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
A P2 would be something
like planning an IG

05:46.020 --> 05:47.598 align:middle line:90%
Live on launch day.

This is the kind of thing
that would be a nice to have,

thing I can be doing

05:53.760 --> 05:55.385 align:middle line:84%
is the thing I'm
doing right now, which

05:55.385 --> 05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
is recording this audio

P1 items as well, are the
things that your team needs

06:11.250 --> 06:13.110 align:middle line:84%

that you, when you're just
thinking about what are you

06:15.360 --> 06:17.370 align:middle line:84%

the quality of the product

product improved

feedback, were in market,

07:18.290 --> 07:20.390 align:middle line:84%

testing the idea.

just execute so well
