00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Okay,

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.820
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.480
Never again.

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.950
Have a look at the sheet change event.

5
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.360
So again,

6
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.770
I'm added this workbook open thing by default just to let me to get to the procedure Drop

7
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.690
down box on from here.

8
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.070
I'm gonna choose sheet change so I can know safely delete this workbook open.

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.390
Okay?

10
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.490
This is where we're gonna be working in between the sub in the end sub here.

11
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.870
And I'm just gonna just by a simple message box and the message box is going to say you

12
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.350
change something,

13
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.160
close quote close brackets on my bare time measures box correctly.

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.440
So message box a go so message box,

15
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.390
you change something.

16
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.930
Now let's come back to here.

17
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.730
So so far,

18
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.200
so good.

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.650
I can happily click anywhere on this sheet.

20
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.680
But if I type something that effectively is a work book change and his enter,

21
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.790
you can see their little message box pop up that says you change something and literally

22
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.430
every time anything changes you can hit,

23
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.930
delete,

24
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.980
it will say you change something.

25
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.970
So there you go.

26
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.960
Now you may find a use for that,

27
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.440
but there is a much more powerful function that begin a commodity when we come on toe

28
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.740
worksheet events,

29
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.100
rather workbook events.

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.760
Okay,

31
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
