1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Okay,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,760
guys.

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,060
And welcome to this lecture.

4
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,720
Now,

5
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,430
whenever I meet someone that uses Excel,

6
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,340
one of my first questions is,

7
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,490
Have you learned how to program?

8
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,580
Now,

9
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,630
most people,

10
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,900
the immediate response would be Why would I need to learn how to program or the second

11
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,860
response would be?

12
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,220
Isn't it difficult?

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,590
Okay,

14
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,010
let's address them one at a time.

15
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,100
Where would you learn how to program?

16
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,590
Now,

17
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,820
if you have 1000 jobs that you need to do with Excel and every single one of those 1000

18
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,350
jobs is unique,

19
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,370
has no common characteristics,

20
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,210
and you'll never have to do them again.

21
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,520
There is absolutely no point in learning how to program,

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,870
because coding cannot help you in those situations.

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,560
But if you have 1000 jobs and excel and some of them you do every day or some of them every

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,350
week or some of them every month reporting is an excellent example.

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,410
Then you absolutely must learn how to program for three reasons.

26
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,650
Speed,

27
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,730
speed,

28
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,630
the difference.

29
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,290
You can get by automating a process using program in staggering,

30
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,920
which is the point of this lecture,

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,950
which I'm going to demonstrate as we go through it.

32
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,800
Accuracy No matter how hard we try,

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,270
humans will always make mistakes or if they don't make mistakes,

34
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,400
they are working at such a slow pace to ensure accuracy.

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,370
Then it would just gobble up your entire day,

36
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,830
and the 3rd 1 is reliability or repeatability.

37
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,280
If the tasks that you have are repetitive or you have to repeat those tasks,

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,760
it is begging to be automated.

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,890
With a little bit of programming a little bit of code in behind it,

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,000
you can make things fast,

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,870
accurate and repeatable.

42
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,790
Now the other concern that I mentioned was people think that it's difficult to program now

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:50,790
.

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,840
People of a certain age may remember a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer now in Buffy

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,890
the Vampire Slayer.

46
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,530
In this one particular episode,

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,490
Zander was having trouble getting a girlfriend.

48
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,340
Now Oz,

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,030
who was one of the gang played guitar in a band on Xander,

50
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,770
realized that chicks dig musicians,

51
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,830
as Xander said.

52
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,500
So Zander says to ours,

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,370
I need to learn to play an instrument.

54
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:13,760
Andi,

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,270
he says,

56
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,190
You play guitar,

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,650
he says.

58
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,150
Is it difficult to play guitar and all says not the way I play it,

59
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,070
which is a very poignant statement because I'm sure programming can be horrendously

60
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,990
complicated,

61
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,150
but not the way I do it.

62
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,630
So you're gonna learn to program the way Island program and you'll find that although it

63
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,950
may look complicated the first time you see it,

64
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,290
you will grasp this so easily.

65
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,450
You wish you had done it years ago.

66
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,350
Okay,

67
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,200
let's crack on.

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,840
Now here's a file that you'll be able to download,

69
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,680
and we're going to look at code in this a bit later.

70
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,700
But for the moment,

71
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,130
this is just to demonstrate that speed difference on the accuracy differences between doing

72
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,650
something manually on doing something in code.

73
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,180
Now what we have is an employee list in a particular format on what we have is employee

74
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,420
number,

75
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,760
name,

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,560
national insurance number and Dunnellon Elland until we get back down to employee number.

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,770
So we have employee number down to car Reg on.

78
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,830
There's our first record.

79
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,140
We have MNC triple 01 and then as we move down,

80
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:27,480
we have MNC triple 02 down to here and MNC triple 03 down to here on.

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,070
We have a total off 200 records.

82
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,690
Now imagine that you get this file from your head,

83
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,310
office or whoever and unique ticket.

84
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,950
And you need to convert it into a table so you can do V lookups from it.

85
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,930
Now,

86
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,110
I've already programmed this just to give you a demonstration of the speed difference.

87
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,980
But let's imagine for a second that we're going to be doing this manually,

88
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,800
so I'm moderately okay.

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,520
It excel,

90
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,030
and I reasonably know what I'm doing.

91
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,280
So I'm just going to start the timer on my phone and see how long this takes to do manually

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,280
.

93
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,790
So let's go.

94
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,670
Okay,

95
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,420
First thing I need to copy the titles,

96
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,740
so I'm gonna copy that number.

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,170
Could move to D one and I'm gonna hit transpose boom.

98
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,900
Okay,

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,270
there's my first record.

100
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm gonna copy.

101
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,690
In fact,

102
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,590
only use keyboard shortcuts from now on.

103
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,570
And I'm going to transpose that come down to hear record to down to record three control

104
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,310
and see back up to hear it,

105
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,580
right?

106
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,800
Click transfers,

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,750
Dan here,

108
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,700
record three dance record for control and say,

109
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,730
back of hair and paste at mistake Their control and said I meant to transpose right click

110
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,590
transpose.

111
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,430
Okay.

112
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,050
Down.

113
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,300
Teoh Andan emerges.

114
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,600
Click sundown to record four dance record five.

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,450
Copy.

116
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,800
Scroll.

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,330
Back up.

118
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,670
Right.

119
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,020
Click,

120
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,850
transposed and stop.

121
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,590
Okay,

122
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,670
42.78 seconds.

123
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm not gonna do the entire 200 records,

124
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,340
so don't worry.

125
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,650
But here we go.

126
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,210
We can see that we now have our titles across the top on.

127
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,390
We have each of our records in sequence.

128
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,200
So we have record one record 234 now,

129
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,930
at the moments let's assume we already have the titles in on.

130
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,340
We have four records in,

131
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,760
say,

132
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,500
took 2.72 point 87 seconds to do the titles.

133
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,910
And then we took 10 seconds a record.

134
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,620
Now you because I'm working at the top of the data.

135
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,070
Obviously,

136
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,010
it's quick to get from here.

137
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,190
Back up to here.

138
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,650
But imagine by the time we go,

139
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm only down to lying.

140
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,580
500

141
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,730
Let's go back.

142
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,240
Uh,

143
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,560
let's get to the thousands,

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:40,930
at least.

145
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,250
Okay,

146
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,800
so now I'm down to line one Sam's and on record.

147
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,820
I can't even see where the record is There again.

148
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,230
Goodness,

149
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,840
we're only up to M N.

150
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,360
C.

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,090
76 on we go down to 200 wasn't So we go down to 200.

152
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,040
So then we gotta keep scrolling down and copy and then coming back up to the top here,

153
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,510
right?

154
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,920
Clicking and transposing.

155
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,110
I think it will probably take longer than 10 seconds per record as we get further down the

156
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,460
list.

157
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,730
But for argument's sake,

158
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,150
let's call it 10 seconds per record.

159
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,820
So we have 200 records to do.

160
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,720
So let's because I'm useless at Mass unless I use Excel.

161
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,950
Let's say we took 10 seconds a record on we have 200 records to do.

162
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,070
Lips equals that times 200 boom.

163
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,110
33 minutes on 20 seconds.

164
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,350
So just so I can remember that I'm just going to put that in.

165
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,870
Yeah,

166
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,550
let me just copy them and pay special values.

167
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,980
I need to format it same way down a so format painter.

168
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,500
But don't dump,

169
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,880
say again if we were to do that manually on dure,

170
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,780
realize that we made a mistake.

171
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:03,010
So there is every chance that you could make errors while you transpose in 200 sets of data

172
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,010
.

173
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,450
But at 10 seconds per record,

174
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,660
it's going to take you 33 minutes on 20 seconds.

175
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,850
Okay.

176
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,920
Lets still eat this slop.

177
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,370
Now imagine that we had a piece of code that would do a similar thing.

178
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,810
Now,

179
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,630
I don't need No,

180
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,180
no,

181
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,190
I don't need to use my stopwatch on this particular one because I already have programmed

182
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,020
in the start and stop time.

183
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,380
And then we can quickly work out what the difference is.

184
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,380
So how long the toe code takes to run?

185
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,680
Okay,

186
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,190
let's have a look at the scope of this.

187
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,550
So we have 2800 lines of data.

188
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,450
We have 14 individual interests and we have 200 records,

189
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,140
each with 14 interest.

190
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,920
Andi,

191
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,930
it takes us 33 minutes and 20 seconds generously to do it manually.

192
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,880
So let's have a look how long that's going to take if we did it in code.

193
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,370
Now,

194
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,290
I don't need to use the stopwatch because I've already programmed in the start and stop

195
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,970
times for this.

196
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,580
And we can just do the calculation at the end to see how long it takes.

197
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,850
So let's go.

198
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,150
Okay,

199
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,770
we're done.

200
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,650
So now we have the table built.

201
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,860
So have employees name,

202
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,080
which is the employee name.

203
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,170
Sorry.

204
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,090
The employee number two number.

205
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:23,600
We have name to name national shows from massive insurance number andan London and all the

206
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,950
different things over here and we can see that we have this record.

207
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,640
MNC won hundreds kind of Phillips coming Phillips J T.

208
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,700
59 blab about Andi all the way down.

209
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,650
Let's just go down to the button to do quicksand.

210
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,050
Check.

211
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,160
So number 200 is Isla Collins and backups there Date they go.

212
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,250
Employee number 200 is indeed Isla Collins.

213
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,240
So manually that would have taken us 33 minutes and 20 seconds.

214
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,810
And here are my start and stop times.

215
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,740
I'm just gonna format these three cells to show us.

216
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,050
Chris,

217
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,540
we are that interested.

218
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,780
We're going to go to Allah's minutes,

219
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,400
seconds and milliseconds.

220
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
Some reason.

221
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,980
My screens having trouble update in Sligo.

222
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,860
I kicked off the code at 11 04 29.4 to 9 seconds on it.

223
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,200
Finished a little while later.

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:32,490
So let's have look equals that minus that one second on dpoint one millisecond.

225
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,710
So let's be generous and knock off the 10.1 milliseconds.

226
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:43,890
So that took one second to run compared to 33 minutes on 20 seconds.

227
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,630
If we were to do that manually,

228
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,140
OK,

229
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,350
so what's the difference?

230
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,250
So We've got 33 minutes.

231
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,300
Onda,

232
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,360
there were 60 sections it.

233
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,330
So we have 1980 seconds in 33 minutes,

234
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,850
plus the 20 seconds.

235
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:09,650
So we're talking 2000 seconds to do that job manually versus one second to do it

236
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,650
automatically using code.

237
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,800
So there you go.

238
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,310
How fast is it?

239
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:21,050
It's 2000 times faster on 100% accurate if you use it in code on.

240
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,480
That is the reason that you should learn to code.

241
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,380
Okay,

242
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,950
I'll see you in the next lecture.
