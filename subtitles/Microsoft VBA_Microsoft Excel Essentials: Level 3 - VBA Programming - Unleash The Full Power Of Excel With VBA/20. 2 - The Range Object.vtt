00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
Okay,

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.640
guys,

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:02.760
um,

4
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.670
welcome back.

5
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.660
And now we're gonna have a look at this block of code here.

6
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.450
So for all of these examples,

7
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.650
woman do I'm in sub mud.

8
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.870
01 the basics.

9
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.090
I'm just going to copy all of this here,

10
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.820
and I'm gonna paste it into here.

11
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.240
I'll delete it again later.

12
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660
Have left it here of just copied and pasted.

13
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.260
Now,

14
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.100
we'll know that if I hit this button now,

15
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.100
this particular subroutine will execute in full on as we have four separate lines of code.

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.620
Wrong There do is step through them now.

17
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.170
We haven't specified a hierarchy here.

18
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.670
So what we're working with is what we are looking at,

19
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.050
which is this sheet here,

20
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.210
this scratch sheet.

21
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.100
So I'm just gonna hit f eight on the keyboard,

22
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.050
which you'll remember from the debug menu is groups.

23
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.450
Where are we?

24
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.960
There we go.

25
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.690
Step into So then the press f eight.

26
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.580
All the green code is remarks.

27
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.030
So I'm just going to click here,

28
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510
and I'm gonna execute this yellow line of code,

29
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.350
so f eight they go.

30
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.570
So this ray knew this line of code range A five is air objects and we are using the method

31
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.460
select,

32
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.630
which fill enough.

33
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.950
Select it now.

34
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.930
That is just how to select a single cell,

35
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.550
which we've looked up before in the last section.

36
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.910
But we could also rank select a range of cells by using this syntax here,

37
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.240
the first cell a colon on the second cell.

38
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870
So when I hit F eight through that,

39
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.210
you can see that range.

40
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.750
A five to a 14 has been selected,

41
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.960
so our object can be a range,

42
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.470
not just an individual cell.

43
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.730
It can be arranged,

44
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.990
so the range a five to a 14 with the method dot select.

45
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.540
Now the next one that we have is selecting noncontiguous individual cells.

46
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.250
If I just hit f a through here,

47
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.540
you'll see that this has happened.

48
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.680
So object in this particular instance is the range A five noncontiguous cells are separated

49
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.040
by commerce or actually,

50
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.000
continuous cells can be separated by comes if you like,

51
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.300
so you could say a five,

52
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.390
a six and a seven.

53
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.950
But here we have the object is range a five,

54
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.930
B seven and C nine,

55
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.510
which you can see of being selected just here.

56
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.810
Finally,

57
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.440
we can select noncontiguous or contiguous,

58
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.940
arranges multiple ranges on.

59
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.370
If I hit F eight,

60
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.450
you can see here that the range the object in this instance is going to be the Range A five

61
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.280
to be five,

62
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.720
which is here a seven to see seven,

63
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.450
which is here,

64
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.950
and a nine to see 10 on.

65
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.920
We have used the method dot select,

66
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.070
so that is how you select the cells using the range object.

67
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.050
Now there's another way of doing this.

68
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.560
So far,

69
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.150
we've just looked at the range.

70
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.000
But there is another way of specifying a range and that issues in the cells object.

71
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.310
And that's what we're gonna have a look at in the next lecture.

72
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.750
So I'll see you that
