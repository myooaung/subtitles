1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
Okay,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:02,720
guys,

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,420
welcome back.

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,170
And then we're gonna have a look at the four.

5
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,360
Next loop.

6
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:06,830
Now.

7
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,110
Ah,

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,540
four.

9
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,760
Next loop is going to use a variable.

10
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,150
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to write the code,

11
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,230
and then we're going to declare the valuable so no se equals equals sub loop will begin the

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,050
more with loop for next.

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,920
His answer A few times I'm going to steal the code from here because we want still select

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,180
the start of the range.

15
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:29,770
Boom,

16
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,550
Andi,

17
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,560
Right of the tough Because I want this variable name to be usable in any subroutine within

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,300
this module.

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,550
I'm just going to declare the variables at the very top.

20
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,420
So you remember anything is declared here becomes available to all the subs in this

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,710
subroutine on.

22
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,720
I'm going to use the dim statement and I'm going to say dim my counter as interject because

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,990
we just moved using it to move through lines.

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,350
There is no cell.

25
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,520
A 1.5.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,710
There's a one is a two.

27
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,770
There's a three on that all inter.

28
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:10,280
Just so an integer only two bites of memory is the most efficient thing to use on.

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,230
That is the name of our variable My cancer.

30
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,860
Okay,

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,240
so,

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,050
back to our sub.

33
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:27,570
Let's come in here and we're gonna say full my cancer equals 1 to 10.

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,240
Well,

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,710
I'm gonna hit Enter and I'm gonna close this loop by saying next because for every four

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,550
that will be in next and now I have that.

37
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm just going to use this thing occurred in here again.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm a pace that in the middle.

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,850
Let's have a look at what that does.

40
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm going to step through.

41
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,950
A one has been selected for my cancer equals 1 to 10.

42
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,350
So if I hover of my counter,

43
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,030
you can see on our first situation It's worth one on were going from 1 to 10.

44
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,420
So active soldiers offset all the way through key clicking it my counters.

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:12,630
Net worth 57 89 Andi down Andi end because I came to reach 10.

46
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:20,320
So we offset 10 times the code in between the four and the next was executed 10 times on.

47
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,230
That's how you use a four next loop.

48
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,650
There is a slight variation on that which is a stepped for next loop,

49
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,590
which we're gonna have a look at next.

50
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,050
Ok,

51
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,650
I'll see you in the next lecture.
