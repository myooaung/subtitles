00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Okay,

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:02.760
guys.

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.630
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.930
And now we're gonna have a look at another use for the workbook open.

5
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.280
And that is to display a splash screen when the workbook opens.

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.950
Okay,

7
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.220
so I'm in this workbook and I've already chosen workbook,

8
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.790
and you can see by default we have the workbook open.

9
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.690
But now what we need to do is create a splash rings I'm gonna come to insert.

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.060
I'm gonna choose user form.

11
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.150
And you can say that we have a new object added under the fold of forms which is called

12
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.550
user Form One.

13
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.050
Now,

14
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.740
to change the caption in use of form one,

15
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.480
we're going to come to the properties down to here where it saves caption.

16
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.550
I'm just gonna type welcome,

17
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.160
exclamation point and enter.

18
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.920
And no,

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.760
what we want to do is add a message on the here.

20
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.280
Now,

21
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.950
if you cannot see your toolbox and you'll know it when you say it's come up to view and

22
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.520
choose toolbox if this box here isn't available And here are all the different things that

23
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.250
you can add to your user for what we're gonna do issues this one,

24
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.470
which is just a label and We're just gonna add a box here on.

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.950
But I didn't mean to double click.

26
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm gonna delete that,

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.040
cause I don't want to do anything with it on.

28
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.700
I'm gonna come back to here,

29
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.360
which is gonna let me view the object.

30
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.330
So here,

31
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.220
slowly,

32
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.860
double clicking.

33
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.280
I want to say Welcome to my jazzy spreadsheets.

34
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.290
Exclamation point on.

35
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.010
Now to change the text on this,

36
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.950
I'm just going to select the text on I'm gonna change the properties to categorized.

37
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.430
Now,

38
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.460
if you want to change the funds,

39
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.640
you can scroll down to here too.

40
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.730
The fund Let me scroll down a little more fund.

41
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.410
Choose this little the ellipsis here on here.

42
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.630
I can say bald on 16 and I'm going to say OK,

43
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.580
so now that's a lot bigger.

44
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.030
So I'm just gonna resize that form.

45
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.720
They goes,

46
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.750
that's going to be more appropriate on were slowly DoubleClick in here.

47
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.580
And then I want to change the color of the text and they're the color of the text lives in

48
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.950
in categories appearance and four color.

49
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.820
So they just click on here.

50
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.140
That's slightly out to shot.

51
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.830
Let's see if I can drag that up a little bit,

52
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.250
Bambi.

53
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.050
One a second.

54
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.530
Hopefully,

55
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.560
you'll be able to see that now a little bit better.

56
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.130
So I'm gonna choose Palace,

57
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.260
and I'm gonna choose red,

58
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.200
and you can see that our text is no gone red.

59
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.470
Now,

60
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.580
the last thing I want to do is send to this.

61
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.880
So I'm just gonna scroll down to behavior and you can see text align on in text the line.

62
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.590
I'm gonna choose center So they go.

63
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.660
That is our use of film built.

64
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.900
Now all we need to do in the workbook open is call.

65
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.520
It's now.

66
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.960
Remember,

67
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.370
if we go back to alphabetical,

68
00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.210
the first thing we see here is the name which is in brackets is called user form one.

69
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:10.070
So I'm just gonna come back to this workbook and I'm gonna say Use a form one dot show and

70
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.120
that's all I'm gonna say.

71
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.580
I'm gonna hit,

72
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.770
save on.

73
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.190
I'm gonna close that and I'm gonna close that.

74
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.840
Andi,

75
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.090
there's nothing we were looking at in the last lecture.

76
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.750
Okay?

77
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.950
And now I'm gonna open that file again.

78
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.080
I notice what happens.

79
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.910
There you go.

80
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.200
Welcome to my jazzy spreadsheet.

81
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.950
And the judge is not gonna be able to do any sort of speaking while it was entering the use

82
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.950
.

83
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.230
That isn't going to be able to do anything until they close this as can be seen by the when

84
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.580
you try to put the spreadsheet.

85
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.260
So here they close,

86
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.870
then everything's good on your away again.

87
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.350
Okay,

88
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.130
We're gonna have a look at this in a little more detail in the next lecture where we're

89
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.290
gonna also add a user log to this.

90
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.850
OK,

91
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.350
