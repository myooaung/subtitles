00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.920
guys.

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.810
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.420
So,

5
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.570
in a similar fashion,

6
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.440
what we gonna do now?

7
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.140
He's creates,

8
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.370
like,

9
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.750
three.

10
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.350
I'm just gonna slide three through in order.

11
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm gonna copy all the code for slide to away then Teoh here.

12
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.070
Copy.

13
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.650
Come back up,

14
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.550
sit up and just paste that in here.

15
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.320
Doesn't matter which order your subroutines appearing because they run order is going to be

16
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.540
determined at the top.

17
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.020
So now we're working on slide three and we're going to set the slide,

18
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.920
no matter in next number three.

19
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.360
So now we don't have to remember to change it here on Dhere.

20
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.700
Okay,

21
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.140
so far,

22
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.650
so good.

23
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.560
So now we have this.

24
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.000
We have the create a new slide in next room three.

25
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.960
Layer number two.

26
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.020
I'm going to stick with that.

27
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.490
We can add a logo.

28
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.700
That's perfectly fine.

29
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.280
And then we want what now?

30
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.450
What we want to see is this chart just here,

31
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.850
this profit foot by day.

32
00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.580
So let's go back to the code alternate 11 and I'm gonna change this to say profit by day.

33
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.310
The prophet rips.

34
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.550
Problem fits by.

35
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.500
I really can't type if I'm speaking to.

36
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.130
Okay,

37
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.880
so there we go.

38
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910
So whenever the title profit by day,

39
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.660
I'm gonna leave the formatting exactly as they are.

40
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.050
This part here we're not gonna need because what we're gonna do is just paste an image,

41
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.670
Onda,

42
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.410
we can we can talk around that image in the presentation itself.

43
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.220
But what we do need to do is add an image.

44
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.660
So what we're gonna do is come down to the base code.

45
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.850
I told you this was gonna be put like putting it together with let go down to the not the

46
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.240
and Text box Two images.

47
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.890
Here we go.

48
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.460
So we are going to pace an object to chart objects.

49
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.280
So that is this code just here.

50
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.880
So paste chart as bit map.

51
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.850
That is exactly what we want.

52
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.010
So we're working on slide three.

53
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.550
So here we've done all about ad in the cycle,

54
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.540
and then we're gonna pace new charts is a bit map,

55
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.490
so I can ram this code.

56
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.290
So there we have sheets sheet one on.

57
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.600
That is exactly what's called.

58
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.760
You can call this most Phoebe name if you want chart objects and this chart is called,

59
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.250
I'm just going to copy it from there.

60
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.920
This chart is called uncertain if 11 army.

61
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.770
This chart is called profit by day Charts,

62
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.570
charts copy,

63
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.710
picture PP,

64
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.320
slides on paste.

65
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.180
So let's run that code and see what it does.

66
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.250
Okay?

67
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.020
So I m not do on bomb,

68
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.190
bomb,

69
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.340
bomb,

70
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.460
bomb,

71
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.470
bomb They go.

72
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.500
That is our child.

73
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.370
Right?

74
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.680
Okay,

75
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.020
so we have a text box that lives behind it.

76
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.350
Now,

77
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.290
this is index number one.

78
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.930
This is index number two.

79
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.500
So next thing we're gonna do is a keep its NFL have a number of points instead of on Excel

80
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.500
.

81
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.130
What we need to do is delete chart number two.

82
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.390
So we have a bit of code that does the deleting,

83
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.340
I think text deleting,

84
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.950
deleting.

85
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.550
There we go delete a shape referred to by the index number.

86
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.850
And that's very useful because it is in next number two,

87
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.430
because it is the 1st 2nd I have done it again.

88
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.310
Control left 11 on power points.

89
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.470
Ah,

90
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.650
v b i them again.

91
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.770
So up to slide three on Dhere.

92
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.010
We're going to delete that second object.

93
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.910
So that's delete.

94
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.990
Uh uh.

95
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.490
Delete textbooks.

96
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:38.640
Textbooks Go on remnant andi that will delete that text box behind their for there will

97
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.740
just manually delete it by hitting delete.

98
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.560
Now.

99
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.570
So far,

100
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.370
that's that.

101
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.290
That looks great.

102
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.140
That centered.

103
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.650
But it's not particularly very big.

104
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.130
Perhaps we might wanna have that a little bit larger.

105
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.900
So let's just dragged on until it looks exactly exactly as we want it to look.

106
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.800
That's a bit better.

107
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.350
We could weaken.

108
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.880
See that?

109
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.150
Let's make it even big yourself.

110
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.030
So now we know that that is said the right size.

111
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.280
And if I just hover,

112
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.590
you can see these little crosshairs means it is now dead center.

113
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.020
So that is exactly where we want this chart to appear.

114
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.490
So I'm gonna come up to here on the right click on former picture.

115
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.350
I'm going to choose this,

116
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:29.260
and now I'm gonna choose size and we can see that the height is 11.65 centimeters and we

117
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.240
already know we have a really clever way of coping with that.

118
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.230
So what we're gonna do is change the size off this chart.

119
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.060
So it's come down to here and find the code where weaken do that.

120
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.120
So we're on images were on re sizing images.

121
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.180
There we go on.

122
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.850
We only need to do one of them.

123
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.010
So what we're gonna do is this'll One here will work with the height.

124
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.150
Copy that all the way back up to number three.

125
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.320
Andi,

126
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.050
this is it Doesn't matter when we delete the text box.

127
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.240
Weaken.

128
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.570
Do startle the beginning.

129
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.950
So now we have That was 50 in the test code.

130
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:16.670
But what we actually want to do with High Sabbath 11.65 So 11.65 times on we can use that

131
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.270
centimeter thing again.

132
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.430
Fantastic.

133
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.150
So that should make it precisely the right height.

134
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.590
Now,

135
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.660
the next in groups,

136
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.960
the next thing we need to do is learn where it is positioned.

137
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.960
So we're just going to click on the position box in in PowerPoint and I'm gonna come back

138
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.050
to excel.

139
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.100
Andi,

140
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.910
here we go.

141
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.250
Now we want to know the positioning code.

142
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.230
So back down here,

143
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.660
images re sizing,

144
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.070
positioning that we don't use the mso alignments.

145
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.690
Actually,

146
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.930
you know,

147
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.380
we could use the MSR alignment.

148
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.180
Let's let's let's try this.

149
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.760
Let's try the m s.

150
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.850
Align centers true and see what that does.

151
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:05.130
So way back rips the top number three on pace that underneath eso that should give us

152
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.340
exactly the right size and that should alone it in the center.

153
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.660
So let me just close this.

154
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.510
Don't save.

155
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.790
Let me just strike.

156
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.180
That s so it's full screen again for you on backup.

157
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.010
Sovereign order on.

158
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.550
Let's run that and see what it does.

159
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.120
Yeah,

160
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.540
that is getting annoying.

161
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.410
There some bum bum bum bum bump.

162
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.580
So there's our first.

163
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.740
Like,

164
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.300
there's our second slide on.

165
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.730
There is a perfectly sized third slide.

166
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.760
Fantastic.

167
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.820
Well risen through this,

168
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.180
right.

169
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.530
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're going to use light three to create Slowed for

170
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.530
.

171
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.020
Okay,

172
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.080
So you in the next lecture.
