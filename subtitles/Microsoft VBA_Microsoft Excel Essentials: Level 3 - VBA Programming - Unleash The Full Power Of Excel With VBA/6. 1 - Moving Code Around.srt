1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Okay,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:03,740
guys,

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,630
welcome back.

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,020
Now,

5
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,900
You'll recall when we executed this macro,

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,500
the one we were recorded a couple of lectures ago.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,800
What the macro did was it selected all the cells that contained formulas that resulted in a

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,290
number and letting just hit control.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,040
It highlighted all of the cells that match those criteria on.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,870
We then added a yellow color to it.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,550
But you'll recall that every time we had to rerun the macro,

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,210
I did something manually to removal.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,320
The highlight in on what I did was clicked up here,

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,850
selected all the cells,

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,400
came to here and chose no fell.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,340
So what we're gonna do now is record another macro.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,000
That does exactly that.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,580
And then we'll take a look at the code.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,620
So I'm going to come down to the button button just here.

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,650
I'm in the left.

21
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,660
Click on default list will leave it a macro one at the moment there because we've closed

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,660
and opened this workbook.

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,970
We are now back at Macro one again.

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm gonna skip the control of the shortcut keys.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,040
I'm gonna store it in this macro.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,540
Andi,

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,250
I'm just going to say clears formatting.

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,250
So clears formatting.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,490
Okay,

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,460
right now I'm gonna click.

31
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,950
OK,

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,370
now I'm gonna click up the corner,

33
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,390
which is going to select the entire shades.

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,850
I'm gonna come up to the Phil and I'm gonna choose no color.

35
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,780
And I'm just going to click a one Andi hit.

36
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,490
Stop.

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:32,980
Okay,

38
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,340
so alternate 11.

39
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,390
Let's go and have a look at our code.

40
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,840
Now you'll notice something has changed.

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,490
This was our original code toe.

42
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,030
Highlight my formulas,

43
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,450
which converted them all to yellow on that lived in module one.

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,740
But you'll never see because we've closed the workbook and reopened when we saved it as a

45
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,250
macro enabled workbook.

46
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,590
We now have a second module which is called module to.

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,330
So every time you close a macro enabled workbook,

48
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,680
when you reopen it,

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,590
if you record a macro automatically,

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,030
a new module will be added and you can probably spot the pattern.

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,780
The original one was called Module One and the 2nd 1 was called Module to,

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,350
and I'll bet you can guess what the next one would be called.

53
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,690
So let's have a look at the co generated in module to,

54
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,840
so I'm just gonna double click.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
And here it is,

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,930
Macro one clears formatting.

57
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,350
And here is the code for that.

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,930
Now,

59
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,670
what we're gonna do,

60
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,280
because we actually want tohave it in the same module,

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,930
is this.

62
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,850
We're just gonna double click module to come up to here.

63
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,220
Copy it.

64
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,150
Delete it on.

65
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,470
Come over here on underneath.

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,510
End sub.

67
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,200
I'm just gonna pace that in.

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,750
So now we have to subroutines in the first module.

69
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,410
Now,

70
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,500
just so you know,

71
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,750
if you have a blank module and you don't intend to use it,

72
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,150
you can just delete it.

73
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,310
So I'm gonna come to module to I'm going to right Click on.

74
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm gonna choose on.

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,600
That's not in view.

76
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,100
Terribly.

77
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,470
Well,

78
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,180
I'm gonna choose.

79
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,190
Remove module to and you'll get this little warning pop up.

80
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,380
Do you want to export module to before removing it?

81
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,050
If you say yes,

82
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,040
it will give the option to save a bass file dot be A s file,

83
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,440
which is basically a macro module code file.

84
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,710
But what we're gonna do is just say no because we read.

85
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,890
We're really not worried,

86
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,330
so OK,

87
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,570
now we have two sets of code.

88
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,040
We have the one that highlights the formulas and we have the one that highlights the

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,730
formulas.

90
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,900
So now I'm just going to come into macro one,

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,930
and I'm gonna change the name of that.

92
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,520
So I'm just gonna hit backspace.

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,950
I need to live.

94
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:56,310
Leave the sub in there banging the coolest clear formatting on your most It's of use.

95
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,570
Come.

96
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:56,900
Okay,

97
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,820
so c is capitalized and f is capitalized.

98
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,750
So let me just click on there on Let me flip back to here.

99
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,970
And they were going to run our to Mac Rose one after the other.

100
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,400
So we're going to go to developer.

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,060
We're going to go to Mac Rose,

102
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,990
and we're gonna double click Highline my formulas and you can see that I have formulas have

103
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,910
been highlighted.

104
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,460
I know.

105
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,980
I'm going to go back to Mac Rose and click clear my formatting,

106
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,360
and you can see that that clears the highlighting.

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,120
OK,

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,150
in the next lecture,

109
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,430
we're gonna have a look at stepping through the code so we can watch and execute one line

110
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,180
at a time.

111
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,940
Okay,

112
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,190
I'll see you in the next lecture.
