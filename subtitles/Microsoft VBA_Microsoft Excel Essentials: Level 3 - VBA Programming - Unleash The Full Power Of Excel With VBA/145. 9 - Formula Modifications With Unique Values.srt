1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230
Okay,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,570
guys from Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,110
So we've most ability,

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,480
unique list using this code just here on there.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,070
We want to be able to populate all the formulas a sum if formula to be able to calculate

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,020
the total profit against each of those individuals.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,410
Now,

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,780
what we're trying to get to here is this particular code.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,350
But there is a quirk.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,920
So let me just show you I'm just gonna write a play in all summit,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,070
which is by far the easiest way to get formulas written in code.

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,700
It's just write the formula record the macro hit F to hit ever hit.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,350
Enter and you done so here.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,960
We're going to say plain old some if I want to look in column B so column B comma.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,360
I want to look in the cell immediately to the right combat,

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,670
and I want to some g close brackets and fantastic.

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,610
And then when I double click to film that down,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,150
notice what happens?

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,080
Nothing.

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,910
Because when we build a unique list using the code we just used,

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,960
you'll know sis that it now say some some if BB extract and this is extract.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,140
So when a copy it down it's still looking at extract.

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,920
So what we need to do is modify this code even though we would think we could just recalled

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,650
the formula.

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,160
And we need to specify it in good old Excel speak.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,240
So we want to some BB our criteria lives in K u one on.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,550
We are going to some g enter now.

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,270
Sales person has no sales,

29
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,400
but when they copy that down,

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,770
that works beautifully.

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,610
Great.

32
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,050
Now we need to record a macro.

33
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,110
So recorder macro,

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,060
it's OK.

35
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,260
Hit f to hit.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,730
Enter.

37
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,110
Stop recording the macro.

38
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,010
Flip back to visual Basic editor Control.

39
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,710
And are,

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,020
which is keyboard shortcut to display the project Window Double click.

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm not interested in range.

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,180
J one All I am interested in is this code right here.

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,560
That is the formula in the B A.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,590
So I'm gonna close that,

45
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,250
and I'm gonna pasted under here when I line it up.

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,890
Megan,

47
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,190
you can see that this formula here matches this formula here.

48
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,090
Precisely.

49
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,740
So that is our formula.

50
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,060
That's how we built the formula part.

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,880
And then we have a really cool thing.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,050
Let me just scroll over so I can get that interview that should do it.

53
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,050
Okay,

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,270
so here what we have is the range K one.

55
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,030
Let's ignore the off sex for a second.

56
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,750
So we have k one to k one,

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,060
Excel down.

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,460
So that is this entire cell.

59
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,410
But because we want to write the formulas to the left,

60
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:42,710
we have also added an offset open brackets zero no rose minus one to the left.

61
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,050
So we are selecting this range,

62
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,450
but working with the offset that is where we're going to write our formula.

63
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,010
So I'm just gonna delete ALS that because I know if you noticed,

64
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,300
but in the notes,

65
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,310
let me just click off in the notes.

66
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,250
Whenever you pacer value using this code here,

67
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,720
the range must be empty.

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,690
So I'm just going to step through that code up to that point on notice.

69
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,600
What happens now?

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,810
Perfect.

71
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,150
It works beautifully.

72
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,920
Okay,

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,680
so I'll see you in the next lecture.

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Well,

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,610
we'll go through the rest of this code.

76
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,120
Okay.

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,660
I'll see you in the next lecture.
