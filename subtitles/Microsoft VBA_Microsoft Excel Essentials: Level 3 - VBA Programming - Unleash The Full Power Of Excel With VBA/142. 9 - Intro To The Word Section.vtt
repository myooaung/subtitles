00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.690
guys.

3
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.390
And welcome to this section,

4
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.810
though,

5
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.520
in this section,

6
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.290
we're just gonna have a look at a really simple way to automate word.

7
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.790
So what we have here is some data that you have seen before.

8
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.020
And this is the sales results from the northern region for January,

9
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.810
so just give you a quick demonstration.

10
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.620
What's gonna happen?

11
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.600
I'm just gonna kick click this rather pretty looking word button here.

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.160
Andi.

13
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.940
Boom.

14
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.700
There you go.

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.810
We have successfully managed to create a word document taking data that we've analyzed from

16
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.600
that table on building a personalized message.

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.710
Toe number one sales person.

18
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.510
Okay,

19
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.390
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're going to deconstruct exactly how we did that.

20
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
