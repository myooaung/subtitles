00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Okay,

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.210
guys,

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.330
um,

4
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.350
welcome back.

5
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.230
And now what we're gonna do is we're gonna extend the functionality of that end function.

6
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.060
So let's just click back here a second.

7
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.860
The end is effectively the same as hitting control on the arrow keys.

8
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.150
But what would happen if we wanted to do the thing that we do when we hit control and shift

9
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.150
?

10
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.560
So that way we get the whole of that line or here and down and we get the whole of that

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.640
line where we can do that in code to And that's gonna prove particularly useful if you want

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.730
to do something with an entire line or column of data.

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.340
Now here there's loads of remarks in here and again.

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.260
We have down,

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.710
up,

16
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.180
right,

17
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.950
on left.

18
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.000
But for a moment,

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.350
let's just have a look at what the record set the recorded macro does now.

20
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.550
Hardly surprising,

21
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.440
it says range.

22
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.740
A five dot selects,

23
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.840
selects a five and then we can see that we have the range object enclosed in parentheses.

24
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.030
We have what we're going to do.

25
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.360
We're going to say with the selection a five that is our beginning point range a 52 a five

26
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.360
,

27
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.170
the selection dot end,

28
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.510
which we just looked at and here we're going to say,

29
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.360
excel down.

30
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.010
So we're going to go from five down to here,

31
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.920
close brackets,

32
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.680
close brackets.

33
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.110
And remember,

34
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.460
this is a range,

35
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.910
so it's going to capture it all,

36
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.850
and then we're going to apply the method dot select,

37
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.440
but here a game,

38
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.850
because we have the range specified.

39
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.250
And then we're saying selection and selection.

40
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.160
We can just replace that selection directly and tell it what the range is here on what the

41
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.380
range is here and that's going to achieve exactly the same thing in half the amount of code

42
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.380
.

43
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.120
You know,

44
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.880
just as we looked at before when we looked at the end,

45
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.520
We don't have to specify in hard code what the start point is.

46
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.250
We can just say from the active cell,

47
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.330
So I'm just going to step through the first line of code so you can see what it does.

48
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.070
So there you go.

49
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.240
On there's a five selected on a five down.

50
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.850
I'm just going to click on a five again.

51
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.980
I'm gonna hit F eight and they ghost on exactly the same thing.

52
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.760
But if I clicked here and then came back to the code window and executed this.

53
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.430
That works because D seven was the active cell on.

54
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.020
We have the equivalent moves for up right on left.

55
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.550
Now,

56
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.990
when you may be thinking is what if I just wanted to capture all of that region.

57
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.620
Everything that's encapsulated by blank rows and columns.

58
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.060
Well,

59
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.670
we're gonna come to that in the next lecture.

60
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.250
Okay,

61
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.170
I'll see you That.
