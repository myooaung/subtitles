1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
Okay,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:03,600
guys.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,100
And welcome to this lecture.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,000
This is going to be short one on.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,470
What we're gonna do is look how to join up our code.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,930
So at the moment,

7
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,440
if we wanted to apply,

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
the said these highlights toe are formula sells.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,470
The first thing would want to do is clear all the formatting to make sure that all format

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,980
in his gum on Then apply the formatting code.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,050
Now these are the two bits of code that we currently have.

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,780
This is the highlight me which we can see highlights on this is the unroll like me which

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,300
unhygienic it's now.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,800
What we could do is make this all happen in the same subroutine.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,780
So one of them do temporarily.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,380
He's just put a few lines of code in there on between the end sub on the sub.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,690
I'm just going to take this code,

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,920
copy it and paste it up here and that the formatting looks a little bit ugly at the moment

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:57,920
.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:07,070
But they go basically so everything below this line is original code and everything above

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,780
this line is our new code.

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,460
So now if we had formatting frog was like,

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,330
let's just do call that in green and we wanted to underplay its men apply yellow toward the

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,710
formulas we could know Just hit this hit play on,

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,280
Boom!

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,940
All off that macro execute.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,370
So that's our first macro which have copied and pasted in here on our second macro,

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,680
which is the warmly originally recorded to color in the highlights.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,510
OK,

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,680
but there is,

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,020
um,

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,570
or elegant way of doing this or more practical way of doing this.

33
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:51,010
You remember from the Let me just under a few times you remember from the 15 golden rules

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,960
of coding that one of the things was to code simply on and in small chunks.

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,380
Now,

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,190
that particular demonstration,

37
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,670
we've still only got probably that doesn't lines of code.

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,850
So it's nice and easy,

39
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,990
and you can still edit that,

40
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,050
and you can still understand it when you look at it.

41
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,520
But there is another way to run one piece of code after another piece of code.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,950
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna code something completely from scratch.

43
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,200
So I'm gonna type sub because we're entering a new subroutine.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,300
Andi,

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm gonna cool it.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,170
Join these two together on notice.

47
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,850
What happens when I hit Enter automatically.

48
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,120
I get opening closed brackets after the title.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,820
Joining together on VB is automatically added an end sub for me.

50
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:52,110
So what I'm gonna do here is I am gonna call the other subroutines in this module.

51
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,420
So all they need to do to call the subroutine is one of two things I could type,

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,190
call and say clear.

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,030
Well,

54
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,450
I haven't finished yet on type clear format and in fact will type it in because you'll

55
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,930
notice that there subroutine clear formatting has a capitalized,

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,160
see capitalized F There was always good practice when you're typing something in

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,610
particularly names of subroutines or instructions such a cell's interior pattern and all

58
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,080
these kind of things type in lower case and notice what happens.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,750
Former Tink.

60
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,450
Now,

61
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:37,250
at the moment this says call with a C in lower case clear formatting with C in lower case

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,670
in the F in lower case,

63
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,900
but notice what happens when they hit,

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,820
enter or click off the line.

65
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,150
It automatically capitalizes this letter,

66
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,710
but it didn't capitalize this.

67
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,230
If you look closely,

68
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,210
you can see why what I'm actually typed here.

69
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,350
It is clear formatting,

70
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,890
which is not the same as clear formatting,

71
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,910
which is the name of this subroutine.

72
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,130
So always hoping in lower case is really useful because it helps you to spot those obvious

73
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,380
mistakes that you make.

74
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,550
So if I put on our in their men click off,

75
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,990
boom may go,

76
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,360
you can see that we have clear the capital C and formatting with a capital F.

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,640
So now we're just going to step through that code and notice what happened.

78
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,700
So I'm in this line on their press f eight.

79
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,260
So I am running the joint these together.

80
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,400
I am going to call the subroutine clear formatting and then notice what happens to the

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,470
highlighted sell.

82
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,580
Well,

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,030
no press f eight,

84
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,600
it immediately looks for this subroutine and jumps to it.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,740
So now I can just step through this subroutine,

86
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,150
his end sub,

87
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,060
and then my yellow highlighting joins back up to end sub on the subroutine.

88
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,560
We started in on F 81 more time finishes it.

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,530
So I said there were two ways of doing this.

90
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,460
One is to use the word call,

91
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,130
Andi.

92
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,140
The only reason that you can use word call is years ago you had to call a process or a

93
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,010
subroutine.

94
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,310
Now you can literally just type the name off the subroutine.

95
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,560
So clear formatting is our 1st 1 and highlights my cells was hello?

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,750
My formulas that highlight my form.

97
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,110
You last on when I click off,

98
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,670
you'll notice the capitalization they go.

99
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,110
So it no ties up with this subroutine eso Now,

100
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,350
when I run this code,

101
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,300
notice what happens.

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm going to step through F eight F eight clear format in f eight.

103
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,800
Jump down to the clear formatting subroutine.

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,480
Execute that.

105
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:53,050
Come back up to the highlight formulas Line F eight going Select the highlight My formulas

106
00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:00,780
subroutine Execute that all the way down n sub back up to n sub f eight Andi finish,

107
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,330
um,

108
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:01,780
a go.

109
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,290
That's how you join two pieces off code together.

110
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,660
Okay.

111
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,560
In the next lecture,

112
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,450
we're gonna have a look at a way to prevent users from running thes subroutines

113
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,440
accidentally.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,240
Okay,

115
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,650
I'll see you in the next lecture.
