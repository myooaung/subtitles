00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
Okay,

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.070
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.470
Now,

4
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.960
So far in this section,

5
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.520
you've learned some really useful pieces of code on what you've learned so far is gonna

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.030
able you to complete your first programming exercise.

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.730
Okay,

8
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.440
What we have here is a downloadable resource.

9
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.980
It is an excel file called the Rainbow.

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.850
Dr X L s X download that file.

11
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.640
When you open it,

12
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.650
you're gonna have a view very similar to that.

13
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.270
You're not gonna see this tab here because I'm gonna hide it.

14
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.170
You can.

15
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.690
Obviously.

16
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.790
If you get completely stuck,

17
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.150
you can,

18
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.320
um,

19
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.600
hiding and have a look.

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.750
So you will see this sheet.

21
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.510
The rain bone.

22
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.490
This is your program.

23
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.530
In exercise,

24
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.830
you are too.

25
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.550
Firstly,

26
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.950
insert a module.

27
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.320
If you're not sure how to do that,

28
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.410
go back and have a look at getting all the code for this section.

29
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.220
Have a look at that lecture in that Marshall,

30
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.180
you're gonna have a subroutine called Rainbow.

31
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.360
Now,

32
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.550
the first part of the code is going to be very,

33
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.420
very straightforward or we're gonna do Is out the texts Red,

34
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.140
yellow,

35
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.740
pink,

36
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.270
blue,

37
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.160
orange,

38
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.600
purple and green.

39
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.740
Two cells.

40
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950
A one through a seven.

41
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.320
Just plain text red,

42
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.600
yellow,

43
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.980
pink,

44
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.330
blue,

45
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.730
orange,

46
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.170
purple,

47
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.690
green.

48
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.800
And the second part of your code is going to need you to probably record a macro.

49
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.790
The next part of the code.

50
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.730
This part the code.

51
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.480
I want you to turn the word read into red.

52
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.850
I want you to turn the word yellow into yellow,

53
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.710
pink to pink,

54
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.510
blue to blue,

55
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.440
Orange to orange,

56
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.100
purple,

57
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.480
purple on green to green.

58
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.860
Now,

59
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.570
you know that some of these you condition shoes VB Andi,

60
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.700
the name of the color.

61
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.750
Some of them you cannot.

62
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.830
You gonna have to record a macro on retrieve the value from that recorded macro.

63
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.870
Highly recommend you record each one individually.

64
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.550
So if the V b and the color name doesn't work,

65
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.350
record a macro for that particular color.

66
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.640
Have a look at the code that's generated.

67
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910
Employ the bit that you need.

68
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.630
Okay,

69
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.830
that is your first programming exercise.

70
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.750
If you do get stuck,

71
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.400
the solution is here.

72
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.820
But this sheet is going to be hidden when you download the file.

73
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.370
Okay.

74
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.920
Good luck.

75
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.460
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
