1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Okay,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,850
guys from Welcome back,

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,490
right.

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,500
We already know there is a fundamental floor in Try and select a sheet using these sheets.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,530
Open brackets open,

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,900
quotes their tab.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,810
Name close quote.

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,530
Close brackets.

9
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,010
Dots,

10
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,520
elects.

11
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,350
That doesn't work if someone re names the tab.

12
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,190
But luckily,

13
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,420
visual basic or visual basic for applications has a way of dealing with that.

14
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:23,630
No,

15
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,210
to do it.

16
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,750
What we're going to need to do is go to the View menu and choose our Project Explorer.

17
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,690
So that is visible.

18
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,630
We're going to go to our view memory you,

19
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,510
and we're going to choose out properties window.

20
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm just going to resize those so you can see it now,

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,690
This file when you downloaded it.

22
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,590
If you look here,

23
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,190
you may have noticed something a little unusual.

24
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,630
We have all of our worksheet elements of here,

25
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,750
and these are all the objects.

26
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,650
This is the work book object,

27
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,070
and you'll notice that we have sheet one,

28
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,050
which is sales data she to which is looping sheet three,

29
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,220
which is scratch.

30
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,780
So you you'll Nobel toe workout that whatever appears in brackets here is what appears in

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,080
the tub name here.

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,820
But this one say something else.

33
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,040
It doesn't say she 12345 or anything else It says Tab,

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,950
my sheet,

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,450
which we now have in here because we changed in the last lecture.

36
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,600
But well,

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,040
front,

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,970
it say's my second sheet.

39
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:29,150
Now that is the visual basic name for this particular object on the way to change that in

40
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,110
your properties,

41
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:30,940
select the sheet.

42
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,100
You want to change the name off and in the name in brackets section just here,

43
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,650
just clicking here and call it whatever you want.

44
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,540
Now this is just an example.

45
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,210
So I've called it my second sheet just to make it easy to remember.

46
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,780
But generally my convention would be S h and then whenever I want to call it so technically

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:50,780
,

48
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,520
in a normal programming project for me,

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,050
this would be called shirt my second sheet or something like that.

50
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,150
So once you've renamed it,

51
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,600
just hit.

52
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,650
Enter on,

53
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,010
then that sheet permanently because has visual basic name of whatever you just called it.

54
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,930
So here,

55
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,070
let's test this code.

56
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,650
I need to be on a different cheek doing that.

57
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,760
Let's just test this code.

58
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,620
If I f ace through,

59
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,580
we no longer have a sheet with a tab name sheet to,

60
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,210
So that code is gonna era.

61
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,490
And so I'm just gonna delete that Now,

62
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,010
notice what happens now?

63
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,350
I'm gonna call it by its visual basic name.

64
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,930
It works.

65
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,190
So if I come back in here on rename and call it sheet to again and hit it whips or shot to

66
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,720
a site type there on I come back over here and I re execute that groups.

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,450
Not that code.

68
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,830
Alan in here and now execute that code.

69
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,950
It still works because the visual basic name is now hard coded to the object.

70
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,760
And by far that is the best way to reference your objects.

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,250
Okay,

72
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,600
Elsa,

73
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,650
you in the next lecture.
