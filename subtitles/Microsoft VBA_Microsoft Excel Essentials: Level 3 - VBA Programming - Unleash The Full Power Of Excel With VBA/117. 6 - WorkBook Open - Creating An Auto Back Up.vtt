00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Okay,

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.760
guys.

3
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.570
And welcome back.

4
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.420
And then we're gonna have a look at the most widely used workbook event function,

5
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.410
and that is the workbook open.

6
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.830
Now I use workbook open and the particular piece of code that we're about to look at on

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.810
anything that is mission critical because occasionally work sheets can corrupt and become

8
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.650
unusable.

9
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.770
And this gets around that problem.

10
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.080
So every time I have something mission critical,

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.970
the very first thing I do is add this to the workbook open function.

12
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.360
And here's the code that I use.

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.830
What we have here are four variables.

14
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.130
We have one that's called my backup folder on that holds the past to the backup folder.

15
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.290
I'll explain these have to go through it.

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.000
I have the might save file name,

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.950
and that is going to be a fall them that we're going to build dynamically at runtime.

18
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.300
I have a variable called my Date,

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.030
where we're gonna hold the date stamp on the variable called My Time,

20
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.770
which is going to hold the time stamp.

21
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.220
Now I have conveniently created this folder here,

22
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.860
which is called Backups on.

23
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.810
I'll show you how to read the past to that in just a second.

24
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.250
So what we have is my date on my date is a string that is built by looking at now.

25
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.550
Now,

26
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.760
if I just had an X up here on say equals now open brackets,

27
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.010
close brackets and just execute over that.

28
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.600
You can see that X holds the current system date on the current system.

29
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.240
Time.

30
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.990
Now what I want to extract from that particular string.

31
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.030
The now shrinking I want to go.

32
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.030
Seven cats is across on.

33
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.790
I want to extract four digits.

34
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.940
So that is going to give me the year.

35
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.670
I want to move across four characters and extract two digits,

36
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.530
and that is going to give me the month.

37
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.760
Then for the last one.

38
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.600
I want to use the no function and I want to return the to left most characters and then I

39
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.510
want a space at the end.

40
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.050
Okay,

41
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.420
So long does hit start hung and delete that on.

42
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.400
Then when we execute over that code,

43
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.180
Whoops a daisy.

44
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.740
Let's just hit f eight.

45
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.470
We can see that my days has never been returned as 2016 08 20 Which just happens to be

46
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.310
today's date now What we're gonna do is we're gonna stick that way up the front of air file

47
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.630
name.

48
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.450
So that way,

49
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.980
whenever we have to go into our backup fall that the latest version is always going to

50
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.040
appear at the top.

51
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.460
Now,

52
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.130
obviously,

53
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.120
we may have more than one of save or more than one workbook open event in any particular

54
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.520
day.

55
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.870
So for that reason,

56
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.400
I also use a my time.

57
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.750
No way using the time function.

58
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.770
And it's basically exactly the same thing that we've just done with this,

59
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.650
but with time.

60
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.310
So when they hit F eight,

61
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.760
we can see that the time is 11.

62
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.950
44 on.

63
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.760
They also add a space death dash space.

64
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.150
So that way we get the data front,

65
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.590
the time space dash space,

66
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.330
and then I just use the name off the current file.

67
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.730
Okay,

68
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.450
so I'm just gonna hit stop for a second.

69
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.200
This is a bit we're up to my backup folder,

70
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.280
which we've declared up here and said holds the past to the backup folder,

71
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.250
and this is where my backup folder lives.

72
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.600
Now,

73
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.800
if I come back to the backup folder,

74
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.160
the easiest way to get that is just a click in here.

75
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.950
Hit control and copy on that.

76
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.000
Says you just navigate your folder.

77
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.490
Click in the address bar on copy whenever it stays in there.

78
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.050
The only thing that you have to note is that the must be a slash at the end of your path.

79
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.420
The reason when you copy it from the address bar.

80
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.940
So just make sure you add this slash in there and here I'm going to build the file,

81
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.620
set the safe file name.

82
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.880
So I'm gonna have my date on my time on do whatever the current name of this workbook is.

83
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.290
And then here is where we save a copy.

84
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.290
This workbook don't save copy as file name equals.

85
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.620
Have to specify away.

86
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.090
It's going to go which has been read from this variable on.

87
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.450
I have to call it something which has been built from this string just here.

88
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.790
So I am just gonna close that I'm gonna close this file.

89
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.850
Do we want to save?

90
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.140
Yes,

91
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.010
I do notice that there is absolutely nothing in my backup folder here,

92
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.680
so I'm just going to reopen the file on any second now that will reopen.

93
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.970
And now I'm never going to navigate back to my backups.

94
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:32.020
And you will see here that we now have a new backup called 2016 08 2011 45.

95
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.850
Which is the point at which I open the file on day.

96
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.460
It's called workbook events,

97
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.050
which is exactly what this particular workbook is called.

98
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.800
Okay,

99
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.490
so that's how I use the workbook open.

100
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.810
Let me just navigate back to excel on Dalton after 11.

101
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.950
Where's it going?

102
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.420
There is.

103
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.050
So that's how I use the workbook open.

104
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.080
You can.

105
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.110
If you're particularly cautious,

106
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.980
you could also add exactly the same code to the workbook.

107
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.890
Close on.

108
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.250
That would make sure that everything is created as a backup before the workbook is closed.

109
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.970
Okay,

110
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.210
I'll see you in the next lesson where we're gonna have a look at using the word book.

111
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.630
Oak broom routine the game,

112
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.050
But this time to display a splash screen.

113
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.720
Okay,

114
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.110
I'll see you in the next lecture.
