00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.840
guys.

3
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.790
And welcome back,

4
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.330
right?

5
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.190
Never can have a look at this one.

6
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.420
Which is the You might pick this on genitals and f 11.

7
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.780
I'm double clicking sheet 11.

8
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.570
You might pick this on,

9
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.650
come to here and pick worksheet on the game.

10
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.880
We're going to choose the activate some scroll way upset up and pick.

11
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.580
Activate,

12
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.020
and no,

13
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.360
I can delete this.

14
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.100
Now.

15
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.490
Whips,

16
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.780
as you may well know,

17
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.980
each of the worksheets within a workbook has an index number.

18
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.240
So the very first sheet in the order in which they appear will be sheet one.

19
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.570
The second sheet is sheet to and on and on and on until you get all of the worksheets.

20
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.180
Okay,

21
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.710
so the first England do set up a variable.

22
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.900
So say DMX is into Jim introduced into jump.

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.920
There we go on never don't want to do is I want to capture the number of work sheets that

24
00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.980
are in this particular workbooks on to say X equals worksheets dot groups dot can't.

25
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.300
And if i f eight over that and hover over X,

26
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.920
you can see that we have what,

27
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.270
14 worksheets in this particular workbook.

28
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.950
Ok,

29
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.010
so now we know how Maney worksheets we have to play with The next thing we're gonna do You

30
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.680
say sheets open brackets now,

31
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.920
rather than calling the sheep bites VB name or its tab name,

32
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.840
we're gonna call it by its index number.

33
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.160
So we know that there are 14 sheets or what we want to do is randomly selects a number

34
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.060
between one and 14.

35
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.080
And for that,

36
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.720
we're going to call the worksheet function Rand between which I'm sure you're familiar with

37
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.840
some there saying application don't.

38
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.670
We're sheet on worksheet functions.

39
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.180
They go.

40
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.760
Don't try not to leave Spaces Allen around between because that's what we want to do on our

41
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.470
lower bound is one on the upper bound is a number of worksheets that we've just counted.

42
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.290
So x on the close brackets on the close brackets.

43
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.700
So I'm gonna hit dot select so well,

44
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.740
that's going to do on the worksheet activate.

45
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.820
So when the user clicks on the tab is gonna count the number of worksheets we have randomly

46
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.950
pick a number between one and however many sheets we have and select that cheat.

47
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.140
So we have a one in 14 chance of clicking this button and actually ending up on the sheet.

48
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.100
So let's give it a go.

49
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.390
No,

50
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.820
that most definitely didn't work.

51
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.630
We went to workbook Change one.

52
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.830
So you might pick this?

53
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.270
No,

54
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.180
we went to this one.

55
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.810
So if you fancy playing up one of your colleagues,

56
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.450
drop that into one of their worksheets and you will have endless fun.

57
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.670
Only kidding.

58
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.630
Please don't do that.

59
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.910
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
