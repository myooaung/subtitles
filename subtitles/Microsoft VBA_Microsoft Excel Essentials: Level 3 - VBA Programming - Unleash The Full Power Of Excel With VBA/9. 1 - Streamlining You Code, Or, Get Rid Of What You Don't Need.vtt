00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
Okay,

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.760
guys,

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.510
we're progressing nicely now because I can't recall what this code look like.

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.080
Originally,

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.280
what I'm gonna do is re recalled that macro just quickly so we can at least get a view of

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.410
what it used to look like.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.630
So I'm just gonna hit the record macro.

8
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.350
Choose macro to are not gonna bother with anything else.

9
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.220
Select all the cells,

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.370
go to home,

11
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.330
go to fill new film on click.

12
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.100
I think I chose that Self ons stop.

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.730
Okay,

14
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.010
so we have our code and window here,

15
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.160
but we can't see our project,

16
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
and you can see that it doesn't appear in this one.

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.370
So long and do temporarily is go to view.

18
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.100
I am going to go to Project Explorer,

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.730
and you can see that that we have module to I'm just gonna double click laughs bomb,

20
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.040
bomb,

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.030
and they go macro to that is what the code looked like.

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.720
Okay,

23
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.800
so I just complete that from next.

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.650
I'm not really interested in keeping it just for reference.

25
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.480
I'm gonna pay step below,

26
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.260
so I'm just going to say,

27
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.370
uh,

28
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:17.680
this is what it started like means nothing.

29
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.780
We're gonna delete it in a minute.

30
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.190
anyway.

31
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.800
But just so you can see,

32
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.070
this is where we started.

33
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.400
So at the moonless just get rid of these remarks.

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.690
So at the moment,

35
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.180
on the clothes,

36
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.800
that right.

37
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.130
Okay,

38
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.900
so at the moment at the recorded macro has the sub in the end sub which absolutely Chris

39
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.090
Cole,

40
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.450
there's nothing you can do about that.

41
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:44.410
On we have 1234567 lines of executed will code.

42
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.740
And we did a bit of stream lining up here with what we learned that with what we learned to

43
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.550
the top things that didn't actually have any effect.

44
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.350
And we just deleted them out.

45
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.270
Eso No,

46
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300
we're down from seven infection.

47
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.750
That bacon note that wanted to 34567 So I'm just gonna come in that so he at the recorded

48
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.630
macro has seven lines of code on at the moment,

49
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.570
we may should bring it down to on 234 In fact,

50
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.250
I think we we did even more than that,

51
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.520
I think we Yeah,

52
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.530
we bought that down to one light of code.

53
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.650
I think I didn't say they're from Bom Bom Bom bom bom.

54
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.200
Delete the space.

55
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.360
Delete the end with?

56
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.660
Yeah,

57
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.820
I think that's what it looked like the end of the last lecture.

58
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.600
So we've come down from seven lines of code 2123 lines of code so instantly,

59
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.350
the code is going to be mawr than twice a faster the original recorded macro.

60
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.070
Now,

61
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.060
if we clocked these,

62
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.250
I I think the answer is there going to be in milliseconds,

63
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.570
But so here we have this,

64
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.850
currently sitting at three lines of code,

65
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.050
but we confer that,

66
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.410
rationalize this code and make it even more streamlined if we look at the end off this line

67
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.550
and the beginning of this line,

68
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.350
So let's just step through and understand what happens here.

69
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.510
So I'm just gonna press in this code.

70
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.780
I'm just gonna press f eight.

71
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.650
So we are on sub clear format in cells.

72
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.750
Select.

73
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.130
So the first line of code selected all the cells on the workbook select all their cells in

74
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.950
the sheet.

75
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.050
Okay,

76
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.740
The second line of code say's with that selection.

77
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.450
So whatever we have selected above,

78
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.650
what I want to work on is the interior property on off the interior property.

79
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.330
I want work on the pattern property and set that property to excel.

80
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.070
Non.

81
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.050
So what?

82
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.750
We hang sleep.

83
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.940
What?

84
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.710
We're actually doing these two things.

85
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.400
We are selecting the cells on Ben.

86
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.970
We're gonna act on that selection.

87
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.440
But what would happen if we deleted the select on just hit delete?

88
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.200
Andi kept Hissene delete eventually that will move up.

89
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.520
Andi just bought in cells dot selection dot interior pattern.

90
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.880
In fact,

91
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.670
I think we'll even go further than that.

92
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.700
I think we can just say cells.

93
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.990
So let's say cells,

94
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.670
which appears to select all of the cells dot interior Doc Patton equals X l numb.

95
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.180
I'm just gonna hit.

96
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.850
Stop.

97
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.550
I'm just gonna f eight through there.

98
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.170
I need to call.

99
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.350
Really?

100
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.470
Um,

101
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.240
first Don't know so we can see what it's doing.

102
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.820
Let's just play this one bump.

103
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.210
There you go.

104
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.340
So we have things.

105
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.550
So here,

106
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.270
one line of code as ultimate,

107
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.160
if I just step through that way too quickly,

108
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.090
color them in our right.

109
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.380
Okay,

110
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.120
so in this section,

111
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.170
I'm gonna hit F eight clear formatting cells.

112
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.090
That is all of the cells.

113
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.560
The interior off those cells,

114
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.520
the pattern of the interior of those cells Change to excel.

115
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.940
Mum on that notice what happens over here in the spreadsheet F eight.

116
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.800
Step through.

117
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.920
Bang,

118
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.570
they go.

119
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.870
Absolutely.

120
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.800
All the cells have been unhygienic than my final instruction range a 12 e one as

121
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.540
interesting Because of here we had range 016 near the reason for that.

122
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.780
Let me just screw over here is that this is emerged cell.

123
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.880
So it's actually merged across a to e.

124
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.260
But that's very useful,

125
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.590
cause that shows us how to highlight a range.

126
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.150
So let's make a note of that.

127
00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:03.150
Highlights a range off cells.

128
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.230
They go now we're going to be very shortly creating our macro book.

129
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.740
Andi,

130
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.760
let me just have eight.

131
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.440
We're gonna be created our macro book and all these useful bits of code these things that

132
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.880
we learn,

133
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.550
and we're gonna stall them all there.

134
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.420
So you never have to work out how to do it again.

135
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.030
Because although you may be able to record a macro again in a year's time,

136
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.410
you're still gonna have to go through the process and look at it in.

137
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.950
Try and work out what it does.

138
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.090
So your macro book will become your Bible.

139
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.430
So you'll instantly be able to see exactly what each of the instructions does.

140
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.680
So let's give those a quick test.

141
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.110
This one coolers in Boom and they go.

142
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.620
We're calling in on this one,

143
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:52.090
which is now down to two lines of code so we can clear the former Wouldn't get rid of that

144
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.090
.

145
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.540
Uh,

146
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.890
and that pretty much We don't need to have two in there.

147
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.490
We will say what it does.

148
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:10.260
Clears the formatting on pull off the sounds in the sheet boom.

149
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.840
Okay,

150
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.470
so we actually originally in our recorded macro,

151
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.820
we had seven lines of code.

152
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.940
We had cells and select.

153
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.230
And then,

154
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.400
with that selection,

155
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.970
we worked on the interior property on off the interior properties.

156
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.000
We worked on the pattern.

157
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.520
Then we worked on Tintin Shade.

158
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.760
Then we worked on patent into in shade.

159
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.910
Then we finished with our end with and then we selected are start range.

160
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:40.190
But he had we brought it down from seven lines of code to two lines of code,

161
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.400
which no means when we execute that it's over three times fast.

162
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.210
That thin the recorded macro version.

163
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.270
Okay,

164
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.150
I shall see you in the next lecture.
