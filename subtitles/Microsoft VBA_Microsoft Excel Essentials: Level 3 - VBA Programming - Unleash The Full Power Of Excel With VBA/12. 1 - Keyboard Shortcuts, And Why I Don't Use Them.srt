00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
Okay,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:03,740
guys,

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,780
welcome back.

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,180
Now you'll remember.

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,500
And you may well have noticed that when we recorded Mac rose up to know we had the option

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,520
to enter a keyboard shortcut,

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,460
and I normally just skip over it on.

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,050
The reason for that is a lot of the keyboard shortcuts are already taken,

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,660
particularly if we just look at the control on letters.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,120
So looking at the list here,

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,220
we can see the A B,

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,770
C D E f G h i k n o P r S,

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:31,990
T,

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,260
u,

15
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,490
V,

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:32,990
W,

17
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,330
X,

18
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,110
Y and Zed are already keyboard shortcuts in Excel.

19
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,780
Now,

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,510
if you were for argument's sake,

21
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,930
to record a macro on,

22
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,850
assign a keyboard shortcut of control and P,

23
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,980
your control and P would always execute Your macro would never bring up the print dialog

24
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,090
box again.

25
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,350
So this is why normally avoid using keyboard shortcuts.

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,340
Plus is also a very good chance that even if you picked one that wasn't on there so we can

27
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,130
see that we have a gap between D and F,

28
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,260
which means control and e may well be free,

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,470
so we could easily assign the macro to control Andi e.

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:20,130
But in a year's time would really remember that this particular keyboard shortcut control

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,710
and e triggers this particular macro because within a few weeks you will have built dozens

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,560
of these things I can almost guarantee you are not going to remember them all.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,560
So the best ways to run them are either from buttons from pictures or alternatively,

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,260
from workbook events.

35
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,270
And we're gonna have a look at all those in the upcoming lectures.

36
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,540
But for now,

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,210
this is the reason that I don't use keyboard shortcuts.

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,160
This less is a downloadable resource.

39
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,940
If you do intend to use keyboard shortcuts over,

40
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,930
suggest you print this out on,

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,070
then scribble on here the ones that you do a sign.

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,720
OK,

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
