00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Okay,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.620
guys,

3
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:02.730
um,

4
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.590
welcome back.

5
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.000
Now.

6
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.790
We're gonna have ah,

7
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.050
look at a worksheet change event.

8
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.760
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come Teoh here on I'm gonna Which I forgot.

9
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.420
We cheat room.

10
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.740
We're in the guard cheese.

11
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm gonna come to the guide sheet.

12
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.880
Double click it on now.

13
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.590
I am in the work sheet area.

14
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.990
I'm gonna choose worksheet on this summer.

15
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.610
I'm gonna come up to here on I am going to choose the change events and now I have private

16
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.510
sub work.

17
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.220
She changed by vow target as range Man.

18
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.270
We have not looked at the options that come in the brackets or the parentheses earlier,

19
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.890
so we're just gonna have a quick look at them now on.

20
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.060
The key thing that we're identifying here is a target as range.

21
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.840
So whatever the target is,

22
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.090
it is going to be stored as a range,

23
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.450
and we're gonna use that now.

24
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.730
What we're gonna do is very simple.

25
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.620
We're just going to say message box on day.

26
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.580
We're going to say,

27
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.550
hey,

28
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:11.670
on what we're going to say you just changed something on and actually no will to say Hey,

29
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:22.160
you just change cell space quotes on and we're gonna say target dot address and we're going

30
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.850
to say a Phoebe.

31
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.860
Okay.

32
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.760
Only Andi whips better pro title in their comment,

33
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.150
Did you?

34
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.900
I like to capitalize this.

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.320
Did you mean to do do that and close Andi enter?

36
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.070
So now when we come back,

37
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.410
Teoh the shirt guide,

38
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.280
this code will execute So here I can happily click around is perfectly happy.

39
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.130
But if I type Hello,

40
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.970
I get this little pop up message here.

41
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.310
It's exactly the same to do them workbooks,

42
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.520
But now it's specific to this particular sheet.

43
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.550
So it'll know say,

44
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.750
hey,

45
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.700
did you mean to do that?

46
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.510
You just change.

47
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.100
Sell a five night click,

48
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.680
OK?

49
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400
And if I delete that will get the same message says,

50
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.720
Hey,

51
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.410
you just change.

52
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.550
Sell a five.

53
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.590
Okay.

54
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.880
In the next lecture,

55
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.740
we're gonna have a look at something much more powerful on.

56
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.360
Basically,

57
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.790
it's gonna be a piece of code that's available on the markets off website.

58
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.400
I highly recommend you go and have a look at it on.

59
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.390
We're gonna butcher that to do something really useful.

60
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.020
Okay,

61
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.390
I'll see you in the next lecture
