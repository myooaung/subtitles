00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
Okay,

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.720
guys.

3
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.390
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.780
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.290
Now,

6
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.110
this is the second part of a question from Karen.

7
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.770
The first part answered in level two,

8
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.300
which was around using villa cups to pull images.

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.850
So rather than just pulling the text out of a table,

10
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.850
it was actually pulling an image.

11
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.160
Now,

12
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.750
this is part two of the question.

13
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.300
Karen has a database,

14
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.750
a huge data set that she needs to use to create individual PD APS.

15
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.120
Now,

16
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.500
those pdf's contain images.

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.020
But as you will probably know,

18
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.550
if you add an image to an excel worksheet,

19
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.060
it increases the size significantly.

20
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.120
Now imagine if you act had had to add 1000 images,

21
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.850
then you work.

22
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.800
She's gonna become so you just gonna be unusable.

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.230
So what we're gonna do here is we're going to use this day to table that we're looking at,

24
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.490
and we're going to specify a path to a picture,

25
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.350
and then we're gonna pull the picture at runtime.

26
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.280
OK,

27
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.150
so a quick word on the set up here.

28
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.050
What I have is a few tabs to get your code here,

29
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.400
where all post the finish code and you can just paste that into a module,

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.910
there'll be a few downloadable Resource is from this lecture that with this spreadsheet

31
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.550
sequential PDF creation with pictures.

32
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.690
And they'll also be the pictures that are currently living in this location.

33
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.860
And just say your name.

34
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.650
These are those pictures on They all have the same name as the unique Identify IRS here.

35
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.310
Now,

36
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.480
if your pictures have a different name than,

37
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.850
obviously,

38
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.580
just specify the name of your picture in another column,

39
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.130
but be sure to add the extension.

40
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.460
So if there j pegs dot j p e g.

41
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.150
Okay,

42
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.260
so a note on the pictures,

43
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.540
especially if they all have the same aspect ratio now all of my pictures of 300 by 300 more

44
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.090
real s,

45
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.530
but we're going to scale them to make them fit in the template.

46
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.110
Okay,

47
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.750
so we have this sheet here.

48
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.640
We have that.

49
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.940
This is what I want.

50
00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.300
No,

51
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.890
If you have 1000 records in here,

52
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.210
it could be that you don't want to create pdf's for all 1000.

53
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.310
So that's why I always use a list like this,

54
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.020
and we can just have the ones that we want to do.

55
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.750
Hit the cone or generate them.

56
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.290
Now,

57
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.080
the other sheet.

58
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.940
Is this the template?

59
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.480
Now what I'm gonna do to find that web print,

60
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.900
borders would bay this can hit control MP and then come back and you can see that we have

61
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.600
this dotted line here and I'm gonna use that as a guide.

62
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.450
So I know how big to make my picture.

63
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.070
Now,

64
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.280
this is very crude.

65
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.490
Number C at the finished result that Karembeu but that Cameron will be working on will be

66
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.840
much more sophisticated,

67
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.450
I'm sure,

68
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.980
but this is just for the purposes of illustration.

69
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.810
What we have here is the unique identify which we're gonna pull from this list on.

70
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.280
What we have here is just a basic V look up,

71
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.240
which is looking up the first name from the data sheet.

72
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.400
And here Avi,

73
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.450
look of looking at the second name from the data sheet.

74
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.050
So they're they're essentially a couple of bits of code that we're gonna need to record.

75
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.110
What we're going to need to do is record a macro to add a picture,

76
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.650
and then we'll modify that.

77
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.270
We're going to record a macro to say of a pdf on,

78
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.830
then we'll modify that.

79
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.770
And then we need to record a macro to delete the picture that we've just placed.

80
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.570
Because obviously,

81
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.760
when we go through the next iteration,

82
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.510
then we're gonna want a new image there and not just stack the images one on top of the

83
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.750
other.

84
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.360
But first,

85
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.490
a quick notes on the set up of of what this looks like in V B A.

86
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.150
So I'm just gonna shrink this in for a second on bring you over to I think that should do

87
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.260
it.

88
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.670
Actually,

89
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.940
they get So I've actually added VB names for some of the sheets.

90
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.830
So the data sheet here it's called shirt data.

91
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.520
The shut my list where the ones that were going to generate here is called Shirt.

92
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.340
My list on the template is called shirt template.

93
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.590
Now,

94
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.670
that way I can call them by their VB names.

95
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.800
So first things first,

96
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.580
let's let's let's just record the shell of the code.

97
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.600
So I'm gonna insert a module.

98
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.460
I'm gonna give myself a couple of lines so I can declare things above.

99
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.700
I want to call this sub get get data.

100
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.500
So that will,

101
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.810
Dave,

102
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.380
on what?

103
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.070
This is gonna be well look at this one to call it a fight based Phoebe a name.

104
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.470
Anyway,

105
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.620
what we want to do is do while we're gonna call it based Phoebe Names,

106
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.610
so shit,

107
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.180
whatever Called it Shut my list.

108
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.050
Ship my list.

109
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:42.230
Dots range open brackets A to don't value doesn't equal blank loop.

110
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.570
So while this value here in a two doesn't equal blank,

111
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.140
this loop is going to continue to execute.

112
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.570
Now,

113
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.370
what we're gonna do is capture the data.

114
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.870
So this is RV.

115
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.660
Look of value.

116
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.010
This C s one hears on and do you say on my item equals and I'm just gonna put zero for a

117
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.580
second,

118
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.520
because that is exactly what I want to capture their so that I'm just gonna copy and paste

119
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.140
it inside.

120
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.250
Just test that code from bomb bump and you can see that we captured CS one there.

121
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.780
So far,

122
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.290
so good.

123
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.890
Now,

124
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.750
what I'm gonna do is declare this valuable at the top because I'm gonna pass it to the

125
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.670
other subject we're gonna record in a second.

126
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.460
So hopes dim that as stringing on while I'm here.

127
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.680
I'm gonna say dim my path as stringing they go.

128
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.950
This will be fully rammed by the time you download it.

129
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.570
Now,

130
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.050
here.

131
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.690
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use this my item that we've captured to capture this path

132
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.090
here.

133
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.510
Now,

134
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.820
we'll see if you've got a bunch of different past you as long as you specify them against

135
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.430
the correct entry that all your pictures don't have to sit in the same directory.

136
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.400
They can be all separate Notice,

137
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.570
though,

138
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.750
that we have a slash at the end.

139
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.750
So here,

140
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.300
I'm gonna say,

141
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.100
What did I call it?

142
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.670
My path equals,

143
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.850
Say application.

144
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.550
Don't cheat function.

145
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.140
There we go.

146
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.680
Rips left cheek function.

147
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.520
Don't V look up open rackets.

148
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.940
Now,

149
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.650
I've already captured the Let me just make them a little bit bigger.

150
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.090
I've already captured the look of value as my items.

151
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm going to say my item Comma on now,

152
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.380
this is where we want to look.

153
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.980
We want to look in shit.

154
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.630
Data don't range.

155
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.320
I'm just gonna hard coded this,

156
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.950
But obviously you can use current region if you need to.

157
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:54.630
On the data sets from A to A to to I think it's d six groups strengthening a bit two d six

158
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.630
.

159
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.550
Yet so bumba woman.

160
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.400
All of them from a to two d six.

161
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.710
Andi,

162
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.620
that's our range.

163
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.400
I want to pull from column four.

164
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.820
So 1234 That's going to give me my path cover.

165
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.680
And I want an exact match.

166
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.280
False.

167
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.920
And so they go that Let's just test that s o bump my item.

168
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.680
CS one my path.

169
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.250
And there we have the path that export from their use in the look up.

170
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.120
Okay,

171
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.560
so so far so good.

172
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.150
Now,

173
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.300
at the end of this loop,

174
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.780
I'm just gonna listen.

175
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.000
No,

176
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.350
but I'm not going to execute it.

177
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.250
What I want to say is shut my list A to copy.

178
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.480
I'm just gonna pace that in there.

179
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.530
What?

180
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.870
I want to do that saying,

181
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:45.880
got entire row dot Delete On that way,

182
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.210
Once we've actually executed and creating a pdf off CS one,

183
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.650
we want to delete the whole of this line delete.

184
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.900
So therefore,

185
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.070
this becomes the new way to,

186
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.440
and that's going to go through the next and create the next template.

187
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.050
So that essentially,

188
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.390
is the bones of the looping code.

189
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.920
So I'm just going to stop that Running for a second comes to the template.

190
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.270
Now,

191
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.980
what I'm gonna do is I am going to,

192
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.010
um we're gonna did First,

193
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.000
we're gonna place a picture,

194
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.880
so I'm gonna just open the sound second,

195
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.660
just so conceal the buttons.

196
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.310
I'm gonna hit record of my macro.

197
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.070
Say,

198
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:29.440
get pick as our first macro Mormon do is come to insert pictures of navigated to the my

199
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.630
picks file.

200
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.220
Obviously pick whichever one where wherever you keeping yours.

201
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.750
Just double click there.

202
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.750
I missed a bit there.

203
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.940
Actually wanted to select that sulks.

204
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.870
That's where I wanted to paste it from.

205
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.610
Um okay,

206
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.560
we can correct that.

207
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.080
One know when we modify the code and I'm gonna make that a little bit bigger and just drop

208
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.090
that they're okay.

209
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.110
Ons stop.

210
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.220
So that's Ah,

211
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.440
get picture.

212
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:03.670
The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say delete because we want to delete it rather

213
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.220
than stack in the morning on top of the other.

214
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.660
So now I'm just going to select the picture hit delete Andi,

215
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.630
pick herself at random on hit Stop.

216
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:19.240
And the next thing I want to do is capture the code for saving a pdf so record macron save

217
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.230
P d.

218
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.130
F from here.

219
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.710
Women hit F 12 on.

220
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.420
Do you can see that?

221
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.320
This is I'm just gonna call it test for now.

222
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.570
We're going to save it.

223
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.100
Change in a second anyway.

224
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.980
And this is also saving to my picks.

225
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.050
Obviously can save you wherever you want to save it.

226
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.950
Now you can't seeks.

227
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.200
It's slightly out a shot,

228
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.600
but at the bottom of this list or near the bottom,

229
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.670
we have P.

230
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.450
D efs were gonna pick pdf,

231
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:49.650
click the options and just check that you have active sheets on if you happy hit.

232
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.250
Okay,

233
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.490
It's okay.

234
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:51.680
Well,

235
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.010
then just click a button on,

236
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.440
then hit.

237
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:53.950
Stop.

238
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.580
And they are our three pieces of code.

239
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.990
Now,

240
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.930
what we need to do I'm gonna close that for a second.

241
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.910
I'm just gonna grab all the macros that we've just recorded and drop him underneath here.

242
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:13.870
So we have the get another close that next we can actually see what we're doing.

243
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.120
We have to get pick code.

244
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.950
So I said I wanted to pick that fair,

245
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.700
so I'm just gonna still easel of this rubbish in the game.

246
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.830
I'm gonna the first England did,

247
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.210
actually.

248
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.420
Slight right sheet,

249
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.220
so sure.

250
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.830
Temp I can't type and talk template,

251
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.250
not select.

252
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.320
So we're selecting the right sheet.

253
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.080
We're gonna go to sell a nine,

254
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.480
and here you can see that we have active.

255
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.990
She pictures insert on what we have there for drinking and add a little bit more.

256
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.780
What we have there is exactly what we've captured.

257
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.910
Two are variable my path.

258
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.190
So all of that,

259
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.990
I am gonna change too.

260
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.750
My path,

261
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.790
Andi Now see,

262
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.780
s one,

263
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.790
as it turns out,

264
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.530
is also my item.

265
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:11.990
So I'm gonna change this C s one and call that my item.

266
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.910
Andi,

267
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.450
I do need that extension dot j peg.

268
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.260
So they go.

269
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.480
That is gonna pull the appropriate picture,

270
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.970
depending on what lying?

271
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.440
Well,

272
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.280
what value havin a to in this list here.

273
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.450
Now,

274
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.390
um,

275
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.890
I selected the sheet.

276
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.030
I don't need to do that.

277
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.600
I actually know what the answers to these questions are here,

278
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.470
But what we do need to do here is because the picture will be called picture on the first

279
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.470
time you pace one picture,

280
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.780
do the second time picture through the third time.

281
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:49.050
So what we need to do is actually captured the name of the picture so saying my pick equals

282
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:54.240
I'm just gonna put zero for a second and we can see that this whips.

283
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.500
We can see that this refers to the picture that we just paste it.

284
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.610
We've got shaping shape,

285
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:00.860
rain,

286
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.140
shape,

287
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.320
range all the way down.

288
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.670
So I'm just gonna copy that Pay sitting there on,

289
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.150
say,

290
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:12.120
Dr Name and that will capture the name of the picture that we just paint paste it.

291
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.250
Now I'm going to get rid of almost everything here up to that.

292
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:24.490
Now what I want to do is say height equals 400.

293
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:31.190
This is in pixels because although their pictures of 300 they look better for 400.

294
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.230
That's a trial and everything I've just seen just did it when I was writing the code.

295
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.180
And they also know through a little bit of experimentation that the left increments is 15

296
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.100
on the top.

297
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.950
Increment is zero.

298
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:48.750
So that's gonna place our picture Now what we want to do then,

299
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.250
is call the what didn't call it saved the PD.

300
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.250
Absolutely cool.

301
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.770
Save pt f on.

302
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.850
That's going to make our code bounce down to here.

303
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.600
Now we can get rid of the change directory.

304
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.370
We don't need that.

305
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.360
But again,

306
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.550
you can see here that we have the special that how it specified the path.

307
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.970
We can build this up out of the information that we already have.

308
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:21.330
So this bit right here is my path on and on,

309
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.150
and then we won't probably want to give it the name of the my item.

310
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.780
Essentially.

311
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.950
So my item,

312
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.530
Andi,

313
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:33.620
But we do want to have dot p the f after the name,

314
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.960
and that's going to give us our safe p d f.

315
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.630
So let's just step through that code.

316
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.100
So far,

317
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.750
so what we've got.

318
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.500
So my item is a s one.

319
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.930
My path is whatever it is from that V.

320
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.400
Look up.

321
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.160
Oh,

322
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.650
I forgot to do a call to get picked at night.

323
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.810
So I call get pick.

324
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.340
All right,

325
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.160
let's try that again.

326
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.020
So here we go all the way through,

327
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.870
and we know jumping down to here.

328
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.320
Sure,

329
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.950
Template select.

330
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:09.200
The one thing I do need to do is say range on ditz.

331
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.080
This cell here,

332
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.780
which is a to A to got value,

333
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:20.800
equals my item that's going to drop the item in there,

334
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.940
which is going to trigger this feel.

335
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.830
Look up in this feel.

336
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.330
Look up!

337
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.430
So f eight f eight they go.

338
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.560
We know of actually Sanford Range a nine.

339
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.460
That's where I want to pace my picture.

340
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.520
My path are pulled from the V.

341
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.650
Look up my eyes.

342
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.810
Um,

343
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.220
I've just read from near the sheet.

344
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.070
I'm attaching dot j pic select.

345
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.130
And there's our picture of actually,

346
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.980
I'm going to capture the name of the picture picture,

347
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.450
too.

348
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.640
And I'm going to change the height to 400 drank this across a bit so you can see that this

349
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.230
is working.

350
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.750
Hey,

351
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.120
left 50 that more or less life stop in the centre,

352
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.180
Andi,

353
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.660
then top zero.

354
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.620
Now I'm gonna have another piece code there before I call.

355
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.440
And that's the delete code,

356
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.500
which is essentially this bit here.

357
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.900
So answer a few times on.

358
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.370
And that's balance Now.

359
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.290
We don't need the selected in selection doctor elite.

360
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.050
We can get rid of all that and just say,

361
00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.920
don't delete,

362
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.480
but rather saying picture warm.

363
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.030
It's actually going to be now called.

364
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.750
Our was my pick,

365
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.350
so they wouldn't just say my pick.

366
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.670
Are we good?

367
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.880
So safe?

368
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.900
Pdf and we're going to come down here and there.

369
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.150
My path and my item are being built dynamically.

370
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.470
Uh,

371
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.880
Bain,

372
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.360
Jeff eight.

373
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.930
Select something that's redundant.

374
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:44.440
We don't need that Their fate Active sheet shapes range or ate my pick picture to dunk

375
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.900
elite.

376
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.410
Now we have a blank.

377
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.630
Now we're going to delete the entire row in A to So that way,

378
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.980
when we looked through again,

379
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.830
my item is going to be e f one.

380
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:56.120
And,

381
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.370
well,

382
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.390
it's same patterns.

383
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:57.920
It happens,

384
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.400
But then we can just scroll through and we get a picture of Emma on dende and scroll

385
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.830
through on.

386
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.810
Then we get Danny Jones.

387
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.970
Bum,

388
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:06.340
bum bum.

389
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.480
I'm just gonna run that out.

390
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.120
So there you go.

391
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.110
What we know should have in our folder and said,

392
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.380
Look,

393
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.400
12345 foot.

394
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.680
But we can delete that one going with the test s one,

395
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.540
which I tell you where you reduce the size of this eye and then we go.

396
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.550
I was gonna say,

397
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.450
I hate Mike.

398
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.120
Ah,

399
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:27.470

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.670
Microsoft edge a window stand.

401
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.230
Whatever it is,

402
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.350
it's causing this to happen.

403
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.410
I have no idea Excrement.

404
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:35.950
So they go,

405
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.470

406
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.880

407
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.260
Stanford take my word for it.

408
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.670
There we go.

409
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.850
We have Cream Washington,

410
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.600

One.

413
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.540
Obviously,

414
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.170

415
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.520

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.800
And there's my good friend Emma Forbes.

419
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.840
