1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,810
Okay,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,170
guys,

3
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,480
welcome back now.

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,800
Have Rendall the code there,

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,890
So that will be available to you when you download the file.

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,880
And now I'm introducing a new theme.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,140
A logical test using the if then else so rather than you watch me write the code.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,370
I've already pasted the code in here and we're just going to go through it line by line.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,150
So we already know what?

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,360
The first few things too.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,450
So we can it f a through all of these.

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,510
And I'm using a while.

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,890
Wend loop here on.

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,650
You can see that the loop is lined up perfectly here.

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,100
So do while the actor self doesn't equal this when we're back to the range object objects

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,510
arranged be to select.

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,300
Okay,

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,670
but no,

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,710
you can see that we have other elements before we have it all in one line.

20
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,580
So said if the active,

21
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,270
sold up value equals male,

22
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,390
then do this.

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:59,000
But what this introduces this isn't If then else test on what this does is if the value

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,840
equals true.

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,000
Do something.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,160
If the value equals false,

27
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,040
then do something different.

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,750
So you can if we look at the structure of the If l.

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,950
If then else test.

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,670
It says If the active seldom value equals male,

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,890
then do this after cell offset zero columns.

32
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,090
Sorry Zeros.

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,910
Five columns that value say's It's a man,

34
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,900
and if it doesn't it says else,

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,160
then the anti cell offset zero comma,

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,510
$5 Value says she's a woman.

37
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,940
W O M A n end of logical tests.

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,050
And then because we have this encapsulated in a loop,

39
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,470
it would just keep going round until the active cell doesn't equal blank.

40
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,050
So let's just execute that.

41
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,240
So if the active cell equals mail,

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,420
it most certainly doesn't.

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,030
You can see by hovering over the active cell Don't value.

44
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,600
It tells a sad that the value is indeed male,

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,700
So this will evaluate to true.

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,010
So we want to do this line of code F eight active cell offset.

47
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,770
Zero comma five equals It's a man on.

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,450
There you go.

49
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,330
That is the end of the logical test.

50
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,990
So now we want to step out.

51
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,850
We want to move down a cell loop and come back up to the Sorry,

52
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,610
it's a do loop.

53
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:16,860
No,

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,450
While Wen,

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:17,730
please,

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,810
we want to come up to the next do while the active cell doesn't equal blank.

57
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,380
So again,

58
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,290
I'm just gonna step through this a few times until we get down to the female.

59
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,360
Here we are so active.

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,140
Celled up value equals male.

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,310
Well,

62
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,270
that's false.

63
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,590
So it will skip this line of code else.

64
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,290
Move over to this line of code on,

65
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:38,880
right?

66
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
She's a woman.

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,240
W o N a m on.

68
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,750
There you go.

69
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,060
And that's just going to keep looping around until the active self doesn't equal value.

70
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,370
So I'm sorry till the active cell isn't blanket.

71
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,350
I'm just gonna hit play on.

72
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,070
There you go.

73
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,980
That is our data completely populated.

74
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,870
So if it's a man,

75
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,260
it says it's a man.

76
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,450
And if it's a woman,

77
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,850
it says she's a woman.

78
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,560
W O M A n on that is Harry using,

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,160
if then else test much useful.

80
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,450
If you want to do one thing,

81
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,270
if the answer is true but a different thing,

82
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,800
if it's not okay,

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,290
I'll see you in the next lecture
