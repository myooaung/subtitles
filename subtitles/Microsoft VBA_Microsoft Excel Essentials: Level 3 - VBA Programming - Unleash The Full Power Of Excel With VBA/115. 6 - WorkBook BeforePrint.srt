1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,710
guys.

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,900
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,120
Now,

5
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,330
we're gonna have a look at a different workbook event.

6
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,960
This so we're gonna have a look at that before print Workbook event.

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,620
Now again,

8
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,350
I'm gonna have to come to hear Select workbook by default.

9
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,730
It's gonna put workbook open,

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,620
Will delete down the second they were going to come to the procedure drop down box and he

11
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,350
at in the scroll way up to the top here.

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,190
I'm gonna choose before print.

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,840
So now I can safely delete this workbook open on Dhere is the module that we are working

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,290
with.

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,110
So a code is going to go in here now.

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,950
I'm gonna set up a variable for the print response on the set it up interject.

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,270
Is there nice and efficient?

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,890
So dim print response as interject.

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,680
And then what we want to do is display a message box to the user to ask them if they are

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,850
completely sure that they're paid you set up before they go ahead and print.

21
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:00,250
So P r T e S P O N s e print response equals M s G b o X.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,380
Because we're doing a message box here.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,710
I'm going to say Quotes please.

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,270
Ah please And show your pain.

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,450
Jews set correctly before printing.

26
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,960
Who's quotes?

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,620
Come out?

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,290
I'm gonna hit.

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:31,240
It'll score on forces Stand on to a new line on Dhere I'm know going to say vb Savy be okay

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,970
Council the B Okay Council.

31
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,570
So that way,

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,460
if they click OK,

33
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,870
it will continue to print If they clicked council,

34
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,440
it won't print So comer IHS,

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,300
you'll page set question mark close groups close brackets on down.

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,600
So there's a message box which we're going to read the response into the variable print

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,290
response.

38
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,290
So now we need to say what we're going to do when that variable is being populated.

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,310
So we're gonna say if PRT arrests Pontes Absolute now,

40
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,950
that's right.

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,810
If if print response equals,

42
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,890
let's say vb council then and because we don't want anything to happen after that.

43
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,170
So let's flip back to excel on here.

44
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,310
I'm gonna hit control and Pete's bring your by a print dialog box.

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,540
I'm gonna hit the print button on,

46
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,060
then notice what happens.

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,110
This little dialogue box pops up here,

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,200
so our code is executed beautifully.

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,600
It says,

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,850
Is your paint set up,

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,150
please ensure your pages are set up correctly before printing.

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,970
If I click council,

53
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,470
then the end will trick Abacus of it.

54
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,460
BB council.

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,800
Andi,

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
If I hit OK,

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,400
then it will go ahead and print.

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,050
Okay,

59
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,770
I'll see you in the next lecture.
