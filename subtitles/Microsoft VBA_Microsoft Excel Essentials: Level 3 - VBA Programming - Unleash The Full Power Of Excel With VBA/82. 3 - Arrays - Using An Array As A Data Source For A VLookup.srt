1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,690
guys.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,670
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,050
Now,

5
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,010
this is kind of a bonus lecture.

6
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,730
In response to a student question Muhammed is asked,

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:16,680
is it possible to use a data table that you captured to an array with the look up?

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,750
So it's the data source for the V.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,360
Look up.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,010
So I've updated the file that you can download now and you'll know,

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,000
find an additional table in their additional.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,380
She called H R table.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,010
So what I'm gonna do,

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,980
let me just come back to visual.

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,380
Basic.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:32,910
There we go.

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,000
I have repurposed sub a raise five and called it sub arrays six.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,130
And I've also imported the HR table,

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,650
which have given a VB name of S H H R table.

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,450
Now,

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,080
here's the repurposed code.

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,620
We don't need quite so many variables this time.

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,270
What we're gonna do is we're gonna have at my array f instead of e.

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,780
On.

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,370
I am keeping my category provided a new variable called my name,

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,420
and I'm gonna keep the my response now.

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,660
It's very straightforward.

28
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,270
This code,

29
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,770
what we're gonna do is have that single line of code reading.

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,380
All of share a chart table dot range a six current region.

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,130
All of this over here,

32
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,150
into my array f that's captured our array.

33
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,450
We're gonna leave the start over labelling just like we looked at in the last lecture.

34
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,520
I'm going to keep my category.

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,110
But I've just changed the wording on this and I've also eliminated the lower case.

36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,710
So we're just going to say please enter the employee number on.

37
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,220
We've changed the title to employees hashtag we're going to use a V Look up.

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,840
We don't need the Lupin anymore.

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,500
Consistency is straightforward.

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,270
V look up.

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,760
So we're gonna say my name,

42
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,340
have a new variable equals application dot worksheet function dot v Look up on the syntax

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,710
for this is exactly the same as it is in Excel.

44
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,790
So I'm gonna say my category which have just captured from the user my array f which is all

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,500
of this data that we've just captured into our array called my r a f comma to because we

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,070
want to return the whole name Common fall.

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,870
So we're looking for an exact match.

48
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,630
And again,

49
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,770
I've just slightly modified the my response to say this employee's name is and then vb new

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,170
line my name.

51
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,810
What we've returned from the V.

52
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,260
Look up,

53
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,730
and then Do you want to have a look for another one?

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,030
So it's just hit play and see what that does.

55
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,900
Enter an employee number M in C dash,

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,330
go eight and enter.

57
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,950
They go.

58
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,870
This employee's name at no apostrophe.

59
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,900
This'd employees name is Annabelle Read.

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,260
Would you like to look for another employee?

61
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,710
No.

62
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,750
So they go.

63
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,610
That's how you can use on the application worksheet function V Look up with an array that

64
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,540
you've captured.

65
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,260
Okay,

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
