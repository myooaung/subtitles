1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,870
guys.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,860
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,340
Now,

5
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,190
in the last lecture,

6
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,770
we looked at how to select a row of data or a column of data using the end incorporated

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,790
within a range.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,100
But what if we want to actually select the entire range without going through the two steps

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,330
from here To hear them from here to here?

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,140
Luckily,

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,360
VB as a built in function for exactly that built in property called the current region.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,400
Now the current region is from anywhere near the object where you begin,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,570
so objects is gonna be range a five.

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,520
So from range A five,

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,800
the current region is going to be anything that is bordered with spaces.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,070
So here we have the border off spaces.

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,370
So range a five dark current region dot select is going to select the whole of this region

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:53,370
.

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,650
So I'm just gonna hit her fate and step over that Nager.

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,720
You can see that all of that range is being selected.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,090
Just gonna hit Stop.

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,490
It's also gonna work if we sick select anywhere within that range.

23
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,350
So even if I'm in C nine and I just step through that exactly the same thing is gonna

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,840
happen.

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,950
It's going to expand out and capture your entire data set.

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,100
I guarantee you're gonna be using that one quite a while now.

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,190
You also condemn exactly the same thing with cells.

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,580
Sophie,

29
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,520
just click off here and hits F eight cells.

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,870
51 which is essentially a five does precisely the same thing on Also,

31
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,570
finally,

32
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,120
let me just click on here.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,240
So if I click the bottom corner one,

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,560
the active cell,

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,020
which is now 12 also works exactly the same way.

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,750
Now,

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,940
you may have noticed if you've been playing with code that if you froggy mistake type and

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,510
objects that should range a five,

39
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,320
arrange a one and you hit the dot.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,710
The very first thing that you see is activate the activate method.

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,920
And you may be wondering,

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,550
what on earth is a difference between activate on a select.

43
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,010
We'll have a look at that in the next lecture.

44
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,070
So I'll see you.

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,450
That
