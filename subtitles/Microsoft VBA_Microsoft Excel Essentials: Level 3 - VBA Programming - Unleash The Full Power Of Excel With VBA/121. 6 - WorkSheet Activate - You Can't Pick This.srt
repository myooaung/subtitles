1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:02,900
guys.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,000
Um,

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,050
welcome back.

5
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,380
So now we're gonna have a look at a quick fun one.

6
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,340
This is gonna be a work sheet.

7
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,800
Event is supposed to work.

8
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,990
Book event on what we're gonna do over here,

9
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,670
you'll see all the green ones are the work book events that we've looked at so far.

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,250
Just copy and paste The code exactly is the red comments say,

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,590
up here on now,

12
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,460
We're going to go on to this one,

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,250
which is a worksheet event that says you can't pick this.

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,830
So what we're gonna do hit Olsen F 11.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,270
We're going to go to the sheet that is named up here as you can't pick this.

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,000
Where are we ago?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,970
You can't pick this.

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,970
I double clicked sheet 10 which is You can't pick this on.

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,240
We are now in a work sheet module,

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,580
so I'm just gonna choose worksheet,

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,160
and you can see that by default we get selection change.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,550
We're going to come to actually,

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,380
But for now,

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,150
what we're gonna do is we're gonna pick the worksheet,

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,320
activate.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,780
So when the worksheet is activated,

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,360
that is,

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,020
the user has clicked it.

29
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,310
We're going to execute the code that's in between the private sub on the end sub on all

30
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,400
we're going to say here is a sure guide not select,

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,050
which you'll remember from a few lectures ago is the name of the guide sheet.

32
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,980
So let's just hit Olsen F 11 and see what happens when we click this.

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,850
You can't pick this when we click it.

34
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,700
It immediately goes to the guide sheet.

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,030
And even if we scroll over,

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,050
no matter how many times we try it,

37
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,060
the code you'll execute and automatically take you back to the guide sheet.

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,560
Okay,

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,150
I'll see him in the next lecture where we'll have a look at another one.

40
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,040
That's just for fun.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,590
I'll see you in the next lecture.
