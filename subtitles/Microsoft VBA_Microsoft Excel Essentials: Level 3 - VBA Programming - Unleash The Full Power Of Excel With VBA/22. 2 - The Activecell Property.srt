1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,720
guys.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,770
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,150
Now,

5
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,250
this time we're gonna have a look at the active sell property because up to now,

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,010
what we've done is reviews the range object within the range object reviews like a one B

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,410
six or whatever it was all specified a range to select the cell that we want to get to.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,420
We've also looked at cells to look to the cell.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,650
We want to get it so because they sells over brackets five comma two to get to a fire,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,390
for example.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,150
But what if the cell that's currently selected is the one that you want to perform an

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,270
action on?

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,600
Well,

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,410
that's exactly what the active cell does whenever cell is selected.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,690
So currently,

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,310
here,

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,240
if I click here,

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,320
the active cell is D five.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,970
Whereas if I come over to hear the active cell is B three.

20
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,110
Now,

21
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,790
I haven't changed.

22
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,050
Anything in the code is literally just looking at the active South.

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,520
So I'm just going to click a one here.

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,830
Let's have a look about the coders Active cell.

25
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:07,910
Technically active cell is a property that returns the value off the object.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,840
So the active cell in code when it executes will work out what the active cell is,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,450
and it will retrieve the object name.

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,240
So in this particular instance,

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,350
the active sell property is going to receive the object range A one.

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,860
Okay,

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,050
So what's going to do with the active cell?

32
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,510
It's gonna act on the fund property.

33
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,710
It is gonna act on the bold property off the front of property and set it to true.

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,890
Now,

35
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,370
because certainly one line of code,

36
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,790
I am not gonna f eight and step through it.

37
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,010
I am literally just going to click here.

38
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,970
Notice I am on a G five.

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,050
So if a hit play,

40
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,970
nothing of parents has happened.

41
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,970
But you can see the Bold has been selected up here because G five is the active cell.

42
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,100
While I actually want to work on is a one.

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,340
So if I select a one and hit from my code Boom,

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,950
they go.

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,780
It's no bold because a one was the active cell.

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,550
Okay,

47
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,470
I'm gonna see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at the offset property

48
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:08,470
.

49
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,620
And I guarantee you you are going to be using that a lot.

50
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,190
Okay,

51
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,580
I'll see you in the next lecture.
