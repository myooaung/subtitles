1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Okay,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,440
guys,

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,540
um,

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,530
welcome back.

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:04,950
Now,

6
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,400
In the last lecture we have look,

7
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,660
it read in an entire data set into an array,

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,570
used a single line of code and then with another single line of code,

9
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,250
we wrote that complete a race somewhere else.

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,710
But it could be that we don't want to read the array with the explicit intention to write

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,060
the array somewhere else.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,230
What we may want to do is hold that Iranian memory on get some input from the user to

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,670
display a result.

14
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,100
So what we're gonna do in this lecture is combined some of the things that we've looked at

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,050
a little earlier,

16
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,300
the input box and the message box to do just that.

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,950
So this the shell of this code is exactly the same as the one we had in the last lecture.

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,610
But I've just added a few more variables in here.

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,220
We have a simple counter on my category,

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,210
which we're going to use to get the input from a user,

21
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,150
my some which we're going to use to some my response,

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,230
which is going to be the response to an input box of that later on.

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,350
So this line of code reads the data array.

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,090
We get the upper bound of the first element on the column count of the second elements.

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,770
And then we get down to this body,

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,310
this part where we're gonna have an input box where we're going to get an input from the

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,640
user.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,330
So I'm just gonna hit t bug click over him just gonna hit the bug and I'm gonna come

29
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,110
straight down,

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,190
run to cursor to get here Air Fate.

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,900
And then this category box will pop up this input box.

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,780
So what would I like to look at?

33
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,730
I would like to look at clothing now to get around any case sensitivities.

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,630
What I've done is so said that my category,

35
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,120
which is the variable that this entry is going to be read into,

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,000
is going to be lower cased on.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,780
I've met the same adjustment here when I am checking column E,

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,050
which is five.

39
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,840
So that so I'm just going click.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,450
OK,

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,390
so my category have no title in lower case.

42
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,190
If I hadn't,

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,160
it would be lower cased No,

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,580
I have a loop check for a match.

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:07,140
So if the lower case of Mireille e number one my cancer column.

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,890
Five.

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:16,440
So 12345 If that equals clothing and we just come up to the top so we can see what it what

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,840
it is.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,780
They go said the first line is actually gonna say category because this is our first line

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,370
of data.

51
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,560
So I'm just going to step through this.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,050
The 1st 1 doesn't because it saves category.

53
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,970
The next one does.

54
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,260
So we're now going to come down to here,

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,800
so my son equals mice.

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,120
Um,

57
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,590
plus Mireille e cancer on.

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,730
We're on cancer number two line,

59
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,150
too.

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,810
Column seven,

61
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,080
Which is where the prophet lives is going to be my some plus mice.

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,350
Um,

63
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,900
whatever the current value is,

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,660
plus that.

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,940
So when they s f eight,

66
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,950
my son is now worth £6.30 or 6.3 because of that there.

67
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,350
So I'm gonna reiterate again we get another match.

68
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,360
So my son's Currently,

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,470
we're £6.30 from here,

70
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,410
but we're now looking at this line,

71
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,020
so it's not gonna add that to that.

72
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,470
So there we have £45.30 and I'm just going to run that through.

73
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,000
So it looked through all 460 odd lines of data.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,370
And then we come down to this line here,

75
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,030
check to see if a value was found.

76
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,450
Now,

77
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,770
this is very important because if the usual type something incorrectly,

78
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:32,570
then a value wouldn't be found because there would be nothing in column e matching what

79
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,450
they typed in.

80
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,300
So all we get here is a VB critical message box That's a snow value found.

81
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,250
But we did have a value.

82
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,520
So we skip straight over that right?

83
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,280
My response equals the total profit four space,

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,870
my category which is while I typed in little earlier Waas or space waas vb New line Andi

85
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,700
format my some as currency so you can see there currently.

86
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,150
My son is where 4955.6.

87
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,260
But we'd like it picked to be displayed in the format of current sick,

88
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,960
hence format over rackets.

89
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,880
My some comma currency on DVI Be new line.

90
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,420
Would you like to look for another category?

91
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,470
VBS No result found.

92
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,450
So let's hit F eight CEO.

93
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,120
The total profit for clothing was £4155.

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,850
60 Nicely formatted.

95
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,700
Would you like to look for another category and I'm gonna say yes on what that's going to

96
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,620
do is now reset the sum to zero because we want to look for another category.

97
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,290
What we want to do is actually start that over.

98
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,790
So I'm just gonna hit Stop there.

99
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,550
And here's a line of code that I wrote earlier.

100
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,970
If my response equals V b yes,

101
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,130
on you'll remember from a nearly elect we used I think six was no and seven was yes or vice

102
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,480
versa will be be yes is also a valid response to a yes,

103
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,100
no box.

104
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,040
So if my response equals V B,

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,540
yes,

106
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,120
that is the use of pressed.

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,600
Yes.

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,050
Then go to start over.

109
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,250
Now start over is a label in a code.

110
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,270
In the olden day,

111
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,790
she usedto have lines.

112
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,360
5 10 15 2025 30 And you could say go to 30 on your code would go back to 30.

113
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,540
We can do the same thing.

114
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:17,840
No,

115
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,580
but this time we're going to use the label now.

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,230
We already have the arrange red,

117
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,930
so there's no need to re read it.

118
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,820
But what we can do is come in here on.

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,660
We're gonna type are label is going to be called start over called Anything you Want and

120
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,190
notice that start over will not in dent,

121
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,560
even if I indented it when I come over because I have the colon after it that's identified

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,520
as a label.

123
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,680
It will always go right over to the left,

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,500
so they're very easy to spot in your code.

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,860
So let's let's run through that security bug run to cursor.

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,750
In fact,

127
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,250
let's try.

128
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,370
Let's just talk something completely nonsense and hit OK And they go,

129
00:05:59,370 --> 00:05:59,710
No,

130
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,520
we get this area of code that's executed because of some equals nothing because there is no

131
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,450
value found.

132
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,560
Okay,

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
and then we're gonna end.

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,020
So let's run that again.

135
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,180
But actually type something useful in there that lets room.

136
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,670
It's a curse of their rooms.

137
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,300
Clothing on they go.

138
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,260
The total profit for clothing was £4955.

139
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,850
60

140
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,050
Would you like to look for another category?

141
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,870
Yes,

142
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,510
I would.

143
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,490
So my response to this was six.

144
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,800
Which is equivalent to VB.

145
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Yes,

146
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,570
F eight.

147
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,680
Then go to start over.

148
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,250
And now look what happens when I hit F right straight up to here and executes the next line

149
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,820
of code.

150
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,060
So when I press it again this time I would like to look for groceries.

151
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,470
Enter and then I can loop all the way through on Get back down to here.

152
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,270
Run to cursor The total profit for groceries for £774.

153
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,810
96

154
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,600
Would you like to look for another category?

155
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,350
Yes,

156
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,810
I would.

157
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,150
In fact,

158
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,010
I'm just going to stop that and run it out now.

159
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,210
So I'm just gonna press play,

160
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,890
so I would like to look for household enter.

161
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,100
The total profit for household was £2116.

162
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,730
62

163
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,390
Would you like to look for another category?

164
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,660
Yes,

165
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,030
I would.

166
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,740
Let's have a look at clothing.

167
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,260
The total profit close them was £4955.60.

168
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,870
Would you like for a friend of the category if you click?

169
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,350
No,

170
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,780
you're just come straight down to end sub.

171
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,130
So there's one use incorporating the message box and the input box that we can use to check

172
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,150
the data that we've just read into an array and do something useful with it.

173
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,860
OK,

174
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,750
I will see you in the next lecture
