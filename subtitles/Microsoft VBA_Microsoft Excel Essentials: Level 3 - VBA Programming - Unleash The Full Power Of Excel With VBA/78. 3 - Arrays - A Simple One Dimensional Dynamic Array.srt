1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,870
guys.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,860
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,600
Now we can have a look a simple,

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,130
one dimensional dynamic array.

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,300
Now,

7
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,930
I've already written the code in here,

8
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,230
most of which you're gonna understand,

9
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,000
but we'll go through it line by line.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,850
So notice the first thing that's changed.

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,250
Here is how I have set up the variable.

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,880
I have said dim my arabi,

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,120
which I cleverly added a watch to already for you Open brackets,

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,620
close brackets as string.

15
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,970
Now the reason I put open brackets close brackets is although I am setting up the array,

16
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,280
I don't yet know how big it should be.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,140
So I'm just going to say dim Mireille,

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,500
be open brackets,

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,560
close brackets.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,310
Now here's another important thing when you're when you're setting up your arrays.

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,500
If you know that all of your days out will be strings,

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,160
it's quite safe to set it up as a string.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,020
As this is just a one dimensional array on all of these values,

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,190
here are strings.

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,800
I am quite safe to do that.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
If you have a variety of different data,

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,070
particularly when we get to multi dimensional race which will do short,

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,950
like then expected to set them up as variant.

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,910
I know they arm or memory inefficient,

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,410
but that will stop you having any read iris.

31
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,260
So it will say we trying to read a long decimal number into a string.

32
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,390
It's just not gonna be happy.

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,070
So set them up as variants.

34
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,020
Okay,

35
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,190
so that's how we set up a dynamic array.

36
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,680
We say dim my array be or whatever you want to call your right open brackets,

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,730
close brackets.

38
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,280
So let's step through this code.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,740
Most of it you'll understand.

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,140
Anyway,

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,850
we are selecting by VB named the correct sheet,

42
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,120
which is this one over here.

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,540
We are clearing the contents,

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,090
indeed,

45
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,150
because that's where we're going to be right in data.

46
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,070
Okay.

47
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,940
And this is where we get dynamic.

48
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:57,220
We're gonna say my row can't equals range A 1,048,576 way down at the bottom of Excel End

49
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,780
Excel Up Row.

50
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,110
So that is going to get us the row number off this cell here.

51
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,390
So now we know how many elements are array should have on.

52
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,040
Then when we do that,

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,350
let me just click in their F eight.

54
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,890
Now.

55
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,320
Our row count is eight which we can see.

56
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,800
12345678 is exactly correct.

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,220
And here's the part where we re dimension our ray This is to make it dynamic.

58
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,750
Now we know how many elements we should have because we've just read it from my row Can't

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,790
weaken se ri dim my array open brackets And there we know the number that we can add that

60
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,290
in here.

61
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,160
So what we're going to say is re Dimension Arabi to my row can't.

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,170
So now we know we're gonna hold eight elements.

63
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,930
So our array is going to be set up to hold eight elements.

64
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,550
OK,

65
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,920
and here's our four next loop toe load the race on the first pass through my cancer is

66
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,930
gonna be worth one.

67
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,760
So my array be one is going to read from cells 11 which is a one that I'm just going to

68
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,670
expand that there.

69
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,280
So when I f eight through it,

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,330
you can see that we now have read just going to step through yellow,

71
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,690
pink,

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,130
green,

73
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,680
orange,

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,950
purple blue,

75
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,110
Andi Indigo Let me just stop that And I'm just gonna add ah satar Toysmart know how to

76
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,650
spell it s so let's just think of another cooler.

77
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,990
A future that's a spell fusion.

78
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,860
So now I'm just going to run straight down to this right part here.

79
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,800
So I'm just going to click on this line I'm gonna come up to debug on will say,

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,670
run to curse.

81
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,980
And that's gonna immediately get us through all of the code down to this point.

82
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,360
Now I'm gonna expand that and you can see that future has been included because my rail

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,280
count has now changed to nine because it's dynamic and we have re dimension there array to

84
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,980
say go to nine.

85
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,650
So there this is just a straightforward loop to write the data.

86
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,840
So we're just going to write all the way through.

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
So again we're looping,

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,300
saying my counter equals one to my row count,

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,200
which is nine f eight and notice what happens here at the bottom erases array.

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,780
Be on notice what happens here when we execute that all of our memory as no being freed and

91
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,750
that's one of the beauties or one of the other good points of a dynamic array is it

92
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:29,600
releases your memory when you a raise or destroy the array So the first benefit is it is

93
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,330
dynamic.

94
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,680
It will expand and contract depending on the data set that you're working with a big plus.

95
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,740
And secondly,

96
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,250
it will free your memory once you raise it.

97
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,080
Okay,

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,510
I'll see you in the next lecture.
