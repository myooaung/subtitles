00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay,

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.880
guys,

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.540
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.700
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.880
Video now following on from the last lecture where John asked if it was possible to save an

6
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.370
individual tab,

7
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.260
an individual sheet from a master workbook.

8
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.910
And save that to a specific directory based on who?

9
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.550
The territory manager WAAS.

10
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.240
What we name want to do is copy multiple sheets from the master workbook and save that to

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.900
an individual file and then save that to a specific directory.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.250
Well,

13
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.960
that's easy to do now.

14
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.520
Jones idea was toe have the sheets listed by the territory manager in a list and then

15
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.820
create a loop to do just that.

16
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.180
And that is exactly the right approach.

17
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.670
So here I've created a who looks after what tab?

18
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.550
And that's that less that hurt that John suggested.

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.500
So write it up.

20
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.730
We have the territory managers want to on three.

21
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.770
These are the sheets that will be associated with each territory manager,

22
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.260
and these are the sheets that we want to copy to a new workbook before we say we to the

23
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.470
specific directory.

24
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.990
OK,

25
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.750
so tm one will have the sheet t m 01 summary.

26
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.230
He will also look after site one site to on site six.

27
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.480
Which is way over here.

28
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.410
Tim 02 will have a tear t m 02 summary.

29
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.280
And he would just,

30
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.690
like go.

31
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.150
He or she was just like after site three.

32
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.410
So in in this instance,

33
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.650
what we want to do is fourth for total Manager to is copied this sheet.

34
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.630
Andi,

35
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.470
site three this sheet into a new workbook.

36
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.300
Now,

37
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.540
just just one thing to note here.

38
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.470
If you record a macro and copy two sheets at once,

39
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.460
the code is interesting.

40
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.790
Let's say so.

41
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.000
We're not going to use that method.

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.550
I'm just going to show it to you here just so you can see what I mean.

43
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.930
So I'm just gonna record a new macro.

44
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.170
I won t mo to summary on a site three so T m 02 summary hit control on site three that I'm

45
00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.900
gonna hit.

46
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.740
Right.

47
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.610
Right click.

48
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.500
Choose Movil.

49
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.980
Copy.

50
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.010
I know that soft shots.

51
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.790
Sorry about that.

52
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.380
Creates Copy,

53
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.900
Andi.

54
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.080
New workbook Onda.

55
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.830
Okay,

56
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.550
and there we go.

57
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.590
Now I'm gonna stop that recording on.

58
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.580
We're going to go and take a look at that code.

59
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.910
So here we go.

60
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.260
Here is that code we can see.

61
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.090
We have sheets,

62
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.020
open brackets,

63
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.210
array T M 02 summary commerce site,

64
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000
three ducks select and inside three Duff activate.

65
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.480
And then we do the copy thing.

66
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.660
Now,

67
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.750
the interesting part about that is this a ray thing on where we have toe have these sites

68
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.080
in exactly that format.

69
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.180
So if we had just one site,

70
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.400
we would have a double quotes,

71
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.100
timid in the name of the thing,

72
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.760
double quotes and then close brackets.

73
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.220
But if we have more than one,

74
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.150
each individual site name will have to be enclosed in brackets.

75
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.250
We'll have to have a comma,

76
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.880
but never have a calmer at the end whether we have 123 or however many sheets.

77
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.900
And to be honest with you,

78
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.180
that's a complicated way of programming.

79
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.280
So I would take a different approach.

80
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.570
So this is how I would do it.

81
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.200
We'll break it down into individual chunks of code.

82
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.130
Now I'm gonna put them all in one sub.

83
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.130
It's nice and easy to understand.

84
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.630
So I've copied the code that we created yes,

85
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.550
to the save me because they're a couple of elements of that that I want to reuse on one of

86
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.490
Don's have created a new new surgical saving multiple sheets.

87
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.670
Andi,

88
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.960
I've just put in the declared the valuables on the four bits that we need to do.

89
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.240
Now.

90
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.920
I've added a little test in here to make sure that we are on row one,

91
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.740
which is where our territory manager lives.

92
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.790
And that's basic stuff.

93
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.500
We've looked at this earlier in the course.

94
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.240
Okay,

95
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.020
so the full parts are The first part is creating new book without first sheet.

96
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.090
So we're gonna copy out ther sheet and create our new workbook and save it off.

97
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.670
So far,

98
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.150
so good.

99
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.250
We did that yesterday,

100
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.940
and everything is good now.

101
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.990
The second part is we want to flip back toe a master file on,

102
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.770
then in the loop that John suggested from the list loop through and then capture all the

103
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.400
additional sheets one at a time and paste them into the book that we've just created.

104
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.160
So far,

105
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.750
so good.

106
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.660
Now,

107
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.620
what will happen if we have links on the summary sheet to sheet three,

108
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.650
for example,

109
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.420
is when we do this,

110
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.910
the link in the summary sheet is gonna point to the original document So what we're going

111
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.100
to need to do is sort out that link issue.

112
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.300
And that's a simple as a find and replace on the final parties we're going to save and

113
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.240
close the new sheet in the correct directory and then go back to our original sheet.

114
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.960
So they're the four elements.

115
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.720
Okay,

116
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.050
What we're gonna need to do is a good a couple of macro,

117
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.230
so we can steal some lines of code,

118
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.620
and then we'll build this supple Lego style.

119
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.030
OK,

120
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.550
so let's flip back to excel.

121
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.730
Andi,

122
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.950
let's record a macron on.

123
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.410
What we want to do in the first instance is exactly what we did yesterday.

124
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.550
Macron number five.

125
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.480
So what we're going to say is,

126
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.030
right?

127
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.830
Click that.

128
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.930
Choose Movil.

129
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.190
Copy on or it's off screen created copy.

130
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.580
Come to new workbook.

131
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.910
Click.

132
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.680
OK,

133
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.260
and then we're gonna hit F 12 to save as Onda Rod Jane.

134
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.820
I think it was.

135
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.730
We keep this one in and we'll call this one t m 02 on hit.

136
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.970
Enter on,

137
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.310
then we're gonna close that and we're gonna stop.

138
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.810
Okay,

139
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.620
so there's our first macro.

140
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.920
Now we need to do is re open that sheet so I just wanted to record the just wanted to

141
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.450
record the closing of it.

142
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.180
So,

143
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.190
Rod Jane,

144
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.620
there we go.

145
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.100
T m 02 whips,

146
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.870
Andi less t mot.

147
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.250
Now our sacra macro is going to be to add the other sheet,

148
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.400
which is site three.

149
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.860
So again,

150
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.160
I'm gonna start recording a macro,

151
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.050
and I'm gonna choose site three right click Movil.

152
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.600
Copy.

153
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.680
On this time,

154
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.440
I'm gonna choose Create a copy,

155
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.440
and I am going to point to t m 02 XLs,

156
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.150
which is the fall we just created.

157
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.200
Okay,

158
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.750
so now we have sheet site three.

159
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.770
Andi sheet to summary,

160
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.710
and I'm just gonna hit.

161
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.950
Stop now.

162
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.960
I'm gonna close that off.

163
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.380
Okay?

164
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.300
Don't save.

165
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.990
Now.

166
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.940
Let's have a look at the code that's being generated.

167
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.300
So what we have is this one code macron number five,

168
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.350
which is where we did the summary sheet.

169
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:36.330
So this is get the first sheet in the first sheet on this one was add the other sheets.

170
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.940
Eso That's just on the other sheets.

171
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.820
Okay.

172
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.790
Fantastic.

173
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.840
Now what we're gonna do is just copy all of that and dump it over here into module one,

174
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.630
so we can have a play around with it,

175
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.250
and I'm just gonna put it up here.

176
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.920
Runs come close,

177
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.730
E So you can see this little bit better.

178
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.400
Okay,

179
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.950
so the first thing we need to do is we're going to be on this sheet that who looks after

180
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.770
what sheet,

181
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.040
and I've tied this macro.

182
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.130
He had this thing subroutine saving multiple sheets to this button.

183
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.150
So when the codes finished,

184
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.430
we can just hit that you can select any of these.

185
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.930
Hit that,

186
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.310
and it's gonna work perfectly.

187
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.000
Okay,

188
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.830
so here we go.

189
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.270
The first thing we want to do is capture this the territory manager.

190
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.420
So begin,

191
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.830
declare a variable.

192
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.750
Appear we're gonna say Dim,

193
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.190
my t m actually,

194
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.450
probably still left off a string.

195
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.420
No,

196
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.800
I'll fully ran this before,

197
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.390
right before I upload the code.

198
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.290
So there's our first thing,

199
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.540
and what we want to say is,

200
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.440
we want to get the active territory,

201
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.760
get the territory manager so we can say my tea and equals active cell don't value.

202
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.520
And so far,

203
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.660
so good That is going to read from this cell here.

204
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.350
Remember,

205
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.210
we've got this little checker to make sure we're on Row one.

206
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.090
s Oh,

207
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.500
there we go.

208
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.660
We've got active.

209
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.750
We've got our territory manager Now.

210
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:05.070
The next thing we need to do is have a file name to saving us on the dim call it my file

211
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.900
name a string on day,

212
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.300
so never gonna add a file name.

213
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:21.590
I'm gonna say my file name equals on my foul name is going to say year now because we want

214
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.510
to have a date stamp on and months.

215
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.150
No,

216
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.220
Andi,

217
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.450
is it day or data car?

218
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:30.830
Remember?

219
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.990
I think it's day now,

220
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.590
Andi,

221
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:40.030
and we wanna have a space dash space on the name of our territory managers.

222
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:45.420
So that is going to be the active cell dot value Or alternatively,

223
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.710
we could use the tea.

224
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.900
And because that's going to be the same value.

225
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.000
Okay,

226
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.240
Eso And then we want to say Andi,

227
00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:03.220
Then we want tohave a dot x l s x sago with whips would have not done up on din there.

228
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.420
So that's my file name.

229
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.800
Now.

230
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.180
I I like the way that we did it yesterday with my safe path.

231
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.180
Eso gonna copy that ongoing pace that underneath here.

232
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:21.070
So there we have my safe path and when I do need to do there is add a backslash.

233
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.530
Alternatively,

234
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.240
we just out of backslash in the safe paths over here.

235
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.520
So let me just declare that one too.

236
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.770
So we have him onto the type I know.

237
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:37.450
So my save path string.

238
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.680
Okay,

239
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.960
so let's just run through that coast.

240
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.380
So far,

241
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.130
so what we've got.

242
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:47.530
So we have my t m s t m 01 My file name is gonna be 2016.

243
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.630
10 27 space dash space T m 01 dot x l s,

244
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.080
x.

245
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.590
So far,

246
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:59.160
so good on my safe path is gonna be pulled from that V Look up from the safe path sheet.

247
00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.540
Okay,

248
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.030
so far,

249
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.490
so good.

250
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:00.900
Now,

251
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:07.790
the next thing we need to do is capture the name off this workbook where this code actually

252
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.340
resides.

253
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.890
So I'm gonna call this master workbook.

254
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:18.750
Someone say dim must work as a string,

255
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.330
and that's going to capture the name of this workbook.

256
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:31.550
So in here in the same master work book equals this work book,

257
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.590
dot dot name on all of these air earlier in the course.

258
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.700
So if you download the my macro,

259
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.380
but you're going to find all of these snippets of code in there.

260
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.740
So now we know the name of our territory manager.

261
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.640
We know the file name.

262
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.860
We're going to save it as we know where we're going to save it.

263
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.160
And we also know the name off this sheet.

264
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.670
Okay,

265
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.550
so the next thing we need to do is do that,

266
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:59.390
copy the active sheet or copy the first sheet and save it to that of the workbook.

267
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.390
So let's go back up to this code here.

268
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.530
No,

269
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.560
I'm not going to choose the clothes because we're gonna do that way at the end.

270
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.570
So it's gonna copy that for a second on pace that underneath here.

271
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.550
Bom bom bom bom bom.

272
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.870
Okay,

273
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.900
I know it will.

274
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.560
Okay,

275
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.810
so sheets T m o to select.

276
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.910
We don't need to select them so we can get rid of that.

277
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.530
What we do need to do is copy it,

278
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.440
but we're not going to be copying the sheets.

279
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.380
T m 02 summary.

280
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.150
We're gonna be copying this sheet with name of the at active cell.

281
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.160
Here's a thought.

282
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.880
We actually need to move down a cell first.

283
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.480
Only because we captured this and then we want to come down to here.

284
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:48.140
So the next thing we want to do is saying active cell dot offset on that offset one comma

285
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.550
zero dot select.

286
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:57.340
And now we've managed to move down to this cell just here on that is the cell value that's

287
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.200
going to contain the name of the next tab that we want to do.

288
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:08.650
So what we're gonna do is instead of saying that we're going to say active sell don't value

289
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.300
on that is going to tell us the name of the sheet that we want to copy.

290
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.150
We can ignore this change directory thing cause we don't need that in there.

291
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.150
And what we actually want to do is set on and again,

292
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.030
okay?

293
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.400
And then what?

294
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.220
We want to do this,

295
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.240
save the file.

296
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.510
So here we have our path.

297
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.670
But we've already specified the path,

298
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.150
so we can just replace that with the my safe path.

299
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.150
So all of that Congar Oh,

300
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:41.700
so what we're going to say here is my safe path on that we've created from here.

301
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.750
So it's going to be my safe path,

302
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.950
Onda.

303
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:51.020
The next thing we're gonna say is my full name on we're gonna say,

304
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.400
I think that's it's actually excuse We heard the Excel SX already,

305
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.750
So they go.

306
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.780
So let's let's run through that code up to their on.

307
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.020
Make sure that that works.

308
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.400
So let's just pick t m o too and step through the code.

309
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.820
Hopefully,

310
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.010
that's all in shot.

311
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.210
So we're going to say F eight f eight F eight.

312
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.760
So captured Territory manager Timo to file name.

313
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.270
That's where it is safe.

314
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.910
Tough is in Jane.

315
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.970
That's name of our original book.

316
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.320
Moved down the cell.

317
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.750
You can see that's just happened.

318
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.000
Sheets active,

319
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.960
Seldom value Copy now.

320
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.780
Might have to bring this back to the front.

321
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.920
So they released him 02 on.

322
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.990
We're going to save that and hopefully they go.

323
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.090
2016

324
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.970
10 2070 m 02 We have just created a new workbook,

325
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.380
and the first thing I'm gonna do is going delete that because as we keep creating these

326
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:41.890
things,

327
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.590
it's going to start to try and save over the tub.

328
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.150
OK,

329
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.260
so that's our first part complete.

330
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.650
We've managed to create the new workbook.

331
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.430
Okay,

332
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.410
The second part is to go back to the original workbook aan den.

333
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.490
Select the next files.

334
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:56.830
OK,

335
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.280
so let's just come back to excel.

336
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.740
There we go.

337
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.310
So that's the first part.

338
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.850
Completing the second part.

339
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.410
Go back to the original workbook.

340
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:09.070
So what we're gonna say is workbooks open rackets and we already have the name of this

341
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.410
saved his masterwork.

342
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:16.710
Book masterwork book close brackets dot Activate.

343
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.450
You'll remember that you have to activate these.

344
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.330
So that's going to take us back to this sheet.

345
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.360
Just here.

346
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:23.980
Now,

347
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.670
once we're here,

348
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.390
what we wanna do is have already captured This is moved down another cell.

349
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.630
So long induced.

350
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.800
Choose that one on pace that in there.

351
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.350
So we've come back to the sheet and we're now going to move down to here,

352
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.490
which will be site three on.

353
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.440
This is where we're gonna add our loop.

354
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.700
So what we're going to say is gonna say,

355
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:53.060
Do while Theo the active cell don't value doesn't equal blank,

356
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.900
and then I'm gonna close off that do loop there.

357
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.140
So there's our loop.

358
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.330
Now.

359
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.050
What we're gonna do is continue toe loop and capture these cheat names until we've reached

360
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.900
the end of them.

361
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.910
Now what we're gonna do so we can reference the sheet by its index number is add cans and

362
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.890
say X equals X plus one and you'll see why in just a second,

363
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.090
let me just go back.

364
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.270
Thats helping DMX is an insurgent in X as into Jenna.

365
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:23.830
So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna increase this buy one,

366
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.520
then the next thing we want to do,

367
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.850
it's still that code where we copied a sheet and added it to an existing workbook so we

368
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.660
don't need this select thing.

369
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.250
But what we do need is this thing,

370
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.470
this code just here.

371
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.750
So I'm just gonna copy that Only pace that into a do loop.

372
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.640
So there is that code.

373
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.610
Let me just line it up.

374
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.050
Okay,

375
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.820
so sheets site three.

376
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.020
No,

377
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.530
we don't say sheets site three.

378
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.240
We wanted to say sheets the active cell value.

379
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.550
So we replace that with active cell,

380
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.500
don't you on?

381
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.300
That's going to give us our sheet name.

382
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:10.090
And there we want a coffee before work books and we're going to choose my file name my file

383
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.690
name because we already know what we've saved it as.

384
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.900
And then we want toe.

385
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.590
Copy this before the first workbook.

386
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.350
So what we're gonna say is before sheets X.

387
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.930
Okay.

388
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.390
Now,

389
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.790
the next thing we need to do is come back to the Sheikh because remember that the new sheet

390
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.700
will no be selected and go through this loop again just to make sure that if there are any

391
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.610
other tubs on there,

392
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.440
so I'm just gonna copy.

393
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.060
Where's that?

394
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.380
That that's what we want to take.

395
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.700
We want to come back here.

396
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.920
So masterwork,

397
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.520
book stocked,

398
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.210
Activate.

399
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:42.710
And the game.

400
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.440
We're gonna want to move down the cell.

401
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.490
So again,

402
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.770
let's go through that Copy,

403
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.080
Andi Paste.

404
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.570
Okay,

405
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.830
so let's step through that code and make sure that that works.

406
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.250
So let's be on T m o,

407
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.650
too.

408
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.540
And let's step through this code.

409
00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:57.750
Bump,

410
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:57.950
bump,

411
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.130
bump,

412
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.340
bump,

413
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:58.550
bump,

414
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.730
bump,

415
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.070
bump.

416
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.520
We know the first part of it works on.

417
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.950
We're now down to the second path.

418
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.200
Well,

419
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.070
we got there quickly,

420
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.000
so we selected this sheet again.

421
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.920
The master workbook.

422
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.610
We've moved in,

423
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.920
so we're on site three.

424
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:16.460
They were going to copy site three on paste it into my file name before sheets X,

425
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.510
which will be one.

426
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.700
And then we're gonna come back here,

427
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.950
so that should have done that.

428
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.790
And then we're gonna come back here and we're gonna loop again.

429
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.480
And now we've reached the end.

430
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.100
This loop should end,

431
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.830
and it does.

432
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:28.200
OK,

433
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.040
so stop.

434
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.500
Let's go and have a look at that.

435
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:30.990
Okay,

436
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.420
So here's our new sheet.

437
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.870
And here we have our two tabs.

438
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.900
So we have a summary sheet and we have a site three sheet now,

439
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.500
just realised rather than copy before what we want to do is copy after,

440
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.200
isn't it?

441
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.780
So we can have it at the end.

442
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.050
Okay,

443
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.860
so we're gonna copy after now.

444
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.190
Here's the complication.

445
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.850
Let's have a look.

446
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.000
If we looked at she to summary,

447
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.100
you can see that this is reference in territory,

448
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.350
man.

449
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.840
Just part two dot excellence.

450
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.790
And with square brackets.

451
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:05.240
So that is going to be the third part where we sought out that link issue.

452
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.640
Here's our new book.

453
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.440
So because this is quite a long lecture,

454
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.450
but recovering quite a lot of ground in here.

455
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.240
What we need to do now is do a search to look for Where is it?

456
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.330
We needed to do search to look for this,

457
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:24.060
which is square brackets territory manages part two Doc XLs em on square brackets again.

458
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:30.780
So what we're gonna do is we're going to copy that just so we can see what the sin taxes.

459
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.390
We don't want the potteries.

460
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.270
We just want the square bracket.

461
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.170
So I'm just going to copy that to the clipboard.

462
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.120
Now I'm going to record a new macro.

463
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.620
Doesn't matter what's going to be called.

464
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.160
I'm gonna select all the cells,

465
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.500
hit control and f there.

466
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.170
It is totally mentions Part two,

467
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.030
and I will replace that with absolutely nothing.

468
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.300
Replace all okay.

469
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.420
And clothes.

470
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.350
And I'm just going to select cell a one.

471
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.900
And that's no broken the link with the original file.

472
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.700
Okay,

473
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.490
so let's go and have a look at the macro that that created.

474
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.800
So stop recording.

475
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:09.300
I'm not gonna flip back to hear view Properties window,

476
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.840
and it will be living there so it would go macro seven them scoops.

477
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.140
Just gonna copy all of that and again dump it over to he eyes.

478
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.060
That's why we're working.

479
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.360
Yeah.

480
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.350
This is why we're working.

481
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.860
Okay,

482
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.580
Macro seven.

483
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:30.470
So this essentially is the code that we want to use who want to use the cells select on.

484
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.650
Then we want to replace that string.

485
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:37.140
So what we're gonna do first is we're just gonna copy all of that Weaken.

486
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.040
Butcher it in a minute.

487
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.510
So we're into our third party.

488
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.620
Okay?

489
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:41.940
Now,

490
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.860
what we do need to do is build that string.

491
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.920
This one here,

492
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.090
square brackets toe tremendous.

493
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.350
Part two on a square brackets again.

494
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.110
So here,

495
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:57.440
I'm gonna I'm gonna call this my replace my replace on my replaces.

496
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.600
Gonna equal quotes.

497
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.550
Open square brackets.

498
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.200
Andi on.

499
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.350
Remember that this?

500
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.820
We already know the name of this.

501
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.450
It's called Master Workbook Has toe work.

502
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.920
Book Andi quotes square brackets.

503
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.310
So now we have the my replace.

504
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:23.170
Now all we need to do is replace this here with my replace.

505
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:23.520
Oops.

506
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.520
Delete that one as well.

507
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.210
My replace.

508
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.090
There we go on.

509
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.810
I'm also going to add that up to here is Well,

510
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.450
Tim,

511
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.970
my replace a string.

512
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.060
Okay,

513
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:39.860
right.

514
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:46.520
So that will no do the find and replace for the sheet that we currently have selected.

515
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.250
Now what we do need to do is loop through all the sheets on here to make sure that we

516
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.090
captured them all.

517
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.160
So we need to wrap this in a loop.

518
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:55.700
So what?

519
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.360
One do before the or before we get to the cell select to say,

520
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.340
for X equals 12 on,

521
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.270
we want to do it for each of the sheet.

522
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.410
So we're going to say sheets dot Kent.

523
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.850
So however many sheets we have that so many times we're going toe loop through this,

524
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:18.180
I'm just going to say next X okay,

525
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.830
so that should do exactly what we wanted to do.

526
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.620
Okay,

527
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.990
so one of the things that we do need to do here is select this sheet bites index numbers.

528
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.940
So I'm gonna say sheets go from rackets X.

529
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.480
And remember,

530
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.660
that's going to be iterating by one east only passionate this loop dot select.

531
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.660
Okay,

532
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.610
so that's gonna make sure we cycle through all of those that's going to select the cells

533
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.220
that's going to do the find and replace.

534
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.980
Then finally,

535
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.850
let's go back to a one because a ones nice entirely on,

536
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.170
Then we're going toe loop again,

537
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.360
and that's going to break all of the links.

538
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.870
And the final part that we need to do is we need to go back to sheet one,

539
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.720
because that's a very good place to start on the final parties sheet.

540
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.290
Let's say one dot select.

541
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.170
That's going to take us back to the first sheet.

542
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.330
These will be in a different order when we run through them,

543
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:15.360
and then we're gonna have to do our file save again.

544
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.590
So where's that code?

545
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:21.660
That's that just there because we want to re save the file.

546
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.390
No,

547
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.330
because we've made changes to this.

548
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.550
What we're gonna do is we're gonna turn off the display alerts,

549
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.830
and that's going to stop it saying,

550
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.080
Hey,

551
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.000
do you want to save the changes that you just made?

552
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.050
So what we're gonna say is application Adult,

553
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.160
uh,

554
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:47.000
display A lot equals false Andi.

555
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.250
That's why I didn't get the thing is a con type application application.

556
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.080
Display lights equals false copy That's going to stop us getting that.

557
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.320
Hey,

558
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.650
do you really want to save this message?

559
00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.790
And at the end here,

560
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.160
we're going to send them back on on.

561
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.760
The final thing we need to do is close the file.

562
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.780
So somewhere up here in the original code,

563
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:15.300
there we go active window dot close copy and come down to the bottom here and then close.

564
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.700
I'll tidy that up in a second.

565
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.580
Okay,

566
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.520
so that should be all four elements.

567
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.990
So let me just close this.

568
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.640
Do you want to save?

569
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.200
No.

570
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.860
Let me just delete the file.

571
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.660
Jane,

572
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.880
we go delete.

573
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.990
Okay.

574
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.580
Let's have a quick thing through that cone.

575
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.640
Make sure that we've done it.

576
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:31.930
Right.

577
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.640
So number this checks that were on row one,

578
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.380
That's all good.

579
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.400
We know this part works for creating the new workbook.

580
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.780
Um,

581
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.950
this part part the second that loops,

582
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.850
ruin ads all the other things here before we go to the my replace.

583
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.650
What we want to do is make sure we've selected the new full name again.

584
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:55.920
So we can say work books on this one is called my file name,

585
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.460
isn't it because it's the new one.

586
00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.130
My phone lane Don't active,

587
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:00.900
Bates.

588
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.920
I can type.

589
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.540
Activate.

590
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.110
It's a little early in the morning for May.

591
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.110
Then we're going to Dio.

592
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.420
We're gonna build a string for the find and replace.

593
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.690
We're going toe loop through all of those using the sheet index number.

594
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.220
So one on the first pass to on the second past select all the cells,

595
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.630
Do the find and replace selection.

596
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:20.920
One just started up,

597
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.330
Turn off the display alerts and save it.

598
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.550
So let's select that one Onda click over here.

599
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:31.600
I'm gonna close that and hopefully get this so most of its in view and let's step through.

600
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.760
So we have a total manager Rafael Neymar Safe path.

601
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.950
Everything works all the way through to here on.

602
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.150
We're going to carry on going through this on that is the end of that loop.

603
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.550
We're going to go back to a new workbook.

604
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.940
There's a new workbook we're gonna build Are replaced string,

605
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.350
which is going to be square brackets.

606
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.620
In the name of that workbook on,

607
00:24:51.620 --> 00:25:00.130
we're going to go here Sheets one x select on We are going to select all the cells do ever

608
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.720
find and replace select Sell a three,

609
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.820
Let's say a one just to be pedantic Next X loop through.

610
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.050
So we know going to cite three that sound that she eats like told cells.

611
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.160
Do the final replace.

612
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.670
Select a one.

613
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.940
Go back to sheet number one scale.

614
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:25.380
It's false saved the workbook turned display alerts on unclos workbook and end sub.

615
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.800
So let's go and have a look and make sure that that worked.

616
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.250
Here's a fall we just created,

617
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:35.140
and here we have t m 02 summary way at the front on we have site three.

618
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.160
So let's just make sure that that does work.

619
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.320
Let's just change that to 4 50 So there you go.

620
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.470
That's destroyed the link between the two workbooks s.

621
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.310
So let's just run that one more time.

622
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.560
Doing bother saving the changes and this sound,

623
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.760
Let's say T m 01 and just hit the button.

624
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.090
But my mama Mama Mama bump on.

625
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:52.540
There you go.

626
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.810
So t m one should be Rod.

627
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.540
So let's come up to hear Ron.

628
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.080
And there's our file and they go Timo,

629
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:08.550
One summary site whose look after you x after site 12 on six.

630
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:12.250
And hopefully we have no links to the old workbook.

631
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:12.730
OK,

632
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.400
fantastic.

633
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.610
That works perfectly.

634
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.310
Now one thing to do.

635
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.480
Let me just close that and show you something else that we've covered this in level two.

636
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.410
So if you've done level to my apologies for repeating this,

637
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.110
if you haven't done 11 to,

638
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.790
here's a neat trick.

639
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.400
Now,

640
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.530
with with these summaries,

641
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:35.080
this particular value referenced site three by name on,

642
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:35.700
Then sell.

643
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.330
See one.

644
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:42.010
So site three exclamation point C one And it read this cell just here.

645
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:48.040
But we didn't have that problem with these because what I did was I built an indirect

646
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.490
reference using the name in cell a three.

647
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.530
So what I said was some open rackets.

648
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.640
Indirect.

649
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.600
And then I built that string as a can Cassin ation.

650
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:08.380
Using the single quote Onda a three Andi single quotes exclamation point B B on that became

651
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.070
an indirect reference,

652
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.000
which we then summed on.

653
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.230
That means you wouldn't have to break the links because that will go with you when you cop

654
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.170
with sheets over.

655
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:17.740
Now,

656
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.150
that was quite a long lecture,

657
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.890
but we did cover an awful lot in there.

658
00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.590
Hopefully that was of some use.

659
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.080
And it was always if you have any questions,

660
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.970
just ask.

661
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:26.880
Have a great day.

662
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.850
Thanks very much.
