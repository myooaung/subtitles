1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,630
guys,

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,150
from Welcome back Now,

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,320
in this section what?

5
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,220
We're gonna have a look at our the U D efs.

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,400
The user defined functions.

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,830
Now,

8
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,490
as we know,

9
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,360
there are loads and loads literally hundreds of functions already built into excel as a

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,660
standard and eventually something like the some function which we can see just here.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,410
So when we type equals some,

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,050
some is a function on now.

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,790
Years ago,

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,050
Excel didn't have anywhere near the number of functions that it has currently s o There was

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,850
a need to create a function specifically for re users need no.

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,550
Since then,

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,770
most things have never been added as a standard.

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,900
But this still could be an instance where you need to perform a specific calculation that

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,250
is unique to your need.

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:48,600
Now,

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,890
just give you an example.

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,180
Years ago,

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,210
pie wasn't included as a standard function in Excel.

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,750
So you if you wanted to calculate pi,

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,250
you needed to create a UDF use of defined function.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,110
So part is going to be one of the first things that we have a look at.

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,240
But firstly,

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,390
a couple of things to remember functions live in standard modules.

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,060
So here you can just say that I've added module one just a standard function,

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,330
just like we've done with the sub's up to this point.

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,140
So as a function is always coded in a standard module thing,

32
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:31,270
number one thing number two functions can be called by their name in the workbook in which

33
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,680
you created them.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,730
So if you created a function called my clever function,

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,780
you could only call that from the workbook in which you created it on where it saved.

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,520
Or if you have that workbook open,

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,900
you can use it in another open workbook.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,390
But you will have to change the way you call it.

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,750
But we'll come to that shortly.

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,790
Okay,

41
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,750
so they go.

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,530
They use defined functions,

43
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,190
live in a standard module on They differ slightly from the subroutines that we've looked at

44
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,030
up to this point,

45
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,050
inasmuch as they begin with the word function.

46
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,680
So instead of saying sub,

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,790
we will say function.

48
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,210
So we will say function pie.

49
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,750
And yes,

50
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,180
I know that's not how you spell pie.

51
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,770
Now,

52
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,010
what we're gonna do here,

53
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,580
we're going to specify which arguments are going to be required.

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,390
So I'm just going to say my value.

55
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,000
And I'm going to say that as a very and because I don't know whether it's going to be a

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,780
long number or a number with a load of decimal places after it.

57
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,520
So variant is going to capture all of those when they hit enter,

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,350
you can see that end function is already being had added,

59
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,650
just like when you type sub the end sub sortie added.

60
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,500
So here we go.

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,810
We've now got the shell of our function.

62
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,760
Now what we need to do is add some code into it.

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,190
No together return value.

64
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,550
What you need to say is the return value is going to be the same as the function name.

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,100
So here the function name is pie.

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,250
So I'm gonna type Pi equals and then I'm going to say this argument,

67
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:13,550
the my value multiplied by I think I can't remember what bias to that many decimal place.

68
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,360
I think it's 3.1415159 something like that.

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,180
So they go.

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,730
So now that is our function complete.

71
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,300
So we have function pie,

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,320
my value that is going to be the arguments.

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,320
That is what we're going to perform a calculation on and we're same pie because that's the

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,170
name of the function equals my value multiplied by 3.14159 So here,

75
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,440
when they come over to excel,

76
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:47,270
I can and type equals pie and you can see that that is now a function within Excel on when

77
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,440
I double click it or well,

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,250
he's open brackets we can know Put the arguments in now Number one drawback of custom

79
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,030
functions You do not get tool tips,

80
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,150
so you're gonna have to remember what the arguments are.

81
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,300
So now if I said pie 10 close brackets hit enter,

82
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,070
you can see that the calculation of pie for 10 is three point.

83
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,780
Where is it?

84
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,500
31.4159 I need new glasses.

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,190
Okay,

86
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,020
so that's a very simple demonstration of how you do it.

87
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,110
So let's have look at another function.

88
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,530
Let me just make that look a little bit pretty like that.

89
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,360
So Okay,

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,530
so an ex function show is going to be square me.

91
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,580
That almost is definitely a square function in excel.

92
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,120
But we're going to say square me.

93
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,790
So here's a new function.

94
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,490
So this time what we're going to say I haven't said what we're gonna use.

95
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,010
We're going to use my value as a variant again.

96
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,570
So here they go square me,

97
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,750
my value as variant So say square me because it has to have the same name as the function.

98
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,370
Thanks a equals and it's going to be my value multiplied by my value.

99
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,760
On day you go.

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,050
It's a simple Is that so?

101
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,480
Here,

102
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,680
if I said equals our on There you go.

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,550
We can sniff c square me.

104
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,420
If I said five and closed off the rockets hit,

105
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,730
Enter,

106
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,150
they go.

107
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,270
The square of five is 25 similarly I could actually reference that self.

108
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:27,130
So you could say square me Open rackets point to that cell closer rackets and hit ends.

109
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,850
That may go the square off 25 s,

110
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,350
625

111
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,030
Okay,

112
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,320
I'll see you in the next lecture where we can have a look at another simple use for the use

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,260
of defined function.

114
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,100
I'll see you there
