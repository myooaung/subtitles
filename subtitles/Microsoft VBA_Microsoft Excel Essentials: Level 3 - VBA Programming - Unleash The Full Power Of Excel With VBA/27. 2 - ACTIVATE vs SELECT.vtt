00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
Okay,

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.740
guys.

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.780
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.150
Now,

5
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.140
let's have a look at what the difference between select method and the activate method is

6
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.100
now you'll notice in the comments or is some explanatory notes just here,

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.180
so that will help you to understand what it is.

8
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.080
So with this data set that we have here,

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.300
let's have a look what happens.

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.250
So if I press f eight,

11
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.570
you can see that a nine gets selected.

12
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.150
But if I click off here and hit after 11 and press F eight in here,

13
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.970
you know,

14
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.390
and get selected again.

15
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.380
So in this particular instance,

16
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.980
it looks like rain j nine dot select a range A no induct activate achieved exactly the same

17
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.520
thing.

18
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.510
So let's have a look at what the difference is.

19
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.210
If we were to say range.

20
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.280
Where are we a put quotes?

21
00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.320
I have a five to a 12 dot Celek script.

22
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.730
I can't type select.

23
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.030
Don't select a man.

24
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.290
I type range a nine dot activated copy clicking that Andi.

25
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.740
In fact,

26
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.570
I'm gonna get rid of this code now,

27
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.590
and there were just gonna look at this.

28
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.070
So we're going to select the range a five to a 12 member can activate a nine.

29
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.290
So when they step through,

30
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.990
there goes my selection.

31
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.610
Notice what happens in Excel when I hit F eight A nine has Bean activated,

32
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.110
though.

33
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.290
Although we have all of these self selected,

34
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.540
the active cell is now a nine on That is the difference.

35
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.100
Okay,

36
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.550
I'll see you in the next lecture.
