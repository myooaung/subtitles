1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Okay,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:02,550
guys.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,450
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:03,830
Now,

5
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,970
before we get into actually creating the presentation normally on the front page of every

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,830
presentation than I've ever seen,

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,870
it will have a title on the name of the presenter.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,410
Now,

9
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,300
as the name of the presenter doesn't actually live,

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,690
you know,

11
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,330
Bay State and what we're going to need to do is at an input box to get the user to end to

12
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:23,750
that.

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,680
So to do that,

14
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,870
what we're gonna do is create a new module level variable,

15
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,580
and we'll call it Prez.

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,370
Name a string on this will be where the variable where the presenters name is stored and

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:43,320
hear what we're going to say is president equals input box input box.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,490
Oh,

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,330
from rackets a prompt on.

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,690
We're going to say something like,

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,660
Please and,

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,110
uh,

23
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,950
the present.

24
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,400
Same here,

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,750
Close brackets.

26
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,040
We're gonna have a prompt say's who is the presenter or something like that.

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,980
So who is the presenter?

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,350
I normally like to do these in upper case.

29
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,200
So who is for the promise anyway?

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,130
Who is the presenter presenter?

31
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:20,370
Close records on close quotes on that is going to allow the user to enter.

32
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,370
Obviously you can have been error trapped here.

33
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,160
So you can say actually feel equals blank and the code.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,010
But we're going to assume that this is going to go in,

35
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,360
find so he out.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,620
We're going to capture the name of the presenter,

37
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,100
So capture,

38
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,190
uh,

39
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:40,500
that name of the prison on.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,150
There you go.

41
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,200
So that's the very pet first bit of code we need.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,750
But if we have a look at our source data,

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,150
we can see that we have different sheets.

44
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,260
Now,

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,200
what we want to do is make sure that we are on the right sheet when we're copying and pull

46
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,260
in data from here.

47
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,180
So perhaps one of the other things that we should do his view The Project Explorer Get the

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,410
name of sheet one,

49
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,070
which turns out to be sheet to make sure we are on the right cheat.

50
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,650
So select the correct sheets,

51
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,910
Correct.

52
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,800
I can't for the life of me select the correct sheet and this is VB name sheets to I think

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,950
sheet too.

54
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,720
Cheat too dot Select.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,590
Okay.

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,120
And then we're ready to add our first slide.

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,860
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
