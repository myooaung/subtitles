00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Okay,

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.650
guys.

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.660
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.040
Now,

5
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.540
what I've done is I've made the subway just created private on,

6
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.460
have carpet it in its entirety pace.

7
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.250
It's underneath.

8
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.840
And this time I've called it Cancun on I have changed the address that we are looking at.

9
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.560
So obviously that particular Web pages dedicated to the weather in room on this one is

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.840
going to be dedicated to the weather in Mexico.

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.390
Cancun on.

12
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.020
Similarly,

13
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.650
I have also done London on rename the sub to London,

14
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.610
and I have changed.

15
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.970
The website address is looking for to the actual address for the London weather,

16
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.180
which is whether slash UK slash London.

17
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.450
What I'm gonna do is I'm actually just going to record all of those websites that we've

18
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.570
used right on top of this code just so you can see them when you download the file.

19
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.030
Okay,

20
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.720
so this is the data set.

21
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.420
Four room.

22
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.050
This is what we returned for room.

23
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.450
Know if we have a look at this,

24
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.690
we can see that we have this strain line of data down here at line 33.

25
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.320
Now,

26
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.280
consequently,

27
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.760
when Cancun rooms,

28
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.270
what I want to do is begin the data at a 33.

29
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.370
So it pastes over this data here,

30
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.950
so I'm just gonna hit play.

31
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.250
It's going to start importing the data from Cancun or from the Web server for the

32
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.780
weathering Cancun on.

33
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.120
While that's important,

34
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.390
that's imported already.

35
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.850
That was extremely quick.

36
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.370
Right?

37
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.770
Okay,

38
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.760
I'll talk through all of these when we refresh in the next one.

39
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.220
Now,

40
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.430
the one thing we do need to do here,

41
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.380
because with Cancun we have.

42
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.120
If we look at the data set,

43
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.890
we can see that it's fairly even.

44
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.770
We have our conditions there.

45
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.450
We have our headings in here.

46
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.560
Then we have the day name on a date and a name and a date in the day name and the date all

47
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.250
the way down.

48
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.440
But then he goes slightly out of kilter here.

49
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.090
So what we want to do a soon as we've finished importing our second data set is delete this

50
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.660
line on this line.

51
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.190
So our data set becomes uniform.

52
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.330
So that's rose 33 on rose 34.

53
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.950
So at the bottom of Cancun,

54
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:18.980
I'm going to say Rose Onda se 33 2 34 I think is 33 to 34 close quotes dot Delete.

55
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.170
And that is gonna make all of our data for the 1st 2 tables perfectly uniform.

56
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.900
So what I'm gonna do is delete everything.

57
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.260
Yes,

58
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.890
I know,

59
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.790
Andi.

60
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.020
I'm gonna come back to our code and I'm gonna create a run order at the top on.

61
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.400
I am going to say I'll make this a sub because we're going to assign it to the church.

62
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.830
The pivot child shortly on what am I going to call this?

63
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.040
A.

64
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:53.310
Let's call this my amazing Web query Boom on their began on.

65
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.420
We are going to run room first and we're going to run Cancun next.

66
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.060
So let's just run that code all the way through.

67
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.050
And while that's running,

68
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.710
I'll talk you through some of the finer points of this code.

69
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.110
Now a mind machine which sits quite a way away from my router.

70
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.290
The data takes about between 12 and 20 seconds per site retrieval to grab the data.

71
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.050
Now,

72
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.790
I have experimented with this particular site at Ramen out some of these different lines of

73
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.650
code to see which ones are the things that take up all the time.

74
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.160
And if I'm honest,

75
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.340
even if I cut it down to the absolute bone.

76
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.150
I can only take a couple of seconds out of this.

77
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.620
So in honesty,

78
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.970
I would just leave it exactly as it is.

79
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.350
Obviously,

80
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.150
if you're performing 200 queries,

81
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.390
you may want to revisit that on the way to revisit that is remote.

82
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.970
Each line individually,

83
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.880
Run your code and test your performance.

84
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.320
O clock,

85
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.550
What time we start to clock what time it finished?

86
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.340
The one thing that you absolutely,

87
00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.630
never can do without,

88
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.210
by the way,

89
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.750
is this one here?

90
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.660
Because that's where it actually runs.

91
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.000
The query so to clear is run.

92
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.970
And here we have our first data set,

93
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.070
which is Rome.

94
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.380
And you can see now that it follows a standard patent all the way down.

95
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.280
It goes day,

96
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.930
date,

97
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.370
date,

98
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.490
date all the way down to here.

99
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.400
Now what we want to do with a Rome?

100
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.620
No.

101
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.360
We've done Rome.

102
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.030
That's London,

103
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.330
isn't it?

104
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.580
Next,

105
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.230
what want to do with London is begin pasting the day at a 63 so you can see I'm starting at

106
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.450
a 63.

107
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.110
But similarly,

108
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.790
I want to delete the last two lines.

109
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.990
So here with Cancun,

110
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.940
we pasted at 33 on we deleted 33 34 on DSO with London.

111
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:58.040
What we want to do is paste that 63 on we wanted deletes 63 64 soon 63 64.

112
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.720
And I'm gonna add London to our run order up here.

113
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.550
So London.

114
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.300
And I'm just gonna portia second while they execute that code and we'll come back and have

115
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.000
a look at it in just a few seconds.

116
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.930
Okay,

117
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.300
guys,

118
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.120
welcome back.

119
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.210
And I'm just going to resize that they in fact,

120
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.290
something probably auto size.

121
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.980
And then we got rid of all those white things.

122
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.010
And here is our data data in a perfectly uniform manner.

123
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.980
We actually need to delete that one as well.

124
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.380
I need to add that at the end.

125
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.150
Eso I need to delete line 93.

126
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.990
I'll add that to the code in a second.

127
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.270
Right,

128
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.540
So here's and days out Nice and uniforms.

129
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.930
Now,

130
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.850
what we're gonna do in the next lecture is looking at Tide in.

131
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.340
This sucks.

132
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.530
If you pay attention to what's actually happened,

133
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.540
we have a day and all the data on that line.

134
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.580
But the date is on its own here with nothing else.

135
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.290
So what we want to do is move this data up to here for all of these.

136
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.800
Okay,

137
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.020
I'll see you in the next lecture,

138
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.650
but we'll cover how to do just that.

139
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.450
I'll see you then.
