00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
Okay,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,970
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,860
Now you know how to do just about everything with Selznick,

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,730
you'll know how to navigate around them,

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,470
selecting individual cells.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,150
Ranges of cells go to the ends of ranges,

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,710
select entire ranges.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,350
Cells is pretty much covered.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,920
Now we're into work sheets,

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,000
and they are these little tabs at the bottom of your workbook.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,050
As you well know.

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,600
Now I've copied some code from down below,

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,260
pace it into the basics,

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,530
testing this.

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,580
And here we're working with the active sheet on.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,480
Remember that the active sheet is this sheet that we are looking at just as with active

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:40,890
cell,

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,890
active sheet is exactly the same thing.

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,200
But applying to the sheet,

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,310
we are going to go to next,

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,730
and we're going to apply the method dot select.

22
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,350
So I'm guessing without even having seen this code before,

23
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,190
you know exactly what that's going to do.

24
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,280
So I'm just gonna hit f eight on notice.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,570
What happens in excel?

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,680
Boom.

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,010
We go to the next sheet.

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,100
So sales NATO was the active sheet we chose the next property on.

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,410
We so chose the select method.

30
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:09,750
Now,

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,340
similarly,

32
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,110
we are back to sheet previous select So the active sheet?

33
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,410
No,

34
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,950
she two previous go to the left and apply the select method.

35
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,450
So when they execute that,

36
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,200
there you go.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,320
We can move left and right use in the next on the previous Now,

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,130
you also could call a sheet directly by its sheet name Or,

39
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,620
more specifically,

40
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,260
it's tab name,

41
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,600
So you can see here the next sheet that we have the next sheet,

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,150
in order after sales data,

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,220
has a tub name of sheet,

44
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,650
too.

45
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,070
So this code,

46
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,390
say sheets,

47
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,040
specifies the tub name on uses the select methods,

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,650
so sheets sheet to dot select.

49
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,620
There you go.

50
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,590
Fantastic.

51
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,670
That works beautifully until a user comes into here and says,

52
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,850
I don't want to be called sheet to anymore.

53
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,630
I want to be that to be called Let's call it my sheets,

54
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,000
you go fantastic.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,210
And that's great for the use.

56
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,140
That theme user knows what's happening.

57
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,670
Andi,

58
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,160
I'm just going to a little of that code.

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,350
The user knows what's happening.

60
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,480
It means something to them until your code executes on.

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,580
Then this happens subscript out of range.

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,610
Runtime era nine.

63
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:30,660
I am looking for an object that no longer exists so there is an inherent floor with calling

64
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,300
sheikhs by their tab name.

65
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,690
Now,

66
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,230
luckily,

67
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,390
we have a way around that which we're gonna come to in the next.

68
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,670
Like,

69
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,450
OK,

70
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
