1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,630
Okay,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:02,970
guys.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,580
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,940
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,480
Lecture.

6
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,060
Now,

7
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,860
this one is piece of code that I've had for a long time.

8
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,160
I can remember,

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,580
and I wrote it to be honest with you,

10
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,950
but don't solve a very interesting problem.

11
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,630
Now.

12
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,430
You may have come across this somewhere in your Excel.

13
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:18,930
Korea.

14
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,250
You have a workbook.

15
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,760
It was perfectly well,

16
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
It's certain size.

17
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,250
It's very manageable.

18
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,580
And you have it for days and days and weeks,

19
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:26,920
weeks,

20
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,520
months and months,

21
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,610
maybe years and years.

22
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,370
And all of a sudden it explodes in size,

23
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,990
and you have absolutely no idea why that is.

24
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,620
Now,

25
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,700
if that she has multiple tabs,

26
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,030
that is,

27
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,950
the workbook has multiple sheets.

28
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,660
The problem usually resides in one of those sheets.

29
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,190
But finding which one it is is a question off,

30
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,970
either using HTML,

31
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,390
which I find a little bit complicated for the task,

32
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:59,230
or individually save enough each one of those sheets to its own folder on vet in the file

33
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,330
size of that.

34
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,450
And that's precisely what this piece of code does.

35
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,690
So as a downloadable resource on this,

36
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,470
like you're gonna find something called Sq may for two in Magic Sheikh Sizer enable macros

37
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,240
on.

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,090
It's gonna look something like this.

39
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,850
All I'm gonna do This is how you're gonna operate it.

40
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,050
I'm just going to select everything hit control and see and close it up.

41
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,240
And I do want to keep what's in the clipboard.

42
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,250
And here is something we used in level three,

43
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,050
but I've added a few extra tabs.

44
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,340
If we look on here,

45
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,230
we can see that this deliberately is now about 10 Meg,

46
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,960
which is quite big for an excel file.

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,580
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna come back to excel.

48
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,530
We're gonna hit old N F 11 to bring up the visual.

49
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,620
Basic editor.

50
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,980
We're going to come to insert.

51
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,010
We're gonna get to module.

52
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,740
We're just gonna pace that code in this window.

53
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,450
Just here.

54
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,340
Now,

55
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,840
this violence 10 Meg.

56
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,660
But we don't actually know why you're here.

57
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,040
So what I'm gonna do is just hit the play button and then that is going to calculate which

58
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,600
of these sheets are causing us an issue.

59
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,040
So he's gonna leave that co two room for a few seconds on.

60
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,150
I'll talk you through.

61
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,420
Had the code works in just a minute okay,

62
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,110
We should be that.

63
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,030
So let's go back to the the file.

64
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,640
And here we go.

65
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,560
We know of new.

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,490
She called my jazzy sheet.

67
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,880
Details on this code is gonna work as long as you don't already have a sheet called my

68
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,200
Jazzy she detail.

69
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,130
So here we go.

70
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,690
My Jessie,

71
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,830
she details is 11 kilobytes hr table is 33 v lookups is 64.

72
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,260
Formatting is 39 here at 9.5 megabytes.

73
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,250
Is this couch sheet?

74
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,580
So now we know that this is the sheet that is bloated.

75
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,190
All the rest are fine Now,

76
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:52,870
the easiest way to solve this is to in my experience is you just copy everything you have

77
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,210
in this sheet copies into a new sheet,

78
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,590
but use paste specials,

79
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,560
just the values,

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,670
and then go back and color meta time Or wrote a time,

81
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,250
reintroduce your calculations,

82
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,300
and then hopefully everything will fix itself.

83
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,830
I have deliberately made this fall 10.

84
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,130
Meghan,

85
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,200
I'll show you have So we've got this one that's got all kinds of conditional formatting

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,770
attached,

87
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,240
which is reasonably small.

88
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,410
We have table,

89
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,440
which is reasonably small,

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,900
but this one is the problem.

91
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,100
What we have is the HR for use in level three.

92
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,680
It's got a couple of 100 entries on.

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,520
I've added a new calculation.

94
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,140
The end called age.

95
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,700
Now,

96
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,890
if I had 200 calculations,

97
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,740
one fridge,

98
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,300
they each record,

99
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,460
we would be good.

100
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,720
But when I deliberately did here was,

101
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,080
I also pasted the same calculation down to the bottom.

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,710
So I have almost or over one million calculations that they don't actually need.

103
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,530
So that's one thing to check for.

104
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,040
If your calculations go all the way down to the bottom of your sheet,

105
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,160
what,

106
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,180
you could do it just come down,

107
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,170
delete them.

108
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,010
Okay,

109
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,160
so let's have a look at that code in action now is very straightforward.

110
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,360
It's all simple stuff.

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
We're gonna have a temp file,

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
which is set up as a string on an X,

113
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,110
which is just a simple counter.

114
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,820
We can turn off the calculations to make the code on fast and turn off the screen of dating

115
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,260
so we can't see you took dating then.

116
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,720
This is basic recorded macro stuff,

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,410
which we just tied it up a little bit.

118
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,560
We're going to add a new sheet and rename sheets.

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,710
Add before worksheets One that weighed always appears at the beginning,

120
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,240
beginning to give the active sheet name values the sheet.

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,550
We've just added my jazzy sheet details.

122
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,320
Then we're gonna add in a heading through a one through D one she named sizing by size and

123
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,190
kilobytes sizing megabytes.

124
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,100
Then we have a simple loop for X equals 12 worksheets count.

125
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,980
So however many sheets we have in this workbook this situation is going to pass through

126
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,060
that many times.

127
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,800
So on the first pass through worksheets X on the first pass will be one on the second pass

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,450
will be to copy.

129
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,140
Now,

130
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,850
here,

131
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,670
I'm going to save it to attempt file on the temp file is going to be stored in C slash

132
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:22,550
users slash allen allen slash desktop Obviously changed this to the path of your desktop.

133
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:31,460
Andi the active she name Andi docked x l s x So that is gonna be the name on path of my

134
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,250
temp file.

135
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,390
Then I'm gonna take the active workbook.

136
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,070
That is the one we have just created a copy off and save it as my temp file.

137
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,670
And then I'm gonna close it.

138
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,800
And now I'm going to say in the sheets.

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,920
My jazzy sheet details range a one fares next cell and excel up.

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,150
That is basically take me right up to below that title.

141
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:00,730
I want to record the worksheets ex dot name and that's going to give me the name of that

142
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,490
workbook,

143
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,650
which is the name of the first worksheet.

144
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,900
And then similarly,

145
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,950
on the next line,

146
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,350
this one just here,

147
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,400
the one in blue.

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,300
We're gonna do exactly the same.

149
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,280
But this thing we're going to go in column B on,

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,640
we're going to go up and we're going to say Value file length.

151
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,940
My temp file,

152
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:25,870
Andi Bites and file win is going to give us the size off the file in bites on the assembly

153
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:25,870
.

154
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,750
We just doing maths for the next one.

155
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,110
So it's exactly the same thing.

156
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,990
But this time we're going to do it in kilobytes.

157
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,170
So we just rammed him by 1024 on,

158
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,600
then simply at the bottom.

159
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,020
We're just going to do exactly the same thing whips too far.

160
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,950
But we're gonna go around following my temp file by 104576 which is going to give us the

161
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,560
answer in megabytes.

162
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,590
Then we're going to come down and we're gonna use the kill instruction,

163
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,280
kill my temp file and that will delete the file that we have just created and save to the

164
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,000
desktop.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
And then we're gonna loop through.

166
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,610
We're going to do the same thing for the second sheet and the third sheet for as many

167
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,750
sheets as we have.

168
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,700
Finally,

169
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,160
we're gonna auto size columns eight d Then we're gonna turn the calculations back on,

170
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,840
and we're gonna turn the screen updating back on.

171
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,310
And that is how this code works.

172
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,020
Hopefully,

173
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,100
that's helpful to you.

174
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,140
But there's always if you have any questions,

175
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,490
do let me know.

176
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,200
OK,

177
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
