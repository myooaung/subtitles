00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
Okay,

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.300
guys.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.940
And welcome to this section.

4
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.830
Now you'll find is a downloadable resource.

5
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.930
From this lecture,

6
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.490
a workbook called workbook events dot x l s X highly suggest you download that In that file

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.490
,

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.910
you're going to find loads and loads of different tabs.

9
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.900
There is a little guide at the from that said the tabs in green,

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.970
such as these ones here relate to code that should be used in the workbook.

11
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.380
Objects rips a click tough on the code in red will be used on work sheets,

12
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.040
objects.

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.260
Which of these ones just here now up to know everything we've looked at,

14
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.310
as required a manual intervention for our code to executes.

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.470
Now,

16
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.390
we did some really clever stuff when we generated reports,

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.340
but still,

18
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.120
we had to go and say,

19
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.050
Run my code for the code toe work.

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.570
Now,

21
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.140
wouldn't it be useful if you could have your code execute based on what was going on in

22
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.750
Excel?

23
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.140
Now,

24
00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.700
luckily,

25
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700
you conduce precisely that using workbook events on worksheet events.

26
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.590
Now we're going to cover a few of them.

27
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.090
A few of them on here,

28
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.400
both workbook and worksheet on.

29
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.500
We're gonna add some really powerful code to these,

30
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.510
For instance,

31
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.510
wouldn't it be useful if every time someone opened your workbook,

32
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.340
it's automatically created a backup of itself just in case anything went wrong with the

33
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.750
workbook or they deleted some really important data you would have a backup for every time

34
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.560
an individual and open the file?

35
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.940
Or wouldn't it be useful if you knew how many people were actually access in your file on

36
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.460
where they access your file?

37
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.750
From what we can do all of that with workbook events,

38
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.830
we're gonna have a look at how you introduce a splash screen.

39
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.670
So when your workbook opens,

40
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.890
you get this beautiful pop up message says,

41
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.210
Hey,

42
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.650
welcome to my jazzy spreadsheet on We're also gonna have Look,

43
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.230
a top secret classified file that you're gonna need a password to access.

44
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.610
So we have a few fun things in here is Well,

45
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.480
okay,

46
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.400
I'll see you in the next lecture.

47
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.210
Enjoy
