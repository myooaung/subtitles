00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Okay,

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.330
guys and welcome back and never can have a look.

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.160
The other type of message box.

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.340
And that is the message box where you can return values from the user,

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.630
depending on which,

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.090
but Nate click now the set up it's slightly different.

7
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.470
So here's the shell of the code,

8
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.180
this particular demos called Message boxes for and,

9
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.860
as always,

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.540
in your get code here,

11
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.790
tab on Michy.

12
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.360
You can get all the code that we've used in the last few lectures,

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.420
and you can download that sticking into a module on.

14
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.290
You'll be able to follow along.

15
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.990
Okay,

16
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.600
so we have message boxes for I have set up a locally declared valuable called my response

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.760
on the format for writing a message box where you want to read the button that they pressed

18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.990
begins with my response or whatever the name of your variable is.

19
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.230
So my response equals member going to carry on as we did before.

20
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.430
So began anti MSG B o X,

21
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.860
and here's the thing that's different.

22
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.300
You also type and open brackets,

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.920
and now you can see that we have the prompt.

24
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.850
So what we want to say is,

25
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.190
would what would really like to.

26
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.350
Would you like to clear the sheet?

27
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.140
What?

28
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.610
Say that.

29
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.270
And then I'm gonna hit comma.

30
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.630
And then you can see that we get these choices,

31
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.940
we get abort,

32
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.900
hoping that that's in shot.

33
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.820
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna scroll them.

34
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.060
You have multiple options.

35
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.660
I'm just gonna choose VB.

36
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.020
Yes.

37
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.380
No.

38
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.620
And what I'm gonna do here just so we can see is headspace hitting under school and hit

39
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.670
Enter on.

40
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.980
That way,

41
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.730
we should be able to see it all on the same screen.

42
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.170
OK,

43
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.160
so would you like to clear the sheet?

44
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.620
Yes.

45
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.850
No comma on the title and I'm gonna put clear sheet.

46
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.920
I like to capitalize titles,

47
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.240
Clear sheet question mark,

48
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.090
close quotes,

49
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.290
close brackets because we open brackets,

50
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.050
we have to finish the arguments by closing the brackets.

51
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.720
Enter a few times.

52
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.040
Okay,

53
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.900
we're going to step through that and observe what happens.

54
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.650
So as we execute this code,

55
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.800
we get this little message box pop up and you can see Is we chose VB.

56
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.130
Yes.

57
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.530
No,

58
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.500
we have the yes button and we have the no button clear sheet is the title Would you like to

59
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.280
clear the sheet?

60
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.470
is our prompt here.

61
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.690
So I'm gonna hit.

62
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.640
Yes,

63
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.170
and I'm gonna hover over my response on.

64
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.860
We can see there that the response to yes is equal to six.

65
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.790
So six equals,

66
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.390
Yes,

67
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.650
I'm just going to stop and step through that again.

68
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.060
And this time I'm gonna click.

69
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.750
No.

70
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.190
And then I'm gonna hover of response and we can see that seven is equal to know.

71
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550
So that's till there's something very useful.

72
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.450
We can now test which button was pressed by knowing whether the response for six yes or

73
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.990
seven,

74
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.890
which was No.

75
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.660
So now we can stop that code and write something more useful.

76
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.610
And what we gonna do is a simple,

77
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.960
logical test to find out if you the six.

78
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.660
Yes or seven.

79
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.190
No was pressed.

80
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.520
So I'm just going to say if my response equals six,

81
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.570
that is yes,

82
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.310
was pressed then.

83
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.180
And I'm just going to do my end if to make sure that I don't miss it,

84
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.980
I'm gonna add my else.

85
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.580
So if my response equals six,

86
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.650
that is yes,

87
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.370
was pressed,

88
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.740
then sells dot clear contents on that you go.

89
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.720
So if they do want to clear the sheet,

90
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.380
then this line of code will execute because my response equals six,

91
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.440
which is yes,

92
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.450
failing that.

93
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.490
I'm just going to say and that will end this subroutine right there.

94
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.720
So let's just step through that.

95
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.440
Would you like to clear the sheet?

96
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.190
Yes.

97
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.040
And you can see my response equal.

98
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.620
Six.

99
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.120
So how logical Test will evaluate to true on this line of code will execute song in the

100
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.090
press f eight notice what happens over in Excel on all the contents it cleared.

101
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.250
And if let's just run that through again on this time,

102
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.150
hit no.

103
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.300
And noticed that our response is now seven,

104
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.540
which doesn't equal six.

105
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.480
So we're going to come down to this line of code here else end,

106
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.020
and then the code finishes.

107
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.710
So have a play around with the message boxes and change the different options here.

108
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.570
My advice would be to play with them and do exactly as we just did that run through to this

109
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.070
point,

110
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.150
hover over the name of your valuable and find out what the number is for the response that

111
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.870
they gave.

112
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.940
So if you have a VB Yes.

113
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.120
No.

114
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.200
Counsel counsel will have a different number two.

115
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.580
Yes and no.

116
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.480
Okay.

117
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.170
I will see you in the next lecture.
