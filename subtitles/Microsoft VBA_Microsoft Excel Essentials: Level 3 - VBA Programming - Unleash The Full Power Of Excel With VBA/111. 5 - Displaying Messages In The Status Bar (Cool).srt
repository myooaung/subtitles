1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:02,910
guys.

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,820
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,410
And then we're gonna have a look at how we add that useful little message for the users

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,270
just down here.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:16,580
So I'm gonna give myself a few lines on when it's actually called is the display status bar

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:16,580
.

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,900
So what I'm gonna say is application If I can spell application application dot and then

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,850
we're gonna look for the display.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,440
Stay to spawn,

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,870
which will be down here somewhere.

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,880
Display status bar.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,140
They dismayed display status.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,140
Bar equals true.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,400
That's the first thing that we need to say.

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,300
We want to set the display status.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,890
My property to true name again.

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,650
Say application.

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,540
Don't stay to spar on.

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,060
There we go.

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,170
Status bar equals.

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,210
And then whatever way we want it to say,

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,720
So we can say just getting the weather I can't spell.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:10,350
Just get in the weather for cast for room exclamation point,

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,580
dot,

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:10,800
dot,

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,450
dot and close quotes.

28
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,680
And it it's simple as that.

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,340
So what we're gonna do just run through that code one line to time F eight F eight F eight

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,340
.

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,550
Notice what happens down here.

32
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,050
The display states part is true and notice what happens now.

33
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,450
Just get in the weather forecast for Rome.

34
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,500
Now,

35
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,310
At the end of that code,

36
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,400
what we need to do is set the value to off.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,910
But the first thing we're going to do before we do that we're gonna copy this and we're

38
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,480
going to add another message on what we're gonna say here is application dot status bar and

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,560
this is probably gonna be so fast that they use is not even gonna see it.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,310
What we're gonna say is,

41
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,370
got it.

42
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,440
That means this part of the code is finished.

43
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,100
Execute in this will excuse and be displayed before we move on to our next world.

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,540
Now,

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,810
the last thing we need to do is turn the application status,

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,690
part status back to falls.

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,720
And that way we'll just about normal displays down there.

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,450
So I'm just gonna copy this a copy.

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,400
Onda set that,

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,450
too.

51
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,760
And it's very important that you do that.

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,560
Otherwise you will have that message displayed forever.

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,850
So I'm just gonna hit f eight and run through all of this code until we get to.

54
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,640
I'll run until we get to them.

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,710
It was going to take a few seconds because it's obviously It's retrieving data in real time

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,460
from the Internet.

57
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,400
So you can see here.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,050
We're just getting the weather forecast for Rome on here.

59
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,560
It's no gonna say.

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,580
Got it?

61
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,590
And then it's going to return The state aspire to excel,

62
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,910
Andi And know what I'm gonna do is similar messages into the subs for Cancun on London on.

63
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,370
I'll be back with you a second where we're going to tie it all together.

64
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,960
Okay,

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,650
I'll see you that.
