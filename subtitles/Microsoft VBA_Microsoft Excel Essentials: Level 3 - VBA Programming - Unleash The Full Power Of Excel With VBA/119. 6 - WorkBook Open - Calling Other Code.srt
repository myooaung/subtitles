1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,690
guys.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,520
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,950
Now,

5
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,480
here's another thing getting Use the workbook open.

6
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,530
Eventful.

7
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,730
You can use it to track how many times people have bean in and out of the worksheets.

8
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,160
Now,

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
one of the tabs on this particular workbook,

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,740
this workbook events is called the user log.

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,730
No,

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,350
If I hit F 11 get the visual.

13
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,490
Basic editor in a normal module.

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,690
I have written this code here on all this does is it adds the user name to the bottom of

15
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,340
the list.

16
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,840
So the list is here,

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,520
so the user names going to go here on the time and date that they accessed.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,770
It goes there now,

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,000
if we just look at this,

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,550
what we have is the the order of hierarchy.

21
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,750
So we are stating it is sure.

22
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,280
Use a log and you can see that that has a V B name of S H user log here.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,470
So we're calling this sheet bites BB name.

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,430
We are specifying the range five invalids say 50,000.

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,730
Just think,

26
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,360
actually get loads of people going into the sheet.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,650
So we're gonna start outline a 50,000 old wait up set up,

28
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,680
then we're gonna offset one and then in the back of the value property we're gonna enter

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,530
the environment string user name that you'll remember that from way back in the my macro

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,400
book section.

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,480
If you want to capture the user name,

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,660
environment,

33
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,320
string,

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,290
open rackets,

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,730
user name in quotes,

36
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,770
close brackets that is going to get us the user name.

37
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,190
So we're gonna know who went into the spreadsheet and similarly to at the time of day were

38
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,430
just going to use the hierarchy again.

39
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,160
Shh.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,250
User log range Be 55,000 All the way up.

41
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,860
Offset one on Do the value as now.

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,240
And if we want to hide that later if we want to hide it so the user can't Unhygienic from

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,900
excel,

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,570
we can use the property.

45
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,580
Excel very hidden on that way.

46
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,930
The only way you can unhygienic it is in here in the visual basic Elyssa in the properties

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,520
window.

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,740
Andi in your properties down here now at the moment just so I can see it,

49
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,850
I haven't done that.

50
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,740
So let's have a look at how we incorporate that Now,

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,380
at the moment,

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,720
you may be thinking on a second I thought we were looking at a workbook.

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,630
Open event.

54
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,500
So let's just have a look at the workbook.

55
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,240
Open event the workbook.

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:35,190
Open event Say's user form 0.1 show on that brings us this splash green that comes up now

57
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,750
from the user form.

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,750
If we come over to here,

59
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,450
we can get to the code window for the use of form itself.

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:43,860
Now,

61
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,810
by default,

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,140
we here have private sub user form Click.

63
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,280
We are not looking for the click event.

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,010
We are looking for the initialize events.

65
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,100
So that is the second The use of form initialize is that is it shows We want to execute

66
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,250
some code here.

67
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,650
Now here's the really cool thing.

68
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:12,210
We have now written this piece of code in a normal module and it is called update user log

69
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,210
.

70
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,050
I am just going to copy the name of that,

71
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:20,400
come back to the use of form and go to the code window for the use of form on inside the

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:30,670
user form initialize I'm gonna say run space quotes the name of the macro that we want to

73
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:37,340
run close quotes and then I'm gonna click off now I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna close the

74
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,930
visual basic editor noticed that there is absolutely nothing in here in the workbook events

75
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:43,930
.

76
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,280
User log.

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,950
I'm gonna close that.

78
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,220
I'm gonna open that file one more time on.

79
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,730
Here we go.

80
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,450
Welcome to my jazzy spreadsheets.

81
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,550
And when I close,

82
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,280
you can see that now the user log has Allen because that's my sign in Name was last

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,820
accessed a 28 16 At 13.

84
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,040
13 I'm gonna close it again.

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm going to save and here I'm going to double click it again.

86
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,050
I notice what happens this time.

87
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,700
Welcome to my jazzy spreadsheet and I have no gone into it.

88
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,540
Alan again,

89
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,730
20 through the 8th 2016 at 13.

90
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,000
13 and 38 seconds.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,850
Whereas previously it was 19 seconds there obviously cannot as much codas you want to this

92
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,780
He can have it save or send emails or whatever you want it to do all or literally select

93
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,450
the front sheet because some people,

94
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,040
if many people use the same spreadsheet,

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,960
someone may leave it on this sheet and you actually want them to come back all the way over

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,380
here,

97
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,250
right the way to the guide sheets.

98
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,560
So in fact,

99
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,180
let's just that.

100
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,320
That s O sheet guide is called S H Guide that has a V be named Suratman.

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,910
Do come back to my modules.

102
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,510
It's over.

103
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,460
Click module one.

104
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,130
And there I'm just four fun.

105
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm gonna say ship guide don't select.

106
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,850
And there you go.

107
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,940
So now I'm gonna close that whip said Daisy,

108
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,820
I'm gonna close that.

109
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,870
I'm gonna save that.

110
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,010
I'm gonna close again.

111
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,900
We were actually on that sheet,

112
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,990
so that's not gonna make any difference whatsoever,

113
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,310
is it?

114
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,970
Okay,

115
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,520
let's say we're on this sheet.

116
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,740
No,

117
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,000
it's close it and save it and open it again.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,450
Eso No,

119
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,250
we weren't on the guide sheet.

120
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,820
No opening the file and then go.

121
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,130
We're going straight back to the guy.

122
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,250
Cheeks are splash screen has appeared.

123
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,030
And if we was way over here to our use a log ago,

124
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,570
you can see every single time that I have opened this spreadsheet.

125
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,450
Okay,

126
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,950
I'll see you in the next lecture.
