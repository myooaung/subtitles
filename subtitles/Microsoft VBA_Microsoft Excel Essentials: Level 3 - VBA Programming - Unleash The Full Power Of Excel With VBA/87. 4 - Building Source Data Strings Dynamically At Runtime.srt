1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Okay,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,540
guys.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,780
And welcome back in the last lecture,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,050
looking at this subroutine the profit.

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,510
By day on,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,430
we established that this part just here is where we were clicking on excel and literally

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,960
selecting the Rangers that we wanted to build our table from on.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,820
We also worked out that this range that we marked off here was replicated exactly down here

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:27,820
.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,420
Save some punctuation,

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,390
zin that on what we want to do is build a string dynamically at runtime.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,610
So we always get the right sheet and we always get the correct data ranges.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,500
So to do that,

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,360
we're gonna have to set up a few more variable.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,590
So I'm just gonna delete these now.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,220
Ultimately,

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,020
what we're gonna do is move all of the data capture into its own subroutine and have that

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,110
run first.

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,520
So while the usual is actually looking at the source data as soon as the macro executes

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,510
capture all the data ranges that we're gonna need for the rest of the subroutines all in

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,020
one go before we even add the second sheet.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,970
But for now,

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,950
let's just set up the variables so we could look at moving them shortly,

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,200
so I'm gonna say my source sheet Azaz,

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,850
And they're all gonna be strings.

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,390
So my sell sheet is gonna hold the name off the data sheet that we're working out.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,210
And the next thing we had was this a six and a six down which captured the date Rangers.

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,450
So gonna call this my date a string.

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,140
And then the next thing we had was this G 62 G six down,

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,230
which was the profit.

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,700
So I'm gonna call that Tim.

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,850
My whips can't type my profits a string,

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,570
and they go on finally.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,770
What we need to do is we need to put all that together into one build string that's going

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,070
to represent this text right here.

36
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,500
So I'm going to call that I'm going to copy the new ambassador routine.

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,350
I'm gonna call it dim.

38
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,550
The name vassal routine data a string.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,350
Fantastic.

40
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,970
So they're all are variable set up.

41
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:27,750
So now let's have a look at capturing the 1st 1 so we can say my source sheet equals active

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,390
sheet dot name,

43
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,460
because what we want to do is make sure that we are looking at this sheet the data sheets

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,220
when we execute code,

45
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,890
so that will be the active sheet name.

46
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,580
I'll reminisce out shortly and then we'll know what we're doing.

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,760
So the next thing we're looking at is my date.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,830
So my debt whips no spaces,

49
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,150
Island,

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,360
my date equals Now we already have the bones of the code right here.

51
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,310
So for a second,

52
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,930
I'm just gonna put zero to stop me getting an error on this is the bit of code that we're

53
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,420
looking at.

54
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,050
Now we can see that when we selected in Excel,

55
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,410
we selected range a six and then with that selection,

56
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,450
selection,

57
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,090
Excel,

58
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,330
end down or and excel down dot select.

59
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,650
So that's almost the code we want.

60
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,760
So rather than selecting,

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,150
there will begin.

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,890
Do is replace a selection with the range selection with the range on.

63
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,640
We don't actually want to select it.

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,580
What we want to do is guess the address off that range.

65
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,950
So now I can copy all of that code copy,

66
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,610
remove the zero and paste that in there.

67
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,790
Now that's almost identical to what we want to do for my profit.

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,290
Except it's looking at column G.

69
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,640
So I'm just going to do that and copy and paste it underneath instead saying my date on the

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,930
same my profit clips my profit on.

71
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,580
Instead of looking at a I'm going to be looking at G and I need to change both references.

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,240
So,

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,650
Jean,

74
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,060
I'm just going to step through that.

75
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,180
Seo tips.

76
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,500
I condemn these out because we don't actually need those anymore.

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,490
Indeed,

78
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,750
we don't need that'll that'll that anymore.

79
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,660
Eso Let's just step through that and see what we get.

80
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,630
So my source sheet equals 2016.

81
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,350
01 North.

82
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,200
Fantastic.

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
My date equals range.

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
8th 6 to a 466 which you can see,

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,150
is quite right here.

86
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,950
My profit equals g 62 g 466 which we can see is exactly right just here.

87
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,610
So now we can hit stop and now we can delete all of that.

88
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,020
All we need to do now is build a concurrent innate ID string to replicate this.

89
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:49,020
Now we said we recall this profit by day data copy that their pace it in Tabin a bit on.

90
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,510
Here's where we need to pay very close attention because we cannot get the syntax of this

91
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,060
wrong at all.

92
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:04,050
So we're going to say quotes apostrophe because it's an apostrophe is the very first thing

93
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,750
in this data source here.

94
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,980
So apostrophe close quotes Onda.

95
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,270
And there we have the name of the source sheet,

96
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,970
which we now have in the variable my source sheet.

97
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,180
Andi.

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,680
Then after that,

99
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,410
want to be have we have another apostrophe and an exclamation point?

100
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,680
So quotes,

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,740
apostrophe,

102
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,170
exclamation point,

103
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:35,700
close quotes Onda And then we have this range here this a six way for 66 which we read into

104
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,240
the valuable my date on and no been hitting on the score and enter and tab in.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,670
So that's the first half of our string built just there on the second half of our Shing

106
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,780
says Comma,

107
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,850
apostrophe,

108
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,090
quotes comma,

109
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,350
apostrophe.

110
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,570
Is that right?

111
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:55,930
Come on,

112
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,590
Apostrophe?

113
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:56,870
Yep.

114
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,720
Absolutely so close Quotes Andi.

115
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,510
Then we have my source sheet again.

116
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,850
My source sheet.

117
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,760
Andi.

118
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,590
Then we have after my source sheet on apostrophe on an exclamation point.

119
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,950
So apostrophe exclamation point and close quotes.

120
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,080
And then finally,

121
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,850
we have this G 60 g 466 which we read into my profit.

122
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,890
So my profits.

123
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,350
Andi,

124
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,370
There you go.

125
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,070
So now we have that built completely dynamically at runtime.

126
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,800
So let's just step through and make sure that this say's what they say is for now,

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm just gonna add a watch.

128
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,520
How to watch.

129
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,290
Okay.

130
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,420
Millet,

131
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,470
step through code F eight F eight F eight on Dhere we go.

132
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,270
This is the code that we want to replicate.

133
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,750
And if we have a look here,

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,750
we can see that that is replicated this string precisely which now means we can just copy

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,720
this and paste it over all of that because we have no built that dynamically at runtime.

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
So let's just hit.

137
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Stop.

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,910
Let me close these for a few seconds and let's just drag this in.

139
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,900
If I can pick it up,

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,510
There we go.

141
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,270
Let's have a new sheet so we can have a play with it.

142
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,510
So sheet fall is where we're going to be going.

143
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,710
I think somewhere down here we had a different sheets.

144
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,220
I'm gonna call that sheep for for now.

145
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,740
Now let's step through this and see if that works.

146
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,870
Fate a fate if fate If fate a fate.

147
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,220
Andi,

148
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,980
there's our chart there.

149
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,090
We couldn't it we're going to shoot for on were paste in its on there you go all the way

150
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,590
through.

151
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,140
And that chart is being built perfectly with the data captured dynamically at runtime again

152
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,140
.

153
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,780
The next lecture,

154
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,930
we're gonna have a look at creating a new module way.

155
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,750
We're going to put all of our data capture.

156
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,800
So I shall remark this code on.

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
