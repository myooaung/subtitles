00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Okay,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.820
guys.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.360
And welcome back there just to catch you up.

4
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.850
I've just added a couple of shapes on here,

5
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.680
so I've come to insert shapes of literally just picked this one.

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.760
I think I have dragged two shapes on,

7
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.760
have called them single and multiple.

8
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.910
I have assigned the macro which macro I signed.

9
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.260
I signed the macro create single folder structure to this button on.

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.920
I have assigned the macro create multiple folder structure to this shape just here.

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.800
So now you're fully caught up.

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.790
So what this is going to do is it is gonna have a look at this column here,

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.520
and it is going to create a It creates a folder in a specified path.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.740
One called Emma one called,

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.050
Actually,

16
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.280
one called Joe one called Bernie one called Danny and create a high pulling to that very

17
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.800
same folder here in column B.

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.960
So let's have a look at that code.

19
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.070
Now.

20
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.300
Fold the structure.

21
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.050
This tab here has a visual basic name of S H index.

22
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.880
So our first action is to call this sheet to make sure we're on the right sheet.

23
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.500
So shit index dot select range before select selects this cell.

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
And this is where we're gonna be writing our hyperlink and it is going to be looking to the

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.450
left to column A to retrieve the full domain that we want to create.

26
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.890
Okay,

27
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.910
so here we have a while.

28
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.580
When loop on it says while the active cell offset zero no rose minus 11 column to the left

29
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.210
column,

30
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.360
a dot value doesn't equal blank continue.

31
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.600
So it's gonna while and when.

32
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.000
Until it gets to hear that it's gonna look here,

33
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.820
say it's blank on the code is going to stop executing.

34
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.380
Okay,

35
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.860
inside a whirlwind loop.

36
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.690
We have this instruction here on ERA resume next,

37
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.690
and what doctors is if the code errors is going to force it to continue anyway,

38
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.020
only for this line of code,

39
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.830
because here we're going to disable that era trapped.

40
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.220
Now,

41
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.980
the reason we don't want the code to stop here is if it turns out we hope already have a

42
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.150
folder called Emma.

43
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.580
We don't want it to stop and not complete actually job.

44
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.830
Ernie and Danny wanted to carry on,

45
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.130
even though Emma may already exist.

46
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.840
So here is that line of code the magic line of code that actually does the job.

47
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.190
M k make directory.

48
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.650
You can see here,

49
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.040
in my instance,

50
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.290
I have see uses Alan desktop my folders backslash.

51
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.470
And then I'm concoct innate in that with the end and saying whatever the active cell offset

52
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.470
.

53
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.410
Zero rose minus one columns column A dot value equals.

54
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.080
So my path back slash on whatever word is in here.

55
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.060
So it could be it could be names of people.

56
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.470
It could be names of corporations,

57
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.720
names of products,

58
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.440
names of projects,

59
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.360
whatever you want to create a folder structure full So on.

60
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.140
Then we're going to get down to this where we're gonna turn disable the error trapped that

61
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.140
we've just put there that is gonna build our folder.

62
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.910
So it's just step through the code up until this point,

63
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.460
just here.

64
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.170
So I'm just gonna hit debug on relative cursor.

65
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.320
Andi,

66
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.060
over here.

67
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.900
You can see that Emma has just being added.

68
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
I'm struggling to get all three things into view here,

69
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.430
so bottom into Czar will go through the loop once on.

70
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.930
Then I'll just run the code and have this window visible so you can actually see happening

71
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.700
in real time.

72
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.520
Okay,

73
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.960
so active sheet dot Hyperlinks stop ad anchor.

74
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.950
Equal selection address Exactly the same path.

75
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.690
Can Katyn ated with exactly the same name,

76
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.310
which is active?

77
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.710
Cell offset minus one.

78
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.980
So essentially,

79
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.080
it's just the same path Exactly that we specified above here.

80
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.930
But we're adding a hyperlink to the cell that we are in on the text to display is go there

81
00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.230
now.

82
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.130
So notes what happens over here when I hit F eight Boom,

83
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.990
we have the hyperlink.

84
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.400
And if I were to click that hyperlink ago,

85
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.780
this folder opens up this PC,

86
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.070
which is C uses Alan desktop.

87
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.820
My folders,

88
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.250
Emma.

89
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.230
Okay,

90
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.100
I'm just gonna close that and here,

91
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.870
or we're gonna say,

92
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.070
active cell offset here.

93
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.830
Access selloffs that moved down one on repeat.

94
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.220
So I'm just gonna hit Stop that is assigned to this This shape just here.

95
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.750
So I'm just gonna drag this in.

96
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.190
And then when I hit,

97
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.480
play or hit the button there they are on you'll notice that we have Emma.

98
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.920
Actually,

99
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.940
we already and Emma,

100
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.320
So images continue.

101
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.470
So all of the names here now have a folder in my folders.

102
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.230
And if I click on the hyperlink for Emma i m a folder opens up.

103
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.770
And if I click on the hyperlink for Ashley whips,

104
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.280
Weather gun,

105
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.870
let's say,

106
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.450
Who is that?

107
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.900
Jo Jo opens up and it's a simple Is that so?

108
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.810
From that one base line of code and skin,

109
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.150
delete those now from that one base line of code remains to build a routine that can

110
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.550
automatically create an entire directory structure of folders.

111
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.100
Okay,

112
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.400
I'm going to see you in the next lecture.

113
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.360
We're gonna look and handsome that so we can have folders within folders.

114
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.270
And it's a lot simpler than you may think.

115
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.840
OK,

116
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
