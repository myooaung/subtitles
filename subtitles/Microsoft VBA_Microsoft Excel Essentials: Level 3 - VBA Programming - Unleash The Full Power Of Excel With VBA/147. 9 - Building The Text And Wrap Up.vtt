00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
Okay,

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.260
guys.

3
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.140
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.540
Let's wrap this up,

5
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.340
right?

6
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.480
We're down to here.

7
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.890
We have total sales equals application worksheet function.

8
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.180
Some range j j don't value.

9
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.420
So if I come over here,

10
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.250
this is going to give us the sum of all of our values here.

11
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.380
And you'll remember that these are some ifs,

12
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.160
this person's name here.

13
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.990
So here,

14
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.820
I'm going to hit F eight groups here.

15
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.790
I'm gonna hit F eight.

16
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.830
And now I have a total sales value of 78.

17
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.590
7847

18
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.620
Fantastic.

19
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.020
Your percentage.

20
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.780
What percentage of these total number is £161.

21
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.850
58

22
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.120
So we're just going to say range J one divided by the total sales which have just captured

23
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.600
above.

24
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.170
Now,

25
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.260
that's going to give us the answer in a decimal.

26
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.800
So what we're going to need to do is multiply that by 100.

27
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.880
So here we have ranged J one divided by total sales in brackets multiplied by 100.

28
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.470
There,

29
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.070
we only want to return a whole number.

30
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.090
So we're gonna encapsulate that in brackets on in front of it.

31
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.480
We're going to say which is going to return an inter jester.

32
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.610
We just get the whole number on.

33
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.660
Then we want to tag on to the end.

34
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.240
Andi,

35
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.630
the percent sign on when I hit F eight,

36
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.930
we're gonna learn that 20% is what 1613 is off.

37
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.220
7847 Okay,

38
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.950
fantastic.

39
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.150
Now rep counts.

40
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.420
Now,

41
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.740
that is how many reps do we have here on what we're gonna uses the application worksheet

42
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.480
function Count A,

43
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.460
which I know you know,

44
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.620
from Excel on.

45
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.430
We're looking at range KK and we are subtracting one because we have sales person at the

46
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.950
bottom.

47
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.030
So actually,

48
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.760
we have seven interests,

49
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.610
but only six reps.

50
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.060
Okay,

51
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.510
so I rep count is six coming up to the end of it.

52
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.140
Now we have body text here.

53
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.520
This is where we build the string.

54
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.930
So we're gonna say dear range K one dot value.

55
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.120
So,

56
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.960
in this instance,

57
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.210
dear Sarah Bond comma VB New line VB new line and that gives us are heading.

58
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.540
So,

59
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.520
dear Sarah Bond comma two new lines.

60
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.980
Then we're gonna add the first paragraph.

61
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.670
So what we have is body text.

62
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.680
This plot equals body text on day,

63
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.050
we're gonna tag on the rest of it.

64
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.390
Congratulations.

65
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.070
You were the top performing sales person in your region.

66
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.480
Very straightforward.

67
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.930
So there we have deer,

68
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.810
her name,

69
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.070
two lines and congratulations.

70
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.970
You the top performing sales person?

71
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.810
No.

72
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720
We're gonna add the second paragraph,

73
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.460
and I've done this so we can build it up in elements.

74
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.140
So begin mistake going to say,

75
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.430
Let me just have faith through that.

76
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.120
Okay?

77
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.870
So what we have here is of the space rap counts six.

78
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.910
So off the six space sales representatives in your region you delivered.

79
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.540
And here we have a pound sign on.

80
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.190
We have the integer value off J one.

81
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.980
So it's going to say 1613 and ignore the pet.

82
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.850
The pence space in profit.

83
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.740
That's space.

84
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.030
Your percentage,

85
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.610
which we calculated above space off the parents sign the total sales which we captured

86
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.870
above space.

87
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.810
Total profit delivered in your region for the month Exclamation point.

88
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.760
Vb new line VB new line.

89
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.340
Thank you.

90
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.000
On behalf of the C e.

91
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.450
O.

92
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.510
Now then on a second,

93
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.480
let me just hit at eight.

94
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.230
Then we're gonna delete this because we don't want it to be visible to the user So here we

95
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.950
delete that.

96
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.420
And there we come to the letter to whomever we're going to create an instance of wet.

97
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.580
We're going to create a new document within that word.

98
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.950
We're going to make it visible on them.

99
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.490
Right?

100
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.120
Our body text in here.

101
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.860
So I'm just gonna hit.

102
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.880
Play Andi,

103
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.870
actually forget that you'll see it.

104
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.340
They go,

105
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.350
Dear Ceremony,

106
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.800
Congratulations.

107
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.370
You were the tough performance else person in your region.

108
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.080
Of the six sales representatives which we built dynamically at run time,

109
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.490
you delivered £1613 which we captured dynamically at runtime in profits.

110
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:25.380
That's 20% which we also calculated from our base data of the 7804 £7 which we also

111
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.100
captured dynamically at runtime.

112
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.070
A total profit of the seventh of his agent report seven times total profit delivered it in

113
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.080
your region in the month.

114
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.670
Thank you.

115
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.790
On behalf of the C f o on that is how you do it.

116
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.960
Obviously you can.

117
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.260
You just gonna close that you can don't save you can build as complex a body message as you

118
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.440
want Now here I've built it in code be quite simply,

119
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.910
have another sheet over here in excel.

120
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.420
And instead of right in the body in code,

121
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.870
you could literally have a new sheet here.

122
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.330
And you could just write all of your text in your paragraphs and then just drop your

123
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.680
variables in there as you see fit.

124
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.450
Okay,

125
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.760
So,

126
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.680
as always,

127
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.210
you can get your code here.

128
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.030
That's how you automate word.

129
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.170
Have a lot of fun playing around with that.

130
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.600
Okay,

131
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.750
thanks very much indeed.
