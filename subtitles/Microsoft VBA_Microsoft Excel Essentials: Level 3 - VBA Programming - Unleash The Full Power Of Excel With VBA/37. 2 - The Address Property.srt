1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,850
guys.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,010
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,660
Never gonna have a look at another property that I guarantee you're gonna be using Quite a

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:08,960
lot.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,350
That is the address property.

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,220
So what we've got set up here is a bunch of code that's gonna demonstrate loads of uses for

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,470
the address property.

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:17,970
Now,

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,470
when you write in projects in V B A,

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,850
there were going to be times where you use something to find a particular piece of data,

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,650
and you need to know specifically where that data resides.

13
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,840
So you can either copy it or you can reference that sell a little later on.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,540
So here we have a few lines of really useful code.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,370
So the 1st 1 this is a variable done.

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,650
We're going to come to valuables in the next section.

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,390
So we're going to read into a little block of memory.

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,780
Called my cell address,

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,430
the active cell address,

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,850
or when I hit F eight,

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,340
you can see that I'm currently in 11.

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,930
And if I hover over here,

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,880
I get the cell address A 11.

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,410
Now,

25
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,120
what I may want to do is find out where the bottom of a particular range lives.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,460
And here we're going to incorporate that end that we looked at a little earlier on Excel

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:09,810
Down.

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,580
So I'm going to say my last row address.

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,980
This is a different valuable started range A five go down to the last active cell or the

30
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,240
last cell with the value and tell me what that addresses.

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,410
So here,

32
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,150
I'm just going to press f eight noticed that this hasn't moved because we haven't used the

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,200
select.

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,150
But when they hover over last row address,

35
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,690
we can see that we have a 10.

36
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,310
And that is the last populated cell in this range of data.

37
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,830
No.

38
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,560
Similarly,

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,200
if we had before,

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,440
I execute that line of code,

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,560
but let me just copy all of that over.

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,030
Similarly,

43
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,030
we could use the last column address.

44
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,790
So again we start arrange a five.

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,510
We're doing the end again.

46
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,220
But this time we go in Excel to write,

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,850
So notice I have these selected,

48
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,240
and that's not gonna affect this because the range A five is virtual so when they hit f

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,680
eight,

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,600
you can see that the last column address from range A five going excel to right is absolute

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:10,600
.

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,300
Be absolute five,

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,550
which is exactly what it is now,

54
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,350
one thing that you're most definitely going to be using,

55
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,290
particularly when your tagging new data onto the end of old data sets is you want to find

56
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,390
out where the bottom of your range is.

57
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,550
So the game we're going to incorporate this end and excel up,

58
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,170
but this time we're going to start way had the bottom of excel in line Is that

59
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,770
1,000,048,546?

60
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,170
If you're using an older version of Excel,

61
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,580
you're only gonna have 65,000 536 lines.

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,310
So you may need to change this.

63
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,470
But again were virtually going from here.

64
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,600
When we're not actually going to go and select it,

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,050
we go virtually from line.

66
00:02:52,050 --> 00:03:00,380
A 1,000,048,500 76 were using the end and going excel up and capture in the address.

67
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,050
So when they hit their fate,

68
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:09,480
you can see that the my very last row address is absolute A 10 which is exactly correct.

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,890
Now,

70
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,150
when you are capturing new data to stick onto the end of all data,

71
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,380
what you actually want it gonna want to know is one is the first blank cell because that's

72
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,300
where you're going to write your new data.

73
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,660
So here we have almost exactly a line of code.

74
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,580
But we've done the excel end up,

75
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,300
and then we have tanked on their the dot offset one which is one road down.

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,640
So what this is going to capture is this cell address,

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,850
which is our first blank cell after this data region.

78
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,480
And that's where we may want to paste on new data.

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,880
So when I hit F eight,

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,140
I can just hover over here they go.

81
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,160
Absolute.

82
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,970
A absolute 11 guarantee you're gonna be used in those quite a bit.

83
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay.

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,950
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at rows and columns.

85
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,200
Okay,

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,700
I'll see you.

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,050
That
