1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,970
Okay,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,360
guys.

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,180
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,530
Now,

5
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,530
what we're going to do is just finalize a few the details on this sharp by recording a

6
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,870
couple of quick macros.

7
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,380
So the first thing you want to do is change the tart chart title.

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,950
So I'm just going to call the new Macron.

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,700
There's only a few of them will be able to spot what they do,

10
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,530
the codes generating over here.

11
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,800
I'm just going to right click on,

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,280
say,

13
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,910
text,

14
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,810
I'm gonna say,

15
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,420
split by category whips.

16
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,390
No enter click off macro number one Macron number two is I want to see the values

17
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,080
associated with each of these elements.

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,470
So there we go.

19
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,580
Macro number six me.

20
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,470
Just scroll up a bit so you can see that.

21
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,390
So we have on data labels at data labels and there we go.

22
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,170
We can see them.

23
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,300
That's perfectly fine.

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,870
Hit.

25
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,350
Stop.

26
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,500
Bizarrely.

27
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,360
Normally you can right click thes and delete these category headings for some reason.

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,310
And I have no idea why it's not allowing me to do that.

29
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,580
But luckily I know the code to do that so we can do that then.

30
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,360
So macro number five.

31
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,990
Wow,

32
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,580
what a load of code has been generated here on what we actually interested in Is that

33
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,560
particular line there where we change the chart title,

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,500
Doc text.

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,140
So I am just copying that.

36
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,430
In fact,

37
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,050
let me bring that back into shot a little bit better there.

38
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:24,500
So I'm gonna its view on the Venus Project Explorer back to project number one,

39
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,690
which is where we're working.

40
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,070
So the active chant duck titled the text split by category that's going to change the name

41
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,070
.

42
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,820
Then we down to this ongoing We have loads of scrolling on.

43
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,010
What we actually want to do is apply data labels.

44
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,950
So copy over here on underneath there will say,

45
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,900
paste data labels on delete,

46
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,820
then tied it up.

47
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,720
Allied comments this a little bit later.

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,980
And the final thing we wanted to do so we wanted to remove those data labels.

49
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,510
Eso We're still gonna be working on the active charts property.

50
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,790
And remember,

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,050
this is the active chart.

52
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,050
But this time,

53
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,080
what we want to do is say,

54
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,040
show all field buttons equals false and they go on.

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,850
That should be So what I'm gonna do,

56
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,250
I'm gonna delete that and I'm gonna run the thing from the absolute beginning from here,

57
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,550
Onda.

58
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,710
Let's just go up to hear him play am Boone,

59
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,820
See what happens.

60
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,340
Let me just zoom out a little bit so we can see all of that.

61
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,020
So you go.

62
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,960
That's how perfectly formatted month report we have split by category.

63
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Those buttons of gun.

64
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,480
The numbers are on their Everything is being built dynamically at runtime.

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,300
So all we need to do now is poured this over to a separate spreadsheet on,

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,150
then test it on our four sets off data.

67
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,680
Okay,

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,230
I'll see you in the next lecture.
