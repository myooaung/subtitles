1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Okay,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:02,810
guys.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,190
And welcome back there.

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,700
So far,

5
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,510
the couple of examples that we've had look at function pie spelt incorrectly on functions

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,370
square me both do calculations,

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,940
but you can easily using a UDF user defined function to use to pull some data about the

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,390
spreadsheet that you're working in.

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,000
Now what I'm gonna do here,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,050
I'm gonna create another function on gonna say function.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,650
Where is this file?

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,390
And I don't need to specify any parameters between the between the brackets here.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,590
So what I'm gonna say is here I want to copy that because that's the return value.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,590
I'm gonna say,

15
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,030
Where is this file equals?

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,050
And I'm gonna say this work book,

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,550
adult path,

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,920
and you can find a load of these different things.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,090
In the macro book section,

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,900
there's there's loads of different things,

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,050
like finding the use of find in the name of the file,

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,410
all kinds things in there.

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,970
So now let me just a little of that.

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,180
If here I say,

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,520
equals where you can see where is this?

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,400
Fire has been added here as a user defined function.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,770
Just gonna hit the tab closer brackets.

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,730
When I hit enter let me just drag that out so you can see they go.

29
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:24,500
This particular file lives in my f dropbox you to me excel level three v b A programming

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,880
slash Complete.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,450
So there you go.

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,250
You don't have to use a calculation.

33
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,670
You can use a custom function user defined function to return information.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,200
Okay,

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll see you in the next one where we can have a look at doing something a little more

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,510
complicated.

37
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,550
I'll see you there.
