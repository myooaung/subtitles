1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Okay,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,010
guys.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,260
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,570
Now it does There.

5
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,420
We're not quite done with user defined functions just yet.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,720
I've had a question from student named Ram who has asked in the What can I have for dinner

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,750
section of this course in level two?

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,450
You remember the one where we we type in the names of all the sheet names down here and

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,000
then we hyperlink to them.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,240
Is there a formula that we can use?

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,600
It will actually read all of the sheet names this implants or is there isn't.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,960
But we can write a really simple user defined function to do just that.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,650
So I've tagged this onto the download and you'll never find this at the bottom of the

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,720
download code in your get your code here.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,630
Now,

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,820
what we have is function called get sheet name,

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,410
and that should give you a clue as to where it's going to do on.

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,900
We're gonna,

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,850
uh we're gonna have a number as long near the number is going to be the index number off

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,620
the sheet,

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,750
so you'll recall that she won His is index one.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,260
The second sheet along.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,510
This is the order in which they appear.

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,170
Is she too?

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,870
So be sheets to on.

26
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,850
That's basically all the number is going to do.

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,550
So you'll recall from an early the earlier lectures that the name of the function must be

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,830
where we return the value,

29
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,150
too.

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,140
So get sheet name equals sheets,

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,250
number and name.

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,500
So let's just have a look at the an operation.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,180
So this is the first sheet in our workbooks.

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,250
So if I typed,

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,530
get and you can see I get sheets.

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,250
Name there.

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,630
If I click on there,

38
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,440
click one.

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,270
That is the first sheet going left to right on.

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,160
Did that hit?

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,560
Enter?

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,030
I get.

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,650
She won.

44
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,400
If I change that to sheet,

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,950
too,

46
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,040
I get get your code here because that's the name,

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,050
their second sheet.

48
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,840
But the idea of this is that we have a formula that weaken dragged down.

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:57,990
Now,

50
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,520
obviously,

51
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,370
typing one in here and two in there is not going to do the trick.

52
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,470
But what we can do is incorporate the row.

53
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,750
So if I hit one cool on one and close the brackets and then hey,

54
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:20,130
center number one is sheet one and then I can drag this down and row will increase to two

55
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,640
on,

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,260
then three and then four and then five and so on and so on.

57
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,140
Selectively.

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,460
If you have 100 sheets across here,

59
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,020
you just write this formula.

60
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,880
Once using this UDF get sheet name drank 100 times on all of your sheet.

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,460
Names will be listed in the order in which they appear across here Now.

62
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:39,790
Obviously,

63
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:48,690
you cannot do never trap up the front here so we could say equals if a role open rackets,

64
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,880
What do we want to return?

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,690
If it's an error,

66
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:58,620
let's return nothing hit enter and then drag that down and then we'll just get blanks Where

67
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,530
we've run out of sheet Seems okay now.

68
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,250
I'll see you in the next section.
