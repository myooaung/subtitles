1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,850
guys.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,440
And welcome back now,

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,520
occasionally,

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,870
when you look at other people's code on DPI,

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,450
perhaps even throughout this course I can't remember exactly how I remember thing that

7
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,810
you're going to see two different ways of reference in sheets.

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,740
You will see this way that the sheets objects.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,630
So here we have sheets,

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,260
sales data dot select or sometimes you'll see written this way as worksheets sales data dot

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,840
select.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,350
Now there is a fundamental difference.

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,640
It's not by accident that we have two different things in here.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,120
Sheets will recognize any sheet within excel,

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,080
whereas worksheets will only recognize regular excel sheets.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,610
They are the sheets that you can see down here.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,770
But if I wanted to add a new charge,

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,830
she just by hitting after 11 you can see that we know have Chart One.

19
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,610
Now,

20
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:04,060
if I If I come over to here and just go to the view on due to the Project Explorer,

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,050
you can know,

22
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,520
see that the charge sheet looks different to the other worksheets.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:09,950
Okay,

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,260
now,

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,730
that's gonna be particularly critical here,

26
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,890
So let's execute through this code.

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,420
So when I hit F eight sheets,

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,720
sales data will select this sheet Perfect sheets chart.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,660
One will select this sheet because sheet will recognize all elements.

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,980
Worksheets.

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,190
Sales data will work perfectly,

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,710
but worksheets only works with regular excel sheets.

33
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,270
So when I try worksheets chart one dot select,

34
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,510
we get a runtime error because the specified specified dimension is not valid for the

35
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,940
current chart type.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,590
And basically,

37
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,780
worksheets will not work with anything other than a regular excel sheet.

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,330
Okay,

39
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,080
so there's a difference between sheets and worksheets.

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,510
Okay,

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
