00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Okay,

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:02.800
guys,

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.930
some Welcome back.

4
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.390
Now what we're gonna do now is we're gonna have a couple of new subroutines way up the top

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.390
.

6
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.170
The first someone we're going to do is a run order.

7
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.100
So I'm just gonna call it a sub.

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.710
In fact,

9
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.200
only call it.

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.650
Privates are private.

11
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.930
So And for now,

12
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.560
I'm gonna call it run or doctor.

13
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.540
So it's descriptive.

14
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.360
We can always change it a little later on balm bump.

15
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.460
And in here,

16
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.010
I'm gonna call the names of the subroutines in the order in which we want them to execute.

17
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.250
But the next subliminal create is also private,

18
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.750
sub private sub.

19
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.550
This was gonna be called data capture,

20
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.300
and we're gonna put all of our data capturing code in this particular celebrating.

21
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.560
And so if we come down here,

22
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.710
everything we did up to this point was all to do with capturing the string to build this

23
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.980
profit by day data.

24
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.350
So all of this I'm gonna copy from here.

25
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.410
Hit delete on when it come up.

26
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.740
Sit up then when it paste it in data capture just here.

27
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.100
So all of this first path,

28
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.280
because we're gonna have more than one set of data to capture relates to rough feet by

29
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.350
Thank So all of this relates to the profit by day now also,

30
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.900
because we may want to transfer some of the states at my source sheet,

31
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.670
most definitely between the modules.

32
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.620
I'm also gonna move all of these from here all the way up to the top on drop them right at

33
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.080
the top.

34
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.450
So they become module level variables.

35
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.030
That way,

36
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.350
we haven't got a worry about declaring them locally in each of the subroutines weaken.

37
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.450
Just pass the data between the subs.

38
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.390
Okay,

39
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.250
so now we have our first call to the data capture,

40
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:09.040
and we have a second call to the aunt you sheet on the 3rd 1 was the profit by day,

41
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.500
so profit by day.

42
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.720
So so far,

43
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.640
they are the three bits of code that we have that completely dynamic.

44
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.120
And we're just gonna run through to make sure that they work.

45
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.750
So I'm in this sublime hitting athletic data.

46
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.220
Capture my source.

47
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.970
She's on the wrong sheet.

48
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.500
Let's hit.

49
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.940
Stop.

50
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.950
Let's select the right cheat.

51
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.610
Let's try that again.

52
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.980
Okay,

53
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.580
So data capture bom bom bom data catch capture.

54
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.210
Name the source sheet perfect.

55
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.570
Captured the day range Perfect.

56
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.560
Capture the profit range Perfect.

57
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.170
Built that string dynamically at runtime.

58
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.950
Fantastic.

59
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.010
Add a new sheet bomb,

60
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.250
bomb,

61
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.470
bomb,

62
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.780
bomb,

63
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.080
bomb,

64
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.500
bomb and capture the name to the valuable.

65
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.920
My new sheet sayings in that sheet seven profit May Day here we're adding the charges in C

66
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160
has been added here on Dhere.

67
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.340
We can change that now to my you sheet.

68
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.420
We don't need to enclose it in quotes because it's a variable name and therefore it doesn't

69
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.470
appear in quotes.

70
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.450
I can also delete the change this because we've no changed it every night.

71
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.570
Andi,

72
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.920
If I select on paste,

73
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.150
in fact I'll just run its out a book and a cane.

74
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.400
Now let's have a look at why that arid?

75
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.290
Because when we actually created the chart there at run time here we can see that the

76
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.880
charts name is chart too.

77
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.350
But it's actually been referred to when we recorded it as chart one.

78
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.750
So the next thing we need to do is to change the name of the chart as we create it.

79
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.520
Okay else,

80
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.690
even the Lexx lecture we'll have a look at doing just that.

81
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.490
I'll see you there
