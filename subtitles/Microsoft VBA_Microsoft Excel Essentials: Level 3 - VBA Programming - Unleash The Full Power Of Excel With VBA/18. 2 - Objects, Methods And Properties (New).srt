1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
Okay,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:02,790
guys,

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:02,950
um,

4
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome back.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Now,

6
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,900
in this lecture,

7
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,510
we're going to discuss objects,

8
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,120
methods on properties.

9
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,590
Now,

10
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,350
technically,

11
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:17,430
I guess we could describe visual basic for applications as an object oriented language and

12
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,500
O L.

13
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,490
And that's because Excel is made up of lots and lots of objects.

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,840
So if we have a look here,

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,510
we have range a one selected,

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,590
so range a one is an object.

17
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,290
Range B one is a different object.

18
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,000
Range.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,560
D six is a different object again.

20
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,880
We now have a little run,

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,750
but none here on this button is an object.

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,900
We have the scratch sheet,

23
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,740
and this is an object on this sheet is an object on this sheet is an object,

24
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,520
so you can imagine the real Lux and lots of objects.

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,990
Now the important thing here is you don't particularly have to know all the names of the

26
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,030
objects and the methods and the properties,

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,080
but what you do have to do is understand what they do just to give you an example.

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,890
I think that Eric Clapton and Jimmy Hendrix,

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,150
who most people would consider to be fine guitarists,

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,130
couldn't read or write music so they couldn't describe it.

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,450
No one would question their mastery of their subject.

32
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,050
So the important thing is that you understand what they do.

33
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,230
Okay,

34
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,360
let's have a look at the little video here,

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,300
so let's imagine for a second we have the object banana now with the object banana.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,690
To separate the object from either the method or the property,

37
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,050
we will use a dot There will never be a space.

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:47,260
We will specify the object and then we will specify specify a dot now a method is an action

39
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,260
or something to do with an object.

40
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:58,150
So if we had our object banana dot we may want to say our method would be eat so we would

41
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,450
say banana dot eat Now sometimes methods can come with extra settings that called

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,480
parameters.

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,970
No,

44
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,610
between the method on the parameter,

45
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,050
that was always a space on DSO.

46
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,440
If we imagine for a second we would have the parameter off eating style.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
So we have the object banana.

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,570
Our method is going to be eat on.

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,550
One of the parameters of our method is going to be the eating style.

50
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,090
Now,

51
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,740
whenever you see a parameter,

52
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,740
it's always going to be followed by a colon and in equals on that is the surefire

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,820
indication that you are working with the method.

54
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,630
Colon and equals always means you are working with the method,

55
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,500
and there we would specify the value of that method.

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,160
So in the case of our banana,

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,710
it will may well be the eating style is peel and munch.

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,250
Okay,

59
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,480
so one is a property.

60
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,840
Well,

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,070
let's take our banana object a gate.

62
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,430
And remember that everything is going to be separated by adults.

63
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,430
Be method or property.

64
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,000
Will.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,480
The property is a characteristic of an object.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,130
So we could say without banana that one of the properties,

67
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,080
one of the characteristics of the object could be its color on a game.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,460
We have dots that separate the object from the property.

69
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:25,400
They can always tell if you're working with the property because it is followed by on

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,480
equals.

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,510
So here we can see the banana object,

72
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,780
its color property equals yellow,

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,170
and they go that say,

74
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,240
you can tell whether you're working with the property or you're working with a method.

75
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,950
If you're working with the property,

76
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,490
it will say equals before the value.

77
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,750
If you're working with a method it will say Coolum and equals.

78
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,630
Let's have a look to re a life example.

79
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,760
So it's come to excel.

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
It's also an F 11 on.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,130
I'm just gonna use this bit here,

82
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,200
So range a five copy is our object.

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,550
Notice what happens when we hit a dot We get this little window pop up and you'll see there

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,110
are two different kinds of entry in here.

85
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,500
There are flaying green books.

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,230
I'm not entirely sure if that's what they are,

87
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,390
but that's what I call them.

88
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,770
And these are the methods.

89
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,220
These are the actions.

90
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,820
These are the things you can do with that object on.

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,730
By default,

92
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,230
the visual basic editor will look at the object that you have,

93
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:32,350
and it will only display the methods and properties that are available to that object.

94
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,680
So if we use this example here,

95
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,140
this select method,

96
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,340
what they could do exactly the scroll down here to get to select,

97
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,130
or I could literally just type s and you can see that Select is already selected.

98
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,350
And it has this little flying green book.

99
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,140
No,

100
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,090
I could either double click on select to select it,

101
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,620
or I could just hit the tab key on they go.

102
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,020
So now we have our objects.

103
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,890
Range a five on our method dot select.

104
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,350
Okay,

105
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,440
so let's have a look at a different one.

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,530
So let's say let's look a property.

107
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,470
If I hit a dot,

108
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,820
you'll see that we also have these little index cards here on the property I'm looking for

109
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,880
here is the front swelling and achieves fund.

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,820
But notice what happens when they hit a dot Again,

111
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,240
you'll see that the property phones of the object range a five also has properties,

112
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,200
So these are sub properties of the main property.

113
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,450
So I could say bold and I'm just going to double click it.

114
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,520
Andi,

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,860
I have no more options.

116
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,190
So for hit dot nothing else comes up.

117
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,250
So I am now at the end of the properties for funds Samonas say equals and I'm going to say

118
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,950
true.

119
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,810
Now,

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,110
if you're unsure,

121
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,780
the best thing to do by far is just record a simple macro.

122
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,250
Have a look at the code that's generated and it's gonna tell you exactly what this

123
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,650
structure looks like.

124
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,520
Now if you don't get these little drop down boxes here,

125
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,120
where my if you don't get these little drop down boxes here.

126
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,000
When you here to dot make sure that you have your settings exactly the same as I do or toe

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,870
list members.

128
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,750
That is what brings up that little box when you hit the dot OK,

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,940
right now,

130
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,810
in the next lecture,

131
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,750
we're gonna have a look.

132
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,620
The hierarchy don't be put off by the name.

133
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,350
It's very simple to understand.

134
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,890
OK,

135
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,370
I'll see you in the next lecture.
