00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Okay,

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.290
guys,

3
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.230
from Welcome back.

4
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.740
And now let's have a look.

5
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.190
This last part here,

6
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.590
this scale in which is very entirely now this is the one that we've just created.

7
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.230
And you'll notice because we did that the paid set up and set it to land escape.

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.530
We have this little dotted line here that shows us the demarcation of where the page will

9
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.900
be.

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.550
So it's down to column and across on all the way down to line 33.

11
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.500
So because it would be very difficult to work out exactly how far that is in pixels,

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.490
what we do know is we want this chart to be the same width as a through.

13
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.390
And I'm also gonna move it down to a six.

14
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.110
I'm going to say I wanted them from a six to a 21.

15
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.650
So we want a through and on a six through a 21.

16
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.890
So with that in mind,

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.110
let's come back here and have a look at this code.

18
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.820
So because this entire subroutine is dealing with the profit by day chart,

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.700
we don't actually have toe activate it because it's already activated.

20
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.970
Because that is all we are working with so we can get rid of that line of code.

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.450
And when I'm also going to do is get rid of all of this here I know.

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.140
And here,

23
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.290
after the active sheet dot shapes profit by day charge dot Laying in a type wits on that is

24
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.320
a property of the active sheet longer say the width is equal to range.

25
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.450
Open brackets on I want a through and because it's from column A over to call him and I'm

26
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.400
gonna close the quotes closer brackets.

27
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.680
And here I am going to say on that property I want from that range is the wits property.

28
00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.170
So whatever the wits off the range eight n is make the active sheet shapes profit by day,

29
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.760
child wits exactly the same size.

30
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.250
And similarly,

31
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.440
we could do exactly the same thing with the height.

32
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.550
So I'm just gonna copy that,

33
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520
paste it immediately underneath,

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.300
tidy it up.

35
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.520
Oops,

36
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.990
a daisy s.

37
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.350
So I think I've just said inserts accepted it dot and this time we want to deal with that

38
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.470
right on.

39
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.780
We wont range.

40
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.800
We're gonna actually say range a six to a 20 to say 21 things that a 21.

41
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.050
And I'm also gonna change this to height H e r GHT,

42
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.820
and I'm also gonna pace.

43
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.060
That's to say six as well.

44
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.350
So changed that there.

45
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.260
Okay,

46
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.150
so I have the correct sheet selected.

47
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.960
I'm going to come up to here,

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.910
and I'm just going to run down to the profit by day.

49
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.980
Debug run to cursor hits f ake and all the way through this there goes our chart.

50
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.420
There is our scaled with a through.

51
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.080
And And here is our scaled Hoat or are precisely set height a six rate 21 on end silver.

52
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.210
When I click in here,

53
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.510
you can see that that matches our prince area perfectly.

54
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.350
OK,

55
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.590
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at sort and the title off

56
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.230
the sheet.

57
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.830
Okay.

58
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
