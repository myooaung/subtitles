00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
Okay,

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.650
guys,

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.680
I almost forgot to cover this on.

4
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.830
Have what happens if you want to call one of your custom functions from another world book

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.830
?

6
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.260
Well,

7
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.910
we already know here that are pie will work perfectly well when we type it in the workbook

8
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.180
in which we've created it.

9
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.460
But if it control and end and add a new file on Dhere,

10
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.560
I typed pie.

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.470
I particularly like it spell pie and said exactly the same thing.

12
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.410
It is not going to know what we're looking at because it is looking in book two for a

13
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.480
custom function called Pie.

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.700
And it doesn't exist.

15
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.150
So what we need to do is specify the path to the file that does contain the custom function

16
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.150
.

17
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.580
Now,

18
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.550
this file must be open now where the quickest way probably to save,

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.760
um,

20
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.240
Intertype.

21
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.130
Everything is going to say equals what we're gonna say.

22
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.040
You sell open brackets,

23
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.770
open quotes,

24
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.200
and we're going to say file name close,

25
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.450
close,

26
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.130
close brackets.

27
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.440
Nantongo that say you get the file Name am path.

28
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.510
I'm just going to copy that Copy and paste special of the top on.

29
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.160
This is the bit I am after the user defined functions,

30
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.930
not XLs m.

31
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.960
It will be an excellent est XLs X when you download it because a com upload files with

32
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.710
Macron's in them.

33
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.510
So what we have to do have a repository,

34
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.000
have the name of the file,

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.040
have another posturing.

36
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.840
Have an exclamation point that tells Excel book to to go look at user defined functions on

37
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.210
the extension on,

38
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.700
then retrieved the function.

39
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.280
So when they hit,

40
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.490
enter boom,

41
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.060
they go.

42
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.850
That's a use it from a different world book.

43
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.460
Okay,

44
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490
that concludes this section on.

45
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.820
I'll see you in the next one.

46
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.750
Thanks very much.
