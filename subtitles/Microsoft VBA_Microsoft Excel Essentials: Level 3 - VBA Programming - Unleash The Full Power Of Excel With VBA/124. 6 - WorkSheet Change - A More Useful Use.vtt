00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.790
guys.

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.790
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.270
Now,

5
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.110
in this lecture,

6
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.030
we're gonna have another look at the worksheet change event,

7
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.660
but we're gonna use it to do something much more useful.

8
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.300
So I am no working with the random data set tab again.

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.910
His Olsen F 11 have double click random data set,

10
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.590
and here is the first deceleration of our code.

11
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.070
Now,

12
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.590
this is the original code from the Microsoft website MST.

13
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.760
End up Microsoft,

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.800
and the full address is here.

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.350
You'll find it in this sheet with the same name,

16
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950
and you can go and have a look at that from Microsoft.

17
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.160
So basically,

18
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.170
the what we're trying to achieve with this code is to find out if a specific cell in a

19
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.160
specific range has bean changed.

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.360
So all I've done here is I've taken the Microsoft Code on.

21
00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.330
I have changed it slightly to say the target is from the range a three to a three XL down.

22
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.880
So those capturing everything from a three to the end off the range a three down.

23
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.750
And then what we've said is if the Intersect is nothing,

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.090
that means the cell I am changing is not in the range a three to the bottom of the A three

25
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.950
data range.

26
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620
Display the message box.

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.600
Do not intersect.

28
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.290
If I select a cell that is within the range a three to a three to the end of the data,

29
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.420
then display the message box that says ranges do intersect.

30
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.520
So here,

31
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.660
I'm going to attempt to change.

32
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.590
Actually here.

33
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.240
I'm just going to say,

34
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.130
burning my mate Bernie on here,

35
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.670
center,

36
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.020
and you can see here that we get the message box that says ranges do not intersect.

37
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.950
Fantastic.

38
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.240
But if I could be OK if I come over here and type Bernie And here center,

39
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.890
we see we get the message box ranges do intersect.

40
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.780
So that useful?

41
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.940
That tells us something.

42
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.060
So I'm gonna hit.

43
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.510
I'm just undo that whip sedating.

44
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.950
I'm just going to undo that.

45
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.190
Yes,

46
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.330
I know the range in sex.

47
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.690
So now I'm back to my original data set.

48
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.250
So this was the first situation I went through.

49
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.430
So that works perfectly.

50
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.840
I confine dirty things are intersecting.

51
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.660
Or if things are not intersecting on,

52
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.480
we'll leave that in there so you can have a play with the code then My second interational

53
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.860
was this an alteration Number two.

54
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.570
And because of rammed everything else out,

55
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.620
this is the code that's actually gonna gonna happen.

56
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.720
So basically,

57
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.100
the shell of the code is precisely the same.

58
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.340
But what we're gonna say is,

59
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.640
if the ice sect is nothing,

60
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.940
that is,

61
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.980
if I don't If I If I don't select to sell,

62
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.700
that's within my A three to the bottom off that data range a three to a three down,

63
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.420
then I just want you to end.

64
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.880
That is,

65
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.870
I don't to display any message boxes.

66
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.800
I don't want anything to happen now.

67
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.070
If they do intersect,

68
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.550
I want to display a message box on that message box is going to say,

69
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.080
Hey,

70
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.570
don't change this to on whatever it is that attempted to change the value to Then we have

71
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.150
this piece of code here on this piece of code.

72
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.950
UN enables the events,

73
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.450
which means it's going to stop it.

74
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:30.190
Iterating again is going to use the application undo which is the undo function in excel.

75
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.050
Nothing vb not control in and said it's the undo function in excel.

76
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.780
And then we are re enabling the application events so excels use will go back to normal.

77
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.210
So let's say let's flip back to here and try it.

78
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.920
So if I type something over here,

79
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.150
so if I take Joe or I take a map,

80
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.050
it's perfectly happy cause it's hitting that end statement because they do not intersect.

81
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.230
But let's imagine for a second that I am a picture Ashley already I haven't picked on

82
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.650
Claire.

83
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.810
No,

84
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.860
I'm not gonna pick on Claire.

85
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.270
Claire frightens me.

86
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.630
I'm gonna pick on.

87
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.460
I'm gonna pick on Emma.

88
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.450
Emma is my favorite.

89
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.260
So imagine I am Emma and I think do I don't want to do thing three.

90
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.850
I'm gonna change that to Joe.

91
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.800
No,

92
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.850
on that change.

93
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.150
When I hit Enter,

94
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.790
we're going to get this message box pop up.

95
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.240
It says,

96
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.790
Hey,

97
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.410
don't change this to Joe because that's exactly what the string say's and notice what

98
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.340
happens when I click.

99
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.950
OK,

100
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.320
he at the cell.

101
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.040
We just changed the undue occurs and it goes back to Emma.

102
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.930
So if anyone comes in here and says,

103
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.550
you know what,

104
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.480
actually I think actually could do this one.

105
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.160
Just a sign that one too young,

106
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.810
actually and hit center.

107
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.470
That would say,

108
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.750
Hey,

109
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.070
don't change this to actually,

110
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.140
when they click OK,

111
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.320
it will automatically go back to Joe.

112
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.220
OK,

113
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.460
I'll see when the next lecturer will have a look at a top secret classified worksheets.

114
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.950
I'll see you in the next lecture.
