00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Okay,

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.710
guys.

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.900
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.320
Now,

5
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.440
what we're going to do in this lecture is deconstruct the sun screen male subroutine.

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.450
And that's this one just here on.

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.510
That's the subroutine that we're going to use to gather all of our data in order to send

8
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.450
out emails.

9
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.050
No way.

10
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.060
At the bottom of our sunscreen e routine,

11
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.880
we have this little loop here that is going to call the e mail routine,

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.160
which is what I have called the code we just looked at.

13
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.860
And this is a copy of it on this.

14
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.260
Just a few Mordecai modifications in there,

15
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.610
but we'll come to that in a second.

16
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.240
Okay?

17
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.770
A few things to point out up from Firstly,

18
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.320
we are going to say option base one,

19
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.520
because we are using an array and we wanted to a race to begin at one and not zero.

20
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.200
So we're stating right at the top option base one.

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.770
Okay,

22
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.030
We also want to force all of their variables to be declared.

23
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.370
So we have said option explicit,

24
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.270
and as you'll remember,

25
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.910
that force is very well built.

26
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.760
Declaration.

27
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.530
Okay,

28
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.860
Now,

29
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.540
because I want a pass data bit from one subroutine to another subroutine.

30
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.910
So So routine one gathers the data subroutine to sends the emails.

31
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.610
I need to pass data between the two subs.

32
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.650
I'm declaring the variables up here module level.

33
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.910
So I have dim blonde count,

34
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.330
and that is gonna count the number of blondes.

35
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.430
This will become clearer as we go through the code.

36
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.740
My array,

37
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.900
open brackets,

38
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.850
close brackets.

39
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.160
Because we don't yet know how big it is until we get the cant of the blondes.

40
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.590
So I'm dimension in the ray of the top or on declaring the array,

41
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.060
but well,

42
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.440
read emit later.

43
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.230
Okay?

44
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.010
My counter is a simple counter.

45
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.190
To populate the array,

46
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.200
my subject is gonna hold the subject of our email.

47
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.630
Okay,

48
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.860
let's get down to the code.

49
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.240
So here we go.

50
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.090
Sub sunscreen.

51
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.610
Male.

52
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.460
What this subroutine is going to do is it's going to look at our source data,

53
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.670
which is very familiar to you by now on,

54
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.670
What we're gonna do is we're gonna look for anyone with blonde hair on.

55
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.850
We're going to send them a promotional email about this fantastic sunscreen that we have

56
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.050
specifically for people with blond hair.

57
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.650
Okay,

58
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.350
so here's the data set.

59
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.170
So what we're gonna do is firstly,

60
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.260
we're going to state what the subject line will be and this is going to appear in a email.

61
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.090
So we're going to say is my subject equals check out our nose.

62
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.370
New sunscreens.

63
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.910
So far,

64
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.450
so good.

65
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.050
The sheet with the data in this She here has a VB name of ship data.

66
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.660
So we are making sure we're on the right screen.

67
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.370
So sure data dot select.

68
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.740
This is all very familiar,

69
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.260
Teoh.

70
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.650
Sure,

71
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.340
by now next we have the get blonde can't So what we're going to use here?

72
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.950
What we want to achieve is a royal A count.

73
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.580
How many times does the word blonde appear in column e now?

74
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.650
Because there is not account if equivalent function in V B A.

75
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.640
We have to call the application worksheet function count.

76
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.140
If so,

77
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.280
what?

78
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.860
We sell his application worksheet function count If range e comma on Dhere,

79
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.500
we say what we are looking for So in range E look for all the instances of blond and return

80
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.290
that count two blonde Count on.

81
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.060
Now we're going to know how many e mails we're gonna have to send.

82
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.940
So now we know how many e mails we have to send.

83
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.780
We can now re Dimension era ray so array Mireille is going to be.

84
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.070
However many blondes we have on.

85
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.610
We want to elements.

86
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.560
We want to elements because we want to get their first name on.

87
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.180
We also need to capture their email address now.

88
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.740
Obviously,

89
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.190
this is a test system,

90
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.320
so all the email addresses of Just Excel Essentials at gmail dot com.

91
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.720
But obviously in real life you would have actual email addresses in there.

92
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.360
Okay,

93
00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.800
so far,

94
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.280
so good.

95
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.380
So next we come down to this section here,

96
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.300
which is fine.

97
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.820
The first Blonde in Column E.

98
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.960
Now this is by far the most efficient way of doing this,

99
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.680
because if you have 10,000 lines of data,

100
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.990
you could easily write a loop that says,

101
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.870
Find my first instance of this.

102
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.770
Is it in line one?

103
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.250
No move to Line two is in line to know moved to Line three,

104
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.400
but you could be down to line 50,000 before you find your first entry.

105
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.190
So by far the most efficient method is to find it using the find,

106
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.050
command or find function.

107
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.030
Now,

108
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.210
for some reason,

109
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.100
on.

110
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.130
I've never quite worked out why you cannot say columns e dot find and then say what you

111
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.870
want to find.

112
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.030
So you have to specify this in two separate bits of code.

113
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.980
So what we're gonna do is say columns e select that's going to select the whole of column E

114
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.980
.

115
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
And then with that selection,

116
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.650
we're gonna find what we're gonna find.

117
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.580
This is just from a recorded macro we're going to find blond,

118
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.310
and that will find our first section now because we've selected what we actually want to do

119
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.970
is make the active cell.

120
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.210
That is the first instance we found the active cell.

121
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.090
So at the moment,

122
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.280
we have all of e selected.

123
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.140
But what we actually want to do is make that first found self.

124
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.740
The active cells are active.

125
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.650
Cell got select that finds our first instance of the blonde.

126
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.720
So blonde isn't at position number one.

127
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.850
This is going to save you a boatload of time.

128
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.650
Now,

129
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.840
the counter is what we're going to use to populate our array.

130
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.630
So we're gonna initialize the counter that is,

131
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.880
we're going to set its beginning value at zero.

132
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.950
Okay,

133
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.530
now we have a while wend loop.

134
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.250
And what we're gonna do with this while wind loop is Let me just flip back.

135
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.540
We're going to continue.

136
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.990
Remember,

137
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.280
we're in column and we've selected the first blonde,

138
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.050
whatever that is there locally.

139
00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.190
And we're gonna carry on all the way down here until we hit our first blank.

140
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.080
So we're going to say,

141
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.090
while the active seldom value does not equal blank,

142
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.090
then continue toe wind.

143
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.510
Now,

144
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.960
the first thing we want to find out is if my cantor,

145
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.240
which is added down here just here,

146
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.760
is equal to the blonde count because it could be that we have x number of blondes within

147
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.530
our list.

148
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.870
But it could be that the last 2000 interests don't actually have a blonde in there.

149
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.620
So once we've captured them all,

150
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.550
we don't want to carry on looping down all the rest of the rose to get to the very bottom.

151
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.480
To make this active cell doesn't equal blank statement.

152
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.870
True,

153
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.890
What we want to do is constantly check Hemley,

154
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.110
do we need And how many have we already got?

155
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.790
Once the two values match,

156
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.670
then actually we can just skip the loop because we've got everything that we need to do.

157
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.370
OK,

158
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.070
so next let's have a look at this eso here we haven't.

159
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.150
If the active cell equals blonde,

160
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.690
that's very straightforward.

161
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.220
If the act itself does equal blonde,

162
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.850
my cancer equals my counter plus one a Remember,

163
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.200
we initialized it here,

164
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.600
So at the moment it's worth zero on here.

165
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.400
It's gonna be with zero plus one.

166
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.190
So if we have found a blonde,

167
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.850
we're gonna increase my counter by one.

168
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.530
So now my cans at is worth one.

169
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.880
So my array one the value of my cantor Comma one.

170
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.250
The first element is going to read this string just here.

171
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.710
So let me see if I can keep that in shut and just drag out a little bit.

172
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.080
That should still be in shot.

173
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.990
So what we're saying is,

174
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.300
let's break this down.

175
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.830
We're using the in string and the active cell offset zero rose minus four.

176
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.750
So we're looking in column A and we are looking for a space.

177
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.140
So that's what this does.

178
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.950
This is looking for a space in the string in the correspondent cell in column.

179
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.260
So once we have found the string,

180
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.070
we're going to use the left function again.

181
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.680
We're looking at column Active cell offset zero minus four.

182
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.730
And we're going to subtract one because this space is going to be one character after the

183
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.520
first name.

184
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.940
So that's a very jazzy way of extracting the first name from this to name String that

185
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.230
appears in column A.

186
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.610
Okay,

187
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.120
so far,

188
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.450
so good and see fucking putting that back over there.

189
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.580
Okay,

190
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.370
Now we get down to loading the second element of the array on my array.

191
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.310
My counter,

192
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.580
which on the first pass through is worth one.

193
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:46.150
So my array one element to is active cell offset 02 which is the email address.

194
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.140
Okay,

195
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.640
so far,

196
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.150
so good.

197
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.800
Once we've done all that moved down the cell.

198
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.290
Now,

199
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.290
if the active cell wasn't blonde,

200
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.200
what we want to do is just move down a cell anyway.

201
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.040
And then we're going to repeat on.

202
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.870
That's going to continue to execute until my counter matches the count off blondes in our

203
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.500
list.

204
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.270
Sorry.

205
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.230
There's something I forgot to point out right here.

206
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.950
When we do this,

207
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.910
my counter equals blown count.

208
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.590
If it's true,

209
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:19.020
then go to e mail section and you can see down here we have something that says email

210
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.700
section Colon on.

211
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.020
Even if I try to tap that over when I click off,

212
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.790
it will automatically go back.

213
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.250
Now,

214
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.420
this is a label and you can identify label because it has colon after it on.

215
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.070
All this does is it will say when my cantor equals blonde count,

216
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.720
then go to E mail section.

217
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.090
It will completely skip all the rest of this code and immediately moved down to here.

218
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:45.910
OK,

219
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.490
so far,

220
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.970
so good.

221
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:52.220
Now we're going to use my counts at again on what we're going to do is say,

222
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.800
for my cancer equals one to the number of blondes that we have.

223
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.870
So for every blonde we have,

224
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.110
we want to look through this one time now because we've already captured the value of this

225
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.370
into the variable,

226
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.590
we can no pass this toe e mail routine on.

227
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.930
We're gonna have a look at that in the next like jet.

228
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.350
OK,

229
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.520
I'll see you in the next link,

230
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:12.850
chap.
