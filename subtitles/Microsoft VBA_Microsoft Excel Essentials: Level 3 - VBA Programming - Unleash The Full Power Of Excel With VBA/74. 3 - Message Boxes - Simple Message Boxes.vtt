00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
Okay,

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.160
guys.

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.070
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.600
In the last couple of lectures,

5
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.120
we have look at input boxes and here we could use those to get data from users on there.

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.920
We're gonna have a look at the input box.

7
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.680
His sister,

8
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.600
which is the message box.

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.990
Now,

10
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590
there are two flavors of message boxes.

11
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.500
Those are those that display simple messages and those that return a response to a variable

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.500
.

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.020
We're gonna look at both of them in the next couple of lectures.

14
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.550
Okay,

15
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.050
We're going to begin with a simple message box on the format for message boxes.

16
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.370
M s G b O X on this is a simple message box.

17
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.650
So whole or we're gonna do is hit space.

18
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.170
You can see that we've been asked for a prompt.

19
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.150
So I'm just gonna type quotes because this is gonna be texting to say this is a simple

20
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.850
message.

21
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.530
Books,

22
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.460
Andi,

23
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.500
close quotes that I'm gonna hit comma and you can see that we have a bunch of different

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.310
options here.

25
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.110
We can get vb abort,

26
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.580
Retry.

27
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.800
Ignore VB Critical default.

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.140
But 1234 loads and loads of different things.

29
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.370
But what?

30
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.890
We're going to select his vb.

31
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.550
Okay,

32
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.070
Only So basically,

33
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.410
that means that on the message,

34
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.310
But on the message box,

35
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.830
there's only gonna be one button,

36
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.230
and it will be okay.

37
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.720
Only on then we're gonna type a comma,

38
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.100
and then we're gonna get the title.

39
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.880
So the title,

40
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.670
we're gonna say hello and close quotes and then come off.

41
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.250
And then when I run that code,

42
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.130
there's only one line,

43
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.280
so it can't do much wrong.

44
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.310
I'm just going to hit play,

45
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.830
and you can see that we get this message box pop up here.

46
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.740
Hello?

47
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.510
Is our title just here.

48
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.680
You can see that we only have the okay,

49
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.870
but that's indicated by this,

50
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.370
Phoebe.

51
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.950
Okay,

52
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.450
only.

53
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.550
And this is a simple message box is the text that's displayed in here,

54
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.430
so just click,

55
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.910
OK?

56
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.770
And that finishes that subroutine.

57
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.690
So that is a very simple message box.

58
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.380
Okay,

59
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.540
let's have a look at how we use the message box to get some data from the sheet itself.

60
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.860
I'm going to use the same code and change it to message boxes to,

61
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.960
and I'm also gonna change the comment in there from one of cleverly prepared earlier lips.

62
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.730
Just copy over that would be much better off they go so we can display a simple message box

63
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.730
.

64
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.000
Having read the prompt from a cell value.

65
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.830
So many say,

66
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.440
this is my text and we're going to read from there.

67
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.540
So Ellipse click off or we're going to do is where we have this statement here.

68
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.080
We're just going to change that and say range open brackets open quotes a one because

69
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.040
that's where I found you.

70
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.870
Lies don't value ons space.

71
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.050
So now when we execute that code,

72
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.570
you can see that we get hello.

73
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.840
Because we didn't change that.

74
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.460
And this is my text has being read from range A one dot value,

75
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.570
which is this cell over here and just click OK,

76
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.250
and they go.

77
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.950
So that's how you can read data from a cell and displayed in a message box.

78
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.350
Okay,

79
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.500
Now,

80
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.950
the 3rd 1 we're going to look at,

81
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.550
we're going to steal the code that we used before in the input box section.

82
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.660
So I'm just gonna pace that in here,

83
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.930
and I've cleverly modified it and you can see that this code I'm just going to step through

84
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.420
it so you can remember it does Alan Andi F eight.

85
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.380
What's your last name?

86
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.300
Jarvis.

87
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.590
And enter.

88
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.370
I am gonna build my string,

89
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.080
which is exactly what we did before.

90
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.690
And I'm gonna proper case that string here.

91
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.820
But this time my message box is going to return my string VP.

92
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.210
VB Okay,

93
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.630
only on greeting.

94
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.750
So we've done exactly what we did up here.

95
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.710
But instead of writing the value into the prompt from a one,

96
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.070
we're going to use the string.

97
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.000
We've just built from these to use inputs.

98
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.270
So when they hit F eight we know,

99
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.910
get this which says,

100
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.700
Pleased to meet you,

101
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.580
Alan Jarvis,

102
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.300
But in a message box.

103
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.990
Okay,

104
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.170
so that's all you need to know about simple message boxes.

105
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.290
In the next lecture,

106
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.880
we're gonna have a look at message boxes that return values to a variable on.

107
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.150
I'll see you in the next lecture.
