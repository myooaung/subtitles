1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Okay,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:02,760
guys.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,730
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,950
Right now let's have a look.

5
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,430
What we want to do for the next light for side to or we're gonna do is copy all of this

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,780
code that we've just written because most of this is going to become going to be constant.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,180
We're always gonna want to add a new slide when we add a new slide.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,950
We're always gonna want our company logo to appear in precisely the right position.

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,460
We're always gonna want our title toe have the same format.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,440
So basically,

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,250
almost all of this code will never change.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,330
This is going to be the bit that we're gonna be working on in this particular lecture.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,640
But here's the thing.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,060
When we copy this code,

15
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,000
we're gonna have to change a few things.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,120
We're probably gonna have to change the layout,

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,340
but we're also gonna have to change the index,

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,500
so we're gonna deal with that immediately.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,330
What we're gonna do is comes the top on.

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,740
We're gonna add a new modular level variable,

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,190
and we can just call it dim X as into General on all X is going to do is allow us to set

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,670
the slide number he at the very beginning.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,970
So set slide number.

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,540
And we're just going to say X equals one whips a X equals one.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,060
They go.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,940
So now,

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,670
instead of saying index one,

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:28,040
we can say index X and all we need to do is remember to change this lumber to match the

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,250
slide number mentioned here.

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,600
Now also,

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,750
we have it again in hair slides one.

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,510
So we want that to say slides X and there we should be good to go.

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,490
So we already have slide one slide to to the run order there.

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,080
So it's going to copy all of this code for slide one.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,920
A copy pasted above.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,700
I'm gonna call it slide to they would change the slide number two,

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,160
too.

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,870
So now that is going to appear.

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,150
It index to their layer one.

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,050
That's the title on the subtitle,

41
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,770
but we don't want layout one again.

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,400
What we want is the title of top on bullet points text at the bottom.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,050
So that is layout number two.

44
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,300
So let's was back up to the top and just change the layers to number two.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,040
Okay,

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,000
now let's just run that code to see what that looks like so far.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,340
So when I hit play,

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,270
let's just say Allen hit.

49
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,640
Enter Andi,

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,520
boom!

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,940
A Go.

52
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,490
So we have our title Subtitle Second slide Multi Report for January 2016 Northern Region.

53
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,590
That's perfectly fine presented by Alan,

54
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,110
and you can see that that is listed as a bullet point.

55
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,100
Okay,

56
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,930
so let's close that what we actually want to do if I can just drank this over a little bit

57
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:46,930
,

58
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,740
I want to change the wording there.

59
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,910
I don't want that to say a range,

60
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,980
a wonder value.

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:04,200
I want that to say something like summary off performance on with the summary of

62
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,270
performance whips.

63
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,740
There again,

64
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,410
I wanted to actually highlight or right values in a three a four and a five this commentary

65
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,660
that were produced before.

66
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,970
So here I'm going to say text equals.

67
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,720
I'm just gonna happen under school and at the new line SE range A three is Nick's.

68
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,700
Arrange a three.

69
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,890
I don't value Andi vb new line because we want to separate.

70
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:44,210
That's not on BB new line because we want this to appear as a second bullet on bond space.

71
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,670
Underscore on now.

72
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,280
Just copy that on pace it a few times underneath.

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,550
So range a three and two range a three,

74
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,930
so we won't range a three range,

75
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,080
A full range a five.

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
And that will be the end.

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,370
So I can just sleeve the and delete that.

78
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:02,590
So,

79
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,010
no.

80
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,930
In our second box underneath our second shape,

81
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,900
we should get this common tree with separate bullet points.

82
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
So let's just run that code and have Look what it does.

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,360
Alan on bum bum,

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,510
bum,

85
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,060
bum bump.

86
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,740
And there we go.

87
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,220
Monthly report for January 2016 presented by Alan Summary performance.

88
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,940
And there is our common tree in bullet points.

89
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,550
Okay,

90
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,360
fantastic.

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,340
We're gonna copy,

92
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,540
slide to to create slide three,

93
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,070
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
