00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Okay,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.250
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.040
So this is the code we just looked at in the last lecture.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.850
So I'm just gonna delete down out of here.

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.640
I'm gonna scroll down again through private sub the basics.

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.140
And I am now going to steal this bit of coast.

7
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm just gonna get control and see to copy it and come back up to here,

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.950
and I'm gonna hit paste.

9
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.520
Now,

10
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.570
here we are,

11
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.450
doing something very similar to the range object.

12
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.890
But this is called the cells objects.

13
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.450
I'm just gonna click here.

14
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.230
Just so we're in a different cell when we're going to step through there.

15
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.940
So again,

16
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.720
hitting f eight.

17
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.580
This is a subway.

18
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.950
Ron,

19
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.640
this is an ex Im occurred.

20
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.630
They were going to execute.

21
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.270
And this is sells one comma one dot select and notice what happens over here in Excel they

22
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.580
go.

23
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.100
So range a one has bean selected.

24
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.230
Now,

25
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.950
if you look at the remarks here,

26
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.150
it selects the cells down one road.

27
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.710
So the first number represents the road.

28
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.480
So one road down on one column across.

29
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.430
So buying any of the term that's a one.

30
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.510
And similarly,

31
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.280
if we FAA through this code.

32
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
We have selected the self that is five rows down,

33
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.280
the first number and one column across,

34
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.860
which is this column here.

35
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.990
So column one is a on row five is obviously Row five.

36
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.670
Now you can.

37
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.310
Also,

38
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.270
though it gets a little more complicated.

39
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.080
Select a range by state in range,

40
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.450
the first cell comma,

41
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.160
not a colon comma to separate the arguments on.

42
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.740
Then the second range so fierce.

43
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.330
F eight.

44
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.290
Here you can see that I have ranged from cells five rows down,

45
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.530
one column across a 52 cells separated by a comma,

46
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.190
14 rows down on one camera across close rackets.

47
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.620
Close brackets dot select has been selected.

48
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.750
You may be wondering why on earth you would need to different methods to do exactly the

49
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.550
same thing.

50
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.250
Well,

51
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.690
range is very simple to program because literally everyone knows the naming conventions of

52
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.720
the cells and excel.

53
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.940
So if somebody said,

54
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.160
Hey,

55
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.340
0.2 d three very quickly,

56
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.770
be able to point to d three.

57
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.150
But if someone said 30.2 cells 273 come at 14 perhaps that's not gonna be quite so simple,

58
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.150
but when you are using loops specifying the range by its cell row and column could be very

59
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.990
useful there.

60
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.350
Don't worry.

61
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.610
If you don't know what loops arcs,

62
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.330
we have an entire section dedicated Teoh loops and variables and all these kind of things

63
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.380
which you're going to come to in a little while.

64
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.230
Okay,

65
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
