1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
Okay,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,460
guys,

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,670
I'm welcome back.

4
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,060
Now,

5
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,340
this is again from the sub,

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,450
the basics code.

7
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,800
And we've already looked at this particular line in the last lecture.

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,070
I just included it in the same group.

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,260
So if you happen to look there,

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,380
you'll find exactly what you're looking for.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,160
So those two particular blocks of code appear twice in sub the basics.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,800
Okay.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,850
Never gonna have a look at two other properties.

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,050
They are the Rowe property on the column property.

15
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,260
And all this is going to do using the dot Rowe property is returned the row number of the

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,170
active cells.

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,330
If I click on D seven and hit F eight on read into the variable,

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,650
my row number equals the active cell dot ro on the hitter face and hover over here.

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,440
You can see that my row number is row seven.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,860
Then that's gonna be particularly useful if we need to work out which row of data we are

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,080
working in on.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,690
Similarly,

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,310
we have a corresponding function called dot column on.

24
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,950
I bet you can guess what that does say.

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,080
If I hit f eight on hover over here,

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,470
you can see that my column number is column number four.

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,200
So I know.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,110
Know that the active cell is in Row seven,

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,560
Column for on That's going to be fantastic if we use in cells.

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,920
But what happens if we want to actually get it in plain old a one?

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Speak and find out that we have he seven selected,

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,220
and that's gonna be the subject of the next lecture.

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,810
Okay,

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,750
I'll see you that.
