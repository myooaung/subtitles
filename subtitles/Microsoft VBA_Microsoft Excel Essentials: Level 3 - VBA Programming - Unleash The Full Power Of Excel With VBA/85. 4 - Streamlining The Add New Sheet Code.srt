1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Okay,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,660
guys.

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,530
And welcome back,

4
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,250
That would have done temporarily.

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,690
I've saved this file is a macro enabled workbook that where can happily play with the code

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,750
and not lose it if I accidentally save it without changing it to macro enabled workbook.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,110
So this is a sheet we just created.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,460
So it's just hit all 10 F 11 and have a look at the code that's being generated and you can

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,400
see that it is considerable.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,870
So that really is quite a staggering piece of code there.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,160
We already know that most of this is going to be redundant.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,150
So what we're going to do,

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,500
though,

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,720
is hit control and a and control and see and copy all of this code.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,990
And I'm gonna come up to incest and I'm gonna choose module toe,

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,570
add a new module.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,710
I'm in a paste,

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,850
all of that code in here.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:57,250
I'm just gonna comment right up top That says original recorded code.

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:04,440
And I'm also going to change the name of module to to marred a rich groups.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,860
And now code said that way it doesn't matter if you make a complete hash of module one

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,960
where the code lives.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,580
We automatically have a copy.

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,230
It isn't gonna cost us anything.

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,620
We're not gonna be using it.

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,830
We're just having in there.

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,040
So we have a backup.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,650
Okay,

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,570
so let's have a look at this code that we've generated.

30
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,220
Now,

31
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,050
throughout this piece of coding,

32
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,830
we're gonna have multiple variables on.

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,150
What I want to do is ensure that all the variables are declared.

34
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,670
So when does come right up to the very top of the code on a type in option,

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,750
explicit on what option explicit does is it forces you to declare the valuables,

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,470
so forces variable.

37
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,650
Declaration.

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,450
Fantastic.

39
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,990
Sub on new sheet.

41
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,620
Now,

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,440
this is a staggering piece of code for essentially.

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,500
What we did was we added a new sheets.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,570
We made it landscape orientation,

45
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,550
and we wanted it to print in one by 11 page tall,

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,550
one page white.

47
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,400
So let's deconstruct this code.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm just gonna remove these here for a second,

49
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,040
and we can see the first line the sheets on after active sheet,

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,260
which adds the new sheets.

51
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,750
So that is definitely one.

52
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,650
The piece of code that we want adds a new sheet after the active sheet.

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,570
Fantastic.

54
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,790
That is one of the hundreds of lines of code that we need.

55
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,750
Eso Let's give ourselves a bit of breathing room application,

56
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,690
print communication titles Rose.

57
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,360
We didn't do anything without that.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,540
Can all go applications?

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,450
Print communication,

60
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,260
true Prince area Nothing in their print communication.

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,810
False.

62
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,430
We don't need any of that.

63
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,480
Now we get into this big with end with thing and somewhere in here there it is.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,000
It will say orientation,

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Excel One escape on.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,510
That is the only change we made when we did the first change.

67
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,640
The other one will be wrapped up in this second with end with.

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,220
So I'm just gonna delete everything from there on because we only have one action we don't

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,730
actually do with end with.

70
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,840
So we can just take this dot orientation and move it immediately after the page set up so I

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,950
can delete the with.

72
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,850
I can delete the end with on here is a next line of code.

73
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,750
Let's just bring that up.

74
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,250
Tablet in on that sets Page two,

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,150
lend skate.

76
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,590
Okay,

77
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,930
so it's coming down already.

78
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,410
Here we have this print communication True thing entitles Rose,

79
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,210
which you didn't do anything with on all of that.

80
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,080
So we don't need any of that.

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,270
And here we get to our next with end with and again,

82
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,390
we're on the active sheet,

83
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,750
Dr Page set up,

84
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,510
lose and lose different things on what we actually changed was this Now because we're doing

85
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,250
two things,

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,690
I am going to leave that within a with end with Bronwyn.

87
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,300
Delete all the things that we didn't change,

88
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,860
which is all of this stuff down here.

89
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,170
And I'm just going to delete that in tidied up.

90
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:20,100
So we have a with and with There you go And that Let me just add a comment in there that

91
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:31,580
scales to print on a single pinch Fantasticks us Bring that up application,

92
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,770
print communications.

93
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,110
True,

94
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,980
we don't need that.

95
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,810
So that is nearly all of the code that we need.

96
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,770
But we do need one more thing.

97
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,360
What we need to know is what the name off the sheet is,

98
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,550
because in this particular instance it was she won,

99
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,160
but we ran it again,

100
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,090
be she two or three or four or whatever.

101
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,280
The next sheet in sequence would bay.

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,570
So here's our first module level variable declaration dim because we want it to be used in

103
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,340
all of the subroutines.

104
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:08,450
My new sheet as string I'm gonna say I'll tidy this up a little bit.

105
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:19,950
So they all line up eso this holds their name off the nearly created sheet.

106
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,370
Okay,

107
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,510
so this holds named the newly created sheet.

108
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,330
And here it is.

109
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,240
So my new sheet,

110
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,830
we can say my new sheet and I'm typing in lower case because we have already declared it up

111
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,060
here.

112
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:41,060
It's automatically going to capitalize equals active sheet dot name.

113
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,320
Now we know it's gonna be that to sheik us.

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,550
It will have just added it just here.

115
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,110
So that's the new sheet routine sorted.

116
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,500
Now,

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm just gonna comment that I'm gonna make it private and I'm gonna comment,

118
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,000
comment?

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100
It's a code complete,

120
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,680
and then I'll add a note to say exactly what it does.

121
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,370
Okay,

122
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,770
I'll see you in the next lecture.

123
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,970
Will have a look at deconstructing this profit by day or profit by days of gold in their

124
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,810
profit.

125
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,680
By day they go.

126
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,410
OK,

127
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,850
I'll see you in the next lecture
