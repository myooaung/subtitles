1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,680
guys,

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,740
some welcome back.

4
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,230
OK,

5
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,740
we've had a look at some of the most commonly used methods.

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:06,920
Now,

7
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,270
let's have a quick look at some of the commonly used properties.

8
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,230
So here,

9
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,450
we're going to be playing with the front property.

10
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,670
Now,

11
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,150
I've already got the text.

12
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,540
Hello?

13
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,630
Written into a one.

14
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,410
And here we're going to be working with the object range.

15
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,150
I want this one just here.

16
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,620
We're gonna hit dot font dot bold and say true.

17
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,950
So you can probably guess what this is going to do.

18
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,090
I'm just gonna hit f eight and go through,

19
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:36,060
and you can see the text in a one has gone bold near the opposites or the reverse function

20
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,030
to that is font dot bold equals false.

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,050
So if that if so,

22
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,000
if I hit f eight again,

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,540
they go,

24
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,180
It's no been emboldened.

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,740
Now there are two ways that you can set a front,

26
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,830
a bold or not bold or regular by any other name on that it's used in that is to use the

27
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,460
funds property on the fund style property.

28
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,420
Now that has a specific use,

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,170
which we're going to get to in just a second.

30
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,220
So here.

31
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,980
Let's just do exactly the same thing.

32
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,410
Make the text bond to use in the font style property of funds.

33
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,420
So they go.

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,750
Text has gone bold,

35
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,430
and now I can set it back to regular notice that I have regular in quotes,

36
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,180
just as I had bowled in quotes a few seconds ago.

37
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,090
On they go,

38
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,760
it's back to regular now.

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,290
The beauty with fun style issue can change mawr than one format or more than one phone

40
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,150
style at the same time.

41
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,310
So here you can see in quotes I have bold italic.

42
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,200
So this is one line of code to do two separate things.

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,520
So when I hit F eight,

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,350
they go,

45
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,590
we get it in bold italics.

46
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,460
Now,

47
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,860
I strongly encourage you just set up a new worksheet,

48
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,050
open a new workbook,

49
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:53,620
type something to sell a one type range a one dot and have a play around with all the

50
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,060
different properties and see what they do.

51
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,190
So here we're gonna look at the range a one interior dark color property and set it to V B

52
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,640
red.

53
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,020
Now all of the colors in Excel and there are tens of thousands,

54
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,660
maybe millions of Kalis have a different number.

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,100
So if you record a macro,

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,390
you may find that a particular yellow is 6 5527 Whatever.

57
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,610
But you can also use if you literally if you type in low case such as we be read baby green

58
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,450
vb blue.

59
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,090
If it capitalizes the way this is,

60
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,460
it is still a recognized name and visual basic.

61
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,080
So now if I hit F eight there you go.

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,410
We can see that the interior property of range A one the color of the interior property has

63
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,560
turned to read.

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,260
Okay,

65
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,870
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at a fume or of the commonly

66
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,750
use properties.

67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,950
I'll see that.
