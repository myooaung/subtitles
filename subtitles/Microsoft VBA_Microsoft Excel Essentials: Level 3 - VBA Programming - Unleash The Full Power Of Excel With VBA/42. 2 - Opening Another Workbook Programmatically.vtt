00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
Okay,

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.960
guys.

3
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.170
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.400
Now,

5
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.200
in this lecture,

6
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.370
we're gonna have a look at opening another workbook.

7
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.970
Programmatically on the structure of it looks just like this first line of code just here.

8
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.590
So what we have is workbooks.

9
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.900
That's the object dot Open.

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.730
That's the method space and nowhere into parameters.

11
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.890
Now,

12
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.940
the first parameter and the one you absolutely cannot omit is the file name.

13
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.560
And you can turn your working with a method because we have a problem and we haven't equals

14
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.560
.

15
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.650
Now this is always specified inside of quotes and comes in two parts.

16
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.640
It comes firstly with the complete path to the file.

17
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.020
So in this instance,

18
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.330
Book one does XLs ex lives in C colon slash users Alan death stop.

19
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.710
If you're not entirely sure how to get that,

20
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.430
if you can see your file just right,

21
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.920
click it.

22
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.800
I know this is slightly off screen,

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.540
but you'll see in the second choose properties and then this window is going to pop up.

24
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.590
If you click security,

25
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.220
you can copy the path on the file name precisely.

26
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.880
And that's exactly how I wrote this code.

27
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.730
A Just when here coupled that came over to this.

28
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.670
And then I pasted the answer in here So that say,

29
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.330
you get the path of the full name or you could use the code that we use a little bit

30
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.750
earlier.

31
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.290
Okay,

32
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.050
so let's just it ace and excuse through that code.

33
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.800
So where?

34
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.680
Books Open file.

35
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.740
Name C users Ang Desktop book one dot Excel s ex.

36
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.570
Andi.

37
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.290
There you go.

38
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.390
That is Book one opened programmatically.

39
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.980
So far,

40
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.140
so good on now.

41
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.270
I'm just going to rent that out and we're gonna come down to the next one now This up to

42
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.470
him here is exactly the same line of code.

43
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.000
I've just separated across multiple lines with space and an underscore,

44
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.230
but I think there are about 16 different parameters that you can set when you open a work

45
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.660
book,

46
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.390
which is gonna look at a few of them here.

47
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.640
Probably the most commonly used ones on this is the next one we're gonna have a look at.

48
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.950
No,

49
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.240
to add a parameter,

50
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.950
you literally just comma.

51
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.930
And then you add your parameters.

52
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.890
So this particular line of code is gonna open exactly the same workbook.

53
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.350
But it will open it up as read only true.

54
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.010
So when I hit our fate,

55
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.610
the workbook has opened again.

56
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.510
But this time you can see its read only interesting.

57
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.400
Ok,

58
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.650
now,

59
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.940
the 3rd 1 on a very important one,

60
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.190
particularly if you have password protected books is You can also specify the password to a

61
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.800
password protected workbook.

62
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.760
When you open it by using the password,

63
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.270
colon equals on whatever the password is Now,

64
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.760
obviously,

65
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.650
if you're using,

66
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.650
if you're storing passwords in your code,

67
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.090
you must lock your code.

68
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.450
Otherwise,

69
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150
there's no point in having passwords.

70
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.850
So what I'm gonna dio this is on my desktop,

71
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.950
so I'm just going to double click it and you can see if I just try and open it in the

72
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.780
regular fashion by double clicking.

73
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.650
It's going to say,

74
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.880
Hey,

75
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.480
give me the password before you let me in.

76
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.350
So cancel.

77
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.540
Then I'm gonna execute this line of code on.

78
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.650
There you go password protected Excel file.

79
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.570
That's this,

80
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.810
and we managed to open it programmatically without having to type the password.

81
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.460
Okay,

82
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.510
now there are other parameters of South.

83
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.640
Things are about 15 16 in all,

84
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.220
some of which you'll probably never use the most common ones who have already looked at

85
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.760
openers,

86
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.380
read only opening a password protected file.

87
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.790
But we do have a few others,

88
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.520
and these are the ones that I've used in the past.

89
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.870
So if your workbook has links to external data sources,

90
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.570
you can specify whether or not it will update those links.

91
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.030
When it opens on,

92
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.170
all you need to do literally is here,

93
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.990
just hit comma and then say update links on whatever the value is that you want.

94
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.150
And you can have as many of these in your open routine as you like,

95
00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.960
so update links.

96
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.910
Zero does not update the external references on opening,

97
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.170
and that's the default setting.

98
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.450
So if you don't mention it,

99
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.600
it won't update them.

100
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.800
If you do want it to update them,

101
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.200
you must add update links.

102
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.210
Colon equals three,

103
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.960
so zero does not update three does notify.

104
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.170
Now,

105
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.470
this is when you have perhaps a file and shared directory and someone else is in the file.

106
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.790
So it is a lock.

107
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.850
If you set this to notify True,

108
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.620
your file was still open,

109
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.510
but it will open as read only and then assumes the other person has come out of the file.

110
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.360
You'll get a notification that sayings no available to read.

111
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.840
Right?

112
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.930
Andi notify.

113
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.710
False is obviously it does not show the above I can't spell.

114
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.950
I've just noticed there.

115
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.310
That should say doesn't know on t m are you?

116
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.450
That's an interesting one.

117
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.250
M are you is the most recently used list.

118
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.050
So you know,

119
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.250
when you go to X when you open X element says these are all the files you've recently

120
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.790
opened.

121
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.410
That is the M Are you the most recently used list?

122
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.020
If you set that to true,

123
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.460
which is its default value,

124
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.650
the file you just opened will appear in that list.

125
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.250
But if you don't want it to appear in that list,

126
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.670
set it to false Okay,

127
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.420
so let's get down to this bottom one just here.

128
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.450
So I'm just gonna run now,

129
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.670
and I'm gonna hit their fate.

130
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.560
So what we're going to do is say,

131
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.630
application,

132
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.220
get open file name,

133
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.290
and that is how you access the open file dialog box on.

134
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.260
What we're going to do is whatever we click,

135
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.150
we're going to read into the variable called My file.

136
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.350
So when they hit f eight,

137
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.690
this comes up.

138
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.260
So if I never get to.

139
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.160
Let's have a look.

140
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.980
Desktop on Book one.

141
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.750
I can double click Book one that or click Book one and say open.

142
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.390
Hello.

143
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.150
I have a very slow computer.

144
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.090
I have no idea what was going on without them,

145
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.400
but never hover over my file.

146
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.440
You can see that we now have the full path on the file.

147
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.370
Name of the file.

148
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.610
I just clicks on,

149
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.740
then,

150
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.990
obviously using that path.

151
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.580
Age issues workbooks open.

152
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.780
Boom on.

153
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.650
There you go.

154
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.190
On.

155
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.550
That is how you open another workbook,

156
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.650
programmatically.

157
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.480
Okay,

158
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.410
I'll see you in the legs like we would have a look at how you close workbooks.

159
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.330
Programmatically.

160
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.250
I'll see you That.
