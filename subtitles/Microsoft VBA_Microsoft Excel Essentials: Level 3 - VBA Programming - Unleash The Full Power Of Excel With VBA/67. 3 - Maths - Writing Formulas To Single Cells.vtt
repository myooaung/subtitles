00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.930
Okay,

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.340
guys.

3
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.640
And welcome back now,

4
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.280
this somewhat we're gonna have a look at is recording a macro to give us the way to write a

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.930
formula.

6
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.110
So in this for me,

7
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.490
I'm just gonna put years from retirement equals And it is going to be 65 minus,

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.890
whatever their age is.

9
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.050
Now,

10
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.750
let's site.

11
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.330
So I'm just gonna hit enter near the simplest way to do this.

12
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.990
If you just have one calculation to do,

13
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.800
right,

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.370
the formula in excel recorder macro doesn't matter what you call it.

15
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.230
Be in the cell with formula hit F two to edit the formula and press enter,

16
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.460
then stop recording.

17
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.750
And then we're gonna was over to here.

18
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.860
That should be in There they go.

19
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.190
So here it is.

20
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.770
Active soldat formula.

21
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.300
I want to see one equal 65 equal quotes equal 65 minus R C.

22
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150
Square brackets minus four.

23
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.760
Close square brackets,

24
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.890
close quotes.

25
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.950
Which is the code that I have in here,

26
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.110
which is incredibly confusing if you don't know what you're looking at,

27
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.510
what?

28
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.650
We're going to go through the step by step,

29
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.470
so I'm just gonna delete this in between execute in these lines of code.

30
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.340
So f eight that is our recorded macro.

31
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.820
So it is 65 minus G two on it is written as 65 minus R C square brackets minus one.

32
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.300
Square brackets close.

33
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.960
Okay,

34
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.680
But we have another option.

35
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.140
We could use the active cell dot Formula on that will say equals and literally it will say

36
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
exactly what it say's up here in Excel,

37
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.450
which makes it an awful lot easier to understand.

38
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.670
So I'm just gonna press f eight and move through that.

39
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.800
I'm just gonna delete this order here for a second.

40
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.950
We are on the active cell boom F eight.

41
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.800
There we go.

42
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.510
So you can see it's written g 65 minus due to which exactly what we wanted to do.

43
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.900
But here's the problem with doing that.

44
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.730
And this is only true for single cells.

45
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.060
As far as I can tell,

46
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.420
you'll notice that we use in the active cell dot formula.

47
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.150
If I clicked in here,

48
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.690
we'll hear any of these active cells.

49
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.670
So notice No,

50
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.690
I Monroe seven.

51
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.790
I'm just gonna Romney's I was a second.

52
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.410
Brem Brem on.

53
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.690
This is a one way on f eight f eight.

54
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.060
Notice what happens here.

55
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.350
Active self formula,

56
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.900
and it's still say is 65 to G two on.

57
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.800
We no longer wanted to look at G two.

58
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.760
We wanted to look at G seven,

59
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.770
so that only works if you are on the line that you need to be on.

60
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.490
Okay,

61
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.280
Now there is a way around that on that is by filling into an entire range all at once.

62
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.900
But we're gonna come to that in the next lecture.

63
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.650
Okay,

64
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.950
So I'm just gonna hit Stop again.

65
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.500
Eso This works for populating a formula in plain old Excel Speak.

66
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.200
If you are on the correct line when you rise it Now let me in fact,

67
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.250
I'm just gonna run That was,

68
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.640
well know,

69
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.270
so we can get down to the next one Now this is active,

70
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.130
sold up formula are one C one,

71
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.990
which is the recorded version.

72
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:26.250
But what we have is equals equals 65 minus are to see seven on what that means is row two,

73
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.070
column seven.

74
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.240
So are one C one,

75
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.850
which is the style would be Row one column one,

76
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.960
which is a one.

77
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:44.780
So our two row two column seven is the equivalent of writing absolute G absolute too.

78
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.650
So if you just have our and a number and see on a number,

79
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.030
it is essentially an absolute ID sell reference.

80
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.450
So I'm just going to click.

81
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.720
I'm just gonna clear these.

82
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.130
Have some was gonna click in here that will execute that line of code eight.

83
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.350
And you can see that although it's written,

84
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.540
are to see two.

85
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.290
When we actually write the formula,

86
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.530
it's being converted to,

87
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.520
say absolute G absolute to OK,

88
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.410
so don't worry yet.

89
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.950
See easier on here that this is the most complicated method of all.

90
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.360
This is what Excel actually does.

91
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.350
When you record a macro on what this formula does again,

92
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.850
we're in our one C one mode.

93
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.640
But if there are square brackets after the are or square brackets after the see you are

94
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.930
moving relative to where you are,

95
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.080
so are active.

96
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.550
Cell is currently H two,

97
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.470
so this will say equals 65 minus are no numbers,

98
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.600
which means we're staying on exactly the same road C minus one,

99
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.550
which means we are looking one column to the left.

100
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.070
If we wanted to look to the right,

101
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.770
it would say,

102
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.120
see one moving to the left minus one.

103
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.360
So when I hit enter or when I pressed their fight,

104
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.950
you can see that that happens.

105
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.810
There we get 65 minus G two,

106
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.780
which which is exactly what this says.

107
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.200
Then the benefit of this is because it's relative and it's always gonna look one column to

108
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.960
the left.

109
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.150
We could happily Let's just stop that and ram this out.

110
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.560
We can happily book that here on F eight and you'll notice that it now says G six because

111
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.350
we're on G six because we have this relative cell reference in here.

112
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.580
Okay,

113
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.400
so far,

114
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.480
so good on.

115
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.640
Do you may be able to puzzle your way through that If if you're frightfully intelligent,

116
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.550
I'm not.

117
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.870
But imagine if we were doing a logical test.

118
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.780
I'm just gonna right quick,

119
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.250
logical test in here for a second on.

120
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.320
Then we're going to recall that and see what it looks like.

121
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.050
So I'll be back in just a second.

122
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.340
Okay,

123
00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.520
now,

124
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.230
this is just quick logical test.

125
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.440
Always gonna do we say have a look and be too.

126
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.640
If it saves male,

127
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.040
then my calculation is going to be 65 minus two to if it doesn't say 60 minus g two.

128
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.990
I'm just gonna hide that hair color again.

129
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.320
Andi at home unharmed.

130
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.710
The so I could see what I was doing.

131
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.570
Hide.

132
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.850
Okay,

133
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.450
so it's just recalled that and see what that looks like.

134
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.180
So I'm just gonna hit record macro and sad.

135
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.870
I don't care which called Hit f.

136
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.580
Took some already in the cell.

137
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.750
Enter and stop recording Macron.

138
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.470
Let's go and have a look at that code.

139
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.890
Well,

140
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.080
there you have it.

141
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.040
If if you can understand that simply when you look at it,

142
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.490
you're a better man than I right now,

143
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.210
in the next lecture,

144
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.850
we're gonna have a look at populating an entire range of data with same formula on.

145
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.750
It's much simpler than that.

146
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.620
Population it for a single formula.

147
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.140
You'll see.

148
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.050
In a few seconds.

149
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.950
I'll see you that
