1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Okay,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:02,810
guys.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,150
And welcome to this brand new section Now since the release,

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,510
of course.

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,340
A few weeks ago,

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,500
a couple of students of contacted me and said it would be really helpful if you could have

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,670
vb a create PowerPoint presentations automatically.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,100
Well,

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,390
your wish is my command.

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,250
And that is exactly what this brand new section is entirely dedicated to.

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,000
Now.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,270
PowerPoint has an awful lot of elements to it,

13
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,160
so it's slightly longer than the word section,

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,020
but it's well worth looking at.

15
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,390
Okay,

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,170
So what we have here is the northern sales report that we looked at back in the reporting

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,000
section on.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,380
What we're going to do is use this report that we've created toe automatically create a

19
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,930
PowerPoint presentation.

20
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,900
Okay,

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,210
guys.

22
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,410
And this is what the finish report looks like.

23
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,330
All the data is taken from our report that we already created.

24
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,130
You can see that we have a very nice company logo of the top rate own side and all of their

25
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,660
charts,

26
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,810
all of their titles of automatically being created.

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,650
Okay,

28
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,680
so let's crack on and have a look at exactly how we do that.

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,340
So you can know create all of your PowerPoint presentations in seconds.

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,000
