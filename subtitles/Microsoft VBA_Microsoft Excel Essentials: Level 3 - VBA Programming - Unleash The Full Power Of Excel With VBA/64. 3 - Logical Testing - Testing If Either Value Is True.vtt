00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay,

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.160
guys.

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.200
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.580
We're almost at the end of logical testing.

5
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.770
So logical Test three e logical tests.

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.690
Checking if e that I should say if that logical test checking if if either criteria are

7
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.460
true.

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.050
OK,

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.630
so we're going to step through the code because we know mostly does pick the right cheek,

10
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.560
clear the contents,

11
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.780
like,

12
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.020
be to do while the active cell does not equal blank.

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.690
So there's our do There's our loop at the end of it.

14
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.830
I'm just gonna invent that there so we can see the do loop more clearly.

15
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.100
Nay,

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.350
go that lines up nicely.

17
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.160
Okay,

18
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.300
So the logical test,

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.490
if the active cell Veldt value,

20
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.470
which if we hover over it,

21
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.460
we can see equals male or that is the operative word there or so If either of these

22
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.820
criteria are true,

23
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.970
then do this code we don't have in else because we don't need an else.

24
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.000
If it's if this is true or this issue,

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.160
do this failing that,

26
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.020
move down herself on loop again.

27
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.090
So if the active celled up value equals male,

28
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.650
all the active cell duct value equals brown.

29
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.030
So if it's a man or if they have brown hair,

30
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.300
then execute this code here.

31
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.290
Other ways just moved down the cell on Let's loop around again.

32
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.080
So let's just hit f eight.

33
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.280
So there you go.

34
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.390
This person is a man.

35
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.150
Let's just scroll over or has brown hair or both.

36
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.950
So let's just step through that on.

37
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.180
Didn't see what we guess.

38
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.770
I'm just gonna hold me finger on there.

39
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.950
There you go.

40
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.510
In fact,

41
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.770
let's just run that by pressing play.

42
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.600
Okay?

43
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.350
So if we highlight on select just men,

44
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.780
absolutely.

45
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.750
Everyone is on their selectable.

46
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.510
Oops,

47
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.460
did that backwards.

48
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.540
So I just want to select women and you can see them.

49
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.420
Not everyone has been selected,

50
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.850
but the lady with brown hair,

51
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.690
brown hair and brown hair has been selected.

52
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.810
So the statement this person is a man or has brown hair or both is most definitely true on

53
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.130
That's how you test If either of your criteria are true using the whole now,

54
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.860
obviously,

55
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.960
as with the and you can nestle so you can save the active DUP value equals male or the

56
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.360
active Celta offsets two columns across equals brown all the one further across on that

57
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.290
equals green yuk unless them as much as you want.

58
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.070
You can just keep adding them together.

59
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.850
Okay,

60
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.940
so let's have a sneak peek of what's coming up.

61
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.230
Another program in project.

62
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.120
So sub logical three f copying convert this code just here and converted to cells.

63
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.840
By the time you finish doing these programming projects,

64
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.370
you'll know cells inside and out,

65
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.320
as they say.

66
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.990
Personally,

67
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.050
I prefer to work with ranges so I can watch what's happening live in the Excel window.

68
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.220
And then when I know the code is solid,

69
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.580
I will then converted to cells.

70
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.450
Okay,

71
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.500
so in the next lecture,

72
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.700
all the last one,

73
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.260
we're going to be looking at select case now.

74
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.620
That's really powerful,

75
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.960
but it is the last lecturing logical test in,

76
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.350
so I will see you in the next lecture.
