1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,680
guys.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,360
And welcome back to another lecture.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,250
Now,

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:05,980
technically,

6
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,100
this is a student questions and selected,

7
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,830
but the solution lies in the UDF.

8
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,600
The questions from Chun Li Lu on what Charlie Lu asks is is it possible to use counts if

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,240
through on non contiguous data,

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,300
whether they're named or not really doesn't make any difference in the answer is no because

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,850
that functionality is just not built into excel out of the box.

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,680
But we can actually bypass that and create a user defined function.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,000
Given us the solution that we're looking for So there's that there's a file that

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,010
accompanies this on.

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,690
Did you can find whips?

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,120
Let me foot the Excel for look first,

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,640
getting ahead of myself on the file is called Super Can't if and super some if because

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,210
there's very little difference in the CO between counting and something.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,680
So here's the problem.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,780
So let's say we had genic on and then let us use numbers.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,940
12341 Onda.

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,010
We use that as a a date.

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,240
Eso we say data one.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm used,

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,450
uh,

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:21,450
account if equals ken's If open rackets and we say data one comma and we're looking for one

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,830
close brackets.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,130
Centre Exeter one appears twice in our named range off data one.

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,990
That's this.

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:36,080
Even if we came over here and 12311 three on,

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,030
we made this unnamed range data to on.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,350
We used data to hear and counted all the ones you can see that we get Fox.

33
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,910
We've got 1234 But this data data,

34
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,250
we're going on date two.

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,630
It's still contiguous.

36
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,880
Even though we have a gap in between actually specified the name data.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,920
Two runs from a three to see seven with me so far.

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,770
OK,

39
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,630
but what happens if we say we want this?

40
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,810
So I'm just selecting that.

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,250
Hold them control.

42
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,910
Copy all of that and call this data three hit.

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,070
Enter their lives.

44
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,190
We try and use the candidate.

45
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,850
If on change that to data three,

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,170
you'll see that we get an era.

47
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,460
So here we go.

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,020
This is how you build a you dear function for it.

49
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,150
You'll find the code here,

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,760
so just copy all of this.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,700
Come to the developer ribbon,

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,470
Go to visual Basic insert module and paste this code in here now,

53
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,920
normally,

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,220
when I'm writing you d efs.

55
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,970
The first thing I do is create a program and just test at my logic to make sure that I

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,590
could actually do what I'm trying to do.

57
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,120
And that's what this sub test does were dimension and arranges.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,670
Arranged my name range.

59
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,720
I'm gonna call it data.

60
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
I call it something else.

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,850
When I wrote this code,

62
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,050
call the data three.

63
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,220
So Data three set my range.

64
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,440
The actual code is fully remedy for this is just me playing about eh?

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,660
So what we're gonna do is we're going to get the range.

66
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,640
It's called Day 23 and we're gonna set that to my range,

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,830
which creates an excel on object with all of the cells and all of the data for those cells

68
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,270
in it.

69
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,540
And then what we're gonna do is we're just gonna iterated through each of the cells and say

70
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,900
for each this cell that with cell,

71
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,280
we're looking at at that particular time in this range data three.

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,130
Then if this cell value equals one,

73
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,680
that is,

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
we're looking for the number one.

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Their next equals X plus one so that on the first pass through the first cell,

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,980
we're looking at.

77
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,300
If X equals one that first X will be zero but will add zero plus one will become one.

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,370
And then the next time we find one again,

79
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,900
it will increase X by one.

80
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,190
And that's how that works.

81
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,820
So let me see if I can shrink that down a little bit.

82
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,170
Whips.

83
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,340
That's made it too big.

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,750
Let me see if I could move That ended the way a little bit on D show you how that works.

85
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,390
Hopefully,

86
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,330
that's still in shot.

87
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,410
What I want to do here is I'm just gonna have to stop.

88
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,570
This won't be in the code when you download it and I'm gonna add a watch.

89
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,350
Two x so x.

90
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,350
So let me just struck that down so you can see.

91
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,970
I guess I'm just gonna room that come back over here.

92
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm just gonna run that to the stop debug Run to cursor boom.

93
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,690
So there you can see the code actually works.

94
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,650
So we've got the range day 23 We set it,

95
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,100
that is,

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,710
we've created an object with all the cells in that range to the variable my range on.

97
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,260
We've looped through each of the cells in that in my range until we find a one.

98
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,750
Then we return the number 41234 and that's how that works.

99
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,470
Now there's a say that would be in the thing that you download,

100
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,800
but that's how it works.

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
So top.

102
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Let me just delete that and click stuff.

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,170
So here,

104
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,040
that's the simple code to work out how to do it.

105
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,580
And here I have butchered that and turned it into If I can make that full screen,

106
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,870
and I've turned that into this the super counted function.

107
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,770
So it's just like any of the function.

108
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,340
This is the name of the function.

109
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,310
Super can't if my name ranges variant because we have no idea what data we're gonna have

110
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:21,770
been there.

111
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,650
Look for that's what we're looking for a string on.

112
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,740
We're going to return.

113
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,080
The answer is a string as well,

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,820
so even if it's a number that we're looking for,

115
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,520
it'll actually come.

116
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,350
Backers a string so rather than the number four it will be the text for You can change that

117
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,950
if you need to.

118
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,800
So it's a you the African tive with non continuous data and be the named pain judge that

119
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,850
should say range.

120
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,280
I'll try and remember to change that in the download.

121
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,500
Must be in quotes in the formula.

122
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,070
So dim my Rangers range holds the named range dim the camp.

123
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,980
That's the iteration where we're going through and every time we find a match were

124
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,050
increasing by one.

125
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,800
So that's as long because I I honestly don't know how many bits of data there are so long.

126
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Pretty much covers everything.

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,170
So now we're gonna go create the object to hold all the cells in the range.

128
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,690
There were only actually interested in the value.

129
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,220
There are loads of properties associated with leet selling Arrange.

130
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,420
All we're trying to get to is the value so set my range equals range,

131
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,790
my named range.

132
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,950
That's what we're gonna get typed in in the formula.

133
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,980
And then we're going to do that loop just like we did up here.

134
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,620
So we're gonna loop through eat selling specified range object which we just created here,

135
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,770
and they were going to perform a logical test to see to sell value.

136
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,340
We're currently on matches our criteria.

137
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,440
Now the criteria is going to be the criterium is going to be the look for if so,

138
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,000
increased the count by one.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,970
So if this cell value each interational so we're looking at if it matches our look for

140
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,470
value than the cams equals the camera plus one.

141
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,240
So on the first pass through before we get here,

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,330
the count will be zero.

143
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,510
Once we find a match,

144
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,430
the zero will be zero plus one.

145
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,110
So the count will become one.

146
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,090
And every time we find a match that will increase by one and then finally to return the

147
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,420
value to excel we're going to say super can't if the name of our function equals the camps

148
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,640
which we've got from here,

149
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,160
so super can't If we're going to say the range on what we're looking for,

150
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,380
let's flip back to excel So if we said equals super and you can see that it's come up their

151
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,280
super can't if open brackets the named range must be in quotes.

152
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,640
My data three think it was called my data three comma we're going to be looking for Let's

153
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,280
say we're looking for the number one.

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,240
Hand it enter.

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,150
No,

156
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,060
Maybe I didn't call it my day to three.

157
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,950
What did I call it?

158
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,250
A day to three.

159
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,170
That's cool.

160
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,580
The Data three and then we're actually looking at the right thing.

161
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,590
So now we can We can see that in date of three noncontiguous.

162
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,170
1234 instances of one occur.

163
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,740
Let's just change that to a different number.

164
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,370
And there you can see the three occur All we could look at number five and see that that

165
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,510
occurs twice.

166
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:14,630
What?

167
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,630
We just talked five in there and here we could point to that itself.

168
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,050
The'keeper's thing is your data set that your named range must be in quotes.

169
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,370
So if we look to that that you said,

170
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,750
we still get the same answer now slightly differently.

171
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,940
Uh,

172
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,220
let's say Rita Onda se Rita,

173
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,960
that was with space.

174
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,050
Sue Bob,

175
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,750
Jack,

176
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,850
uh,

177
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,300
Bob,

178
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,450
they because we're looking at this south,

179
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,080
we can see that restore appears once.

180
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,770
But if we were to type it and we couldn't just say Rita because Rita doesn't particularly

181
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,480
mean anything,

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,390
so you get value.

183
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,070
So if you're actually gonna type in the value groups rather than look it another cell,

184
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,800
you must enclose the string.

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,620
That is the word that you are looking for in quotes a ***.

186
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,570
That's how it works now.

187
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,020
Very simply,

188
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,350
I've also just adapted this to say super some if which works pretty much saying like no,

189
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,780
no ranges where intercourse.

190
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,890
We don't know what date we're gonna have on what we are looking for.

191
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,310
And all I've done is I have modified this line of Cose earthy sell,

192
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,500
value equals Look for then the sum equals the song plus this cell value.

193
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,950
So let me just demonstrate that.

194
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:45,150
So if we said 1111 seven So the summer veil accidents for the one in there,

195
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:57,350
the sum of our ones should be 123456 So if we said equals super some if open rackets data,

196
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,440
lips,

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,870
data three comma one.

198
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,610
We should get the answer of far 6123456 That's right,

199
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,110
They go.

200
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,480
So that's how it works for a summit as well.

201
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,350
Okay,

202
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,650
and that's all there is to it.

203
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,290
Hopefully,

204
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,000
that's helpful.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,370
If you have any questions yourself,

206
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,180
do let me know.

207
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Have a great deck and I'll see you in the next,

208
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,650
like Jack
