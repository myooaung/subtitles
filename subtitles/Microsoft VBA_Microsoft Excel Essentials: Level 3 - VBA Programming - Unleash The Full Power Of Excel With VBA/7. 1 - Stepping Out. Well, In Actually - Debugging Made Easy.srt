1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Okay,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,810
guys,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,290
welcome back now.

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:12,820
We already have two pieces of code inside this XLs M workbook called Sales Data on.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,870
What we're going to do now is execute the code a single line at a time so we can see

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,190
exactly what it's doing.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,420
Now what I'm gonna do to do this,

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,150
I'm just gonna hit F 11 to open the V b e the visual basic editor.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,130
Andi,

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,460
what I'm gonna do temporarily is just close the V b a project,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,050
and I'm gonna close the properties on.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,210
That way you can see the code in the whole window.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:40,620
Now,

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,150
don't worry.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,920
If your view is like Max,

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,300
it's easy to get the Mac.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,630
You just go to view and you choose projects Explorer on boom your projects.

18
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,600
Explorer comes back on view properties window on your properties window comes back,

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
although you may have to resize it a little bit.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,570
So I'm just going to close those two just so we can see the code here.

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,870
And then what I'm gonna do is strength this over here.

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,520
That should be perfectly fine on.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,470
I'm gonna drag this over to here so hopefully you can see both windows side by side.

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,420
Okay?

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,700
No,

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,760
What we're gonna do is we're going to step into the code now.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,450
At the moment,

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,720
we can see that this isn't highlighted.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,570
So the appropriate code to execute is this one,

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,340
which is the highlight.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,750
My formulas.

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,180
I'm just gonna delete these remarks here just to bring the code up a little bit.

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,570
Okay,

34
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:44,650
so now what we're gonna do is step through this and you can see at the top you have a debug

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,250
option.

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,160
And if you left click on debug,

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,630
you can see that you get the option to step into,

38
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,300
which is F eight.

39
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,810
So woman do is click into the code,

40
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,840
and I'm gonna press F eight on the keyboard and you can see because I was in this

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,830
subroutine.

42
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,240
It knows this is a subroutine we want to step into.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:13,260
So highlighted Number one is sub highlight my formulas when I pressed F eight again,

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,780
I want to come down to this line of code now because it's highlighted.

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,920
That means that is going to be the next section of code that will be executed.

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
So when they say fate,

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,850
it's gonna move from here.

48
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,240
This line is going to be highlighted,

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,630
and that line will have executed.

50
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,890
So just have a look at what happens in the worksheet.

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,610
As we press f eight,

52
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,140
they go.

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:45,450
You can see that this particular line here has managed to highlight all of those formulas

54
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,250
that resulted in a number.

55
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,480
Now,

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,750
if you remember the 15 golden rules of coding,

57
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,350
it says number 72 realm extensively on.

58
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,040
Now we have learned what this particular line of code does want to do is his end.

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,550
Tabin.

60
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,690
I'm gonna hit an apostrophe on.

61
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,470
I'm just gonna make a little note of what that does.

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,350
So this code,

63
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,750
uh,

64
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,610
select oh,

65
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,380
form you laugh cells resulting in,

66
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,290
I value.

67
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,770
So there you go.

68
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,620
Whenever I come back to this code,

69
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,540
if it's a year or two from now,

70
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm not gonna look at this particular line and say,

71
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,710
Wow,

72
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,340
I wonder what that does because I know have a little ram,

73
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,180
a comment,

74
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,470
a note that tells me exactly what that line of code does.

75
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,740
So this code selects all formula cells,

76
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,130
resulting in a value,

77
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,700
and that is what matters.

78
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay,

79
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,810
so,

80
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,180
no,

81
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,440
let's pay attention to what's going on over here.

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,700
in the Excel file.

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,950
So we have with selection dot interior.

84
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,590
I'm just going to hit F eight.

85
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,610
Nothing.

86
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,450
A parent has happened there.

87
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm gonna hit F eight again,

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,450
which is gonna execute dot pattern that equals X l solid.

89
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,230
Okay,

90
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,020
so that looked like it made a slight change.

91
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,580
I'm gonna hit pattern color index equals X l automatic by pressing f eight.

92
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,750
That doesn't look like it.

93
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,450
Did anything color?

94
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:25,950
No.

95
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,540
My guess is this is going to make a difference.

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:35,770
So color equals 65535 which will be the code number for that particular shade of yellow.

97
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,130
So when I hit F eight Boom,

98
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,880
everything has gone to yellow.

99
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,030
Tinton Shady call zero.

100
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm just gonna here to f eight.

101
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,850
That didn't make any difference on dot pattern Tinton Shady Call zero.

102
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,210
And guess,

103
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,520
And that's the default value.

104
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,890
I'm just gonna hit at night.

105
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,370
Step through it,

106
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,070
Andi,

107
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,850
end with Andi.

108
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,310
That finishes all of those,

109
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,240
Okay?

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,970
And then the final instruction is range.

111
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,720
Open brackets quote.

112
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,910
0 16 Close quote.

113
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,160
Close rackets dot Select.

114
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
So let's have a look.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,750
What that does on that moves a stand to sell.

116
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,590
0 16 so I'm gonna insert a new line next.

117
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,940
We've just learned something else.

118
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,640
Select.

119
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,050
Ah.

120
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,850
So named in quote.

121
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,110
So they go next time I look at this code,

122
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm not gonna have to wonder what that particular line does because I now have a comment

123
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,450
that tells me exactly that.

124
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,420
Okay,

125
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,700
now,

126
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,820
in the next lecture,

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,930
we're gonna have a look.

128
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,600
At what?

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
This with and end with process Tres.

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,950
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
