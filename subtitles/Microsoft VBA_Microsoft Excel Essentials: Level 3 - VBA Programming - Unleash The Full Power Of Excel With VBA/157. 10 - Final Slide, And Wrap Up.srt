1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,820
guys,

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,970
let's wrap this up.

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,980
There would have done.

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,550
I've realized that I was using this ad logo routine here,

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,940
this particular section of code in each of the slides.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,330
Now,

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:12,630
obviously,

9
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,890
if you want to change the logo,

10
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,970
you've then got to go in and change the particular line of code in every one of these

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,840
subroutine slide ones like these,

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,370
like three.

13
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,800
So what I've done is I've just moved it to its own sobriety,

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,240
and I've placed a call to it in each of these.

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,910
So in slight for we have an ad logo calling slight three Slater and slide one.

16
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,700
So that way,

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,510
if we ever do need to modify our logo or we need to do is change this particular subroutine

18
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,510
.

19
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,150
OK,

20
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,980
so the last side we want a mad is the thank you and any questions,

21
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,520
which is how all good presentations and so we're gonna do is I'm just gonna choose slide

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,150
number one.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,790
I'm copying the code from there.

24
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,980
I'm gonna wears way back up to it up to say it doesn't particularly matter where you have

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,160
these because the run order is determined above on.

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,080
We are now on slide five.

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,720
So slide in next.

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,890
Number five on We want to do way,

29
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,130
actually want to delete that?

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,140
Don't make eso sledge shapes to I think it was Was it just delete?

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,370
We'll find out when we run it because we don't want the subtitle on We don't It's a range A

32
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,620
one.

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,430
What we wanted to say is,

34
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:32,420
thank you in probably in capitals and from from pump and close coats on and vb New Line.

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,690
Andi,

36
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,000
Any questions?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,410
Andi,

38
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,360
There you go.

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,290
So hopefully that is going to give us our finished presentation.

40
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,890
So that's just hit.

41
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,090
Play president Taste with prison taters.

42
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,140
Name presents his name on Jarvis.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,460
Andi There you go.

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,120
There is are fully automated Power point presentation slide one slight to slight three.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,530
Slide for Andi.

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,170
Thank you.

47
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,510
And any questions?

48
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,860
OK,

49
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,350
guys,

50
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,030
that's it.

51
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,350
That's how you create a presentation automatically using VB A enjoy
