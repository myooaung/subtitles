00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Okay,

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:02.650
guys.

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.790
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.630
Never gonna have a look at this ad Common tree code,

5
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.290
which we can see is really,

6
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.960
really,

7
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.870
really quite considerable.

8
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.870
But essentially,

9
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.390
if we look at what we've actually done,

10
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.580
if we ignore the format in aspects,

11
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.050
what we'll actually done is we written text to sell a one text a three,

12
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.610
a four and a five.

13
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.710
So the first thing I'm gonna do it's split this out into its component parts.

14
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.350
So we have a range of one dot Select on with the active cells formula formula.

15
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.440
I want to see you want on,

16
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.660
right?

17
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.330
The text.

18
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.950
That cell A one.

19
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.420
I think we sorted the formatting.

20
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.850
I'm not out a little bit later.

21
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.330
Then we had sell a three here,

22
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.290
sell a full on somewhere down here,

23
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.890
we'll have range a five.

24
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.540
OK,

25
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.100
so far,

26
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.610
so good.

27
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.370
So let's have a look at range one.

28
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.820
First on.

29
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.060
What we're gonna do is we're gonna build the concussion ated strings to populate the data,

30
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.290
and then we'll come back and have a look at how we apply the format in in a little while.

31
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.910
Okay,

32
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.740
So the first thing that we can see here is that we have range 81 Select on with the active

33
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.210
cell doctor formula are one C one.

34
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.590
We know this isn't a formula.

35
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.660
It's just a value.

36
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.420
So we can get rid of all of that and just replace it with the word value.

37
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.400
Because what we want to do is say range a ones value property is going to say month match

38
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.080
the same monthly report,

39
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.450
shouldn't it?

40
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.280
Monthly report for month year North ERN region and you'll remember the things in upper case

41
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.600
are the things that we need to read at Runtime.

42
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.390
So it's completely dynamic.

43
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.430
Now we have three elements here.

44
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.190
We have the month,

45
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.980
we have the year and we have north on.

46
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.540
What we need to do is set up three local variables and they're going to be local because

47
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.800
we're not going to use them anywhere other than this in this ad commentary section.

48
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.990
So it's gonna portia second,

49
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.250
declare the variables.

50
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.020
Okay,

51
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.510
there we go.

52
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.990
So we now have my month,

53
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.600
our string,

54
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.970
which you're gonna hold the name of the month,

55
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.100
my year on my region.

56
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.300
Now you'll remember that all of this data is contained in our source sheet.

57
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.170
So what we're gonna do for now is we're going to steal that line of code from our day to

58
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.780
capture rooting up here that says my source sheet equals the active sheet dot name.

59
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.770
So I'm just gonna come back down here.

60
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.550
Where are we?

61
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.720
Here we go.

62
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.500
I'm just gonna put that there will delete it little weight.

63
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.890
And when we had this to the run order,

64
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.460
But for now,

65
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.950
we need to capture the name off the source sheet.

66
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.100
And they're what we need to do is build lines of code to populate my month,

67
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.940
my year on my region.

68
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.450
So the first thing we're gonna do is say my month equals and there's a man that's in lower

69
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.320
case because declared it here or capitalize automatically on what we're going to say is

70
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.170
sheets because this is the hierarchy.

71
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.750
Remember,

72
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.870
we have to specify which sheet toe look at before we have.

73
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.220
We specify which range to look at.

74
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220
So this is going to be my source sheet.

75
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.790
Adults range open brackets open quotes on.

76
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.170
We can see that that lives at B three.

77
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.050
So we're gonna say be three close quotes close that dot value.

78
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.130
And we may as well do this for the others as well,

79
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.750
while we're here.

80
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.590
So my month equals that my year equals that on my region equals that.

81
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.000
Okay,

82
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.010
so let's just step through that code and see what it say So bomb,

83
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.210
bomb,

84
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.370
bomb,

85
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.560
bomb,

86
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.840
bomb.

87
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.820
So my month equals no.

88
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.160
One No.

89
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.420
1 2016 which is precisely what it say's here.

90
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.150
Know exactly what we're looking at.

91
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.250
My year will be exactly the same in my region.

92
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.570
It's just looking at the wrong sell.

93
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.170
What we actually want to do is pick the first cell or any of these cells where we have the

94
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.170
region specifies.

95
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.800
That's actually going to be C seven in this instance.

96
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.050
Soc seventh.

97
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.300
So it's stop stepped through and let's have a look at that rumble bump.

98
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.820
So my region north fantastic.

99
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.950
We have the region sorted There will go through these in reverse order because there is a V

100
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.100
be a function called year.

101
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.390
So before the sheets expression where we tell it where to look on my year,

102
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.800
we're going to just add the word year and you can see the argument it's looking for is a

103
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.410
date.

104
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.880
Now the date lives in sheets.

105
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.150
My source sheet range B three don't value.

106
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.210
That is our argument.

107
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.650
So I'm just going to stop.

108
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.580
No,

109
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.950
I go all the way through that and you can see that.

110
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.680
Now we have year 2000 and 16 on the region is north.

111
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.950
So we have two out of three completed now a slight complication with mine month.

112
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.390
What we need to do is call the worksheet function text on,

113
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.530
then specify that we want it returned as a month in its long form.

114
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.220
So because of the hierarchy,

115
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.750
what we're gonna have to say is application hopefully of type that right does work sheets

116
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.650
function,

117
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.950
Dr Text,

118
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.830
open brackets.

119
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.390
And now we're into the arguments were going to do that for Southee arguments hit space on

120
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.720
one score and hit end Zach Tabin and then we can see that.

121
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.080
So here is our arguments on what we need to do at the end is hit the comma,

122
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.900
hit the quotes four EMS,

123
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.050
and that should return that in long form.

124
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.550
So it should say January.

125
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.940
So let's just step through that bump,

126
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.160
bump,

127
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.330
bump,

128
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.550
bump,

129
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.840
bump.

130
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.880
So most know saves January.

131
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.660
My essays 2016 in my region saves north.

132
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.980
So they are all of our variables captured?

133
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.480
No.

134
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.790
What we need to do is build those into a string.

135
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.050
I'm just gonna tempt those in.

136
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.350
So we know that's part of the code,

137
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.290
this one we're going to delete later.

138
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.940
So just come out and say still eat later because we're already gonna capture the source

139
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.500
sheet name in the data capture.

140
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.170
So there,

141
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.760
we need to build this into its component parts.

142
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.020
So what I'm gonna do It's a month report for Andi Space and I'm gonna hit quotes on Gonna

143
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.680
hit on D l I'm gonna hit space now here.

144
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:17.540
I'm gonna say my months and I want to space Between the my month and the my year So quotes

145
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.540
,

146
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:25.430
space quotes on and on And even I'm gonna delete that on I'm gonna hit an underscore and

147
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:33.200
hit Enter I know it will And here we have my year on Between my year on the word Northern

148
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.620
What I want is another space on the same island Quotes space quote Onda And here we go my

149
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.630
region and I can delete the word north Andi and I don't want to space here.

150
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.620
Abella print Andi on those style.

151
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.720
I don't want to.

152
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.450
Space X.

153
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.500
I want the urn attacked immediately onto the my region on.

154
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.350
That should just about do us now because we're in the sore.

155
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.420
She What we're gonna need to do is run this part of the code and select new sheet before we

156
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.290
get to hear.

157
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.280
So let's just step through that code.

158
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.250
Bom bom bom bom bom.

159
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.790
We can see we have my month.

160
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.690
You can see we have my year and we can see we have my region now so it doesn't pace across

161
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.170
this one.

162
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.650
I'm going to select a new sheet and hit that.

163
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.080
So let's just hit F eight so month report for January 2016 Northern region.

164
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.050
Fantastic.

165
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.690
Okay.

166
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.410
I'll see you in the next lecture where we'll have a look at the rest of them.

167
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.880
I'll see you.

168
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.250
That
