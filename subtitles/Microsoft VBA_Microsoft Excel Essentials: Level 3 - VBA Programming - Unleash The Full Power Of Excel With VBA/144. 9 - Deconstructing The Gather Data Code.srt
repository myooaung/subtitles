1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,390
Okay,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:02,780
guys,

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,260
from welcome back there.

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,010
One of done is I've taken this base code here that we looked at in the last lecture on.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,530
I've created an almost exact copy of it here,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,290
and I've renamed it to letter To whom?

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,940
Ever on.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,450
We'll be calling that at the end of our subroutine in the gathers of data.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,870
And the only of the change I've made is here for the text.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,220
I'm using the variable body text which we're gonna build above live at run time Now,

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,600
going from the beginning,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,090
we have option explicit because we want to force variable declaration near the body text

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,190
that we're gonna pass to the subroutine to actually open word,

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,430
create a new documents and write the text needs to be passed from the build the data

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,280
subroutine to the letter to whomever subroutine.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,830
So that is declared up here at module level.

17
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,510
The other variables are built at local level within the subroutine.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,450
Build the data.

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,980
OK,

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,450
so this is gonna be split over into a couple of lectures because we've got some really

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,960
interesting code in here,

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,420
and it's worth exploring it in detail to make sure that you understand how it actually

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,970
works.

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,680
So very straightforward.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,280
To begin with,

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,130
we have shipped my date at night.

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,420
If I move this out the way raw days at this sheet,

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,070
just here,

29
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,340
with all of our data in its is called shirt.

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,720
My data so sure,

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,540
my data select.

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:26,990
Now,

33
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,020
this is the first really interest in peace of code here.

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,910
What we have is shit.

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:40,330
My data on what is going to do is read the range from B one to B one end,

36
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,160
excel down.

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,960
So ALS the data set in column B down to the last entry.

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,680
That is the range it is working on.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:57,910
Then we're gonna use on advanced filter with an action filter copy copy to Range K one on.

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,550
We only wanted to paste unique values,

41
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,370
so I'm just going to step through that coat on.

42
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,910
Jackson put K one into view so you can actually see what that does.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,240
So there's K one.

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,400
Let's come back to the code.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,350
I'm just quips.

46
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,370
Let's try that again,

47
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:13,650
Ella.

48
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,710
Let's hit f eight and scroll them eighth all the way through and have a look.

49
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:25,580
What happens when this code executes all of the unique entries have Bean returned to K one

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,580
,

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,900
including the Heather sales person.

52
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,540
I'm not particularly worried about that because we're gonna have a clever way of dealing

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,980
with that when we actually write the formulas in.

54
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,560
Now,

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,800
here we have a slightly bush ad version of how to write a formula to a bunch of cells lap

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,320
once.

57
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,480
But there is a quirk when you use this function here,

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,780
this filter copy and pasting unique ranges.

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,620
So we're gonna have a look at that in the next lecture when they show you how I built this

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,590
code here.

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,320
Okay,

62
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,950
I'll see you in the next lecture.
