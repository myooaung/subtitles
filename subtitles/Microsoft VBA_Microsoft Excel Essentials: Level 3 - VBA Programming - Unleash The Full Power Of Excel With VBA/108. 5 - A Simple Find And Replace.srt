1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650
Okay,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,050
guys.

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,040
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,130
And so we can do our chart.

5
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,980
What we now going to do is have a look at the whole of color me where this feels like.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,300
So this is a temperature,

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,210
and this is what the temperature feels like.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,320
What I need to remove is this space on the degrees centigrade.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,580
So I'm just gonna copy that there partly because I have absolutely no idea how to do that

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,610
degree symbol.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,800
And I'm just gonna record a simple macro,

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,510
which we're gonna butcher in a second.

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,920
And I'm gonna slight all of column me.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,850
I'm gonna hit,

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,140
find I'm going to pace the Degree centigrade thing in that I just copied from here number

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,810
to replace it with nothing.

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,400
And I am going to replace all okay and close on stop.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,460
And that is the code that we're looking for.

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,150
So here,

20
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,780
that's obviously going to No,

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,470
here it is way down the bottom on the world Got such a great big gap there.

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:55,900
There we go.

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,570
So this is a code that we've got.

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,150
We have columns e dot Select on with that selection so we can get rid of that.

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:11,810
So what we want to say is columns e replace the degree centigrade with absolutely nothing

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,020
on that is gonna tidy up our code.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,920
So after we finished doing the while wend loop,

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,050
that is the last thing I want to do.

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,910
That woman do is tidy up this code,

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,110
but will bump on and tab everything in.

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,100
And I'll fully round this for when you download it.

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,330
And it's gonna look very,

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,320
very pretty indeed.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,440
But for now,

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,190
what I'm gonna do,

36
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,400
it's just pause for a second and I'm gonna check that that code works from the very

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,920
beginning.

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,570
Now I'm gonna hit,

39
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,470
play on,

40
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,570
I'm gonna pause,

41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,350
and then I'll be back to you in just a second.

42
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,480
Okay,

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,870
guys,

44
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,500
welcome back.

45
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,940
So that code has run through from beginning to end.

46
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,590
We now have a perfectly tabulated table on.

47
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,640
We have now remove that annoying degree centigrade from column E,

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
which is no gun.

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,490
Allow our child to work.

50
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,330
Okay,

51
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,080
I'll see you in the next lecture,

52
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,580
where we're gonna look at populating the formulas in the front sheet.

53
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,050
Okay,

54
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,570
I'll see you.

55
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:04,950
That
