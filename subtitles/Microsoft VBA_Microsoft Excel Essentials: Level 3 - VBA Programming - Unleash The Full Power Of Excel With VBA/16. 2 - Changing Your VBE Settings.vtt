00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
Okay,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.740
guys,

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.850
um,

4
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.000
welcome back now,

5
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.960
before we progress,

6
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.860
when I want to do is make sure that your settings in your visual basic editor are exactly

7
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.400
the same of the settings I have in mind.

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.290
So with your visual basic in view come up to tools on from tools,

9
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.480
I want you to come down to options and just left Click and you will get this window appear

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.050
here.

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.610
Now,

12
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.550
in the term called editor,

13
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.740
make sure that your tick boxes are precisely the same as this.

14
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.140
Don't worry about this variable declaration.

15
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.650
We'll cope with that in a later lecture when we look at variables.

16
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.200
But trust me for now,

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.250
with the code that you've just imported that is going to cause you more headaches than you

18
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.050
would believe.

19
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.600
So just leave that one.

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.670
UnTech orto list members is an absolute must have,

21
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.390
as is auto quick info.

22
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.850
So just make sure that all of your tick boxes much this precisely.

23
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.550
Okay,

24
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.700
Now,

25
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.270
the next thing we're gonna have a look at is the editor format.

26
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.070
And here you can change the way that VB E displays its code,

27
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.380
so I'm gonna leave it exactly as it is.

28
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.700
but have a play around with this.

29
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.820
So if we chose normal text here,

30
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.380
we could say size 14 for example,

31
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.350
make it OK,

32
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.320
and you can see that all the code becomes an awful lot bigger.

33
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.850
Now,

34
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.940
I'm just going to scroll down that,

35
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.360
actually,

36
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.750
because if all of the code that I've written fits within that view,

37
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.260
I am probably going to leave it like,

38
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.600
yeah,

39
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.980
perhaps it's a little bit too big.

40
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.240
I'm gonna go tills Options editor for matter may set it to 12 though,

41
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.650
just so it's gonna be a little bit easier for you to read on the screen.

42
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.610
Okay?

43
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.910
Yeah,

44
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.290
Okay.

45
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.010
We'll work with that.

46
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.960
On the other options that you have in here.

47
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.510
Tools,

48
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.200
options,

49
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.340
eliecer format.

50
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.440
You could see that there are different types of text which we looked up briefly in the last

51
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.510
section on.

52
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.210
You can change the colors or the size or or kinds of different things.

53
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.050
So have a play around with this on Get it to something that you're happy with.

54
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.460
Let's have a look.

55
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.840
If so,

56
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.670
come in text,

57
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.640
which is the ram you can see currently it's green.

58
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.710
So if I went in here and click red and clicked.

59
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.250
Okay,

60
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.870
All of my rimmed text goes red.

61
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.690
Okay,

62
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.900
I'm just gonna undo that.

63
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.950
So it's going tills options at its on.

64
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.880
I'm gonna say comment,

65
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.200
text.

66
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.790
I'm gonna put it back to the green That it waas Okay.

67
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.560
Okay.

68
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.790
So have a play around that until you get the settings.

69
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.540
Just as you like them on.

70
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.180
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at a really important thing

71
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.180
.

72
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.120
So when she have written your masterpiece of coding,

73
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.380
no one can go in and play with it.

74
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.920
Okay,

75
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.350
I'll see you in the next lecture.
