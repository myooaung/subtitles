1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,970
guys.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,950
And welcome back,

4
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,510
right?

5
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:11,060
I've had in another private subroutine called redo formulas on have added redo formulas

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:21,550
will add redo formulas unless to our room order up here on Ive Also added notes as to what

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,160
each of these calls does.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,100
I'll do that for this one in just a second.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,830
Now,

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,970
one of the first things that we need to do because we're going to write the formulas.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,370
Or rather,

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,880
we're gonna call the macro from she warm here.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,940
We need to specify in Rome the first data that we call.

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,960
We're gonna have to specify that we should be on this sheet here.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,680
Now,

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,790
if I go Teoh View Projects Explorer,

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,460
you will see that the data sheet is called shirt data.

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,070
So long and do here is on a line of code.

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,660
Say,

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,320
select the right sheet and I'm gonna add shit.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,350
Data don't select,

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,550
and they go on their woman do.

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,190
That's going to ensure that we're on the right day to sheet when we capture all the data on

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,650
a copy that come way down here to our new sub.

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,000
And I'm gonna pace that in here,

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,880
but it's not sure Data we want to select its the front sheet,

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
which is called shirt main.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,850
So that sounds like a Michael Jackson song.

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,550
Charmaine.

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,440
So they d show Maine.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,780
We are now on the right,

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,140
chief.

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,900
So let's actually go to the right sheet and you can see that everything in here has

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,490
reference on the chart is completely screw if because all of the data is wrong in here,

35
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,540
so I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna record a simple macro,

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,410
and I'm gonna reference each of the cells that we want and then leave it a macro three

37
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,640
diesel.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,150
The one and do is still the co fruit from it.

39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:01,450
So the first thing I want to do is say equals Flip back to here and say that I'm gonna hit

40
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,170
enter,

41
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,360
and here I'm gonna say whether equals no,

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,780
Remember among Rome,

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,160
which is the first day to set,

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,670
we call.

45
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,020
So everything from 18 down to this 18.

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,620
So the weather in Rome is morning clouds.

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,100
So that's that one done here.

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,330
I'm going to say equals and I am looking for the temperature and that's here.

49
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,530
Enter and here I'm going to say equals on it feels like,

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,480
and I'm still in this first black a code,

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,010
and it feels like 30 that's going to allow us to use our charts here.

52
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,090
I'm going to say equals now.

53
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,540
This time I'm into our second block of CO.

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:47,160
So I need to come pass this 1st 18 down to the next 18 because this is Cancun and I'm gonna

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,970
hit enter.

56
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,390
So no,

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,810
I'm looking at that Particular cell temperature equals and I'm gonna come down to hear

58
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,420
their until next 18.

59
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,720
That's the temperature for Cancun on the fails like equals.

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,880
And I'm going to come back to here on We're on our 2nd 18 and it feels like 36 lucky people

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,770
in Cancun.

62
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,710
And now we're into London.

63
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,290
So medically,

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:10,780
here,

65
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,320
I'm going to say equals.

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,150
I want to come down past that 18 to our very last 18 our third day to set.

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,470
And I'm going to say more someone clouds because that is the first data from London here

68
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,490
I'm going to say equals flip back on day 18.

69
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,900
That's the temperature.

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,170
Enter and finally I'm going to say equals and it feels like in London on the 18th feels

71
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,120
like 25 not bad day for London.

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,010
It'll so far so good.

73
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,570
Norman,

74
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,520
do come back,

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,450
select everything all the way across,

76
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,360
and I'm just gonna double click.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,690
And that's all about data populated.

78
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,230
Okay,

79
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
