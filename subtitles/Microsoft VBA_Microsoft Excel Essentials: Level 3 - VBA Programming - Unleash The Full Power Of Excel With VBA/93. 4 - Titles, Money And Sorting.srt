1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Okay,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,670
guys.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,610
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,210
And now what we're gonna do is we're gonna make three changes and we'll look and modifying

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:08,670
that code,

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,770
incorporating it into our exist in subroutine.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,730
Normally,

8
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,480
we only do one thing per lecture,

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,820
but these are fairly straightforward.

10
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
So we're going to do all three all in one.

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,190
Go.

12
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,880
So what we're gonna do first is we're gonna record three.

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,950
Individual macro is the 1st 1 to change the road label on a hit record.

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,600
New macro.

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,430
I'm just gonna call it,

16
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,790
label it enter.

17
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,490
I'm gonna choose this cell,

18
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,790
but in the formula.

19
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,670
Bar it up.

20
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm gonna type sales person and hit.

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,630
Enter.

22
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,040
That's our first macro that changes the road ahead a second,

23
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,600
macro,

24
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,960
I'm going to call it money on.

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,100
We're going to convert this to currency.

26
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,270
So woman do Here,

27
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,740
it's select this cell control shift and down that's going to select all of them.

28
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,580
I'm just gonna hit the currency button.

29
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,300
My default currencies pounds,

30
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,330
whatever yours is is perfectly fine.

31
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,430
I'm just going to click off and I'm gonna hit stop and then record our third macro and this

32
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,530
one is going to going to be called sought me.

33
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,120
What we're gonna do is select the very first value here.

34
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,460
Right click.

35
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,200
We're going to choose,

36
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,440
sort and sort largest to smallest now,

37
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,580
although it's not apparent at the moment that is really gonna help us a little later on

38
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,520
when we come to do the common tree,

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,210
you know,

40
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,390
I'm just gonna hit Stop,

41
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,980
Let's go and have a look at the code that's been generated all the module to.

42
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,370
So here's our label.

43
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,720
We have range A 23 select.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,070
But we can see here that the anti she pivot tables is already selected and it already knows

45
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,910
where the compact row header is.

46
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,250
So that is the only line of code that we need to change the header.

47
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,250
So I was gonna pace that in that I'm gonna say changes the header.

48
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,160
Okay,

49
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,670
so far,

50
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,080
so good.

51
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
Let's hit space a few times.

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,360
So we got some more room.

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,180
Eso that's this one.

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,720
Dealt with them,

55
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,360
just can delete,

56
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,630
actually don't want it anymore.

57
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:06,730
They were onto money range B 24 rain selection selection and their own currency style with

58
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,520
the selection.

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,750
See,

60
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,700
26 Astra's where I clicked off.

61
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,490
So this is our money.

62
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,020
So copy into here,

63
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:24,580
paste it into this one on Dhere changes to currency here we can see that we have B 24

64
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,240
selects.

65
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,220
Then I did the control shift and down,

66
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,210
which then said with that selection,

67
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,990
do the Excel down thing.

68
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,970
So that way it's completely dynamic.

69
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,670
But we already know that we can eliminate this line of code by specifying that as the

70
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,410
selection.

71
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,850
So I'm just gonna replace the word selection with both of those.

72
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,080
So we can never really be 24 because it's incorporated in this line of code.

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,410
And here we have a select and then with the selection dot style,

74
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,910
so we don't need to have selected selection.

75
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,620
We can immediately just say dot style equals currency on.

76
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,850
That's our current seat line of code.

77
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,220
So that's done the head on,

78
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,230
lest on the current say,

79
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,120
what was the final one?

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,540
The sort Gillete Next.

81
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,540
We don't want it anymore,

82
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,510
right?

83
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,230
Here's a sort.

84
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,360
And again we have this b 24 but because it specified in the active sheep pivot tables,

85
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,620
it already knows where to look.

86
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,530
So what we're gonna do is just copy that and quick in here and paste it in here.

87
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,130
And this performs a sort,

88
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,090
so performs a swart Right now.

89
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,580
There's a peculiarity with this.

90
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,650
Inasmuch as we don't need anything after some of profits.

91
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,130
Now that's one of those things that you either know or you won't know.

92
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,750
All you need to do is just delete that and delete some of the comments,

93
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,610
the comma afterwards and that will sort this perfectly.

94
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,850
So now what we can do.

95
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,720
Yes,

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,700
we can delete that.

97
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,040
Yes,

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,640
I know.

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,760
Select the source data sheet was way back ups that up here to fire in order longer run to

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,880
profit by sales.

101
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,390
But wrote cursor,

102
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,730
There's our first chart and we'll come back here.

103
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,540
It's f eight.

104
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,410
Andi,

105
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,760
Here's where we started making changes soon in development.

106
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,620
That's where we were on never gonna change the road.

107
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,900
Header two Sales person.

108
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,670
They were going to change this dynamically to currency on.

109
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,290
There you go.

110
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,680
And now we're going to do the auto sort.

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,220
So Justin G looks like our most profitable guys.

112
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,360
Someone needs their fate.

113
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,450
Justin.

114
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,820
Jesus.

115
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,150
The top on that.

116
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,880
Is that piece of code completely finished?

117
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,350
OK,

118
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,040
in the next lecture,

119
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,710
we're gonna have a look at butcher in that and using for the profit by category.

120
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,250
I'll see you in the next lecture.
