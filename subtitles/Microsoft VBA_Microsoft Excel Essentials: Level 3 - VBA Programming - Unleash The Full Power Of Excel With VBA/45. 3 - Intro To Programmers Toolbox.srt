1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,810
guys.

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,330
And welcome to this section the programmers Toolbox.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:06,480
Now,

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,490
in the last section,

6
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,200
we looked at lots and lots of intimate individual lines of code and snippets of code.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,190
They're going to teach you the structure of how to program.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,850
But to really make your programs dynamic and powerful,

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,350
you're gonna need to master a few of the key programmer's tools.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,730
And they are variables.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,050
Looping logical test in math,

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,930
how to write formulas using code input boxes,

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,570
Andi message boxes.

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,390
And finally,

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,130
we're gonna have a look at a raise.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,460
Now,

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,050
by the end of this section,

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,250
you're gonna be able to program anything that you can imagine.

19
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,990
Okay,

20
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,540
without telling further delay it.

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,900
Let's crack on and I'll see you in the next lecture.
