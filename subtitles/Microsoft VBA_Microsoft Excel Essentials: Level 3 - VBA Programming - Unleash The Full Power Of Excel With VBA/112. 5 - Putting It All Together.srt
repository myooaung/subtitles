1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Okay,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:02,910
guys.

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:08,030
And welcome back to this final lecture in this section on Web data retrieval.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:08,720
Okay,

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,520
now what we're gonna do is final few touches.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,450
What we have is this chart here.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,660
So I'm just going to right,

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,940
click on the charts and I'm gonna cheat.

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,370
Let me scroll up so you can actually see that men right?

10
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:26,690
Click on the chart and choose a sign macro on my amazing web Queary is where our macro lips

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:26,690
.

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,500
So I'm just gonna double click on that.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,150
And then when I click here,

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,190
all of our code will execute.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,230
But at the moment,

16
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,890
if we think about what our code does,

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,600
it flips back to this sheet.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,170
Richie,

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,400
VSEL The date of them flips back to this sheet there.

20
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,580
We don't actually want the user to see that.

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,190
So what we're gonna do here immediately after my amazing Web query sub starts?

22
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm gonna make that private.

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,150
By the way,

24
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:59,440
I am going to say application don't screen updating equals false on that is going to stop

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
the excel sheet itself.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,610
The Excel window will not change at all.

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,550
Other than the messages up the bar,

28
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,950
the main window display will not change.

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,630
If they're looking at this now,

30
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,270
remain looking at this,

31
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,390
but absolutely critical.

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,110
When every and only ever do this at the end of your code,

33
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,120
would you know everything works is you must turn the screen updating back on.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,860
Okay,

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,110
let's give it a final check to make sure it works.

36
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm just gonna delete all the data in here,

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
which is going to completely mess up their table.

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,940
I'm gonna come down here on the hit Our charts.

39
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,780
Onder who flee they go were retrieving the forecast from room.

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,990
I'm just gonna pause while it executes on.

41
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,650
There you go.

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,540
That's our code Complete,

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,920
completely dynamic.

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,020
Retrieving data in real time from the Internet building a beautiful table on the lovely

45
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,370
charts.

46
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,450
Look at OK,

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,950
I'll see you in the next section.
