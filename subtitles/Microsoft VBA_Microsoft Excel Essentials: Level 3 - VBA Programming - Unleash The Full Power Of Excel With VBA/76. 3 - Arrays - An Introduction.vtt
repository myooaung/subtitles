00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Okay,

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.190
guys,

3
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.260
from Welcome back.

4
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.490
Now,

5
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.590
in the next few lectures,

6
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.680
we're gonna have a look at one of the rial powerhouses of any programmers Toolbox.

7
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.310
And now this.

8
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.200
The array,

9
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.340
their way back at the start of this section,

10
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.160
we looked at variables on variables can best be described as a box or units of memory that

11
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.150
holds a single value.

12
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.470
Well,

13
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.190
what happens if we want to hold a whole bunch of different values?

14
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.490
Well,

15
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.950
that's exactly what the Raiders now,

16
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.480
just before we get into the code improperly,

17
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.210
I've written this very crude piece of code that demonstrates what life would be like

18
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.290
without a raise.

19
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.710
Now,

20
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.310
at the moment,

21
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.390
I have the Project Explorer visible just so you can see that we have multiple sheets and

22
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.250
I'm gonna be calling each of them in the next few lectures by their VB code name.

23
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.260
So you'll see that when you download the file,

24
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.160
which is a downloadable resource on this very lecture,

25
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.710
and it's called a raise dot x l S X and,

26
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.260
as always,

27
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.720
you'll have your get your code here so you can paste in all the code into a module and

28
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.250
follow along well here we have the colors of the rainbow.

29
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.040
Seven of them listed.

30
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.550
Down here on here.

31
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.020
We have a what life would be like without a raise piece of code,

32
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.770
which is inelegant,

33
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.600
inefficient,

34
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.090
but it absolutely works.

35
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.800
So remember,

36
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.320
ugly code still works.

37
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.750
I'm just going to step through this.

38
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.310
I've declared all my variables and I'm going to read into my valuable one.

39
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.810
The rank,

40
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.100
the value in range.

41
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.030
A one my valuable to to from a to three from a 34 from a four andan.

42
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.250
So,

43
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.490
no,

44
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.850
I have in my seven valuables 123 all the different colors that we've just read from here.

45
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.780
Now I'm gonna write those same variables to column be someone there,

46
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.360
press F eight effectively to faint all the way through.

47
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.420
And they go.

48
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450
That code executes beautifully,

49
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.200
but you can see we already have seven variable declarations,

50
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.220
seven variables or seven lines of code to read the data on also seven lines of code to

51
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.080
write the data.

52
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.330
No,

53
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.750
I know we could wrap that up in a loop to make it a little bit shorter,

54
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.850
but that's just for seven individual variables.

55
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.210
What if you have 50 variables or 1000 variables or 100,000 variables you can see very

56
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.050
quickly that your code is going to become absolutely huge.

57
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.990
Okay,

58
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.550
now we know they're valuable canal.

59
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.970
One piece of data.

60
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.690
Well,

61
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.690
Honore is essentially a variable that can hold multiple pieces of data.

62
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.940
And in the next few lectures,

63
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.070
we're gonna have Look at exactly how you do that.

64
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.960
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
