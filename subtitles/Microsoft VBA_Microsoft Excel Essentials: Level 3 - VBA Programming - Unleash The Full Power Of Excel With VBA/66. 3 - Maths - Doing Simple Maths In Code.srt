1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Okay,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,960
guys.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,510
And welcome back in the next four lessons,

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,820
we're gonna have a look at doing maths in code on that comes basically in four flavors.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,950
We're gonna do simple mathematical calculations in code.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,780
We're gonna have a look at writing formulas into spreadsheet on.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,950
We're also gonna have a look it calling on excels built in functionality and all the work

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,880
shape functions that are available in excel and heavy can utilize those in our code.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,690
Okay,

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,650
So quickly.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,660
Here's the 1st 1 This is just doing simple massing code now,

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,860
because we've got quite a large data set.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,900
State largely got 51 things,

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,950
but all we're going to be acting on in these next few lectures is this the age.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,900
So I am just gonna hide.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,730
I threw sing Andi these to hear your recognizes status,

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,200
what we will be using before.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,870
So I'm just gonna step through this code until we get here.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,360
We're gonna work out what the last row is fantastic,

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,370
and you'll notice that this time I've done at four x equals two to last row.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,370
And that's because our first data set appears at row to on.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,250
We're going to be using the cells arguments here at the cells method.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,300
So I'm gonna tab in a little bit.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,420
Then we'll say Cells open brackets X.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,910
Remember,

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,030
don't have toe.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,410
Add one here because I've already started X counting at two so immediately.

28
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,580
We're at Row two,

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,600
Comma seven because seven is column g A B C D E f g.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,750
I'm counting on my fingers there,

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:46,540
although you can't see it so cells open brackets X comma seven equals cells strips open

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,520
brackets X comma four Because A B C.

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,550
D is where our age currently lives,

34
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:02,180
so they go cells x seven Equal cells x four plus one Simple mathematics.

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,050
Take whatever the current age is in column d Add one to it and stick it into column G.

36
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,650
So let's just f eight and step through that on they go.

37
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:17,520
So 20 becomes 2122 becomes 23 24 becomes 25 on on and on and on.

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm just gonna hit play So they go.

39
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,200
That's a you simple mathematics in vb a coding.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,560
It literally is a simpler specifying your arguments on then adding your mathematical

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,790
operators Simple.

42
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,030
Is that OK?

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,040
In the next lecture,

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,150
we're gonna have a look at writing formulas into cells.

45
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,610
I'll see you in the next lecture
