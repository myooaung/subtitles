00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Okay,

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.750
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.220
Now,

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.860
At the moment,

5
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.470
what we've done is we've managed to read data from a specific cells.

6
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.430
We've learned all about selecting different cells.

7
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.960
We learned how to write data to cells.

8
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.400
We've learned how to read data from cells.

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.180
But what we may want to do is get the user's input and to use that,

10
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.290
we're going to use a couple of functions,

11
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.410
both of which are input boxes.

12
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.490
One is called the input box function,

13
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.280
which we're gonna have a look at in this lecture on the next one is the input box method.

14
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.710
No,

15
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.370
don't worry too much about the differences between the two.

16
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.760
You'll see them as we go through them in this example.

17
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.720
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to write a piece of code.

18
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.750
I've already written the code,

19
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.300
so I'm just gonna pay sitting here.

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.150
So I'm declaring the variables and we'll have three variables.

21
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.340
All of them are strings response.

22
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.520
One response to Andi my string.

23
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.100
So to write an input box statement,

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.100
what we're gonna do is say response one equals and then we're gonna type the word input box

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.100
.

26
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.980
And then when I hit open brackets.

27
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.850
You'll see we have been asked for a prompt.

28
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.680
So I'm gonna say is please enter your first name.

29
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.410
Not not not close quotes.

30
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.240
I'm gonna hit comma and you can see that the next thing we want is the title.

31
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.220
But before we get there,

32
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.750
I'm gonna hit space on underscore and hit Enter.

33
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.600
So we're still on the same line of code.

34
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.380
We just broken it down into another line to make it easier to read.

35
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.770
So open quotes.

36
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.710
The title is Christian name and I want it closed Quotes on.

37
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.960
I'm gonna finish there by just closing the brackets on Gonna click off and you can see that

38
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.650
response ones automatically capitalized because we have already declared the valuable a bit

39
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.660
up here on now I'm just going to copy that code,

40
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.820
going to paste it underneath ongoing a money fight slightly and say response to because

41
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.420
that will be our second burial variable,

42
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.360
please into your last name and only change that too,

43
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.520
sir.

44
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.450
Name.

45
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.990
Okay,

46
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.580
so let's just step through.

47
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.630
That hits in F eight.

48
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.880
So response one on when we press center,

49
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.040
we can see that this little box pops up Christian name,

50
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.360
which is exactly what it says here in the title.

51
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.480
Please enter your first name.

52
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.230
My first name is Alan.

53
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.540
Okay.

54
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.650
And there were down toe line to some in the press f eight.

55
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.250
Please enter your last name,

56
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.700
Jarvis.

57
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.100
And okay,

58
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.180
if I hover over one,

59
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.110
you can see that the variable response one contains my first input,

60
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.080
which was Alan on response to our second variable.

61
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.970
Has the name Jarvis,

62
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.250
because that was the second thing I typed in.

63
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.680
So I'm just gonna press stop for now and know what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build a string

64
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.650
using those two inputs.

65
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.800
So I'm gonna say is the third variable.

66
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.140
My string equals open quotes.

67
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.050
Pleased to meet murdered,

68
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.840
please to meet you,

69
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.720
comma space,

70
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.450
close quotes and response one.

71
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.100
And I'm just going to hit the underscore there so I could move down toe onto another line,

72
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.340
Andi,

73
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.020
because I'm joining it together now.

74
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.940
I'm gonna want another space in here.

75
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.270
Otherwise we're not gonna have a space between response one on response to so quotes,

76
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.700
space quotes Andi never wanna stick response to in the end response to So let's execute

77
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.340
that money click off Notice what happens to my string?

78
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.930
I'm pointing at the screen here.

79
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.380
Even though you can't see that that's automatically been capitalize.

80
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.750
So let's step through that again.

81
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.870
My first name is Alan.

82
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.500
Andi F ate.

83
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.390
My last name is Jarvis.

84
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.360
Andi.

85
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.280
Okay on.

86
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.950
Then this string is going to be built using police to meet you.

87
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.030
Andi,

88
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.210
My response one under space on my response to It's just like in Katyn,

89
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.790
ating in excel said.

90
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.440
Then when I hover over my string,

91
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.900
you can see that we now get the combined string.

92
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.990
Pleased to meet you,

93
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.330
comma space Alan Jarvis.

94
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.050
Okay.

95
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.360
Know,

96
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.940
it could be that we want to write that to a cell,

97
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.310
and we know how to do that.

98
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.750
So what we gonna do,

99
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.790
which we just can say range from rackets,

100
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.390
open quotes,

101
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.130
one close quote,

102
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.500
close brackets dot value because we're gonna change the property value of range A one we're

103
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.340
going to say that is going to equal my string.

104
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.460
So I'm just gonna hit run,

105
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.280
and that's going to run all the way through.

106
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.370
So play into your first name.

107
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.210
It is,

108
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.750
Alan.

109
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.340
And to your last name.

110
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.390
It is Jarvis on Hit.

111
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.470
Enter on.

112
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.040
There you go.

113
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.410
You can see that our tech cering successfully been built using this block of coaches here.

114
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.780
And then that combined string has been written to a one.

115
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.770
So they go,

116
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.810
please to meet you,

117
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.860
Alan Jarvis.

118
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.500
Okay.

119
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.260
And the next lecture,

120
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.060
we're gonna have a look.

121
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.910
A casing,

122
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.810
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
