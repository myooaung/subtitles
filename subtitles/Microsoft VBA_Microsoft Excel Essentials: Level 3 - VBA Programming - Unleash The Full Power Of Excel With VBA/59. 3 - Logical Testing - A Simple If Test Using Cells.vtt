00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
Okay,

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.100
guys.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.910
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.070
So I fully rammed.

5
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.540
All of the code from the last lecture have also added a new sub in here.

6
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.650
There's nothing in it,

7
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.910
but it's called logical one be on.

8
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.810
That's what I want to do is just copy this code into here on modify this code a little bit

9
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.810
.

10
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.490
So if it isn't mail,

11
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.040
it returns a different message.

12
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.550
Okay,

13
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.510
Now we're gonna have a look exactly the same.

14
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.410
Test a game,

15
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.730
but this time using cells so you can see up here.

16
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.810
We use the range objects and we use active cell dot value in the active cell offset.

17
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.000
But this time we're going to use the cells.

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.650
Object.

19
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.060
Now,

20
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.840
I normally prefer to write code the first time round using range because you can actually

21
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
watch what it is doing inside Excel.

22
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.500
So if you're gonna make a mistake,

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.050
it's pretty obvious what you're doing.

24
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.610
Then if I have the time and inclination,

25
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.630
I'll then converted to cells because it's more efficient and you'll see why in this test.

26
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.350
So it's exactly the same code so fast,

27
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.500
like the right she clear the old contents cells.

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.120
See,

29
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.690
sit,

30
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.370
start again.

31
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.110
Cells to to two rows down.

32
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.120
Two columns insert still print us into B two dot select.

33
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.210
If I just stepped down to that,

34
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.750
they go,

35
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.200
You can see that we've selected be to On this time we're going to use a four next loop

36
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.490
because we have 50 lines of data I'm gonna reiterate 50 times.

37
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.780
So for X equals 1 to 50.

38
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.440
So far,

39
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.080
so good.

40
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.690
Now I'm gonna in dende because it makes the loops easy to read.

41
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.790
I'm gonna say,

42
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.690
if cells X plus one because we're starting at line two.

43
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.860
So on the first situation,

44
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.470
X will be worth one,

45
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.030
so X plus one will be too.

46
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.980
So that will be lying to That's the row index become a two because we're looking at column

47
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.390
B So too rose down.

48
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.710
Two columns in two will be constant because we're always looking in column B.

49
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.050
But the X will increase once every time we pass through this loop.

50
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.540
So if cells X plus one,

51
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.970
which will be to the first time through the second time for the third time comma two in

52
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.150
column B equals,

53
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.100
then we said mail and then we're just gonna do exactly the same as we did before.

54
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.390
Well,

55
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.000
almost.

56
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.110
We're gonna say then what we want to do.

57
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.760
You say cells X plus one.

58
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.820
So we're still on road to in the first iteration comma seven,

59
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.700
because column G is +1234567 columns across close brackets stop.

60
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.590
Value equals,

61
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.740
he said.

62
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.700
It's What do you say?

63
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.260
Said It's a man on clothes on.

64
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.050
Then click off Now notice what happens here.

65
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.910
I'm just gonna hover over the different elements as we execute through this code,

66
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.300
and then you'll be able to see exactly what does So f eight if cells and you can see if I

67
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.670
hover over x X equals one.

68
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.500
So X plus one is two.

69
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.330
So two rows down.

70
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.510
Two columns across equals mail.

71
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.170
It most certainly does.

72
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.620
I'm gonna say cells X plus one so again to +72 rows down.

73
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.470
Seven columns across has a value of its Amanda.

74
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.650
When I press f eight,

75
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.590
they go.

76
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.850
You can see that it's written.

77
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.580
It's a man noticed that this has not moved.

78
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.090
We are still in Cell B two,

79
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.220
but when I hit F eight and move through the next iteration of the Loop X is now worth two.

80
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.760
So X +12 plus one is three.

81
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.390
So it's now looking at the third row down,

82
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.560
but still in column two.

83
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.950
So it's actually looking at B three.

84
00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.990
Andi.

85
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.100
That is also true.

86
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.950
So execute code on the third passed through X is equal to three plus one is four.

87
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.550
So we're gonna move.

88
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.490
1234 lines down.

89
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.020
Two columns across misses the cell.

90
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.850
It's checking.

91
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.450
That is also true.

92
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.350
Write the code.

93
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.840
It's a rate again.

94
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.510
X is now worth four plus one.

95
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.350
So that's 512345 across on again.

96
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.950
And here X is worth five so five plus warm.

97
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.310
So we're on 12345 plus one image.

98
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.310
And Ross is female,

99
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.020
so this test should fail on it,

100
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
so it just move straight down to the next loop on it will keep its rating.

101
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.840
I'm just gonna hit play on there you go with and actually moving down the cells using the

102
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.740
cells objects rather than the range object saves us having to hit that at to sell that

103
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.960
offset command,

104
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.610
which basically means if we automated 1000 times,

105
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.350
we have saved 1000 iterating sins of a line of code,

106
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.510
which is gonna make your code room faster.

107
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.240
Okay,

108
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
