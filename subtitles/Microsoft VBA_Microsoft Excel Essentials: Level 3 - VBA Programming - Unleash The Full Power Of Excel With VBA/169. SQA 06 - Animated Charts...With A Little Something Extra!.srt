1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Okay,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,680
guys.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,740
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,120
Questions answered.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,100
Now this.

6
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,880
This was really a two part question from Alice Andrews in the complete course.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,790
That's levels 12 and three on Alexandra's question related to making dynamic charts and

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,510
graphs,

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,150
now one of done in level two.

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,570
I answered that in the named on dynamic range section of the course,

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,850
but the third part was held to automate this and make it animated using V B A.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,360
So that's why that sits in level three here.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,560
So basically,

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,680
this is the This is the file that I created to show have to do dynamic charts on.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,320
We have a little scroll bar here,

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,980
and you can see that the chart updates dynamically.

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,320
But what we want to do is effectively create an animation out of this.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,830
So what we're gonna do here is we're going to create a thing.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,440
I'll just call it cycle clips on Hit enter a few times.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,060
No,

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,650
because we have let me just flipped back here.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,780
Olsen F 11.

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,980
We essentially have 31 sets of data each in six month blocks because each of these graphs

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,970
will show six months worth of data.

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,810
So this will be block one.

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,250
This will be blocked too,

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,210
if that six so and so forth.

28
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,090
31 times.

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,420
So we get through to December 2016.

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,460
So what we want to do,

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,920
we're just going to say for X equals 1 to 30 whips.

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,050
31 Allen on We'll say here,

33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,780
Next X.

34
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,010
So there is our loop?

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,500
No,

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,370
because the this is this is how we started in level two.

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,390
We just type a number in here.

38
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,340
What we need to do is programmatically increase this number by an increment of one each

39
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,770
time.

40
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,090
So back to the code,

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,820
what we're going to say is range open brackets,

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:07,390
a one dot value equals X because we're gonna increase by one for each passed through this

43
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:07,740
four.

44
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,500
Next loop on DNA.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,910
Now,

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,090
if let me just make that little bits whips as full screen,

47
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,200
let's see if I can make this a little bit smaller so we can see both windows.

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,650
Let's have a look.

49
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,490
I squished this right the way down.

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,470
This isn't gonna work terribly well.

51
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,200
It'll let me close that on debt.

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,730
Me Come down here.

53
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,210
So of chopped off half of the the thing here,

54
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,980
but hopefully you'll be able to see that.

55
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,770
So when I step through this,

56
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,180
you can see that this will become one on our chart.

57
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,440
Looks like that on.

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,630
Then it would become two and three and four,

59
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,970
and it'll keep increment in.

60
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,530
So that way,

61
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,520
if we press stop,

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,770
just run the code.

63
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,880
You can see that we'll get an animated charts up here.

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,200
So let me just press play.

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,270
But unfortunately,

66
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,730
that animated that quickly that you couldn't actually see what it was doing.

67
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:07,200
So what we need to do is introduce a pause between each of the interational is of this four

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,260
next loop.

69
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,450
And to do that,

70
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,550
we're going to use the application dealt Wait,

71
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,750
and we're going to say now,

72
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:24,130
plus on time value open brackets,

73
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,670
and we're gonna put this in quotes so we can say zero.

74
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,240
It was zeros minutes on.

75
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,030
Let's say one second.

76
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,520
Close quote close brackets on.

77
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,900
Now look what happens.

78
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,290
In fact,

79
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm just going to bring this off screen and just hit play,

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,980
and you can see what happens in the chart here.

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,880
So I'm just gonna play that macro January 14.

82
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,680
It's waiting for an increment of one second.

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,490
And then it's going through on performing the animation.

84
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,050
Now there's no smooth way to do this animation excel,

85
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,150
but essentially that becomes an animated chart.

86
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,780
Now,

87
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,500
obviously,

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,420
let me just sit,

89
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,910
escape a bit and stop that running.

90
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,510
There we go.

91
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,240
What we could do so we can change the interval here.

92
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,010
So we changes.

93
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,190
Say,

94
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,130
let's say every three seconds on that will obviously then change the chart dynamically

95
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,350
every three seconds.

96
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,800
But this bits just for fun.

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,550
Eso There's another thing you can I'm in here.

98
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,490
Um,

99
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,020
I've never really found a practical use for it,

100
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,770
but it's a bit of fun,

101
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,550
so show you had to do it and that is add application dot speech.

102
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,930
Don't speak on,

103
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,790
say,

104
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,070
open rackets And this is we wanted What?

105
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,490
This is what we won't say.

106
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,750
This chart begins at on.

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,790
Then we want to close that quotes.

108
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,460
Let me just make that look bigger so you can see here.

109
00:04:48,460 --> 00:05:00,810
So we will say this chart begins that andi sheet warm dot range from records open quotes B

110
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,230
one.

111
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,330
I think it's in B one.

112
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,520
The B one is the date,

113
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,580
so this chart begins at sheet one range.

114
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,670
Be one close quotes cause closed.

115
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,820
Brackets stop value on close brackets.

116
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,410
Again.

117
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,380
Sorry,

118
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,340
I had a slight mishap with my keyboard there,

119
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,740
so I've just bought This is the code that we've just looked at.

120
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,410
I'm just gonna bring it off screen on.

121
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,890
I'm just gonna play it and you can see what that does.

122
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,040
Oops.

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,710
OK,

124
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,050
run.

125
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:35,650
This chart begins at the first of January 2000 and 14.

126
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:46,410
This chart begins at the first of February 2000 and 14 of just sitting escape to stop that

127
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,890
code executing.

128
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,800
Obviously,

129
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,810
if we wanted to have that play a little bit quicker I'm not sure how many seconds it takes

130
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,210
to actually play that through.

131
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,540
But let me just play that.

132
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,060
And here we go.

133
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,560
Charge begins the first of January,

134
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,450
2000 and 14.

135
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,630
This chart begins at the first of February,

136
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,450
2000 and 14.

137
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,420
You go eso if you ever wanna have your code talk to you.

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,640
That's exactly you do with the application dot speech not speak.

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,420
Okay.

140
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,310
Any other questions?

141
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,020
Just let me know and I'll be happy to help.

142
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,950
Have a great day.

143
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,650
Thanks a lot
