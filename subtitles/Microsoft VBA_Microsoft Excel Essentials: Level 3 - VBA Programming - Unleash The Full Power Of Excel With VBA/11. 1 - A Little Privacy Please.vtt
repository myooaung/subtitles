00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
OK,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:03.930
guys.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.150
Now there is one drawback in coding the way we've been code in so far.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.290
If we have a look at our formulas,

5
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.270
I'm just gonna the the Project Explorer Andi View groups view Properties Window back in.

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.780
Let me just resize that they go that sound normal view now There is one problem in doing it

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.610
the way we've done it.

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.800
At the moment when we've recorded a macro,

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.850
we automatically get sub the name of our macro,

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.200
and if we type over it,

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.200
we can call it what we want or by default.

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.250
It will be macro 12 or three.

13
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.880
Then we record another macron.

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.960
We get sub on again and again and again and n sub now.

15
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.870
So far,

16
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.770
so good.

17
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:54.050
But what if the code that it lives between the sub and n sub is specific to one sheet?

18
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.940
That is,

19
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.190
it's geared to work precisely on this sheet,

20
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.730
but perhaps not on this sheet.

21
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.160
Well,

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.060
we have a problem because at the moment we haven't explicitly referenced any sheet,

23
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.420
and that's OK because at the moment our code is generic and it work with all sheets.

24
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.330
But any use that who knows anything about X.

25
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.400
L could easily click up to the developer Tab,

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.390
Run over to Mac Rose amigo.

27
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270
This is exactly what they'll see.

28
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.660
You'll see.

29
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.370
We have a clear formatting subroutine.

30
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.580
We have a highlight,

31
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.220
my formula subroutine.

32
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.350
And we have a join these together subroutine.

33
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.850
Now what we actually want them to be able to see is just the joint these together,

34
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.950
we want to stop them having access to run this Uprooting on its own on this subroutine on

35
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.490
its own.

36
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.450
And that's really simple to do.

37
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.320
What we do is gonna were gonna come before the words sub,

38
00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.250
and we're gonna type the word private notice I have typed in lower case and you have to

39
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.820
have a space between private and sub.

40
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.680
And then when I click off notice what happens to the P Private is capitalized and it's gone

41
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.810
blue on.

42
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.660
I want to do exactly the same down here.

43
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.050
So I'm just going tight private.

44
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.930
And when I click off they go.

45
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.460
It's capitalized p and turned blue because private is a reserved word in vb ages like sub.

46
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.050
And now when I come back to excel,

47
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.280
I can happily click on my Mac Rose and you'll see that Although those two subroutines are

48
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.110
still there,

49
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.100
they are now private and therefore hidden from the macro playback window.

50
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.640
So all the users conduce display this one.

51
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.950
Let me just manually on hide that so you can see that it did work.

52
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.450
No film.

53
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.160
I need to highlight the entire sheet.

54
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.730
I'm useless without code.

55
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.290
So now if the user goes into here hits the Mac rose on hits run,

56
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.960
boom.

57
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.290
It works perfectly,

58
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.480
but they won't be able to call this routine or this routine because they are now private.

59
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.880
Note the venters,

60
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.010
um,

61
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.900
stuff this subroutine from calling them It just hides them from the macro run window in

62
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.590
excel.

63
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.430
Okay,

64
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.770
I'll see you in the next lecture.
