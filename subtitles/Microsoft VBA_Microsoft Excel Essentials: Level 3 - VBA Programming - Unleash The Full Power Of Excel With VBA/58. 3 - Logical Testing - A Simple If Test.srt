1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,470
Okay,

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,910
guys,

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,730
welcome back in this lecture,

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,660
we're gonna have a look.

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,500
It's a simple single.

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,660
If test,

7
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,140
that is,

8
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,450
we're just going to write the entire test on one single line of code.

9
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,950
Now,

10
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,030
if you only test him for one value,

11
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,420
then this is a really fast and efficient way to do.

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,710
It will come to the more complex versions of that later on.

13
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,140
But for now,

14
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,650
we'll begin with a simple stuff.

15
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,260
Okay,

16
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,620
so here I have the shell of the code.

17
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,350
Andi,

18
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,520
this sheet here that you can't see See it because I've hidden the Project Explorer is

19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,500
actually called S H Logical testing.

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,950
Now,

21
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,980
I will paste this into your macro book.

22
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,140
So it's there when you download it on.

23
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,130
All of the code for the module is available as a download.

24
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,870
Reese Downloadable resource,

25
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,560
which you'll find in here.

26
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,540
Okay,

27
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,040
Right.

28
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,280
So let's have a look at the data.

29
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,940
So what this does is it calls?

30
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,300
I'm just going to step through this.

31
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,830
It calls this sheet to make sure we are on the right sheet because there is no undue when

32
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,310
you do something in code.

33
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,370
If you make a change in excel in code.

34
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,460
There is no coming back unless you quit without saving.

35
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,050
So remember Golden Rule Number one work on a backup.

36
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,630
There is no undue.

37
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,600
Let's look would have it.

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,540
You can download this as many times as you like,

39
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,560
so you perfectly fine,

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,380
okay?

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,740
And that we are going to be writing days into column G,

42
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,160
which is just out of view at the moment.

43
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,210
Don't worry too much about whether you can see what the actual values in the cells are at

44
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,660
the moment.

45
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,490
The key thing,

46
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,910
it's we'll zoom in the middle,

47
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,960
have a look at it as we working through the code.

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,310
So everything is gonna be written in here.

49
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,810
So the first thing I want to do is clear the content so we know the range.

50
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,660
Objects range open rackets open quotes G two G,

51
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,010
which is all of column g dot clear contents.

52
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:55,460
It's fairly obvious what clear contents does F eight range be to select in this test,

53
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,430
we're going toe.

54
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,410
Look for the sex of the person in that particular lines.

55
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,780
Arrange me to select on Ben.

56
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,980
We get to our first loop,

57
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,620
and this is a wile wound loop,

58
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,640
which you saw a few lectures ago.

59
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,430
Okay,

60
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,060
so now we're gonna add some more code in here,

61
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,750
notice that I'm in denting here.

62
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,410
And that way there is a natural flow to the coast.

63
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,690
So I'm just going to say the logical test because that's exactly what this is.

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,990
Now I'm gonna remnants before you download it,

65
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,810
but at the moment,

66
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,210
I'm just going to write the code.

67
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:36,950
So what this is going to say is if because it is a logical test and if the act is seldom

68
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,370
value now is whatever value,

69
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,960
whatever cell were in its value.

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,990
So here it's be,

71
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,390
too.

72
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,590
So the actor sell value will be male,

73
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,950
and that's what we want to test for.

74
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,550
If it equals male whips in quotes because it's text that we're testing,

75
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,410
then what do we want to do?

76
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,240
If it's male,

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,170
then we're going to say,

78
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,420
Well,

79
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,700
we will rise a value.

80
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,650
Two column G so at its cell because we're currently in column b don't forget offset.

81
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,080
However many columns across that is so it's zero rose.

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,780
We want to stay on the same road comma on If we have a look,

83
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,050
it's 12345 So active cell dot offset,

84
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,620
zero comma five dot value equals.

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,730
And what would we like?

86
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,350
It's the same.

87
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,060
We can say it's a man.

88
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,430
Close quotes on Ben.

89
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,190
We hit.

90
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,750
Enter.

91
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,850
Okay,

92
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,660
so that's a little long to see.

93
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,060
Uh,

94
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,290
yeah,

95
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,050
but if you scroll over or if I drag it over,

96
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,010
you should be able to say so There you go.

97
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,210
If the active cell value here equals male and it does,

98
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,900
then the active cell value offset zeros.

99
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,510
Five columns,

100
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,660
which is column G set that value to say its a man on.

101
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,690
When I dragged down back about me just one second,

102
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,250
I almost got that right first time there.

103
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,560
So let me come down here.

104
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,820
But before we execute over this line of code,

105
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,470
the next thing we want to do in our while wend loop is continue to test the rest of the

106
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,000
data.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,750
So we need to add another line of curd in here that says active cell adults upsets because

108
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,150
we want to move down 11 row zero Collins dot select.

109
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,100
So now look what happens in column G to just here.

110
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,860
Let me just click off.

111
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,450
That helps if I could smell select f eight and there were over to this part.

112
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,940
So this logical test has evaluated.

113
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,800
True.

114
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,530
So I'm gonna say active cell offset.

115
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,640
No rose.

116
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,630
Five columns equals It's a man F eight c.

117
00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:00,040
It's a man has just appeared in their active cell offset moved down a cell when repeat our

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,970
loop on Dunland and and and and then I can just hit play and set that running on.

119
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,500
Boom!

120
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,350
There you go.

121
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,690
That is all 50 lines of our data executed,

122
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,750
and you can see if I apply filter to female.

123
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,520
No one has any comments,

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,000
and you can see if I apply a filter to mail.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,900
Everyone has a comment,

126
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,880
so that works perfectly on.

127
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,050
That is a logical test in its simplest form.

128
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,700
Okay,

129
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,350
now telling fuel program in projects.

130
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,490
Let me just make this a little bit bigger,

131
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,080
and I will explain to you what your program in project is.

132
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,430
If you have a look at this code,

133
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,550
you'll see that certain elements of it is starting to make sense.

134
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,390
We know what the selecting a sheet bites Phoebe named does weaken very easily into it.

135
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,680
What clear contents means we know this one,

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,220
because on the first things we have looked at But if we actually look at this statement

137
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,840
here,

138
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,360
if the active self dot value that is the cell you sell,

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,110
we are in equals male,

140
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,600
then axis l offset zero comma,

141
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,440
five column G The value there will say it's a man.

142
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,340
So your programming project here is to copy this code paste underneath Onda there.

143
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,390
I want you to modify the code to say something different.

144
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,120
If it isn't a man on just to give you a hint,

145
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't just change male to female on.

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,870
When you look at the operators in this on,

147
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,740
just copy this code paste it,

148
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,030
modify the code slightly and change the message to make it do something different.

149
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,650
Okay,

150
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,250
I'll see you in the next lecture.
