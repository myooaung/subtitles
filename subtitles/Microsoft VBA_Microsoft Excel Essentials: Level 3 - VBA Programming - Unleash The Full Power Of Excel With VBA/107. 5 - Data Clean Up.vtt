00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Okay,

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.010
guys,

3
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.100
um,

4
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.450
welcome back now.

5
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.910
I've also added a rose 93 delete to the bottom off our London thing,

6
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.610
our London subroutine,

7
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.940
which has removed that odd stray bit of data just there.

8
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.450
Now,

9
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.750
one of donors have created a new subroutine called Cleanup imported data.

10
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.350
And I have already added that to the run.

11
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.100
All that right up here.

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.430
So how we were going to clean up the data?

13
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.530
Well,

14
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.220
the first thing we need to do is select first cell.

15
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.590
We wonder if I look at this.

16
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.180
You remember that we have day where all the data lives on randomly.

17
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.750
We have the date below it.

18
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.860
So here,

19
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.850
this is a cell we want to select.

20
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.770
I want to go to a three song.

21
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.750
This a range over back soaking approach.

22
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.180
A three close quote,

23
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.580
close brackets dot select.

24
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.080
And that is where we are beginning just the one dot allen.

25
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.470
So range a three dot select,

26
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.450
and then we want to do a loop to copy this data into this cell,

27
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.230
and that's going to be fairly straightforward.

28
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.580
What we're going to say is,

29
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.230
while they're the active cell,

30
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.800
dark value doesn't equal nothing.

31
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.060
And then we're gonna add a wend.

32
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.390
So here's our first loop in an actual program on what we're going to say is that the active

33
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.100
cell groups,

34
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.970
the active cell don't tell you equals the active cell dot Offset on.

35
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.930
We want to go one road down.

36
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.860
So positive 11 We don't want to move columns on they go.

37
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.800
So the anti cell offset one road down,

38
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.860
zero columns across dot value So the active cell value is gonna equal whenever the cell

39
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.910
immediately below it say's then what we want to say is delete the blank line that's being

40
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.260
left.

41
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.150
So what we're going to say is on himself dot upset,

42
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.050
remember?

43
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.380
That's going to be this road now that when we're looking at because we haven't moved,

44
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.470
we're still here.

45
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.160
We've just copied this data to here.

46
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.910
So we're looking at this cell so active seldom offset one road down zero columns across on

47
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.790
what we want to say.

48
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.660
There is dot entire row on.

49
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.250
We want to say don't delete and we want to do the X l shift.

50
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.250
Oh,

51
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.040
close brackets.

52
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.940
Boom on.

53
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.060
That's gonna delete that blank line.

54
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.620
No,

55
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.270
here.

56
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.800
This cell will be disappeared.

57
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.200
This value is gonna live in here.

58
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.850
This will be gone on Friday is going to be immediately below it.

59
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.770
So the next thing we need to do is just move down a cell,

60
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.760
active cell that upset.

61
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.530
And this time we actually want to use the select method.

62
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.030
So we're gonna say one comment,

63
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.750
zero move one sold down dot Select and I'll ram this out in a second.

64
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.650
But let's just step through that code and have a look at what it does.

65
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.940
So it's gonna whips.

66
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.280
Spaces they know will be happy.

67
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.190
So instead,

68
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.850
through a three has been selected.

69
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.660
If it wasn't already the anti sell value recalls the Accel offset dot value notice What

70
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.210
happens to Thursday here?

71
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.910
It knows,

72
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.850
Say's 18 08 2016 UK formats obviously notice what's gonna happen a row for here.

73
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.310
That's gonna be deleted entirely and everything is going to shift up,

74
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.370
and then we're going to move down a cell,

75
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.920
and then we're going to repeat because while the active cell isn't blank,

76
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.470
it's going to continue toe loop.

77
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.020
So I'm just gonna hold my finger on that overweight and in fact,

78
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.410
let's just run its outlets hit,

79
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.740
play.

80
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.150
Boom.

81
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.380
So they go when they click back on here,

82
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.350
we have a much more friendly looking table that we can easily extract data from.

83
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.920
Then the next thing we're gonna have,

84
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.250
have a look at in the next lecture is doing something about this.

85
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.780
Feels like you can't chart off text.

86
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.710
So here we have 30 space degrees centigrade.

87
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.940
What we actually need that to say is just 30.

88
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.230
So we're just going to simple find a replace in the next lecture on,

89
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.050
then we'll be ready.

90
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.560
Okay.

91
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.980
I'll see you in the next lecture.
