1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,720
guys.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,740
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,060
Questions answered.

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,630
Lecture.

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,960
Now this is in response to a question from Claire,

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,470
who's working away through Level two on Had the idea that what would you do if you have

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,870
multiple date ranges for one item in gallant charge?

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,360
She's just completed began Child section Now,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,670
actually,

11
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,430
Miss read this question originally,

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,960
and I thought the question related to this middle part just here that said,

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,100
What do I do for one different colors?

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,560
Which was part of the question.

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,810
If I have different reasons for the absence,

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,430
so answer that question.

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,910
Back in Level two,

18
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,330
that actually wasn't a full question.

19
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,330
And the four question,

20
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,400
though it could probably be done with formulas.

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,760
It's far simpler if you do it in V B A.

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,750
So the question is,

23
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,380
what do I do if I have the unique identify the same unique identify or look of value

24
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,080
multiple times.

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,200
So store number seven,

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,700
double 01 We don't particularly want to lower Gannon charts a list it five or six times.

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,700
We just wanna list it once and have it color in the Gant chart in different colors,

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,200
depending on the reason code.

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,630
So that's the question.

30
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,190
Now,

31
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,640
here's some data that are butchered together and you condemn low this as a downloadable

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,150
resource.

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,640
It's called Gantt charts with a little more sophistication.

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,360
Andi,

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,210
as always,

36
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,750
you can get your code here.

37
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,060
Just copy all of that and paste it into a regular module and I'm gonna show you what it

38
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,310
does.

39
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,210
This is our data.

40
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,920
We've got different store numbers down here We have from Nate's.

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,250
We have two dates on.

42
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,920
We have reason codes.

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,550
So we only have three in ages for the purposes of illustration.

44
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,940
And they are stock take or its and statutory holidays.

45
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,590
I'm just gonna hit the button.

46
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,540
The goal is going to go away,

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,490
and it's going to generate this gun charge just here.

48
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,040
So we can say that green is a you which isn't all it.

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,690
And we've got little au in each of those cells to tell us it's not.

50
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,470
It s t will be in red on.

51
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,260
It will be a stock.

52
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,660
Take an S H will be a statutory holiday.

53
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,990
And in yellow,

54
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,920
obviously canal.

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,020
It's much sophistication to this as you like,

56
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,450
but this is just for the purposes of demonstration.

57
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,530
So let's have a look at the code.

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,170
So the code looks something like this.

59
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,120
A couple of things to point out.

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,570
The data sheet has a VB name of share data.

61
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,380
The gallant sheet,

62
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,550
this one here that we're looking at has a VB name of shit Gant,

63
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,440
both of which were covered in the course.

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,560
Now here is the code.

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840
Now what we're gonna do is I'm just going to ram out the application screen updating so we

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,850
can watch this code go through as we execute it.

67
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,220
So here we're going to say,

68
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,570
shirt guns because we calling by cheat name,

69
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,530
range A range seven rose seven to row,

70
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,570
10,000 clear contents than clear format.

71
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,710
So it's just step through that bump on bump and they go,

72
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,920
That's giving us a completely blank sheet.

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,620
No,

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,930
we're going to say copy from ship Data range a four to a and again,

75
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,770
I'm specifying shit data because it's the data range on the data sheet.

76
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,310
Range a 65,000 way at the bottom.

77
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,710
Use the end,

78
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,770
Excel up.

79
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,860
That's going to take us to the last populated cell and get the road number.

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,990
So whatever the road number is and we can see here it's 52.

81
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,540
So essentially was saying,

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,640
should date at range a four to a 52 copy and then paste it to ship gowns.

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,230
This one range a seven.

84
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,440
So let's just execute that ***.

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,040
That is an exact copy of everything that we have in there now it should.

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,100
Gallant selects were already on it.

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,120
Now remove duplicates.

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Now we're going to do a similar sort of thing.

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,210
Here we go.

90
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,120
But this time we're going to go from a seven to a We're going to go range.

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,830
We don't have to specify which sheet now because we're on the right sheet.

92
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,650
Range a seven and Excel down Row,

93
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,060
which is a similar kind of thing.

94
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,120
But we've gone from here down instead of 65,000 on up.

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,450
Remove duplicates columns one headed Excel.

96
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:11,790
No,

97
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,600
that's just butchered from a simple recorded macro.

98
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,230
Me his f eight,

99
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,150
We get our unique list of things.

100
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,630
You could probably other sorts of this.

101
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:20,860
Oh,

102
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,480
yeah,

103
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,170
clear.

104
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,190
Any sort filled.

105
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,260
So let's go f ace And again,

106
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,350
this is just a butchered recorded macron.

107
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,590
Step through now.

108
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,010
There you go.

109
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,150
So we have a sort order.

110
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,450
So then now they're sequential.

111
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,050
Go back to the main data sheet.

112
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,720
Here we go.

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,100
Range a four and do while the active cell doesn't equal blank.

114
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,420
So literally we're going to just loop through all of the's.

115
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,540
So we're on our first line.

116
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,240
Just contract,

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,990
then in a little bit,

118
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,250
so you can see it better.

119
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,900
That's probably about right.

120
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,350
So we're gonna do this while the active cell doesn't equal blank step through,

121
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,480
We're going to capture my store.

122
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,610
My start may end on my reason.

123
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,000
So we have my store.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,640
7020 my start.

125
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,040
10 January 10th 2018 12 genera 2018.

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,010
And my reason is stock take F eight and we're going to step through again and we're coming

127
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,090
back to this sheet.

128
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,370
Began chart McGuinness.

129
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,850
You choose a seven.

130
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,870
They were going to have another loop.

131
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,190
While this column doesn't equal blank on,

132
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,770
we're gonna test if the active cell value,

133
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,570
which is currently seven double 01 equals my store,

134
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,720
which is 70 to 0.

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,070
And if it doesn't,

136
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,220
we're gonna skip through and we're going to move down the cell and then loop back up and

137
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,800
we're going to continue that until we get to this part.

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,310
Just here,

139
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,670
that is.

140
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,810
We have found a match.

141
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,660
So I'm just going to hit the bug and run to cursor.

142
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,770
And they go seven to blow four active cell value seven to blow four.

143
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,690
Sorry.

144
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,170
Here's where it should go to bug rule to cursor Try again,

145
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,470
Alex.

146
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,020
Diego.

147
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,960
So now we have xsl.

148
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,220
Value equals 7020 which is my store 7021 So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna have

149
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,640
another loop that goes across,

150
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,840
so we're going to go eight and we're going to move over to our first date column,

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,800
which is here.

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,930
So we have gone active Cell zero rose one column across and there we have another loop

153
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,550
that's never gonna loop across and check the date above.

154
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,360
So I might need to close this place off so you can actually see the four code Nega,

155
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,530
and that's a little bit better.

156
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,080
They go.

157
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,070
So now we're going to say do while the active cell offset minus active cell ro minus six.

158
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,490
Because we have six rows of the top selectors ro minus six.

159
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,460
The value doesn't equal blank.

160
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,770
So while this row here doesn't equal blank,

161
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,310
it's going to continue to loop.

162
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,000
So now we're just gonna loop through that their fate and check if the date in rows six is

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
greater than my end.

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,710
And if so,

165
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,370
go to the next pass.

166
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,550
So we're just going to step through that on.

167
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,000
We're gonna go like this and we're going to keep looping until we find a date that does

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,460
match again.

169
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,970
And with this,

170
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,520
I think I'm gonna run to cursor here for a second.

171
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,440
Let's go there,

172
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,020
debug.

173
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,650
Run to cancer.

174
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,080
Bigger.

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,320
So now we've found date match the matches our start date.

176
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,770
Now,

177
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,280
if my reason equal stock take this is just three logical tests of my reason.

178
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,440
Equal stock take and it does.

179
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,140
What we're going to do is collect the internal collapse vb red and to the active self value

180
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,140
.

181
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,460
We're gonna add the value S t.

182
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,610
And there's a second test to safe in equals old it it doesn't.

183
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,360
There's 1/3 test that says,

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,160
if unequal statutory holiday,

185
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,740
it doesn't.

186
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,860
So it's going to skip that,

187
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,250
and then we're just going to keep looping through that until we've done all of these.

188
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,390
Now what we're gonna do,

189
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,950
I think somewhere we're gonna loop out of this,

190
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,320
right?

191
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,150
Let me just go back up to that so you can see what that did.

192
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,420
So we had a jump to next pass.

193
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,790
So what we said is,

194
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,670
if the date in rows six is greater than my end date,

195
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,490
that is,

196
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,470
we've already reached the end of the things that we need to call it in,

197
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,250
then go to next pass and next pass lives down here.

198
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,500
So now we're going to go back to our store coat,

199
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,550
sell a six,

200
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,330
and we're going to go to sheet data.

201
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,910
We're going to move down the cell,

202
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,210
and we're just going to repeat.

203
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,660
And again,

204
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,050
we're going to capture all the data,

205
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,370
jump back there,

206
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,670
loop back through until we find out particular store code,

207
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,380
and then we're going to go across and coal retain.

208
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,210
And I'm just gonna play that well while it works.

209
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,200
I'll tell you the other bit that we're going to do now.

210
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,630
Now what this does is it generates It runs this code when you hit this button,

211
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,630
but oops,

212
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,410
that's a kitten coming in from the outside.

213
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,610
What we also have is this here You remember this from the gun child lecture back in level

214
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,160
two.

215
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,570
But rather than having that in Tyco duplicated as a workbook event,

216
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,420
what I'm gonna do is I just have a simple workbook event,

217
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,200
a bit of code,

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,810
which I did take outs.

219
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,670
It will keep calling this otherwise,

220
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,420
and I'm just gonna put that back in into the v b e,

221
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,490
which is No,

222
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:31,940
not that I concludes that I think I don't safe eventually will close on.

223
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm just gonna pesetas a workbook event in here.

224
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,650
So I'm going to go to view to Project Explorer,

225
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,600
and it's gonna live in shit,

226
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,460
Gant.

227
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,810
And I'm gonna pace that in there.

228
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,680
Literally.

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,870
This is copied straight out of the workbook change events section because the law is gonna

230
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,720
do you say,

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,540
Look at that sell.

232
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,390
Look at that cell.

233
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,850
And if either of them change display a message.

234
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,870
So if a type seven and then he tends that you'll see you just change the either the

235
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,290
incremental the start date,

236
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,400
please it generate gam button again.

237
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,030
Okay.

238
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,410
And then with the gam button,

239
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,540
he could have just looked at will execute,

240
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,670
obviously turn screen update enough.

241
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:16,020
And then then you won't see all this flickering happen on then any second now.

242
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,690
And there you go.

243
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,310
Now you have your gun chart,

244
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,390
which is completely scalable to use in this increment.

245
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,760
I hope that helps and has always any questions.

246
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Do let me know.

247
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,780
Have a great day.
