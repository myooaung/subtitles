00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Okay,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.090
guys.

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.080
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.350
And never gonna have a look at something that seems to Fox some seasoned programmers as

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.980
well as beginning programmers.

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.170
So what we have here is we're going to capture the column letter on the road number and

7
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.210
then would be able to stick them together to actually get a cell reference that we would

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.020
understand switches D seven a one Q 406 or whatever it ISS.

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.550
Don't worry too much about how this works.

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.450
Just feel free to steal this line of code whenever you have this particular need.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.950
So just to quickly talking through it,

12
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.650
what we're gonna do is take the active cell address,

13
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.300
which here is D seven on.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.020
We're gonna split it by the delimit er dollar sign.

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.790
Now you'll remember from the last lecture that when we capture addresses,

16
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.820
their returned in their absolute cell reference.

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.200
So d seven,

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.950
when we captured it became absolute de absolute seven.

19
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.210
So the first thing we want to do is capture the column letter,

20
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.860
which is going to be much more meaningful to us.

21
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.880
And to do that,

22
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.840
we say split the active cell address that the limiter is the dollar sign on.

23
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690
Then we put open brackets,

24
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.190
one close brackets at the end.

25
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.620
So if I hit F eight,

26
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.350
we can see here that the column letter is D.

27
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.200
Now you can just use road to get the road number,

28
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000
but just for completeness.

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.510
And if you have a fancy deconstructing this code,

30
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.180
we're going to use exactly the same format.

31
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.150
But to get the road number using this method,

32
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.280
we put two in the brackets at the end.

33
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.690
So if a hit of eight,

34
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.140
they go row number seven using exactly the same method.

35
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.910
So I column letter S t on a row.

36
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.230
Number is seven.

37
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.010
Okay,

38
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.640
Now there are a bunch of other things that from time to time,

39
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.080
you are gonna want to capture.

40
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.760
Some of them are slightly are.

41
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.300
Some of them are really,

42
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.470
really useful.

43
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.190
Okay,

44
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.140
I'll see you in the next.

45
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.080
Like to a We're gonna have a look at all of those.

46
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.900
I'll see you then.
