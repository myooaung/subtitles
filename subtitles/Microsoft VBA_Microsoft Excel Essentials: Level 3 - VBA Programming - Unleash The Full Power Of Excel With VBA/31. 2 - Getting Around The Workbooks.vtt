00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
Okay,

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.900
guys.

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.860
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.790
So now we know all about moving around cells.

5
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.560
We know how to navigate between the sheets on.

6
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.700
Then we're gonna have a look at the third level of the hierarchy,

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.450
which is the work books themselves.

8
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.690
Now you're going to see a piece of code or a word that you've never seen before.

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.950
And now is this workbook.

10
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.450
Now,

11
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.060
you may be thinking as we did with active cell inactive sheet,

12
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.650
It is redundant to activate it.

13
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.040
But if you have more than one workbook open So if I just hit control and then Onda save a

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.800
book one somewhere So let me just press safe on save it.

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
Whatever saves the desktop save ago.

16
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.590
So now we have to work books open.

17
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.460
So notice well on Book one.

18
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.520
If I want to get back to the workbook where the code lives I use this workbook dot Activate

19
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.900
and they go We are back to this workbook,

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.620
the workbook where the code lives now.

21
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.380
Similarly,

22
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.660
if I flipped back to here,

23
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.020
I'm now in book one and I say workbooks.

24
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.540
My macro book dot Activate hit F eight again.

25
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.270
We are coming back to a workbook because we're specified.

26
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.900
The object workbook with a name of my macro book should be activated.

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.530
Now,

28
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.530
the third method for doing this,

29
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.240
which is a little dodgy but I've included it here for completeness is reference in the

30
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.530
workbook bites index number.

31
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.030
Now it's index number is the order in which you opened it.

32
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.430
So in this particular instance here,

33
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.340
workbooks one will be my macro book because that was the first workbook I opened on

34
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.000
workbooks.

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.610
To would be that second workbook I opened.

36
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.960
So that's the index number.

37
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.850
I must admit I never use this,

38
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.830
but there it is,

39
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.290
just in case you ever need to know.

40
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.980
One thing to knows when you are selecting,

41
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.830
if you want to select a range or a sheet in another workbook,

42
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.590
is you must activate it first.

43
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.450
So here,

44
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.920
if I press f eight workbook ones,

45
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.820
activate.

46
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.240
So here's workbook one.

47
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.180
I have now leader sheet to better.

48
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.630
I'd want bigger so she to let me go back to xi one xi to dot Select will work perfectly

49
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.240
because we've done it in two steps.

50
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.220
We have activated the workbook and we have no chosen sheets sheet to dot Select Notice that

51
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.470
we can't just take this immediately.

52
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.320
Their front like this here.

53
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.660
So you may think I could streamline that into one line of code workbooks.

54
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.920
One sheets to dot select.

55
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.130
If I come back to my macro book and we execute that line of code,

56
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.790
you'll see that you get a runtime error.

57
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.300
You must activate a workbook before you attempt to select it.

58
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.630
Now,

59
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.380
that's only true with selections,

60
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.990
you can still read on right data from a workbook without activating it.

61
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.580
But for selecting,

62
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.400
you have to do it in two steps.

63
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.150
Activate the workbook,

64
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.840
then do the select.

65
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.350
Okay,

66
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.750
I'll see you in the next election.
