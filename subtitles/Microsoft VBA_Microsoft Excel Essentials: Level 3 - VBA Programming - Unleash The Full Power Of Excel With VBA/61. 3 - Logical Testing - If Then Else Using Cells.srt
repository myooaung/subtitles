1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Okay,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,230
guys.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,370
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,820
Now,

5
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,240
that's another program in project here for you.

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,320
If you're up for the challenge on I've pasted the code directly into here and this is gonna

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,310
be called logical to be.

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,800
What I want you to do is copy.

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,940
Logical to a That's the code we just looked at in the last lecture.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,780
So couple the current into here,

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,130
but converse it change some of the code to test if a person or a precedent as I've typed

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,460
there,

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,800
if a person is over a certain age and then put a message in appropriately so that your

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,900
program in project okay,

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,730
own theological test to see simple,

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,320
logical testing using the if then else on the cells objects of this exactly the same code

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,450
we just looked at.

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,960
But I've modified it to you cells instead of ranges.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,910
So that way we don't have to move down the cell.

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,070
So what we do,

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,670
you'll also notice,

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,870
have incorporated this from our macro book.

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,030
And what this does is he gets the last row number.

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,530
Before,

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,420
when we used to four next loop,

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,390
we knew there were 50 values.

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,700
So we said for X equals 1 to 50.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,110
But data can be dynamic,

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,640
and the may not always be 50 lines.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,620
So what happens if something gets deleted or something gets added?

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,290
The coach just not gonna work anymore.

32
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,370
So now we're introducing an element of being able to be dynamic with echoed.

33
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,090
So what this is going to do is gonna have a variable which I have declared up here,

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,950
my last root as interject.

35
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,020
And I've just got to find that again.

36
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,740
They're here again.

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,170
Eso my last row equals range be one million,

38
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:42,720
I think,

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,560
Or 1001 every $100,000 and excel up to the row,

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,890
which is going to get us to the bottom of this range here.

41
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,390
So we're starting down the line,

42
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,010
a 1,000,000 or something moving up on.

43
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:03,110
Then we're going to subtract one because we have 50 lines of data because we have a title

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,690
at the top.

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,850
On that way,

46
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,870
Alyssa will be 50.

47
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,650
So let's just execute all way through that by pressing F 84 X equals one to my less road,

48
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,750
and you can see that my last row already has 50 because it's dynamically calculated that

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,480
out just there.

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,740
So Frank's equals one to my last row,

51
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,800
which is 50 cells.

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,910
X plus one x on the first pass through is once a one plus one is two so cells to 212 rows

53
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,550
down 12 columns across Selby to in any other language.

54
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:49,390
It's that equals male F eight cells X +11 plus +12 so it sells to +712123456 7/2 column G

55
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,190
right?

56
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,110
It's alone F eight.

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,900
We don't need to move down and sell because that's going to be taken Care off because we

58
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,740
use in X as a reference in the cells.

59
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,350
Object,

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,960
eh?

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Phase next.

62
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,410
Exes.

63
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,450
No worth two.

64
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,710
That's a male again.

65
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,300
So again,

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,860
it's a man.

67
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,440
It's a man.

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,100
It's a man.

69
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,890
I'm just stepping through by hitting F.

70
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,350
A cheese woman hit play and they go.

71
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,670
We didn't even have this screen a scroll then,

72
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,160
because the cursor actually never moved away from B to.

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,380
But still every line occurred was executed,

74
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,620
and we have a value against everyone.

75
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,280
So that's the efficiency of use in the cells.

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,880
Object.

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,670
Okay,

78
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,180
I'll see you in the next lecture where we are looking at.

79
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,350
What are we looking at?

80
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,660
Testing.

81
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,170
If there is more than one criteria.

82
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:37,820
Okay,

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,170
I'll see you in the next lecture.
