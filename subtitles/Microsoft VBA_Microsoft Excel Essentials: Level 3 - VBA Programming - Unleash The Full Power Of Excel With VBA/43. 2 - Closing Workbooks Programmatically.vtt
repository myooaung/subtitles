00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
Okay,

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.640
guys,

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:02.750
Um,

4
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.910
welcome back now,

5
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.750
In the last lecture,

6
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.180
we looked at how to programmatically openwork books on.

7
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.280
We looked at a different the different ways that you can open workbook so you can have them

8
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.660
open read only so they do.

9
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.460
Or they don't update the most recently used list on also here to open password protected

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.170
workbooks.

11
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.840
And then we can have a look at how close workbook.

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.540
So we have a few lines of code.

13
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.550
Here s so what I'm gonna do,

14
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.830
I have here Book one Open.

15
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.530
So Book One is the active workbook.

16
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.790
So to close a workbook,

17
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.160
simply literally.

18
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.930
All you have to do is type active workbook,

19
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.310
Doc.

20
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.150
Close on.

21
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.070
Notice what happens to book one over.

22
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.330
Here they go.

23
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.460
Book one is closed.

24
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.180
Nice and simple on.

25
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.310
Now.

26
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.210
I'm gonna rent these out so we can get to each of the individual bits of code.

27
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.840
Now we looked at earlier at the index number of the workbook,

28
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.730
the indexes,

29
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.790
the order in which you opened your workbooks.

30
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.150
So if you open my macro book first,

31
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.050
that will have an index number of one.

32
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.320
If you open book one second,

33
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.750
that will have an index number of number two.

34
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.770
I really wouldn't recommend closing a workbook by index number,

35
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.270
but just included it here for completeness.

36
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.180
No.

37
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.540
Okay,

38
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.400
now we're into the slightly clever stuff.

39
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.780
This workbook dot clothes simple line of code will work perfectly.

40
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.940
No,

41
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.930
if you haven't made any changes,

42
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.370
it will just close.

43
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.590
If you have made changes,

44
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.680
then it's not gonna close immediately.

45
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.610
You're going to get that little pop up that says,

46
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.100
Do you want to save your changes Will weaken bypass that by specifying a parameter.

47
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.490
And here we have active workbook close space.

48
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.350
The parameter save changes equals true.

49
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.280
So where if here,

50
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.770
whatever random text is in this cell,

51
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.990
I have no made a change to book one now.

52
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.820
Notice what?

53
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.490
Actually,

54
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.990
let's let's come back and let's have a look of that code.

55
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.490
So I've made a change.

56
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.430
And if I try to execute this code,

57
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.240
I get this message prop up.

58
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.980
Do you want to save?

59
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.970
Do you not want safe?

60
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.270
So that can be annoying,

61
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.550
particularly if you want this all happen automatically.

62
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.240
So this is where this bit of code comes in.

63
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.330
Active work booked up,

64
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.930
close save changes true on notice.

65
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.750
What happens when their faith through that one,

66
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.770
it just closes on it saves the changes now,

67
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.650
conversely,

68
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.880
we may not want to save the changes,

69
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.730
and we may not want to give the use of the option to save the changes.

70
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.750
So if they just type some random Texan here,

71
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.720
we have now made a change.

72
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.000
But if I f a through this one,

73
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.110
the workbook is just going to close.

74
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.250
And if I reopen it,

75
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.700
you can see that the changes have not Bean saved.

76
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.280
Okay,

77
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.710
guys,

78
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.210
at the time of recording,

79
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.220
that's just about all we have in some of the basics.

80
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.040
And now you have loads of individual lines of code that will teach you the structure to do

81
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.810
what you need to do now,

82
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.410
Really,

83
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.320
you can probably piece together an awful lot of the things that you're gonna want to do,

84
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.440
using just the stuff in sub the basics.

85
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.390
If not,

86
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.380
they're certainly going to give you a steer ist of what you should be looking at on what

87
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.670
the structure is gonna bay.

88
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.560
Now we're gonna 45 what you have just learned in the next section the program's toolbox

89
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.270
where we're going to covering depth.

90
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:27.570
All of all about variables looping logical test in writing formulas in code message boxes,

91
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.510
input boxes.

92
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.340
And by the end of that section,

93
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.850
you are gonna have absolutely everything you need to program any project that you can

94
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.370
imagine.

95
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.910
OK,

96
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.450
I'll see you in the next section.
