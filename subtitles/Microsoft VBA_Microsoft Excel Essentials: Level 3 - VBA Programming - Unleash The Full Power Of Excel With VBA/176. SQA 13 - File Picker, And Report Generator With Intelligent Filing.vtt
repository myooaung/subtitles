00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Okay,

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.490
guys.

3
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.050
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.570
Questions answered video there this questions from Lisa.

5
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.130
Now Lisa has already cleverly written some super duper code that she runs on a monthly

6
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.490
reports monthly,

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.150
Obviously,

8
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.580
so she conformed at the reports exactly as she wants them.

9
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.290
But the problem lies in this.

10
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.950
She has two files that she has to extract.

11
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.420
Data from one is the full file with all of the history,

12
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.880
and one is the latest months data.

13
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.570
So presumably today it's no August.

14
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.640
So it will be July's data and in each of these sheets there 50 odd different tabs for the

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.580
various cost centres that she has to do.

16
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.640
So she has to open the two files Extract Cost Centre,

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.300
one from the first file cost centre,

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.440
one from the second file run her magic macro that generates the report.

19
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.550
But when she wants to do,

20
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.110
if she wants to have the code,

21
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.260
given the option to open the two down the two workbooks that she needs to work on,

22
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.220
so that is the full file and the latest day to set number two is getting excel to export

23
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.630
the sheets.

24
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.460
Depending on the cost centre owner into one of two formats either Excel or PdF,

25
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.550
and the third part is automatically saving that in an appropriate directory structure.

26
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.830
So for argument's sake,

27
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.580
let's say you had a folder called 2017 and inside there you had folders for January through

28
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.250
December.

29
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.800
Currently,

30
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.390
it's August.

31
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.590
You'd automatically say that in July because that's the last state.

32
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.000
So they're the three questions and they're posted in here.

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.590
One thing to note the V.

34
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.160
Look at that.

35
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.630
Look up.

36
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.960
She's here has a VB name of shit.

37
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.840
V look up,

38
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.070
and I'm just gonna run me through this code.

39
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.530
All of my variables have declared up here,

40
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.550
and he told you what they are,

41
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.600
Coach fully rend,

42
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.700
and you can find it in here.

43
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.650
So let's run through that.

44
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.560
This is the room in order.

45
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.400
I'm just gonna step through question one private sub question one.

46
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.860
This is where we want to pick the to file.

47
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.460
So I'm just gonna hit their fate.

48
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.030
We're going to go to this subroutine file picker butchered the file.

49
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.370
Pick up your code is way at the bottom here,

50
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.220
but it's not used in this particular thing.

51
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.930
So here's the butchered version filed.

52
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.810
Pickup butchered.

53
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.170
Now what we have is we have a variable.

54
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.480
Say what was clicked because when you pick a file,

55
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.980
you either picker file and click OK or you click.

56
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.850
Council one is 01 is minus one.

57
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.490
So that is,

58
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.130
just capture,

59
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.950
whether it's zero or minus one there because we want to files.

60
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.490
Begin iterated through the file picker twice,

61
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.050
So it's just going to say for X equals Wanted to.

62
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.880
Here is the file picker with,

63
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.450
and it's a with end with a flattened get that'll on No con gate on one screen.

64
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.320
It's the application fold dialogue MSO filed.

65
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.460
I like file picker at which,

66
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.240
although you may know what not know where it's called When you see it,

67
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.120
you'll instantly know it so and their multi select false.

68
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.680
I'll do a lecture on this particular this file picker and add that in a week also or in the

69
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.950
next week just so I can talk you through what this does.

70
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.350
But basically we're gonna clear the filters on.

71
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.150
We're gonna add a filter to say Excel files only,

72
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.680
and I'm going to show you what that does in a second but name is the but name.

73
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.250
Got it.

74
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.980
And here we need to do a bit of clever work.

75
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.160
The title.

76
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.760
Now,

77
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.610
if X equals one,

78
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.030
that is,

79
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.550
we're on our first passed through this loop.

80
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.720
If X equals one,

81
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.250
then the title is going to say please select the all months files.

82
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.240
That's gonna prompt the user to pick the right file if it equals two and you can see that

83
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.940
this equals one.

84
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.750
So it's gonna if it equals to the title's gonna say Please select the latest months file

85
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.690
that's going to guide the user Now the initial file path You can just change your minds and

86
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.380
see uses Alan Desktop demo waas clicked show.

87
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.870
Now this is where it's going to pop up on.

88
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.470
That is what it looks like.

89
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.080
So I am an almost fell in the latest months file at these you just empty files with 10 tab

90
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.510
sets.

91
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.350
That's all they are.

92
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.450
And now you can see here that the book says open.

93
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.100
But when I click all months,

94
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.570
it says got it.

95
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.070
So Okay,

96
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.390
Now the thing is,

97
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.060
when you when you use the the file picker,

98
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.110
it doesn't automatically open the file.

99
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.090
You don't have to tell you what you want to do with it.

100
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.950
So now we're going to use that.

101
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.890
Was it clicked?

102
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.990
Very vaulters I was.

103
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.910
It clicked or melt.

104
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.240
If they didn't click anything.

105
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.630
We just got a message box saying you didn't pick anything,

106
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.170
so I'm just gonna step through that.

107
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.490
So obviously we did pick something So the file name equals a selected item.

108
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.760
What?

109
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.250
We clicked and they were going to do the work books open.

110
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.510
So there is my all months file.

111
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.190
Just open.

112
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.740
You can see.

113
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.750
I've just got 10 tabs on Do all it does is it says this is I think that it's just in a one

114
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.750
.

115
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.900
What?

116
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.040
Accept what file?

117
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.710
It's called him What cost centre it is.

118
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.040
So now what we're gonna do,

119
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.960
we're going to read the name of the file that we've just opened into Variable One called

120
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.570
all months on one called latest month that waits like it's easier to work on a little later

121
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.700
on.

122
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.800
So if x equals one all months is going to equal the active workbook name so they go or

123
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.400
months start Excel s end with exclude through again X equals two now,

124
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.100
So we're just going to step through and you can see this neighborhood.

125
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.390
Say,

126
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.050
select the latest months file.

127
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.270
Select the latest months file on.

128
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.760
Got it.

129
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.430
Okay.

130
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.790
From bomb,

131
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.970
bomb,

132
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.150
bomb,

133
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.850
bomb bomb.

134
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.900
No,

135
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.520
on.

136
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.250
We've just captured the name of that that variable.

137
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.820
So that answers.

138
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.410
Question one.

139
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.230
That's how you can pick two fouls.

140
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.330
Question to now,

141
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.830
what we need to do with Question two is go through and pull the appropriate tabs from each

142
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.070
of those two files.

143
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.280
So eso that Lisa can run a code on it so instead straightforward this workbook activate.

144
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.050
That's a book within where the code lives.

145
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.990
My master equals this work,

146
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.820
but name again.

147
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.230
That's just so we can access it again easily.

148
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.880
Should look up.

149
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.590
Activate gives back to the sheet.

150
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.940
Hey,

151
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.690
to select.

152
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.320
Select.

153
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.710
No,

154
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.750
um,

155
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.950
that Aiken doing that cause that's,

156
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.250
uh,

157
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.760
that stuff code.

158
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.430
Okay,

159
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.780
right.

160
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.350
So here we go.

161
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.760
Here's a loop through all the cost centres.

162
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.970
Frank's equals.

163
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.920
Want to application worksheet function came to a range ace always conduce.

164
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.670
Can't Emily values we've got in a a subtract one for the titles,

165
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.760
so X equals 10 s.

166
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.960
O.

167
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.030
S.

168
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.500
We have 10 things I was gonna iterated 10 times.

169
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.030
My car center equals the actor sell value.

170
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.600
So that's gonna become cost centre.

171
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.630
1 may say format.

172
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.350
We're just going to use use this over here.

173
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.130
So my say format in the first instance is gonna be pdf.

174
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.380
Now what we're gonna do,

175
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.620
we say workbooks all months.

176
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.660
You remembered We captured the name of the old months Workbook to that variable dot cheats

177
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.160
my coughs center cost centre one in this instance.

178
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.570
Copy afterward.

179
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.930
Books,

180
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.750
My master.

181
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.410
This workbook Copy it after sheet one and then hit f eight and they go,

182
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.590
We get cost centre one now because both files have a sheet called Cough Centre.

183
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.420
One we're gonna need to rename it.

184
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.690
So I'm gonna do is rename it here and call it at the active she name Cost centre one Andi

185
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.310
All in this instance so f eight.

186
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.780
So let's become cost centre one.

187
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.420
Yep,

188
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.550
that's I have read that into the valuable my sheep one so we can access it easily later.

189
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.880
Never gonna do exactly the same for the other one.

190
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.480
So now we have cost centre.

191
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.450
One latest now saved file name.

192
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.770
This is where we're going to save it.

193
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.120
Lisa's code executes he at,

194
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.540
by the way,

195
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.090
where she generates a report.

196
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.000
So never going to go to the saved file name.

197
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.680
Now,

198
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.890
this is important,

199
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:45.800
because what we what we need to do is we're gonna have the date in the file name,

200
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.850
but we also we're gonna need to know where to save it.

201
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.550
You remember?

202
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.630
Talked about that direct directory structure.

203
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.610
If you had a fall to call 2017 and inside there you had January,

204
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.020
February,

205
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.400
March,

206
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.260
all that kind of stuff.

207
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.370
Well,

208
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.150
that's exactly what this is going to do.

209
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.990
So a couple of valuables in here,

210
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.750
my route So that's gonna be the first part of my directory.

211
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:05.970
See,

212
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.030
Ellen uses this sort demo backslash on.

213
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.590
Then we're gonna say month name month now,

214
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.370
because it's currently August.

215
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.750
So I'm guessing that you're not gonna get July's data until August.

216
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.020
So my month now minus one know if they're equals January,

217
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.320
Then my year and month is going to be called.

218
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:33.180
This is the rest of the path that's going to be cold slash 01 january slash and that is the

219
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:39.250
name of the folder that we can tag onto this part here that's going to file it in the

220
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.210
appropriate place.

221
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.420
So because it's August,

222
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.360
all of these air gonna just skip over.

223
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.740
And so we get here and it's gonna say are no less.

224
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.860
1 August less one is too light.

225
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.630
So therefore,

226
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:59.470
my year a month is gonna equal year now 2017 and that's going to give me the 2017 folder.

227
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.180
And then the rest of the directory path is going to be slash 07 July.

228
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.010
You'll see this in action in the second.

229
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.960
So there you go,

230
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.630
so we won't take what folder.

231
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.790
We should save it in.

232
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:15.080
There's a logical test to see if the last month that we reported almost December because if

233
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.000
it's December,

234
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.490
you don't want to call it 2017.

235
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.330
You want to call it the year before,

236
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.990
so we just have a slight adjustment here.

237
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.140
If it was December,

238
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.220
you subtract one from the So now we're gonna have,

239
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.910
um,

240
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.430
there we go.

241
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.410
Application display alerts equals false.

242
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.800
That's because when we delete these sheets when we're done with them,

243
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.600
we don't have these pop up saying issue.

244
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.980
So my say format is PD,

245
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:49.210
except my safe format equals PdF Then call save as pdf Now here at remember captured the

246
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.980
names of those two sheets sheet one and sheet to which of the things that leases just

247
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.960
remote code over.

248
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.630
We're going to select those.

249
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.790
And this is a butchered version of a recording Macro saving a pdf.

250
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:06.340
The only thing that I've changed is that and that and then this full path name,

251
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.150
which econo sees is what we've just built.

252
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.110
It's C users Ang Desktop Demo,

253
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.260
the 2017 bit,

254
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.170
which we built in the 07 July,

255
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.490
which we've built on the file name.

256
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.230
And then we're gonna tag on the end dot pdf exits a pdf,

257
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:27.890
it's F eight on in sub Delete that she delete that sheet ended Application display lights

258
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.350
turning back on ship.

259
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.800
Look up,

260
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.280
Select.

261
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.050
Go back here.

262
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.450
Move down a cell on.

263
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.030
Repeat.

264
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.240
I'm just gonna run that through to here.

265
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.570
So I think the next one was Excel Debug runs care sample.

266
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.880
Mom Got that?

267
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.350
Already?

268
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.310
Onda.

269
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.350
Exactly the same thing.

270
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:51.220
Recorded macro for save as Excel Andi Again you'll see from the recording macro version

271
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.720
below.

272
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.640
What I've changed.

273
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.760
I've called Sheet one and she took three.

274
00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:01.410
Just name them and have used the same file sake file safe path and name that we built.

275
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:08.200
But this are among an attack dot XLs x on it because it's gonna be an excel file closed the

276
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.910
file I've just saved.

277
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.790
Okay.

278
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.680
And so we want to do is stop there for a second.

279
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.850
That's Lisa's report builder.

280
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:21.750
Let's just make sure I closed the all months file on the latest months file.

281
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.250
Now,

282
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.000
let me take you to the folder where these live.

283
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.140
I'll put the so you can download them.

284
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.070
Just have a play with.

285
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.690
But this is This is the 2017 folder.

286
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.730
What I've done is obsessive per directory structure.

287
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.990
Now put the number of the month in front.

288
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.660
That way they run sequentially.

289
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.750
If you name them January,

290
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.070
February,

291
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.410
March,

292
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.830
April,

293
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.860
they'll arrange themselves alphabetically,

294
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.530
which,

295
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.820
which isn't very intuitive.

296
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.380
So July These are the two files that we've just created.

297
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.040
The actual budget the actual July,

298
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.260
which we build dynamically at runtime cost centre.

299
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.640
One cost sensitives at once.

300
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.770
Pdf ones on excel file.

301
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.790
A woman do is just one that coat you can see what it does.

302
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.440
So the end result Better delete Those tuks are stopped halfway through tonight.

303
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.640
Yes.

304
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.850
Tune iss Andi,

305
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.310
look up!

306
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.990
Right.

307
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.200
Let me just run that code.

308
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.210
No,

309
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:16.770
firstly,

310
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.900
notice There's nothing up my sleeve.

311
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.410
There is nothing in 07 July at all,

312
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.150
so I'm just gonna hit the report.

313
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.750
I want the all months file.

314
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.350
Got it.

315
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.490
I want the latest months file.

316
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.210
Got it.

317
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.040
It's gonna get bubble,

318
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.580
bobble bomb do its thing.

319
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.550
And at the end,

320
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.920
it's going to close those two newly opened workbooks.

321
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.300
Now,

322
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.580
obviously,

323
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:42.230
if you turn on the application screen update and then that's gonna run through in seconds

324
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.700
on back to that file.

325
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.950
So they go there.

326
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:51.520
We have all 10 reports created in just a few seconds under the appropriate format.

327
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.440
OK?

328
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.010
I hope that helps at the code is fully rammed.

329
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.200
Stepped through it.

330
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.500
If it's not clear from my descriptions,

331
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.450
that and hopefully it will make sense,

332
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.980
as always.

333
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.200
Any questions do let me know.

334
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.600
Have a great day and else that you in the next lecture
