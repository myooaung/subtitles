1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,880
guys,

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,040
um,

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,190
welcome back.

5
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,420
Now,

6
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,890
in your coding career,

7
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,340
mostly you're gonna be doing one off two things.

8
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,450
You are either going to be reading data or you're going to be writing data.

9
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,470
And that's what we're gonna have a look at in the next couple of lectures.

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,170
Okay,

11
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,600
up to now,

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,660
we've used the methods,

13
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,250
select and then we're gonna have a play with at the Value property.

14
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,240
So I've got a bunch of code in here.

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,610
I've just pasted it into our sub basics test.

16
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,890
Testing this on what we're going to do is work with the range A one object.

17
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,060
Now,

18
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,210
just a note on the hierarchy here.

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,320
I haven't specified which sheet or which workbook.

20
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,050
So we are working with whatever we are looking at.

21
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,910
That is the active sheet.

22
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,580
So that's this one just here.

23
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,460
So what we're gonna do is say,

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,280
with range a warm we are going to set its value to hello world on notice that because this

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,270
is text,

26
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,020
we have enclosed it in quotes before and after.

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,590
Okay,

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,840
so let's just hit f eight and step through this coat.

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Notice what happens over here in excel they go range a $1 value.

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,800
Property has been set to Hallow World.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,790
How cool is that?

32
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,610
Now?

33
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:21,360
We can also write the same text to multiple cells all at once by using the range and

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,210
specifying the range here,

35
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,960
separated by Coghlan's.

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,810
So the game,

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,670
when they hit their fate,

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,700
notice what happens over here in Excel.

39
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,690
Boom!

40
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,480
They go.

41
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,390
We get that same text populated to all the cells we specified in that range.

42
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,040
Now,

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,900
equally,

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,520
we don't have to use the range object we can use.

45
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,730
The cells object,

46
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,190
so it's exactly the same.

47
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,670
Structure sells 30 most down one column across a 13 by any other name.

48
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,910
The daughter value property is now going to say this is a 30.

49
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,090
You know,

50
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,060
when I hit f eight,

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,940
they go on pointing.

52
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,170
You can't see that.

53
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,570
There you go.

54
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,330
So in cell A 13 we now have this text.

55
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,390
Now here's the thing to note.

56
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,460
If you're entering Texas,

57
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,790
I said just a second ago,

58
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,620
you have to enclose in quotes if you're entering a number.

59
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,540
Not so.

60
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,770
If you're entering a number,

61
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,850
you can literally just write the number,

62
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,550
So range a $1 value.

63
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,820
1234 When they hit that,

64
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,730
you can see the A one has changed toe.

65
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,090
1234 as a number.

66
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,150
Okay,

67
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,980
Now observing the hierarchy You'll remember a couple of lectures ago that we renamed the

68
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,950
visual basic name off sheet to hear to my second sheet.

69
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,180
So what we're gonna do here is specify my second sheet range.

70
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,490
A $1 value.

71
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,440
Will say I did this from Sheet one actually did it from scratch.

72
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,750
So let's come over here,

73
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,300
Hitter Fate.

74
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Nothing's happened here because we've said it's in my second sheet.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
When I come back,

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,690
Here they go.

77
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,150
I did this from sheet one.

78
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,430
Now,

79
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,700
Not only that,

80
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,480
we're gonna observe the hierarchy again.

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,270
Just a quick note on this.

82
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,750
This code here,

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,110
you can see that I have dot space underscore,

84
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,380
and then the text goes onto another line.

85
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,060
If you have a really long line of code,

86
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,750
you can literally just hit space.

87
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,100
Underscore Hit.

88
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,880
Enter your code will still execute as a single line of code.

89
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,940
It just makes it a little bit easier to read.

90
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,130
So here we are,

91
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,740
specifying workbooks one which is this one here groups,

92
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,540
which is this one here sheet,

93
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,150
too.

94
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,900
And I'm gonna come back to sheet one.

95
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,410
So there's nothing in cheat to.

96
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,490
I am picking sheet one and coming back to my macro book.

97
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,110
So here,

98
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,330
I'm gonna say workbooks Book one,

99
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,650
which is the other workbook sheets to which isn't the one that we could see because we just

100
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,180
flip back to sheet one ranger You want to stop,

101
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,490
Value equals.

102
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,060
I did this from another workbook.

103
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
When I hear that right,

104
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,790
Boom,

105
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,320
Let's go back here.

106
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,870
She want his workbook?

107
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,920
One She too.

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,870
I give this from another workbook.

109
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,930
How clever is that?

110
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,090
Now you'll remember.

111
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,200
I mentioned a couple of lectures ago that if you want to select another workbook,

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,490
you must activate it first.

113
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,380
That is not true.

114
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,490
If you just want to read or write data or make changes in another workbook only if you want

115
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,490
to select it,

116
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,100
that is.

117
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,110
You want to see the thing.

118
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,350
So if you're reading and writing data,

119
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,920
this structure here works perfectly.

120
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,500
OK,

121
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,430
Now what we're gonna do is have a look.

122
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,250
It's a variable now.

123
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,990
All of variable is is a little units of memory that we can allocate a value to now in the

124
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,420
next section recover variables in debt.

125
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,040
But for now,

126
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,970
all you need to know is a variable is a little unit of memory that we're going to store

127
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,900
something in on what we're going to store in my first variable.

128
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,440
That's its name is the text Wonder.

129
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,150
Lovely day.

130
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,000
So when I hit enter this tax.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,470
There's no been loaded into this variable here.

132
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,980
My first variable no holds this text.

133
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,190
And now what I could do with it is right that to a cell.

134
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,250
So notice here.

135
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,920
This is like this from sheet one.

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,820
But when I hit f 81 a lovely name.

137
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,450
Okay,

138
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,180
so now you know how to write data to cells.

139
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,650
To ranges of cells,

140
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,400
two cells on a different worksheet and even to cells in a different workbook without even

141
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,080
having to activate and select them first.

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Okay,

143
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
I'll see you in the next lecture.
