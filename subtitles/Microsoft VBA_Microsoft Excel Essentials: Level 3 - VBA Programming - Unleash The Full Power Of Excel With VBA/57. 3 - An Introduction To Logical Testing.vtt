00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Okay,

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.900
guys.

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.770
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.230
Now,

5
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.640
you have variables under your belt and we've had a look at Lupin.

6
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.570
So you understand what,

7
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.070
Dallas?

8
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.810
This next section we're going to incorporate that looping and that variable knowledge that

9
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.180
you now have on we're gonna add to it.

10
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.680
Logical testing.

11
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.140
Now,

12
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.110
in this lecture,

13
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.280
you will find a downloadable resource.

14
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.680
It is next cell file called logical testing dot x l s X On on that file,

15
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.210
there will be a tab here called Get your code here on when you download it,

16
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.380
there'll be loads and loads of code in there.

17
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.180
Just copy all of that code,

18
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.970
hits Olsen F 11 in certain module and paste all the code into that module,

19
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.790
and then you'll be able to follow along.

20
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.290
So why would you want to use logical testing?

21
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.740
Well,

22
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.260
we have all of this state here,

23
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.650
which is a small data sample,

24
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.700
just 50 people.

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.960
But it could be that we want to quickly identify anyone who's male or anyone who's female.

26
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.880
Now I know because we could just use the filters or we could say,

27
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.240
actually,

28
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.730
we want to identify anyone who is female Between the ages off let me guess.

29
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.900
40 and 47.

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.510
Andi also has green eyes.

31
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.450
Now when you have all of those parameters,

32
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.290
it's gonna get very messy to do with filters.

33
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.630
And you're also having to click here and there and everywhere,

34
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.940
and it's it's a mess,

35
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.160
but if you do it in code,

36
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.920
it's very,

37
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.310
very simple to do.

38
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.090
Okay,

39
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.580
so without further ado,

40
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.950
let's crack on and have a look at the first logical test,

41
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.350
which is a simple single if test also you in the next lecture.
