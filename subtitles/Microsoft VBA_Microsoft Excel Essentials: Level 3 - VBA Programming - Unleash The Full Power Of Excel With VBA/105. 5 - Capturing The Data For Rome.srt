1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Okay,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,860
guys on Welcome back,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,160
right.

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,080
Let's have a look at how we get this done.

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,520
Now,

6
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,510
you may be aware that you can pull data from a Web source using Excel on.

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,090
What we're gonna do is we're gonna get three.

8
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,090
Web queer is pulling data for each of the three countries in our charts.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,210
They are Rome,

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,300
Cancun on London.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,830
Obviously,

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,020
you can do whatever you want with this,

13
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,080
but this is just for the purposes of demonstration.

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,690
There wanna have Here is a friend sheet called sheet one.

15
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:37,160
The data sheet is where will be storing our data queries on renamed it the VB name as shirt

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,860
data.

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,900
So back to hear what we're going to do to begin with is we're gonna go to a website and the

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,230
website we're gonna look at is this one here,

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,400
which is time in date dot com and here you can see that I have when they're Italy,

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,740
Rome e X t.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,760
And that is going to give us the data for room.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,150
So I'm gonna do for now.

23
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,590
Copy the name of that website,

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,970
the address of that website,

25
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,260
starting new macro recording,

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,570
and I'm gonna call this Rome because that's what we're going to be querian And from here,

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm gonna come up to the data tab and I'm gonna hit from web and this window is gonna open

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,150
up.

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,570
Now,

30
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,430
this is essentially a very,

31
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,280
very old Internet explorer that's just available for doing web queries,

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,990
and I've pasted the address in there.

33
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,220
I'm gonna git go now.

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm gonna drag this out a little bit,

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
and you can see you right up the top here.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,550
It says next to the tables you want to select?

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,540
Sorry it.

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,250
Click this little image next to the tables you want to select and then click import.

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:49,000
So I'm gonna roll down here and while actually wants to import is this particular table

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,900
just here?

41
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,600
So I'm just gonna hit the little arrow button,

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,360
which exactly what it says here,

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,450
I'm gonna select import,

44
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,700
and now it's gonna ask me where do or want to import it,

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,020
too.

46
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,510
I'm just going to click cell a one on our data shooting hit.

47
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,250
Okay,

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,090
now,

49
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,140
because this is retrieving data from a website which we can see down here,

50
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,070
it is gonna take about 15 or 20 seconds to pull all the data back.

51
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,340
But what we're going to do is,

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,710
once the date is pulled back,

53
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,820
we'll have a quick sneak a peek at the code.

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,330
Okay,

55
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,820
here's Aled,

56
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,350
the data,

57
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,930
and I'm scrolling,

58
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,790
and I probably shouldn't be.

59
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,990
CSI's gonna recall that.

60
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,950
So I'm just going to stop recording.

61
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,980
There we go on.

62
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm just gonna size that in a little bit and we're gonna have a look at that data.

63
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,020
And essentially,

64
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,770
that is the table that we just saw on this website just here.

65
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,300
This particular table right here.

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,350
Okay,

67
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,330
so that's going to have a look at that code old NFL Levin modules.

68
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,930
DoubleClick Number one on that.

69
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,360
Here is the code.

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,680
Now just a four.

71
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,200
Warn you.

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,540
Occasionally,

73
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,400
when you get a script era,

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,790
you'll have a little message box pop up that says,

75
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,580
Do you want to continue running this script now?

76
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,090
If you say yes,

77
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,720
you'll be able to continue warning.

78
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,430
You may get asked this question thousands of times.

79
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,850
I know when I originally wrote this piece of code,

80
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,200
I was getting the script warning.

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,560
For some reason,

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
it didn't happen just now.

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,590
But the way to get around that when you play your code back in all of the code,

84
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,350
you'll see this line here.

85
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,620
Command type equals zero.

86
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,850
Just realm that out because that will stop the script areas.

87
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,150
And I'm just gonna add a little note in there to say that so you'll remember it.

88
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,370
So that stops the script.

89
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,550
Harris on The next thing that we need to change is this particular line here where it says

90
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,010
refresh style.

91
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,910
And currently,

92
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,560
by default,

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,710
it says excel,

94
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,420
insert delete cells on what we actually want.

95
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,080
That to say which I stole from the Microsoft website was Excel overwrite,

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,070
sells other ways,

97
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,820
just keeps dropping new data in front of the old data.

98
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,950
You end up with a spreadsheet filled with millions of bits of data.

99
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,070
Okay,

100
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,400
so that was my active window scroll and then delete that.

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,820
And in the next lecture,

102
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,810
we're gonna have a look at Butcher in this code to run for Cancun on London,

103
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,360
and we'll have a look at the little bits of code that we're going to need to modify to do

104
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,610
that.

105
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,290
Okay,

106
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,750
I'll see you in the next lecture
