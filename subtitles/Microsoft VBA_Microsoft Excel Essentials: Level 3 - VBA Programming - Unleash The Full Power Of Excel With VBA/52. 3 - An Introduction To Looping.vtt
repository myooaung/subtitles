00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.650
guys.

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.850
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.810
Next,

5
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.440
we're going to be having a look at looping.

6
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.840
And to that end,

7
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.170
I have added a looping section or looping tab to your my macro book.

8
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.350
What we going to do?

9
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.860
Notes.

10
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.440
At the moment,

11
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600
we've got most of the basics covered in here.

12
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.500
I'm just going to change the name of that module.

13
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.640
Two more basics.

14
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.530
On that way you'll easily be able to find it.

15
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.100
And I'm going to insert a new module and call that Mont Looping.

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.220
Now you may be wondering why you need to use loops.

17
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.340
While it's an absolute staple in any programmers.

18
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.050
Talk it.

19
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.450
And it could be if we take this particular data here,

20
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.400
we want to highlight every alternative cell.

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.880
Or it could be that we want to loop through all this data and find the first value that's

22
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.090
greater than 31 for example on then perform some other code on it.

23
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.840
So without further ado,

24
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.450
let's move on to next lecture.

25
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.180
We're gonna have a look at our first loop type,

26
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.050
which is the do loop.

27
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.700
OK,

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.150
I'll see you in the next lecture
