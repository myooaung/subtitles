1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:02,730
guys.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,970
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,470
Now,

5
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,570
from this lecture,

6
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,070
you'll find a downloadable resource.

7
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:14,320
And that is an excel file called email automation dot x l s X.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,740
And in there you're going to find us file.

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,190
That looks pretty much like this.

10
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,370
A tab here that say's get your code here.

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,010
So what we're going to do in this section is look a automating outlook so you can send an

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,090
email campaign from the push of a button.

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,670
Now,

14
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,750
what we have in this particular demonstration is we have an amazing sunscreen product that

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,610
we want to sell to people with blond hair.

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,970
So here we have our data set,

17
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,300
which I know you've seen before.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,830
We only have about 50 people in there,

19
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,250
but we have some people with blunt hat,

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,650
and they are the people that we want to send our email too.

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,820
So I'm just gonna flip to outlook so,

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,090
you know,

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,020
there's no trickery.

24
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,930
I'm just gonna close that bet so you can see that outlook has no e mails in it.

25
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,280
So won't do is press the button on the flip back to outlook on,

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,620
depending on how fast my Internet connection is any second.

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:07,940
Now,

28
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,520
all of our e mails from a email routine should start dropping into our in box now,

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,630
what will weight him?

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,820
Perhaps I'm not going to speak.

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,490
While that happens.

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,130
Chris is gonna keep making a noise.

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,660
But here we go.

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,270
Everyone with blunt hair in our list is now receiving an email.

35
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,240
Obviously all the email addresses of Just Excel essentials at gmail dot com.

36
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,170
So everything is going to come to me.

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,450
But you can see if we look here.

38
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,200
The 1st 1 is to Luca,

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,650
and we have our wonderfully tailored message here.

40
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,160
The next one is to Leo on the next one is tamale.

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,720
So it's actually extracting their first name so we can personalize our email and they go,

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,430
The routine is complete there,

43
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,870
Just in case You ever hear these terms?

44
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,510
There are two ways that you can automate.

45
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,350
Outlook from excel using B B A.

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,540
You can either use early binding or you can use late binding.

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,420
We're gonna use late binding and I only ever use late binding,

48
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,630
early binding.

49
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,640
There are some advantages in that it slightly easier to code.

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,420
The major disadvantages is that you have to set a reference to the outlook library in your

51
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,870
visual basic applications editor.

52
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,330
Now,

53
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:30,690
that is not a problem whatsoever providing that the code on the spreadsheet is always run

54
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,710
from your machine.

55
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,200
If you give it to your body when they press the button,

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
it will not work.

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,770
So need gonna have to go to their machine.

58
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,010
And you're gonna have to go into then visual basic editor and set the reference to the

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,250
outlook object library.

60
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,850
And if they pass it on to someone on the other side of the department and you're gonna have

61
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,620
to go to their machine and do the same so literally,

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,390
if your programs ever gonna have to be used by multiple people use late binding I always do

63
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,330
on it's a jolly good idea that you always do too.

64
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,050
Okay.

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,250
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at how that works.

66
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,410
I'll see you in the next life
