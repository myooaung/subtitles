1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Okay,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,690
guys.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,110
And welcome to this section.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,900
Now we're going to use as a base for this particular project the report that we created

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,650
little earlier.

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,160
So this particular one is the monthly report for January 2016 in the northern region on

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,290
this report is what we're going to use to generate our power point presentation.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,340
So let's have a look at the base code on this.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,000
Is it just here.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,490
Now,

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,070
with this,

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,530
you're gonna be able to do pretty much most things that you can imagine with a power point

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,380
presentation.

14
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,960
So just as we did with word and just did without,

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,320
look,

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,150
we're going to be used in the late binding.

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,770
That is,

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,970
that you'll be able to transfer the file to other computers and the code will still work

19
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,670
perfectly.

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,270
So what we're gonna have to do?

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,130
We set up three objects,

22
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,730
Dimension.

23
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,850
Three objects were gonna have PP app.

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,610
I've just used pp to represent power points,

25
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,500
but obviously you can call these whenever you want,

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,450
So I have PowerPoint app,

27
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,910
PP apples and objects,

28
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,560
pp presentation.

29
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,630
That is the presentation object within power.

30
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,950
Point on.

31
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,070
Be below that.

32
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,750
We have PP slide and they will be the slides within the presentation.

33
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,460
Okay,

34
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,060
Now we're going to create or open a power PowerPoint application used in the set peopie app

35
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,060
.

36
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,110
Create object.

37
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,580
PowerPoint application to add a new presentation will use the code set PEOPIE presentation

38
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,990
equals PP app.

39
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:29,030
Just here dot presentations dot ad and that will give us a new presentation within our new

40
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,960
instance off power points on.

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,580
Finally,

42
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,080
we're gonna make it visible.

43
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,570
So this codes broken it up into different sections and the different sections relate to the

44
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,290
different things and the different elements that can use within PowerPoint.

45
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,940
So,

46
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,240
too,

47
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,290
are they slide.

48
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,700
You will use this code set peopie slide equals pp presentation,

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,520
all of which have declared above adult slides dot ad And this is the only bit that will

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,120
vary.

51
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,720
The index number is the position off the slide within the slide show,

52
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,900
so index number one will be the first slide index Number two will be the second and so on.

53
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,320
And then the other thing is the layout.

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,260
No layout.

55
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:08,740
11

56
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,710
If you look down this list in the realms here is title only.

57
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,310
If you use lay at one,

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,360
you will have a title at the top on a subtitle at the bottom and so on and so forth.

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,310
Through all these leather,

60
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:27,470
11 pre defined layouts numbered one through 11 from enough anything beyond level beyond 11

61
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,470
.

62
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:27,660
So,

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,210
she said,

64
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,420
layout 12.

65
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,150
It will become a custom layout,

66
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,450
which essentially is a blank slowed,

67
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,120
to which you can add images or text,

68
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,750
and we'll look at that in just a second.

69
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,310
Okay,

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,320
so adding text,

71
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,170
we have a few different ways of doing this.

72
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,860
We can use the name off the text rain as we did in this example,

73
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,840
or as we would in this example just here.

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,090
So it's a PP slide dot shapes title,

75
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,090
which refers to the title text frame on.

76
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,240
We would use this particular line of code PP slide dark shapes up titled Doc Tex Rain.

77
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,450
Very complicated,

78
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,890
but basically at the end.

79
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,250
Whatever is in the quotes is what the text that will appear within that frame or

80
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,980
alternatively,

81
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,010
you can just reference.

82
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,820
Arrange on your spreadsheet.

83
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,510
Obviously,

84
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,300
if you have more than one sheet on,

85
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,240
do you are working on a different sheet?

86
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,390
Be sure to remember the hierarchy and specified that she just here now.

87
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,460
The other way we can do this is we can use the index number off the shape,

88
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,270
as you can see in these three lines of code just here on basically,

89
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,850
the index numbers refer to the numbers off the objects from left to right from top to

90
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,320
bottom.

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,700
So if you have a title frame at the top on a subtitle frame below,

92
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,010
title frame is Index one,

93
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,660
so that would be shapes one on the subtitle frame would be shapes to Okay,

94
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,880
we'll explore this as we go through the code on now.

95
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,090
Teoh a new bullet point to a text box.

96
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,840
We will use the VB new line,

97
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,590
so if you have a few lines of text,

98
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,420
but you want to be separated by bullets,

99
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,350
always add VB new line between the lines of text and that will force a new bullet point.

100
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,860
Okay,

101
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,870
formatting texts.

102
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,670
Basically,

103
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,030
it's very race simple.

104
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,310
This is the format,

105
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,540
PP slide dot shapes on the index number Text framed up Tex ranged outfront on name equals

106
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,000
times or don't fund duck.

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,050
Call recalls whatever color you want dot fund dot size whatever size you want,

108
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,090
Andi Italic or bold or whatever you want.

109
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,570
So very straightforward stuff.

110
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,520
So this is literally just plug and play.

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,700
Just copy this and paste in.

112
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,860
No,

113
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,130
Obviously,

114
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,360
if you want to change a few the different formats,

115
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,050
you can wrap that in a with end with as we have just here.

116
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,380
Now we have a couple of ways of aligning text.

117
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,910
We can use the MSO,

118
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,870
which is the Microsoft Office Align right which will align the text of the rightful enough

119
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,950
mso alain left which will firmly enough behind to left and M s align center or mso alone

120
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,040
center and that will send to your text if you want to on a text box.

121
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,750
This is how you do it,

122
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,090
you say PP app dot active presentation dot Slade's Whenever the index on review Osleidys,

123
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,810
don't shape start add text box one left,

124
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,980
100 top 100 or whatever value you want with 100 on height 50 and you can change these

125
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,590
values.

126
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,970
One thing to knows.

127
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:32,680
These values are expressed in points and you will notice here in the comments position of

128
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,560
sizes are in points so one inch equal 72 points.

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,440
One centimeter equals 28.346 points.

130
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,650
But I have a very clever way of coping with that.

131
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,020
So this is basically the text adding attacks box.

132
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,510
Now this number one here basically means that the text is going to be the right way up.

133
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,970
If you change this to a to the Texas rotated counterclockwise to change it to three,

134
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,360
the Texas rotated clockwise.

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,840
Now,

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,350
if you want to delete a shape,

137
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,280
just refer to it,

138
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,520
bites index number and use the code.

139
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,570
People slide dark shapes in next number.

140
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,200
Dr Lee.

141
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,050
OK,

142
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,670
there were them.

143
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,660
Two images.

144
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,000
Now we have a few different ways of adding images we can paste.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,730
Arrange as a picture a bit map on what we'll do.

146
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:27,980
We'll specify what we want to copy from our Ex Felt Excel spreadsheets hit dot copy picture

147
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,200
appearance equals X l screen format Excel picture on,

148
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,730
then to pace will just specified slide PP slide duck shapes duck paste on that will paste

149
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,010
it in the dead center.

150
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,520
Now,

151
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,740
if we want to paste an object such as a pie chart,

152
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,770
we have a pie chart on our report.

153
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,460
We were used this terminology sheets sheet one dot chart objects the name of the objects

154
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,930
dot chart doctor.

155
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,180
Copy Picture on,

156
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,990
then to paste it,

157
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,190
use the PP slide that shape stop paste.

158
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,870
Okay,

159
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,320
now there is another way of doing this,

160
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,180
but it does retain some of the data from the spreadsheet.

161
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,110
So personally,

162
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,300
unless you want them to be able to access the data that the presentation came from,

163
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,950
I would avoid using this.

164
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,310
But should you need it?

165
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,280
This is the code to do it Now.

166
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,970
Finally,

167
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,280
we can add a saved image,

168
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,240
so they picked a J peg or a gift for something that we have on our own computer on.

169
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,400
This is the code we need to use for that now.

170
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,940
Obviously where?

171
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,030
Here I have my my use that Alan Pictures logo J fig.

172
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,420
You will put your own path in your own image in there and again.

173
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,620
These are expressed in points again,

174
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,990
re sizing images to change the size of an image.

175
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,380
What we'll do is we'll say PP abduct active window dot selection dot shape range Height

176
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,180
equals whenever it is in points.

177
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,480
But I have a clever way again.

178
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:58,980
Ran that or with now you don't have to do both because it will maintain the aspect ratio.

179
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,450
So you only need to change height or wits and everything is good from that.

180
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,260
Okay,

181
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,900
I've just realised couldn't spell position.

182
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,650
And Okay,

183
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,780
so position in images.

184
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,510
Note that there is a slight unusual way This is expressed position.

185
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,130
Image use pp apt,

186
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,860
Attractive window.

187
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,900
That selection Obviously this will be with the active shape,

188
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,840
shape Ranger line mso align left It's on.

189
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,740
There is an s at the end so we can align Left rights,

190
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,660
middles centers,

191
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,810
tops or bottoms Eso notice it's not left right middle.

192
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,690
It's left,

193
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,900
sir Within s at the end.

194
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,840
And all of these have left or all of these Haven't s at the end.

195
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,500
Okay,

196
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,600
Finally we have the align image using points and then this is position your image precisely

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:47,600
.

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,410
But don't worry,

199
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,230
I have a very clever way of doing that too.

200
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,630
Okay.

201
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,880
And then finally we have to destroy the object valuables in the reverse order in which we

202
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,720
created them.

203
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,510
So we created PP up first.

204
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,350
So that's the last one to be destroyed,

205
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,070
PP.

206
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,360
Presentations second.

207
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,510
So that's the last but one to be destroyed.

208
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,750
And the last thing we created and the first thing we destroy is the PP slide.

209
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,980
Okay?

210
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,830
I don't expect to remember all the lamp.

211
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,890
What we're gonna do is put this together like Lego and build our presentation.

212
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,420
Okay,

213
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,180
I'll see you in the next lecture.

214
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,150
Thanks very much.
