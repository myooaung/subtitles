00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
Okay,

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:02.560
guys,

3
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.460
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.800
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.370
Lecture.

6
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.210
Now that there is a particularly interesting element in this question,

7
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.670
basically revolves around a project tracker on most of this is fairly static.

8
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.440
So what we have is a star data status Project name could be anything who the owner of the

9
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.220
project is.

10
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.060
And here is where the interesting part comes.

11
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.290
What we want to do from whichever cell we are in is automatically go to the commentary

12
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.760
column,

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.150
which is column E.

14
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.810
And if there is no data in there,

15
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.150
what we want to do is insert the current date space dash space.

16
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.180
Andi,

17
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.710
I'll come back to the interest in fast in just a second,

18
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.240
so that's what we want to do if it's blank if it isn't blank.

19
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.290
What we want to do is keep on every authority in their return a new line and then insert a

20
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.050
date with a space and a dash and a space.

21
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.540
Now,

22
00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.050
so far,

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.550
so good.

24
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.230
All of those things we've already covered in the course.

25
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.820
But here's the interesting thing that we haven't covered in the course.

26
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.390
What we want to do is simulate hitting F two.

27
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.180
So if I took this 1st 1 here,

28
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.350
what I could do drag the formula bar down.

29
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.580
It's Olson.

30
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.100
Enter his holes.

31
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.080
Andi Coolum on hits based our space.

32
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.820
And there you go.

33
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.400
My cursor is blinking immediately where I want to start.

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.070
Type in the text on That's the interesting part.

35
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.270
What we want to do.

36
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.350
We already know how to select to sell.

37
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.650
But we have not yet looked at simulating the F keys.

38
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.190
So by hitting f to weaken automatically,

39
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.760
just begin type in whatever our common tree should say.

40
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.060
So that's what we're gonna have.

41
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.270
Look at in this,

42
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.500
like,

43
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.780
chap.

44
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.750
Now what I'm gonna do,

45
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.620
I'm gonna shrink the formula bar back down because that looks absolutely awful like that.

46
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.800
Never.

47
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.530
Go on.

48
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.190
I'm just going tab over so we can just see columns D and E.

49
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.180
Andi,

50
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.880
let me shrink.

51
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.570
Excel them.

52
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.630
Okay,

53
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.240
so here we go.

54
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.970
Here we here,

55
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.860
we have stamped me on that is tied to this particular sub here.

56
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.810
So we have two flavors we have to see.

57
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.180
Is there anything in the commentary section off the cell that were on on the row of the

58
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.990
cell that were on or is there not?

59
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.380
So this is just dead.

60
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.670
Straightforward logical tests were going to say if the range open brackets open quotes E.

61
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.980
It is always going to be column E because that's where the common tree lives.

62
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.000
But the row number is dynamic,

63
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.340
and that is based on whatever cell is currently selected.

64
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.120
So we're going to say E Andi the active cell DOT wrote and that is going to give us the row

65
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.950
of the currently selected cell.

66
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.080
So now we're going to get from whichever column where in two columns eso if Range E and the

67
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.400
active sold up row don't value equal nothing,

68
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.150
then no se else,

69
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.810
I'm gonna say.

70
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.340
And if someone if I get to do it otherwise,

71
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.050
OK,

72
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.750
so if it is blank are requirement is very straightforward.

73
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.420
What we want to do You say range E on the active cell row equals and we wanted to say date

74
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.090
Andi quotes space dash space.

75
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.840
So far,

76
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.400
so good.

77
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.450
Now if it isn't,

78
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.540
if it isn't blank,

79
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.340
that is like this one here already has something in it.

80
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.090
What we want to do is say almost the same thing.

81
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.930
I was going to put that in.

82
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.580
What I can say is range E and neck to sell value dot value equals the same again.

83
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.550
So arrange a active seldom value equals range a active cell duck value.

84
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.370
In fact,

85
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.750
I'm gonna put the underscore where we're gonna put that over here equals going to school.

86
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:06.670
So range E active value equals whenever is currently in there on d V would be be new line.

87
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.880
That's essentially the VB control at the VB command for bolt and enter and whips Plot stuff

88
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.880
.

89
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.880
Andi the date.

90
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.140
So let me just put that on the new line as well.

91
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.470
So if it's blank,

92
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.620
just insert the date on the space.

93
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.390
That space,

94
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.450
if it isn't blank then return more is ever currently in their Onda new line on the space

95
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.410
dash space.

96
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.760
So it's just test that out.

97
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.810
So they go,

98
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.630
we can see that that's been out there.

99
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.480
And if I'm over here and I hit stamp me the new dates Al it in here now.

100
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.120
So far,

101
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.750
so good.

102
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.930
We've successfully managed Teoh,

103
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.350
I'm gonna have to go in delete all that nowhere to go way go.

104
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.320
So so far so good.

105
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.090
Now we can select the cell eso what we could say.

106
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.460
Let's just copy that again.

107
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.040
So we want that there.

108
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.870
And at the very end,

109
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.950
we want to be able to select set whips and I havent finished,

110
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.550
so dot select and hit Enter on.

111
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.730
No,

112
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.370
If I'm over here and they hits,

113
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.850
that's a poor example.

114
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.720
Will need to be is in this one so I can hit stamp me a little on our date in there,

115
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.570
But still,

116
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.550
we don't have that blinking cursor.

117
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.460
We know we can get it by pressing F two on a keyboard in Excel,

118
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.340
but it's what we wanted to do is do that automatically encode.

119
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.070
So what we're going to do after we've selected here is we're going to use something we

120
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.080
haven't seen before,

121
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.850
and that is called the application.

122
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.190
Send keys.

123
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.780
Now here's a word of warning.

124
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.420
If you test this code in the visual basic editor,

125
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.820
when you use applications,

126
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.800
send keys.

127
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.950
It will assume the send keys is relating to the visual basic editor on DNA not to excel.

128
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.320
So when you test the code in the VB,

129
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.540
it won't work correctly.

130
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.180
But when you test the code in Excel.

131
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.850
It will.

132
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.080
When you've done this,

133
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.260
just have a look and you'll see exactly what I mean.

134
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.230
So what we have to do with application saying keys is we're going to hit quotes.

135
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.220
We're going to hit curly brackets on.

136
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.800
What we want to simulate is F two ongoing close curly brackets,

137
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.230
and we're gonna closed quotes on DNA.

138
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.010
Now look what happens over here.

139
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.730
If I am on this cell,

140
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.500
let me move.

141
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.800
Ever.

142
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.750
If I'm on this,

143
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.050
only it stumped me.

144
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.510
A new date is automatically added on Our curse is immediately they're allowing us to carry

145
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.310
on typing.

146
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.480
But if I am,

147
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.060
um,

148
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.210
let's use the same cell again,

149
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.830
cause now we have something in there.

150
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.460
Now if we clicked it,

151
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.340
it immediately goes as New line and again puts Akerson at the insurgent point on on an eso

152
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.440
and literally let me this cut this code works.

153
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.670
Now I'll ram that whips.

154
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.450
I'll run that before you download it.

155
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.340
Just drag this out and collapse.

156
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.290
That's up so I can be here,

157
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.510
say,

158
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.240
for argument sake,

159
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.650
I'm here in cell.

160
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.020
A five hit the button and automatically a new line has been led to the bottom of their

161
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.060
snake and happily type my commentary in Andi.

162
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.490
I could be here and hit it and automatically I could just start typing my commentary and

163
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.850
and that's how you do it.

164
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.100
So applications send keys.

165
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.360
That's the way to simulate the keyboard shortcuts,

166
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.740
the F keys and a bunch of others using your code in VB A.

167
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.080
Okay,

168
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.200
Hope you enjoyed that.

169
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.600
Ondas.

170
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.840
Always any questions.

171
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.790
Just let me know and I'll be happy to help.

172
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.670
Have a great day.
