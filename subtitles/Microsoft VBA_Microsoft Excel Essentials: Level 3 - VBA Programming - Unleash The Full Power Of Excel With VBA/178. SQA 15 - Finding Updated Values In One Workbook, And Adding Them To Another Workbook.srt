1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Okay,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,110
guys.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,690
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,380
Questions answered on This is a question from shore.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,520
Now,

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,160
what Sean has is to files are identical in structure.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,730
Now,

8
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,300
this date is completely made up.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,600
But what we have in Sean source file is sheet one,

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,420
she to sheet three and sheep four.

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,310
Sean assures me it doesn't matter what the day to say is on.

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,410
We have another file,

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,330
both of which you can download called Sean Destination file on the game.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,230
We have sheet one sheet to sheet three and sheep.

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,220
For now,

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,250
the structure in each of the files is absolutely identical.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,160
Now,

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,780
the object of the exercise is to loop through each of the sheets in the source file and

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,430
find anything that's new or changed.

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,520
And if it finds something that's new or changed,

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,070
it wants to take that entire row of data that entire line of data on write it to the

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,240
corresponding sheet in the destination file.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,000
Now,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,230
this is actually quite straightforward thing to do.

25
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,550
What we have are essentially two loops.

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,340
We have an outer loop that's gonna loop through each of the sheets in turn on and in the in

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,240
that outer loop.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,270
What we're gonna do is we're gonna write a concomitant nation Formula two column E just

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,480
here and all the concatenation formula is going to say that on that on that on that and

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,760
right,

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,570
the value in there that's gonna build back in Katyn ation string.

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,070
Now we're going to do that in Leak source file,

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,990
and we're also going to do it in the destination file,

34
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,040
then back in the source file a column f here.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,770
What we're going to do is look for a match of this.

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,750
Can Katyn ated value in this can Katyn ated value column just here.

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,850
So if it finds a match,

38
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,900
it's going to return the position off that can Katyn ated match in column E in the

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,610
destination for their file.

40
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,050
Now,

41
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,030
if it finds a match we wanted just move over it.

42
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,510
What we want to do is if you find something that is not a match,

43
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:13,470
that is either one of the current values that as that's had something added to it.

44
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,520
So I'm just going to add my name in there,

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,750
so that will be a mismatch.

46
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,350
What we're gonna do is at an error trapped.

47
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,840
That says,

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,210
actually,

49
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,650
if I can't find a match,

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,000
just write the text update.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,550
Now,

52
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,670
let me just show you how we do that.

53
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,720
So I've already written the code and the code looks something like this,

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,410
and it's very,

55
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,450
very straightforward.

56
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,170
So what it says at the top is this code luxury multiple sheets checking for changes between

57
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,410
the source file in the destination file.

58
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,760
Any changes new or changed are written to the destination filers and new entry.

59
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,950
Both files were identical in structure.

60
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,530
Okay.

61
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,150
At the Temple of Four variables declared,

62
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,700
my source file holds the name of the source file.

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,680
My desk file holds the name of the destination file.

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,180
My sheet name holds the name of this sheet and should say name,

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,610
shouldn't it?

66
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,980
Does the name off the bar?

67
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,370
Actually,

68
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,950
just also the name of the sheet.

69
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,240
They go on the outer loop,

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,070
and that is the outer loot cycle through these sheets.

71
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,410
So let's step into this.

72
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,770
Here we go.

73
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,540
Load the names of the source and destination files.

74
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,770
So my source file is Sean source file.

75
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,260
My desk file is Sean destination file F eight F eight.

76
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,780
Now we've captured the name to the to file,

77
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,920
so we can easily flip between them.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,120
Go to the source file F eight workbooks.

79
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,360
My source file doesn't activate nowhere into our outer loop.

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,420
So for outer loop equals 12 workbooks.

81
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,650
My source file sheets dot Kent.

82
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,100
Now,

83
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,900
because we have this sheet over here,

84
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,350
this Get your sheet.

85
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,550
Your code here.

86
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,150
We actually have one extra sheet that we don't have in the destination file.

87
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,840
So I've just added a minus one.

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,730
So what we're going to do is out loot from 1 to 4,

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,670
which is the five minus one.

90
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,700
So that cycle,

91
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,490
through sheets out of loop one dot select.

92
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,970
So we selected by the index number one,

93
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,490
which is sheet one just there.

94
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,090
Now,

95
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,460
we're going to capture the name of that sheet so we can use it in our formulas.

96
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,890
So here we have our first block of code.

97
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,060
Now,

98
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:32,080
this is the formula that is going to be written to cells e to to e my source file my sheet

99
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,840
name range 65,000.

100
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,330
Way down the bottom here dot end excel up dot ro.

101
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,070
So in this particular instance,

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,220
it's going to write from E two to e 17.

103
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,830
This is covered in the course,

104
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,160
but it's very straightforward.

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,750
And all this is is a formula that were recorded.

106
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,980
I wrote the formula,

107
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,890
recorded a macro hit F two,

108
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,250
stopped recording a macro.

109
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,490
I've just pasted the foreman there in there.

110
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,950
So watch what happens in this sheik here.

111
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,160
F eight.

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,560
No,

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,000
we have all of our can Katyn ations.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,370
Now,

115
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,460
I'm gonna do exactly the same thing to the corresponding sheet because I'm no got the sheet

116
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,570
name in the destination file.

117
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,840
Now,

118
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,080
I am gonna look at it,

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,140
but we don't actually need to be looking at it for this to work.

120
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,590
Just look what happens over here.

121
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,660
F eight.

122
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
And there they go.

123
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:20,880
Now,

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,900
let me come back here because the next thing we're going to do is write that check.

125
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,150
And this is the formula that I have written in their I've actually got that down twice.

126
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,380
I think so,

127
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,760
Yeah.

128
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,340
I don't need that in that many times.

129
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,850
That's the formula that I use just there.

130
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,320
Scroll over.

131
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,810
They go.

132
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,840
So workbooks my source file sheets.

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,830
My sheet named range F two to F muscles formation named Range A 65,000 way down in the

134
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,380
bottom end,

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,990
excel up and get the row number.

136
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,230
So that's going to be rose 17 on right that formula.

137
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,700
And again,

138
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:03,650
I just wrote this formula here in in F two recorded the macro hit F two stocks recorder

139
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,090
macro.

140
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,380
And that's how I got this coat.

141
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,550
So now you can see that we have to.

142
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,430
So this particular line of date has been found at row to I have update because I know have

143
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,700
Alan written in there on That's the one I want to look at.

144
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,620
So now we're going to go to the inner loop.

145
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,400
We're gonna hit F two a face rather to select the first line of data Robert gun sales While

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,920
the active celled up value doesn't equal blank,

147
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,550
that is cycle all the way through until you get to the bottom.

148
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,850
So if the active cell value equals update,

149
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,320
then do something.

150
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,240
If it doesn't move down the cell loop through No,

151
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,710
the active seldom value does equal update on what I want to do is copy the active cell

152
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,690
entire row dot copy to worksheets.

153
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,590
My destination file my sheet name That way,

154
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:01,710
we always know where right into exactly the same sheet range a 65,000 dot end excel up

155
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,350
that's gonna take us to our first populated cell.

156
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,310
And then we're gonna say dot offset one road.

157
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,270
So that's going to take us to our first blank row F eight and I'm gonna move down,

158
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,190
and I'm just gonna cycle all the way through that until we get down to a blank on.

159
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,920
Then I am going to any second now.

160
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,660
There we go.

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,370
Now I'm gonna clear the formulas that I've just written on my source file on my destination

162
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,640
fall.

163
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,720
So my source file may sheet E to f clear contents.

164
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,100
Look what happens over here and here.

165
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,040
When I flipped back,

166
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,250
you can see that we know have that new row of data written at the bottom.

167
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,920
And again,

168
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,230
if I come back to here,

169
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,510
I can just hit f eight on that removes that next out of loop.

170
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,350
Now I need to be on the destination sheets back to the code on this is just gonna loop

171
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,080
through again.

172
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,550
So again,

173
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm gonna write the blocks.

174
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,470
Now we have a different one to update loop all the way through right that update for me,

175
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,870
I you can see that that changed to 12 because there is now a match and again just loop all

176
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,660
the way through.

177
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,170
And I'm just gonna run that out.

178
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,070
Number one more month.

179
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,710
Now here we have the source file on day you go on.

180
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:17,910
Now,

181
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,320
if we look at the destination file will see that we have a couple of new entries.

182
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,940
Vast one Andi among the source file.

183
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,080
Sorry.

184
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,430
Here's the destination file.

185
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,420
So our new entries have been added to the bottom of sheet one to the bottom of sheet to on

186
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,420
.

187
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,950
There was nothing new in Sheikh three and nothing new in sheep for hopefully that makes

188
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,410
sense.

189
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:49,050
But the codes fully rammed and you can get it from from this tab just here.

190
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,920
Hopefully,

191
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,180
that's helpful Shown.

192
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,750
Obviously you'll need Teoh make the concatenation longer because I think you have columns A

193
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,940
B,

194
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,120
C d e f on on.

195
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,380
But in principle,

196
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,430
that should give you exactly what you need.

197
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,150
Okay.

198
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,040
As always,

199
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,070
if there are any questions,

200
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,250
just let me know and I'll be happy to help.

201
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,180
Have a great day
