1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Okay,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,260
guys on welcome back and never can have a look at the absolute,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,050
most efficient way toe load your array.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,520
Now,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:11,810
again,

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,630
we're gonna be dealing with a multi dimensional rates.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,950
Gonna have two dimensions,

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,980
just like x elder.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,170
So we're gonna have lots of Ros and lots of columns.

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,540
And he I have a data set that I prepared earlier.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:22,780
I mean,

12
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,790
how's that sub?

13
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,050
Look?

14
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,870
It has 461 lines of data,

15
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,160
including the titles on We have seven columns of data.

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,920
Now,

17
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,960
you'll remember before in the last lecture and we when we populated the arrayed statically

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:38,960
,

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,740
we had an outer loop to iterated the first dimension on an inner loop to iterated through

20
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,980
the second I mentioned.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,110
And if that did your head in,

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,590
then this is going to be music to your ears because what we're gonna do is just use one

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:03,250
single line of code that will populate the array in its entire ITI in one go.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,150
So we don't actually have toe have the sheet selected to read the array.

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,200
So this is the sheet that we're reading from and you'll remember 261 lines of data.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,420
Seven columns of data Woman do is click here to the right here because this is where we're

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,600
going to write the data.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,740
So I've added a watch to my arrayed de I'm gonna debug and I'm just gonna run to cursor and

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,280
you'll notice that Maya Radi has been initialized because we've set the array there.

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,420
And when I press f eight look what happens here.

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,930
One line of code plus my r a d one plus I have all of the titles in their my array to I

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,370
have all of the first.

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,790
This is Robi that so let's just flip back here.

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,570
So have all the titles in a row.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,050
One,

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,840
I have the first record set.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,990
Let me get back up,

38
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,550
Sit up.

39
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:05,070
Have the first record set in array to so to one is the first of the 1st 2016 Sarah bomb

40
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,850
north bangle clothing on all of these numbers Over here on all the way down in fell images

41
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:20,490
drug casus citizens take forever 461 lines of data completely populated with seven columns

42
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,560
of data in one line of code.

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,470
Now,

44
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,330
the thing that we don't know at the moment because it's easy to read a whole bunch of data

45
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,720
into a two dimensional array using that one line of code.

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,140
But when you write the code back,

47
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,440
you need to say to excel.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,020
I am specifying a range of exactly the same dimensions.

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,140
So we can't read all the code into my radi,

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,600
then select cell a one on right,

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,550
because all we're going to get is the first element off the first element.

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,400
So what we have to do if we had a three by three dimension Deray.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,140
So three rows and three columns we would have to say to excel right in a one through C

54
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,680
three.

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,380
So we have to know how big that array is now.

56
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,910
Luckily,

57
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:16,310
you you'll recall that we had an upper bound before and there is a command called you bound

58
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,090
that we can use to find out the road can't.

59
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,770
Now here I have specified the first element.

60
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,390
So I'm gonna hit F eight on the row.

61
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,420
Count is going to count how many elements,

62
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,350
How many rows of data what the upper bound it.

63
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,150
So what is the highest number that that array is reaching its 461 Because you'll remember

64
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,840
we have 461 lines of data.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,650
Now,

66
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,370
Cole count is again a you bound.

67
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,230
It's the upper band,

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,100
the highest number.

69
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,020
But this time we're looking at the second element.

70
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,260
Hence we have Comma two.

71
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,140
We're now looking at the second element.

72
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,140
So when I press f eight,

73
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:03,290
you can see that we have 461 lines of data that is rows of data on.

74
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,170
We have seven columns of data.

75
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,750
Know what I'm gonna do is select the sheet to write to calling bites.

76
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,190
Phoebe,

77
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,160
Name on here.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,740
I just have a range statement.

79
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,040
So sells 11 We want to begin at a one cells row count.

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,510
So 461 rose down to seven columns across on.

81
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,280
All I want to do is say that equals my array D,

82
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,300
which is everything that we have just copied in that one line of code above.

83
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,650
So I'm just going to hit F eight and look what happens over here.

84
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:43,200
So it's all been read in one line of code with works out how many rows we have worked out.

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,860
How many columns we have on.

86
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,640
We've written the entire data set back in one line of code.

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,360
Just here.

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,340
Okay,

89
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,250
I'll see you in the next lecture.
