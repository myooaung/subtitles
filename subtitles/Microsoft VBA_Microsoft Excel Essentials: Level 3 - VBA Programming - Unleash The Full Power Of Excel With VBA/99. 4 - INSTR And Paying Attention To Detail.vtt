00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Okay,

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.840
guys.

3
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.960
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.440
Now I've added in all the format into the ad commentary section.

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.470
Now there are a few things I need to draw your attention to.

6
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.390
This one,

7
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.970
Alan Commentary to a three is fairly straightforward because bold in the month,

8
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.850
we've just used the in string and we've used my month just like we did in the last demo for

9
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.420
the year.

10
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.920
Obviously,

11
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.520
we've changed my month to my year,

12
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.140
but here's where it gets a little more complex,

13
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.790
not particularly complex as long as you understand exactly what you're doing when we bowled

14
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.780
profit because we set the format when we wrote the text.

15
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.590
What we need toe add in here is the full thing,

16
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.250
including the format.

17
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.540
So if we just said range 23 on and excel down dot value,

18
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.540
what we would have returned was literally just the digits,

19
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.110
we would have omitted the pound sign.

20
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.300
So because this is exactly what we specified when we wrote the string,

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.570
that is exactly what we have to specify here now,

22
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.550
Similarly done in the ad commentary to a four.

23
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.590
This is the next line again because we didn't actually read this into about a variable.

24
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.790
We actually read the top performing sales person's name from Range A 24 to his result.

25
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.360
We have just specified range A 24 here where we had above.

26
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.790
We had my mom for my year and exactly the same here.

27
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.500
We have said the length of range A $24 value again in a four where we've done the profit.

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.540
We've also mentioned the format so we get exactly the right length.

29
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.050
It's exactly the same for if I So let me just hit Stop!

30
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.760
Come back to the source data sheet.

31
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.320
We're gonna wish all the way back up to the top.

32
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.580
We're going to come here.

33
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.440
We're gonna debug.

34
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.460
We're gonna run to Kenya,

35
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.000
Sample more,

36
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.150
more,

37
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.030
more Bomb on.

38
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.090
We're going to hit at com entering.

39
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.420
And I'm just gonna move this out the way a little bit so we can see that you won't see all

40
00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.920
of the code,

41
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.250
but you'll see what's happening at runtime.

42
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.800
So they go,

43
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.790
there's our title.

44
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.240
Here's our profit.

45
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.640
There's January just gum bold.

46
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.850
The next thing we're gonna do is make the year bold.

47
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.020
There goes the year now we're going to make the profits bold.

48
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.310
There goes the prophet.

49
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.660
Never gonna add the text a full.

50
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.860
Then we're going to make Justin g bold.

51
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.400
We're gonna make hiss profit Boulder gonna add the text a five on.

52
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.060
Here we go.

53
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.330
We're going to make the clothing category bold on.

54
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.010
We're going to make the profit bold.

55
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.330
Now have looked at this.

56
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.220
I think what we probably need to do is have this particular table beginning one road down,

57
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.550
so it gives us a bit of space that Okay,

58
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.760
in the next lecture,

59
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.480
we're gonna have a look.

60
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.920
A just tidying up the formatting on the title here on.

61
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.770
Then we'll get onto oppo chart,

62
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.450
which will be our finishing touch.

63
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.930
Okay,

64
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.380
I'll see you in the next lecture.
