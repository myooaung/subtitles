1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,390
Okay,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:02,830
guys.

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,270
And welcome back now,

4
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,150
you will have gathered by now so far in this section that there are lots and lots of

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,620
workbook events on.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,910
We've looked at a few of them and we've worked out that you can put code in the workbook

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,450
event.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,320
You can call code from a workbook event,

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,110
as we did with the user form in the splash screen on.

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,980
We then had that access in the macro that were written in a normal module.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,020
So literally,

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,300
if you can imagine it,

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,690
you can probably code it now.

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,800
One particularly useful thing on the before close,

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,990
I used to manage a team,

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,410
not the people who are named here,

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,560
which are all friends of mine.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,060
But I used to manage a team where one of the individuals always used to filter to their

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,170
name and then save the workbook and close it.

20
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,620
And that way,

21
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,710
when any other user went in,

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,400
they had to go in and unhurried his name.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,620
Un apply the filter so they could see their own name.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,310
No.

25
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,090
What?

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,410
This particular better code is really,

27
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,270
really simple.

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,120
What it's gonna do is go to this sheet on It is going to remove any auto fill for.

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,270
So for argument's sake,

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,240
let's just say I usually pick.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,010
Let's click Ashley.

32
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,810
So OK,

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,990
so actually is in here.

34
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,860
This is his work.

35
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,110
Lissy has thing want to do thing too.

36
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,550
So thing one thing six and thinking.

37
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,500
11 on.

38
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm gonna hit.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,050
Save now.

40
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,850
Olsen F 11.

41
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,150
I'm gonna come into this workbook.

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,170
I am going to choose workbook.

43
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,060
I'm not been delete that just yet.

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,530
I'm gonna choose Be full clothes,

45
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,680
which now means I can delete this.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,280
So all ominous do in here because this sheet the coming on but the sheet was called it was

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
called Random Data sets.

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,650
The random data set sheet has a VB name of shirt RND data.

49
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,750
So what I'm gonna do is say sure are nd data don't select,

50
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,450
and that is going to make sure I am on the right sheet.

51
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:11,890
And then I am going to say active sheets dot on What I want to do is choose show oh,

52
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,050
data.

53
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:22,350
And the next thing I want to do is say active workbook don't safe.

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,820
So before it closes,

55
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,970
it is going to select this sheet.

56
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,370
It is gonna un apply the filters and it is going to save.

57
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,700
So let's just go back to that sheet.

58
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,780
So here,

59
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,350
I'm gonna click.

60
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,860
Save.

61
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,320
Imagine.

62
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,890
Now I am.

63
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,450
Actually,

64
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,850
I'm gonna close the file.

65
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,060
I'm gonna come over on Rio from the file and notice what happens this time.

66
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,110
We are back on this sheet on It is no being applied.

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,720
So we can know.

68
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,600
See everyone.

69
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,620
So let's imagine Young Danielle does exactly the same thing.

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,150
So Danielle is beaning.

71
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
She saved it.

72
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,190
I'm just gonna double click on when it reopens.

73
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,960
There you go.

74
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,720
Everyone could be sitting again.

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,620
Okay.

76
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,860
I'm gonna see you in the next Like to ever gonna get onto work sheet events.

77
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,310
I'll see you in the next lecture.
