00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Hello,

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.760
guys.

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.580
I'm welcome back now.

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.660
In the last lecture we looked at manipulating the range dot value on we could say range be

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.890
one dot value equals range.

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.330
A $1 value on that would copy the value from a one to be one.

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.390
But there's also this method and again,

8
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.360
this particular little block of code.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.260
All these blocks of code are available in the download sections called Mod copy and Paste.

10
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.350
I'm just Kentucky through a couple of them quickly.

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.090
Now,

12
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.350
here we have a simple copy and paste on the format looks like this.

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
The sin taxes range a one doc copy space,

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.130
and then you can immediately say what you want,

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.490
the destination to bay.

16
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.330
So here we can say range a one dot copy.

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.400
Let's just paste it into here and we can see what that code does.

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.900
So we're just gonna hit F eight step through,

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.180
so range a one dot copy space on the destinations can be ranged.

20
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.590
Be one so they go.

21
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.720
You can see the B one.

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.940
No say's exactly what a one say's now that performs exactly the same function there that we

23
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.490
did with manipulating the dot value But here's the thing.

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.500
If we change this and we formatted the cells on,

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.350
let's say we have it in Let's have read Let's say it's bold and let's say it's 14.

26
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.000
It's OK.

27
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.630
They go.

28
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.960
Someday we have range.

29
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.360
A one says hello in red in 14 m Bold.

30
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.350
Now look what happens when we execute that code.

31
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.620
It pulls over all the formatting,

32
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.550
not just the value but the formatting to.

33
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.650
So if you want to preserve the format in using the copy and paste is a really good way of

34
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.300
doing that.

35
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.200
Now again,

36
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.590
what we can do is we can we can do this between worksheet.

37
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.450
So if we took this code and again,

38
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.280
I encourage you to play with all of these,

39
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.090
Let me just pace that over there on pace.

40
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.880
You can see that we have worksheets.

41
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.800
She won range a one dot copy space and we're gonna be pasting to work sheets.

42
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.510
She to range a one.

43
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.960
So she twos just here.

44
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.310
You can see that we have nothing in a one,

45
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.420
but let's come back and go Bump,

46
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.640
bump,

47
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.000
bump and hit f eight.

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.410
Then when we flipped a sheet to they go that's copied from sheet one range a one?

49
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.890
No,

50
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.340
I encourage you to have a play around with all of these and see exactly what they do so you

51
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.050
can do it from this one sheet to the same sheet.

52
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.990
You can use it from one sheet to a different sheet,

53
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.530
and you can also do it between workbooks on all of these copy paste in the simple format.

54
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.210
Preserve the formatting,

55
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.010
and there's also these here where you can use the special so you could just copy the

56
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.420
formats if you wanted to,

57
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.060
rather than the values as well.

58
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.420
So have a play around with those there's always If there's any questions,

59
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.350
just let me know.

60
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.330
I'll see you in the next lecture.
