1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Okay,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:02,800
guys,

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,960
welcome back there Rather than have this impl anal dull black tax let's change this Let's

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,930
make it blue and let's make it bold.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,880
So I'm just gonna close that off on I'm gonna hit no safe.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,110
So here we valued the logo here.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,010
We've added the text so immediately underneath that between the title and subtitle.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,050
What we're gonna do is come down to here to the text to the formatting text.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,820
Because we're doing two things we're gonna do is use the with end with someone's gonna copy

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,450
that code,

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,560
come up to here,

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,580
and I'm just gonna pace that in here.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,630
So let's just tidy that up.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,970
So using the with end with,

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,070
we can delete their sweetened delete this weaken,

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,800
Delete this weaken.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,570
Delete this.

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,610
I'm not gonna bother change in the typeface,

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,640
but we could also need Teoh delete the Rams in front within the end with So we're going to

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,530
say VB blue obviously can make this review once I want to rent in the file.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,650
So the font size because I don't know what's gonna look like.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,600
Andi.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,940
I don't want it to be Talic.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,410
I want it to be bold So let's run that and see how that works.

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:18,470
So up to the run order hit Play into my name Andi Mango Month report for January 2006.

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,640
Actually,

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,040
what we could say is presented by just in front of that Couldn't be so Let's just come down

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,370
to here and say I think the PP slide shaped to the subtitle is actually going to say

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,500
presented by colon space.

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,620
Close quotes Andi Prez name.

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,330
So let's have a rumor that and see how that looks.

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:49,460
So let's say on Jervis to be terribly formal on they go from three port for Jerry 2016 or

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,680
the region presented by Alan Jarvis.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,570
Fantastic.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,660
Right now what we're gonna do because we have the base code sorted is we're just going to

36
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,310
steal that,

37
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,400
modify it a little bit and create slide to I'll see you in the next lecture
