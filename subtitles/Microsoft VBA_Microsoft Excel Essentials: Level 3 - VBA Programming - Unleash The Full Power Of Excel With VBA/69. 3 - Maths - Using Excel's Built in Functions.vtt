00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
Okay,

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.370
guys.

3
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.510
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.120
Now I know that we could perform the same function as a V.

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.000
Look up by just having a loop looking tree loads a day to satisfy a certain criteria and

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.230
then return in the value we know how to do loops.

7
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.780
We know how to test values of cells use in logical testing,

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.680
But to be honest with the feeling that works beautifully in Excel and we can adapt it so it

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.160
works beautifully in our visual basic code to So here is the code to do that.

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.940
Just this.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.360
What I've done is I've set up a locally declared variable because it's inside the sub and

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.480
I've just called it tempts.

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.000
All I want to do is temporarily hold the value off the worksheet function the look up now

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.830
when If it's actually before we get started,

15
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.950
Here's a tip for you.

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.300
If your code looks like this and you find yourself having to scroll over to seize all,

17
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.510
you can break it down so it splits over a couple of lines.

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.320
So what I'm gonna say Here's 10 p equals application dot Working function will come back to

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.010
the specifics of this in a minute and somewhere in your code hitter space.

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.160
Hit the under school and then press enter and then you can just tab over Andi.

21
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.720
They go.

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.870
It looks nice and neat,

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.970
and when you click off,

24
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.950
it's not gonna era so anywhere in your code.

25
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.660
Not in the middle of a string iisten to add.

26
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.630
But,

27
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.810
well,

28
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.690
I'm sure we'll come to that when we come to the tech section somewhere in your code,

29
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.630
preferably between arguments.

30
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.100
Space underscore his hands out and then tab over so you can see it right?

31
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.980
Let's have a look and have this function works.

32
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.150
We are signing the results off this to our variable temp.

33
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.640
Now,

34
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.390
whenever you use a worksheet function,

35
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.950
switches V look up.

36
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:56.420
You have to proceed with application dot worksheet function dot on the name of the function

37
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.240
you want to call on.

38
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.480
Then,

39
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.190
after that,

40
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.940
it's pretty much straightforward kind of stuff.

41
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.610
What we have to do is specify it in VB,

42
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.400
a speak so here way have said range E to where is normally in a straight.

43
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.360
They look up in excel.

44
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.770
It would just say e to We have to say this is a range and it is called e to.

45
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.640
That is they'll look up value.

46
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.400
The order is still exactly the same.

47
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.210
Comma range.

48
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.610
Open open quotes 02 Sorry.

49
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.230
04 to P eight.

50
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.010
Close quote.

51
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.510
Close brackets again.

52
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.470
This is arranged.

53
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.130
The look of range,

54
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.570
by the way,

55
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.560
is over here somewhere.

56
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.710
Vega in 0204 through p eight.

57
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.680
So you are.

58
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.280
We have to explicitly tell it.

59
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220
This is the range on.

60
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.840
We can write the range and then proceeded with the range open brackets quotes.

61
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.030
So everything has to be in this format on then the rest of it.

62
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.010
It's just the same common to come falls.

63
00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.020
So if I wanted to get a look of value looking at e two in this range into our temp variable

64
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.020
,

65
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.640
I just hit eight.

66
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.980
Step through on.

67
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.690
There you go.

68
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.490
15

69
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.730
Which I'm fairly sure is right.

70
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.680
Calling around what?

71
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.540
We were looking at it.

72
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.610
I think it was hair color.

73
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.640
Yes,

74
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.940
a hair commercial.

75
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.190
Hair color is brown.

76
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.900
You should probably have some protection.

77
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.940
In fact 15.

78
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.160
This has no basis in science.

79
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.670
By the way,

80
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.150
I've just completely made this up.

81
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.880
So that's how you use all of excels built in functions in V B.

82
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.080
A.

83
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.740
You just proceed them with application,

84
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.370
that worksheet function and pretty much you can piece it all together.

85
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.490
Just looking at that one.

86
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.250
Example that Okay,

87
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.970
we do have one more example toe look at because sometimes we will have named Ranges or we

88
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.450
would like to have a named range in code.

89
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.950
So that's gonna be a subject of the next lecture on.

90
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.730
Then we completely done with maths.

91
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.170
I'll see you in a few seconds.
