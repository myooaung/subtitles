00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Okay,

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.630
guys,

3
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome back.

4
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.680
Now,

5
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.570
what we're gonna look at this time is another oldie,

6
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.120
But goody,

7
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.220
which is the while wind loop.

8
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.250
So we're just gonna call this sub?

9
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.390
I'm gonna start them or with loop on its while wend It's answer a few times.

10
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.260
Give us some lines to play with.

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.010
Copy that code because we want to tell it.

12
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.600
We always want to start with a one and now a while.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.180
Wend loop for Lena begins with while and ends with wend But what we need to do with the

14
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.250
while is give it a condition that you'll remember.

15
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.700
We used the condition up here in the do loop,

16
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.140
we said,

17
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.970
while the actor celled up value is less than 38 So let's use that same condition or one

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.490
very similar.

19
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.660
So while the active sell dot value is less than five,

20
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.040
let's say his center a few times and close your loops of wiles end with wend typed in lower

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.050
case you can see that's been capitalized.

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.780
And again,

23
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.110
for now,

24
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.310
we're just gonna do is copy this offset code so we can move down to some on pace it there

25
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.150
on Let's step through that so range a one select fantastic active,

26
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.180
sold up value equals one,

27
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.260
which is indeed less than five.

28
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.990
So execute the code when'd come back up.

29
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.470
Set up the active cell equals two,

30
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.870
which is still less than five.

31
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.500
So execute the code again.

32
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.170
Three.

33
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.950
Less than five execute again.

34
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.560
Four.

35
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.490
Less than five Execute again.

36
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.790
Five.

37
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.900
Not Weston.

38
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.440
Five.

39
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.050
Hit F eight and notice what happens straight down to the end sub And and so they go.

40
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.680
They are the four major loops.

41
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.220
The Do loop before next loop the for next loop with a step on the while wend loop.

42
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.730
Now,

43
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.270
at the moment,

44
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.760
all we've been doing is just offsetting through them.

45
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.270
But for argument's sake,

46
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.350
let's Ah,

47
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.040
yeah,

48
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.400
In fact,

49
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.260
let's let's do it with the do loop Now I can't remember what the code for color in

50
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.000
something in it.

51
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.060
So what I'm gonna do,

52
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.010
it's just I'm going to record a macro.

53
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.670
I don't care what number this,

54
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.870
because I'm let's just watch it recording over here.

55
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.190
Was it There was this one,

56
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.780
I think,

57
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.390
is going to say a one right click format cells.

58
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.530
Phil and I want to that lovely green color.

59
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.220
Okay,

60
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.940
so they just going to stop recording and I'm going to steal all of that code copy.

61
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.990
Come to model.

62
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.120
Looping on.

63
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.330
I'm just gonna hit enter a few times on paste All of that code in there.

64
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.880
So we have rain J one select.

65
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.490
We don't need that because we've already got range a one select in their delete that on.

66
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.440
I think what we're looking at is working with the active cell,

67
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.860
and I think we can avoid the selection.

68
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.270
Next,

69
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.830
we're going to say Active cell.

70
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.040
So let's just let's write this code as we go.

71
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.350
So let's say active sell adult.

72
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.520
Let me delete that dot because when I want to work with is the interior so dot in theory,

73
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.730
See,

74
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.960
as I start typing it,

75
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.070
it automatically suggests space.

76
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.180
I think they're solid colors anyway,

77
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.620
so it's not interior dots,

78
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.530
pattern or current color.

79
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.910
They go.

80
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.350
That's where it is its interior dot color smell.

81
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.810
The American way equals on 5 to 8 7936 which is obviously green.

82
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.190
Some skin deletes all of that code,

83
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.460
so have taken.

84
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.240
It doesn't lines of code or half a dozen lines of code and cut it down to one line of code

85
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.240
,

86
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.000
which is going to be more efficient.

87
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.650
So let me just uncultured that for a second.

88
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.250
Format cells no call that.

89
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.980
Okay,

90
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.600
let's step through this from watch what happens.

91
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.220
So they go into Erica Lack Green are now we actually want to offset to if we want to color

92
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.710
every other cell.

93
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:08.710
So f eight we have moved in two rows offset to commerce era coloring moved down,

94
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.420
calorie moved down color in until it is less than 38.

95
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.510
I'm just gonna hit play on.

96
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.120
There you go.

97
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.490
That's colored every other cell in that color.

98
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.400
So that's one thing you can do to use a loop now.

99
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.750
Another thing we could do is we could copy the value of the cell that we're on to the

100
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.580
column to the right of it.

101
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.050
So let's use for next loop for that.

102
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.880
And this one was very straightforward.

103
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.100
What we're gonna say is the active,

104
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.840
active cell dot off set open brackets,

105
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.270
same row,

106
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.010
zero comma,

107
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.090
one that is the column to the right.

108
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.050
Got value equals the active,

109
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.450
so don't value.

110
00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.800
So I am gonna be writing whatever is in an active cell into the cell immediately over to

111
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.760
the right,

112
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.810
so that would be column base.

113
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.850
So it's stepped through that much that inaction.

114
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.300
So here we go.

115
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.080
We are on a one,

116
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.170
our country's 1 to 10 on notice.

117
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.760
What happens?

118
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.880
Over here we get the one in B because the active cell offset zero comma.

119
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.070
11 column to the left is gonna be the value of whatever is in the active cell on step

120
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.460
through on again.

121
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.790
In fact,

122
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.280
let's no change that 23 and see what happens.

123
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.110
And there will be moving down three on each pass That one worked,

124
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.450
moved down three.

125
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:42.610
Right that compliment right that value in there and step through and set through until my

126
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.040
cancer reaches 10.

127
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.220
Bum bum bum bum bum bum like ants currently on nine.

128
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.730
My cannons,

129
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.130
currently on 10 and ends up so you can have mountains of code in between your four next

130
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.880
loops.

131
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.630
Andi,

132
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.320
You could,

133
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.630
in fact,

134
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.750
let's just do one more.

135
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.070
Ah,

136
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.760
let's Let's use the wild wind so well.

137
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.950
Then to sell doesn't equal.

138
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.230
While the active cell is less than five,

139
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.860
let's color it in less color.

140
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.770
It in red.

141
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.570
In fact,

142
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.740
now some of the colors actually have names.

143
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.580
Copy some.

144
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.810
Nicholas actually have names in visual basic.

145
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.890
So if you are ever unsure,

146
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.830
just type something like VB on the name of a cola on When you click off.

147
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.290
If it capitalizes,

148
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.890
it's a thing.

149
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.150
So VB red is indeed a known phrase within visual basic.

150
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.270
So let's just step through a sewer.

151
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.400
Lantos a one select vb red They go moved on.

152
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.010
Cell will be ready.

153
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.180
Be read BB red while it is less than five.

154
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.590
So they should be the last iteration.

155
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.960
When'd actor sell value?

156
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.480
No equal slice which is not less than five and sub on and on.

157
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.020
There you go.

158
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.080
That's everything you need to know about looping.

159
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.990
We're going to use them extensively as we go through the program and projects on now you

160
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.780
know all about them.

161
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.320
OK,

162
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.650
I'll see you in the next lecture
