1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,150
guys are welcome back now in the last select Should we looked at how to populate values

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,430
into cells Now it could be that we want to take a value that's currently mon cel

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,090
unpopulated to another cell.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,380
And that's what these little blocks of code here do.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,400
So here,

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,260
if we look at this line of code,

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,130
we're working with the object range B one on the object range.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,890
A one on what we're going to say is the value in B one is equal to the range in a one.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,250
So here,

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,200
if we said hello or he low,

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,080
I can't type,

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,300
found talk at the same time and then and then ran this line.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,610
Mako.

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,190
So I'm just gonna hit f eight.

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,640
Notice what happens in B one So the value of B one is equal to the value in a one there for

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,470
clicking there,

18
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,600
you can see it doesn't say is equal a one.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,310
It literally is just the value because it's the value property we're working with.

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,520
So let's say I can't remember how many,

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,860
uh,

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,500
whips.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,250
Hello.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,380
How are you today?

25
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,340
1234512345 That will.

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,510
Day s O here we say working with the range objects again.

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,580
But this time the range B one to B five.

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:14,940
Now,

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,350
the important thing when you're copying a range of data or when you're saying a range of

30
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,650
data equals another range of data,

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,150
you have to have the same size range.

32
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,410
So B one to B two wouldn't work.

33
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,670
If we're copying a one to a fight,

34
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,140
you'd only get the first to value.

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,470
So b one b five a one a five and this will do exactly the same thing.

36
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,620
So when he hit at eight,

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,610
there you go.

38
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,050
Everything that was in a one through a five has been written out to be one to be five.

39
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,580
Now,

40
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,590
what we could also date is captured the value of the active cell on reading into a variable

41
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:52,590
.

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,830
So if I said this is the active cell,

43
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,530
so have written lips.

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,340
I can't type told Wickham type tonight.

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,600
So this is the active cell.

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,750
Andi,

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,650
make sure that it is the active cell.

48
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,430
I could read the active cell value into the variable.

49
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,750
My first variable hit f eight.

50
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,430
And if I hover over that,

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,870
you can see that we've no captured the data.

52
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,840
The value data from the active cell into this variable on.

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Then I come right that variable to range g 16.

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,440
And if I hit F eight rips the G 18 and there it is in G 18.

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,270
Okay,

56
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,900
I'll see you in the next lecture.
