1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Okay,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:02,890
guys.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,010
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:04,260
Now,

5
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,660
these are some things that don't come up very often,

6
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,800
but when they do come up,

7
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,280
they can be an absolute nightmare to find out how to capture them.

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,620
So I just have the same valuable name in all of these,

9
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,070
and it's all called all they are all called my various attributes.

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,990
And here we have the active workbooks.

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,540
That's the word,

12
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,830
but that we're looking at now,

13
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,610
in this instance,

14
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,650
it's my macro book with the DOT built in document properties.

15
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,280
You'd never guess that one open brackets and we have the application name,

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,250
the author,

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,280
the company,

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,880
the creation date,

19
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,980
The last order on the last save time.

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,950
So I'm just going to hit f eight.

21
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,520
We can see here that the application name is Microsoft Excel.

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,100
We could probably have guessed that one.

23
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,850
And if they are faint through it again,

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,850
I have captured the author as Alan.

25
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,060
If I f eight again,

26
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,940
I have no company set to my file creation date must have a look that was the 13 for the 7

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,970
2016 That's a while ago.

28
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,960
Last author.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,340
That's probably going to be me again.

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,800
they go.

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:16,150
And the last save time Waas on the 23rd of the 8th 2016 13 46 and 19 seconds.

32
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,870
Okay,

33
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,170
so from time to time,

34
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,510
you may need to use those,

35
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,070
as you can see by the layout,

36
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,310
their nightmare to try and work out.

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,080
Luckily,

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,350
you have them all in your macro book.

39
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,130
Okay,

40
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,510
Here's another useful thing.

41
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,490
If you're using the sheets dot next or sheets stop previous if you try to go next form or

42
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,940
sheets than you actually have.

43
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,190
So if you say I want to go next five times,

44
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,700
we only have four sheets.

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,320
Your code is going to fail,

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,470
so it may be useful to know how many sheets you have,

47
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,650
so both of these lines do precisely the same thing.

48
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,170
It's the active workbook dot sheets dot count on.

49
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,710
If I hit F eight rips me like if I it hits FAA,

50
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,200
they go.

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,290
So we have four sheets in the active workbook.

52
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,370
Alternatively,

53
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,090
we could just omit the active workbook,

54
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,370
and by default it becomes the active workbook,

55
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,670
and that does exactly the same thing now.

56
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,230
We spoke a little bit earlier about index on before sheets on this piece of code here,

57
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,430
the active sheet dot index property will return the index.

58
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,510
So I'm currently on a sheet scratching.

59
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,840
When I hit F eight,

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,010
we can see that it is the fourth indexed sheet on Dhere.

61
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:34,150
We have open workbook counts on What we're doing is counting the number of open workbooks

62
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:41,620
using application dot workbooks Don't count from his F eight to because I have my macro

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,710
book and I have a book one.

64
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,620
OK,

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,840
I'll see you in the next lecture where we can have a look at right in some vb a code to

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,550
open workbooks.

67
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,170
Okay,

68
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,590
I'll see you in the next lecture.
