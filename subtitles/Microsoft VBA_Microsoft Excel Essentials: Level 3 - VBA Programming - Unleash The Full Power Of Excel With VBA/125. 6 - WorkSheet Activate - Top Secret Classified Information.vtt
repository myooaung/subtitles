00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Okay,

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:02.880
guys.

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.650
And welcome back to this final lecture in the workbook and Worksheets event section.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.290
Okay,

5
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.490
Now,

6
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.310
if you downloaded the source file,

7
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.150
you'll notice that you have many,

8
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.560
mainly Tampa's across there.

9
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.580
All the green ones are to do with the workbook.

10
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.980
All the red ones are to do with work sheet.

11
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.250
And when you click in here,

12
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.750
you can see that you can see you can get to the code that we've actually used in the demos

13
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.180
right now.

14
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.300
You may notice that you have this sheet here,

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.940
top secrets on.

16
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.040
If I click this,

17
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.900
you're going to see exactly what it does.

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.450
Then we'll have a look at how you do it.

19
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.600
I'm gonna click the top secret sheet on do notice.

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.450
Have immediately gone back here on they have this message Top secret.

21
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.610
This sheet is highly classified.

22
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.410
You must be very important to view the contents.

23
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.470
Please enter the password below.

24
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.960
Let's imagine I don't know what the pass earlier,

25
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.520
so I'm just gonna type something on a hit,

26
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.130
Okay?

27
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.560
And then I get this access denied.

28
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.580
You better run security have been notified,

29
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.200
okay?

30
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.510
And I'm gonna run because I'm not clear to see that sheet?

31
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.380
Okay,

32
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.390
It's just a bit of fun,

33
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.050
but let's have a look at how we do that.

34
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.890
Olsen F 11 on We are on top Secret on here is the code.

35
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.130
I have used that password as string,

36
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.460
which I'm going to capture down here in an input box.

37
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.720
So I'm making sure that the enable events are on.

38
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.210
So this code will work.

39
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.870
I'm gonna choose ship guide so that immediately takes them away from the top secret

40
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.070
classified file on.

41
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.920
Gonna ask the user to enter the password user password,

42
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.490
which is the valuable declared here equals input box.

43
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.100
This sheet is highly classified on VB New Line.

44
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.270
You must be very important.

45
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.240
View the contents.

46
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.890
New line,

47
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.390
please.

48
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.670
Into the password below top secret.

49
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.190
That's the title on there.

50
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.990
We come onto a logical test,

51
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.250
which we've used before,

52
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.810
and it's going to say if use a password equals password,

53
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.000
then application enable events false there.

54
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.660
We must put that there because otherwise it's gonna innocently try to active to activate

55
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.800
the sheet again on this codes gonna execute in an absolute endless loop because the next

56
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.930
thing we tell it to do is select the sheet,

57
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.150
which is obviously going to call this code again.

58
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.140
So we're gonna enable events false.

59
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.200
We're going to turn off this code,

60
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.140
activating only until we have activated the sheet shirt top secret,

61
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.590
which you'll see here on.

62
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.470
Then we're gonna turn the events back on.

63
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.650
So if the password ended is correct,

64
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680
we're going to stop this code executing.

65
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.390
Activate the sheet on.

66
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.020
Then we're going to turn on the enable events again.

67
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.520
If the use against the password wrong,

68
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520
we're going to display the message box.

69
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.130
You better run security have been notified.

70
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.380
Exclamation point on its VB critical on access is denied on.

71
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080
Then we want to end.

72
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.300
So if I come back here on attempt to do it and I don't know,

73
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.200
the password is I'm gonna get this warning.

74
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.710
But if I come over here Andi,

75
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.190
I click it again and I type password enter.

76
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.550
They dio this finally stop secret,

77
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.830
but I am now allowed to get into it.

78
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.130
So there you go.

79
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.880
That's the end of the workbook on work sheets Events section.

80
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.350
I'll see you in the next section.
