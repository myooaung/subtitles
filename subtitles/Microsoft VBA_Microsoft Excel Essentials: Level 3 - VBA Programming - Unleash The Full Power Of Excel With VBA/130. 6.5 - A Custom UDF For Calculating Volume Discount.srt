1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,820
guys.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,830
And welcome back up to this point,

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,290
we'll have a look at just using a single argument in our use of defined functions.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:09,690
But here,

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,870
we're gonna have one way we're going to use to.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,700
Obviously,

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,500
you can have as many as you like,

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,650
but you must remember the order in which they appear.

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,650
Because don't forget you don't get tool tips with user defined functions.

11
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,090
Eso here,

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,250
one of them do is in a sailor that that that I'm going to say Discount.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,200
No.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,880
Imagine the scenario we have a business on.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
We give people a discount,

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,250
depending on how many of our goodies that they buy.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,350
So here will have his custom function shelter.

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,830
It's called Discount Couch.

19
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,060
I have two arguments.

20
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,480
I have my quantity,

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,030
which I want to type in here I have my price,

22
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,740
which I'm gonna type in here on this function is going to be used to derive the discount.

23
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,730
So I have a couple of variables that have price break as interject.

24
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,060
Imagine that we only sell in hold units on.

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,870
I have discount as a single precision variable because I'm just gonna be dealing with

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,840
currency on a discount of a percent at a percentage.

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,150
OK,

28
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,910
so now what we need to do the first test we need to do,

29
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,270
you can see the parameters.

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,490
Here.

31
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,950
The price break is 1000 and if they breach $1000 they by 1000 and one,

32
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,880
then they're going to get a discount of 5%.

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,940
So now what we need to do is add a logical test so we can actually test to see if the

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,220
quantity entered is greater than 1000 or not.

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,950
So we're just going to use a simple,

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,080
logical testing and say,

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,510
if my quantity,

38
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,780
we're going to say if my quantity is less than or equal to.

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,400
But actually,

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,950
having type one thing has never taken just a price make price break,

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,130
then then what do we want to do?

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,420
If it's less than that,

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,460
we want to say,

44
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,860
Let me just add the end difficult.

45
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,480
I'm frequently forgetting to do those and they'll have the Elsa's.

46
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,670
Well,

47
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,830
we're in there so they go.

48
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:08,430
If the my quantity that is our first argument is less than the price break,

49
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:17,090
which is 1000 then discount couch and you'll remember that this has to be the same as this

50
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,090
,

51
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,370
so the discount Kulka is going to equal nothing.

52
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,100
OK,

53
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,130
so now let's.

54
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,000
So let's let's just test that.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,110
So if we said 100 on their pound each,

56
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,150
then we just change the format in groups.

57
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,760
Let me just change the formatting on the east currency formatting currency.

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,420
Okay,

59
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,130
obviously whatever currency or in it's perfectly fine.

60
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,360
So now I'm going to say,

61
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,900
What's it called?

62
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,530
It's called this Can calculus A equals disk?

63
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,600
No,

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,630
but the one thing to remember whatever case you use here is exactly the same case that

65
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,290
appears.

66
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,370
He s so if this said discount go all in uppercase,

67
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,310
it would appear here all in uppercase of discount coke.

68
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,980
My first argument is quantity Comer.

69
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,020
My second argument is price there.

70
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,450
So when I hit that and hit enter zero,

71
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,620
they go because 100 is less than 1000.

72
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,550
Calculation is straight ful with discount calculation equals absolutely nothing at all.

73
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,670
So let's just copy that and let on in our else.

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:31,510
So discount talc equals is going to be my quantity multiplied by my price whips eso This is

75
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:37,590
what's gonna happen if they breached the 1000 set here and it's gonna be multiplied by

76
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,490
discount on the discount.

77
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,890
Here is 5%.

78
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,100
They've all capital I.

79
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,740
So I have no typing mistakes in there,

80
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,990
so let's try that.

81
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,020
So if we have 999 we still get no discount.

82
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,390
If we had 1000 we still have no discount book.

83
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,020
If we have 1000 and one they go,

84
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,250
we know get 5% discount on the discount.

85
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,870
Value is £50 on 50 p.

86
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,880
Okay,

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,620
so have fun with playing with you.

88
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,350
D efs on.

89
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,750
I'll see you in the next section.
