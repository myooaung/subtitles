00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Okay,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.810
guys,

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.150
welcome to this lecture.

4
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.510
No,

5
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.420
this lecture is going to be dedicated to the with end with procedure,

6
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.100
which is this area just here that we stepped through in the last lecture.

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.850
Now won't do just so we can see all of the code in one window.

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.030
I'm just gonna delete some of these remarks that's completely redundant as completely

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.750
redundant.

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.550
I'm just gonna put a few spaces in there.

11
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.910
Let's do that.

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.740
They go so we could see all the code that we've written so far,

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.070
all in the one window.

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.250
Now the thing to notice with with an end with is that we have the format selection,

15
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.890
adult interior.

16
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.370
Then we have another dot on the next line,

17
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.790
says Doc Patton,

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.010
Excel salad.

19
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.420
Then we have another dot says Paton.

20
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.050
Color index equals X l automatic,

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.680
and we also have dot color onda 65535 dot tintin shade zero dot patent Tinton Shade.

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.290
Now,

23
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.000
the reason that you would want to use a with end with function is if you're gonna perform

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.800
or than one action on the same cell.

25
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.300
Now,

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.220
the question is,

27
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.060
which cell are you acting upon on that clue comes just here.

28
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.790
So the first line of code that we have is this selection where we use the pay special on

29
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.580
were automatically highlighted all the formulas that resulted in a number on selected them

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.580
.

31
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.590
And now those that particular area has bean selected.

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.080
That is,

33
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.580
they've been highlighted like this.

34
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.980
Onda cross.

35
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.110
Not not the bottom line that what we can do now those are selected while we have that

36
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.530
selection active that is selected with the selection,

37
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.610
which is everything we just highlighted here.

38
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.700
We can know that Make a change to the adults interior value off that selection now,

39
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.480
not only can we make a change the dot interior,

40
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.320
but the interior itself has further properties on those properties.

41
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.550
Will enough our pattern pattern core index cola,

42
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.440
Tintin shade,

43
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.340
pattern,

44
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.650
tint and shade.

45
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.370
Okay,

46
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.750
now,

47
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.850
what we're gonna do is do this in longhand just so you can understand what it does.

48
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.220
And you'll see why the with end with is an effective way of dealing with multiple changes

49
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.180
to the same cell.

50
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.740
So I'm gonna start with exactly the same statement with selection.

51
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.540
I'm gonna say dot in theory or which is exactly what it says here.

52
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.450
Then I'm going to say adult,

53
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.170
and then I'm going to say pattern,

54
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.130
and I'm just going to copy the values in there.

55
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.950
So I'm going to say X l solid.

56
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.050
No.

57
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.660
Notice that I have selection with a little less interior with a little eye pattern with a

58
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.120
little p and X l solid all in lower case.

59
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.370
But if you look here within the with end with,

60
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.380
you'll notice that selection is capital s.

61
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.870
I is capital.

62
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:29.310
I p is capital P on this says x l Capital s when I click tough this line this change to

63
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.430
capital s capital I Capital P on Excel solid was in exactly the same cases.

64
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.810
It appeared down here.

65
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.400
So there's our first instruction selection dot interior dot pattern equals x.

66
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.170
L solid.

67
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.790
Now what I'm gonna do is just copy that a few times in just a copy and enter.

68
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.270
Enter.

69
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.410
Enter on.

70
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.730
What I want to do is also have the pattern color in next.

71
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.490
I'm just gonna copy that on pace over here.

72
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.040
I also want tohave the what was the next one color showing a copy color and I'm gonna pace

73
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.360
that over here I'm gonna have Tintin shade copy.

74
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.980
And on the pace that over here on,

75
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.760
I'm gonna have pattern tint and shade.

76
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.090
Copy on Pace that over here.

77
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.410
So now you can see what we actually have is five lines of code each.

78
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.210
That does.

79
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.660
Waas.

80
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.960
What?

81
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.550
What this with end with does all with one selection.

82
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.330
So I'm just going to step through that code first long and execute this code so we can

83
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.480
remove all the highlights.

84
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.900
I'm just going to hit play and they go to conceal that.

85
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.530
Highlighting has been removed and they were going to step through this code one line.

86
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.610
It's a time just like we did in the last lecture.

87
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.520
So clicking the code press F eight selection special that's going to select all the cells

88
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.740
we want to manipulate.

89
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.420
Now,

90
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.120
with that selection,

91
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.640
I'm know,

92
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.610
going to say excel solid.

93
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.850
So notice what happens in this window.

94
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.550
You can see that the line in between the cells,

95
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.920
this has disappeared so it looks like excel solid actually does perform a function.

96
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.650
So let's just say does do something.

97
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.390
Okay,

98
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.290
so now we know that that particular line does something.

99
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.280
Now let's execute this line that says Paton color index equals X l automatic.

100
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.430
So pay attention to what's going on over here.

101
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.180
Press F eight.

102
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.490
Andi doesn't appear to do anything,

103
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.950
so it doesn't appear to do anything.

104
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.280
Okay,

105
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.670
we're gonna test this shortly.

106
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.410
So now we're on selection dot Interior Dark color equals 65535 No,

107
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.510
I remember from the last time we executed this line by line that changed all the cells to

108
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.990
yellow.

109
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.980
So let's just hit F eight.

110
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.920
Boom on may go.

111
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:10.670
That one turn soul shall live tens cells yellow on the next one was Tintin Shade equals

112
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.030
zero.

113
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.180
So pay attention to what's going on here.

114
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.950
Nothing appears to have happened,

115
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:24.510
so let's just copy that comment a copy Andi paste so that it doesn't appear to do much on

116
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.990
then last one.

117
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.920
Let's just scroll back about selection.

118
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.430
Interior pattern,

119
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.650
tint and shade equals zero Selects just F eight through that and that didn't look like it

120
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.610
did anything either.

121
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.560
So let's just paste that comment in there.

122
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.760
Okay,

123
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.500
So now we can see we have achieved exactly what we achieved with the end with with five

124
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.580
individual lines of code,

125
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.170
but by doing that.

126
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.320
We did learn something interesting.

127
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.600
We saw what had an effect on what didn't have an effect.

128
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.790
So Patton excel solid,

129
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.850
does something.

130
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.710
So I'm just gonna comment that and say good,

131
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.640
because that does something.

132
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.540
Color index equals X l automatic didn't look like it did anything.

133
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.340
So what I'm going to do with this line is ram it out by just adding an apostrophe on that

134
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:24.280
now becomes when I click off green because it's now a comment and no line of excusable code

135
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.280
.

136
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.990
Now,

137
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.410
Cullum absolutely did something.

138
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.150
I'm just contemporary and saying that was good.

139
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.200
Onda also Tintin shade didn't appear to do much.

140
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.240
So I'm gonna realm that by hitting on the posh free And when I come off the line,

141
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.770
you'll notice it turns green Onda pattern Tintin shade also didn't appear to do anything so

142
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.250
again I'm gonna rim that out by hitting an apostrophe one I click off that will go green.

143
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.190
So now I am going to.

144
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.540
In fact,

145
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.410
I'm just gonna ramel of those from there will delete them shortly.

146
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.660
So just stick in a pottery in front of them and that means they're non execute herbal code

147
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.530
right.

148
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.450
So let's clear our format in by run in this macron,

149
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.330
they go way back to where we were Never.

150
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.670
Let's step through this and see what happens.

151
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.820
So I'm hitting F eight that selected all of my cells.

152
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.880
I am going to work with that selection.

153
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.790
Say I am working on the dot interior.

154
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.250
I'm going to use excel solid and notice what happens in this sheet.

155
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.210
Yep.

156
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.030
Those little lines in between the cells have disappeared.

157
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:40.760
I'm gonna choose color 65535 That delicious yellow f right end with on a select 016 or 16

158
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.250
So that looks like it has done exactly the same thing that it did before.

159
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:53.200
But this time we have 123 less lines of code executing.

160
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.850
So let me just pit play because it was still on in sub.

161
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.130
So they go,

162
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.710
the code is finished executing.

163
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.220
So now what we can do is we can get rid of the rubbish.

164
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.500
So that little demonstration we can hit delete.

165
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.530
We know that Patton index collapse doesn't do anything so we can delete that and we know

166
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.890
that Tintin shade on Patton Tintin shade also do nothing,

167
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.110
which we actually have a clue.

168
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.800
If we look at the clear formatting because Tinton shade equal zero patent tint and shade

169
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:32.270
equal zero are exactly the same values whether we call it in the formulas or be removed the

170
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.740
color from the formulas.

171
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.500
So it would be a safe bet to say,

172
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.890
like,

173
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.980
see if they If these values are exactly the same as these values and this colors it in and

174
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.050
this uncle is it,

175
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.100
we can probably safely delete these two lines too.

176
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.980
Oops.

177
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.460
I think I deleted too many lines.

178
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.410
There s so we should end up with just one delete on delete.

179
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.370
Okay,

180
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.710
so let's go ahead and delete those Onda.

181
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.510
Let's test this code just to make sure that by deleting those,

182
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.100
we still get the result we want.

183
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.150
So it's hit play.

184
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.270
Boom,

185
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:08.780
they go.

186
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.580
All the calls have been removed.

187
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.200
So it looks like after all of that,

188
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.220
what we actually only needed was a single line of code.

189
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:22.300
So what we can do with this particular line of code is we don't actually need a with

190
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.200
because we're only doing one thing.

191
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:32.680
So what we actually wanted to say with the selection cell Select selection dot Interior Doc

192
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.070
Patton equals X l non.

193
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.790
So I'm just going to come here.

194
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.440
I'm gonna hit,

195
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.020
delete.

196
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.680
I'm gonna come to the end.

197
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.630
I'm gonna hit Chile,

198
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.120
which is gonna bring that line up one.

199
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.640
I'm just gonna move down.

200
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.220
That will screw.

201
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.450
Gee,

202
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.230
it's all over,

203
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:53.890
And I'm just gonna back space and delete that end with So now we're down to three lines of

204
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.940
code in this particular format in this particular function.

205
00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.920
So here,

206
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.270
we're going to execute this code.

207
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.170
I'm just gonna hit play.

208
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.430
I'm not going to step through it.

209
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.290
Bang,

210
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.840
they go.

211
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.050
All the cells are highlighted in white or highlighted in yellow.

212
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.780
And now I'm gonna hit,

213
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.440
play and execute this code on who we Eman invalid or unqualified reference.

214
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.480
So let's click.

215
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.090
OK,

216
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.790
and have look what happened.

217
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:24.410
Now we have a space after interior and you'll notice here that we have no space,

218
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:30.030
no space or here we have selection dot immediately special cells,

219
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.410
close brackets immediately dot immediately select.

220
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.810
So let's just delete that space and let's try running that again.

221
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.320
They go on That worked perfectly.

222
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.710
So whenever you have different properties off each of these words.

223
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.670
You can't have a space between them.

224
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:54.890
It literally says selection dot interior adult pattern equals X l numb so we can run this

225
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.540
code to cover them in on.

226
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.450
We can run this code to uncle of them.

227
00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.050
Now,

228
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:05.800
we have greatly optimized the code here by taking out two or three or for whatever it waas

229
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.760
lines of code.

230
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.460
Which means if we had eight lines of code and we now have four lines of code,

231
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.220
it's gonna execute twice as quickly on That's the difference between making ugly code that

232
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.030
still works a more elegant code that only has what it needs.

233
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.600
Okay,

234
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.940
now,

235
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.830
in the next lecture,

236
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:29.440
we're gonna have a look at further refining this one down here because we can make it even

237
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.680
mawr efficient.

238
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.350
Okay,

239
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.650
I'll see you in the next lecture.
