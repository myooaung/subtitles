1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
Okay,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,600
guys.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,630
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,740
And here they are,

5
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,780
the 15 golden rules of coding.

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,090
This is a downloadable resource from this lecture.

7
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,460
I highly suggest you download it printed out and keep a copy with you,

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,180
particularly as you'll start in your code in Korea.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,390
Sit to these 15 golden rules and you are not going to go far wrong.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,980
Right?

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,060
Number one work on a backup.

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,790
There is no undue.

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,730
I know that when you work in Excel,

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,800
if you make a mistake,

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,600
you have that comfort feature of hit in the undo button.

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Not so when you make a change using code,

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,270
there is no undo.

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,850
All you can do is close your file without saving and then reopen it.

19
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,280
The drawback is that any work that you did do is lost.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
So always wear coming back up.

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,260
There is no undue okay number to think through the process.

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,090
The guy who got me into programming originally all those years ago told me If you can

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,260
describe how to cross a road precisely without getting killed,

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,670
you can lend to program.

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,270
So as long as you think through the process and adopt that philosophy when your programming

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,010
you are not going to go far wrong.

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,960
All of these rules are built in to this course natively.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,700
So we're gonna explore them as we go through the course.

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,430
So number to think through the process.

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,550
Number three,

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,950
test test and test again.

32
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,230
If you write a particularly exquisite piece of code that works beautifully on one data set

33
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:29,230
,

34
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,370
test it on a few more data sets just to make sure that there are no little bugs in there.

35
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,430
So test test and test again.

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,470
Number four,

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,750
keep a macro book.

38
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,180
Now,

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,150
Macro book is just next cell filed that you're going to save is a macro en abled workbook.

40
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,320
And your macro book is gonna hold all the really useful bits of code that you're ever going

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,190
to need on.

42
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,240
We're gonna build a macro book as part of this course.

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,630
Okay,

44
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,520
so number four keep a macro book number five be explicit.

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,310
VB a Can't guess No.

46
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,400
By default,

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,250
unless you code it differently.

48
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,160
Whenever your code executes,

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,200
its gonna execute on the sheet that you're looking at on on the work book that you are

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,930
looking at.

51
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,880
And that may not be what you want.

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,440
It to do.

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,690
We're going to cover this fully in the course that don't worry,

54
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,210
Teoh too much at the moment.

55
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,300
But just remember,

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,140
be explicit.

57
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,840
Okay?

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,600
Number six code simply Andi in small chunks,

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,150
although is going to be tempting to write 10,000 lines of code.

60
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,500
If something goes wrong,

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,880
it's gonna be a nightmare to try and debug it and find out where the error is.

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,920
So I highly suggest you could simply alley in small chunks.

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,430
Just write a little bit of code.

64
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,120
Make sure that works and then progress.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,770
Okay,

66
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,270
Number seven Realm extensively.

67
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,290
Now Ren is short for remark,

68
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,460
and all that means is it is a comment in your code when you work out what something does.

69
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,350
If you add an apostrophe and you're going to see this throughout the course,

70
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,970
you can add a little note that describes exactly what that little bit of code does,

71
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,930
and that's going to make it so much easier if you come to look at the same code a year

72
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,550
later and you think I don't know what that does So realm extensively.

73
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,610
We'll cover that in the course took Okay,

74
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,770
Number eight re usual code.

75
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,750
This comes back to the macro book.

76
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,510
If you write a brilliant piece of code or a brilliant routine that does something,

77
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,490
keep it in your macro book.

78
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,870
There's no point in writing it again a year later.

79
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,010
Just go back and re use the code that you've already written.

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,540
Okay,

81
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,820
Number nine Code iterated Lee,

82
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,270
though,

83
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:41,770
is going to be really tempting view to solve every problem all in one huge piece of code.

84
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,210
I strongly suggest that you break your larger problem into smaller problems and solve each

85
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,470
one individually.

86
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,300
So number nine code,

87
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,380
it's relatively numbers 10 and 11.

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,320
Shorter code runs faster,

89
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,850
but ugly code still works Now have put that in here because everyone I've talked to program

90
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,500
whenever they write a program at the start of their program in Korea will look at it again

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,700
year later and say,

92
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,890
I could do that in half the mantle lines.

93
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,150
Probably true.

94
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,430
Shorter code does run faster,

95
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,390
but if you're ugly,

96
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,600
code still works.

97
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,880
It still works.

98
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,410
Okay,

99
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,870
that's 10 on Day 11.

100
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,110
Number 12.

101
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,400
Use the built in translator,

102
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,490
and that is the macro recorder.

103
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,920
The macro recorder,

104
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,380
Although it'll often generate many lines of code a lot of which you don't need.

105
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,980
It's very useful for telling you the structure of what it is that you're trying to do,

106
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,160
and we're going to cover that throughout the course.

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,550
So Number 12 use the built in translator number 13.

108
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,310
Is there a function for that?

109
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,950
Most of the functions that are built into Excel are already built into VB A,

110
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,370
but not all of them.

111
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,630
But if there is a function that you can do in excel,

112
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,030
then we have a really neat way of making that function available to V.

113
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,250
B.

114
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,470
A.

115
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,020
And we'll cover that in the course to.

116
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,340
So number 13.

117
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,260
Is there a function for that number?

118
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:07,980
14

119
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,010
There is always more than one way if you can write a piece of code.

120
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,440
The works perfectly is solid on repeatable,

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,940
but it looks different to someone else's solution.

122
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,090
Don't worry about it.

123
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,980
There is always more than one way and number 15 have fun,

124
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,820
and I guarantee when you start to automate your routine tasks,

125
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,030
you're gonna have a lot more time to have fun.

126
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,810
Okay,

127
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,950
their number 16 off 15 is used Google.

128
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,060
Years ago,

129
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,590
when I started to learn to program.

130
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,120
Google wasn't even invented.

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm not even sure the Internet was invented.

132
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,750
But I can guarantee you if you have a particular problem.

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,930
Someone else has already had the same problem on there will be a least half a dozen

134
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,320
solutions on Google.

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,450
So if you come across a particularly sticky situation,

136
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,980
your first move should be go to Google,

137
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,230
type in VB a excel,

138
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,160
and then what it is you're looking for guarantee you're going to find some solutions.

139
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,630
They may be very complex solutions,

140
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,310
but by the time you finish this course,

141
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,670
you will be able to break them down and simplify them and make them more elegant.

142
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay,

143
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,230
so there they are,

144
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,890
all 16 off the 15 golden rules of programming.

145
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,200
Stick to these and you're not going to go far wrong.

146
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,810
Okay,

147
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,030
I'll see you in the next lecture.
