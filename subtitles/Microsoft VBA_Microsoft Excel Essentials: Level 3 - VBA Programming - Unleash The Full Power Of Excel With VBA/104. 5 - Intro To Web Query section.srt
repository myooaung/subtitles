1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:02,940
guys.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,680
And welcome to this action.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,130
This action is completely dedicated to retrieving data in real time from the Internet.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,390
Now there's masses and masses of data on the Internet.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,880
It's very easy to pull the data from there.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,040
You may need to do a little manipulation with what you get,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,960
but basically,

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,720
if the information is on the Internet,

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,390
you contrary,

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,660
vit with VB a code.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,790
Import it into excel for use.

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,750
However you want to do it on their there is a downloadable resource from this particular

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,780
lecture called Super Weird Web query that Excel s X.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,850
And in there you will find this section here called Get Your code here.

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,940
And this is all the code that we're going to go through during the course of the upcoming

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,590
lectures.

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,230
Andi In she one,

19
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,430
you will see the sheet.

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,960
Now what we have is this beautiful chart,

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,550
and I'm just going to click that chance because that's how we run the macro and you can see

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,510
no down the bottom left inside.

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,360
We are just getting the weather forecast from Rome on.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,100
This is gonna be completely live as own record in this lecture,

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,110
and you can see,

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,560
the messages just changed.

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
And we are now retrieve in the weather forecast for Cancun.

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,020
And any second now will be populating our final one,

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,050
which is London.

30
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,840
So it's going to go to the Web service.

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,450
There you go.

32
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,920
We're just getting the weather forecast from London on.

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm going to show you exactly how you do that.

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,200
How you had these little messages on the bottom.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,850
Left inside on they go the day tress fully retrieved.

36
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,890
I'll see you in the next lecture will start to deconstruct exactly how you achieve this

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,310
Also,

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,250
you in the next lecture.
