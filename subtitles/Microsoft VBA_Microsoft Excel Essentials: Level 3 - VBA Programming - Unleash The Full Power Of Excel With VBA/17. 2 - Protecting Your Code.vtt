00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Okay,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:02.730
guys.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.740
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.830
And in this short lecture,

5
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.580
we're gonna have a look at probably one of the most important things you're ever gonna do

6
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.120
in your code in Korea On that is learning how to protect your code.

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.580
So imagine you've created a masterpiece of programming.

8
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.650
But anyone who knows almost anything about Excel can just come to your excel file hits

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.450
alternate 11 get straightened your code on break it.

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.970
So we're gonna prevent them from doing that.

11
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.650
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna come up to the tools menu on from the tools menu.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.440
We're going to choose VB a project Properties on this little window is gonna pop up here.

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.970
Now,

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.050
ignore the first half of the general tab.

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.210
What we're gonna look at is this one the protection tab on what you want to do or what you

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.500
may want to do is look project for viewing on.

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.690
But that's going to do is stop people seeing your code.

18
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.360
So I'm just going to type the password in here.

19
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.610
I'm just typing Hello on.

20
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.710
Hopefully if I forget that I can watch this video back in America,

21
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.010
get back into my coat,

22
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.740
so it's gonna click.

23
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.340
Okay,

24
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.920
I'm gonna close that.

25
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.590
I'm gonna hit,

26
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.250
save,

27
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.830
and I'm gonna close this.

28
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.750
Now I'm gonna go and open up my macro book,

29
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.200
and here we go.

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.300
Enable the content on.

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.060
I'm gonna turn off that warning about updating alone genitals in f 11 and you can see this

32
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.490
is the V b E.

33
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.850
As it stands now,

34
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.550
if I hit the plus,

35
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.630
it's going to say,

36
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.850
what is the password?

37
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.590
Luckily,

38
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.940
I remember it's hello.

39
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.100
So his skin type in the password and click.

40
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.650
OK,

41
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.450
and then here I am back to where we were just a second ago.

42
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.490
So I if it's if it's a sensitive piece of code or if it's a really important piece of code

43
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.490
,

44
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.980
strongly suggests that you password protected.

45
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.660
Ah,

46
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.590
Word of warning.

47
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.560
There is almost no getting around a forgotten password,

48
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.610
so make sure you keep a note of it somewhere securely.

49
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.510
Okay,

50
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.780
I'll see you in the next lecture.

51
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.340
We're gonna have a look at objects,

52
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.020
methods and properties.

53
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.470
I'll see you in the next lecture
