00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
OK,

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.150
guys.

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.450
Now,

4
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.300
in this short lecture,

5
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.820
we're gonna have a look at how we can get around this hard coding of the path to a specific

6
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.300
file on no.

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.940
So far,

8
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.780
at the moment we've looked at how to hard code using something similar to this you'll

9
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.230
remember from the last lecture.

10
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.290
We also had the word demo tanked at the end of this another backslash.

11
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.570
But what this is going to do is bring up the folder pick out which is called the MSO file

12
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.980
Dialog folder picker,

13
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.110
which you'll get if you're in Excel and you hit control or no,

14
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.130
and it goes to the open file dialog box.

15
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.680
Now there are many versions that this is a simple Google will turn up 100 of them,

16
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.290
I would imagine,

17
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.950
but this was particularly useful because it allows us to personalize that.

18
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.600
So what we have is basically so with end with thing going on here on,

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.710
we have different options.

20
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.830
So we say dark yellow,

21
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.220
multi,

22
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.810
select false because we only want them to be able to pick one folder.

23
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.750
Now we're going to be reading the name of this to the folder name Variable,

24
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.010
which have declared publicly above next weaken.

25
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.760
Do it normally just say is open up the top left hand corner.

26
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.880
But using the dark title,

27
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.450
we can actually specify the text that appears in there.

28
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.430
So what we can actually say is a personalized message.

29
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.610
Please select the folder containing the fouls you want to import.

30
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.600
I'll show you this in action in the second Britain name normally just says OK or cancel.

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.810
Well,

32
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.090
here we can change what the okay says to say,

33
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.270
select this folder.

34
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.940
So once they're pointed and clicked a folder they know select this whole that is the button

35
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.690
they should press now,

36
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.240
this one,

37
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.250
the initial file name here,

38
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.790
rather than go into my computer and then having to navigate through eight levels of

39
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.240
directories to get them to wear roughly they should be we can get them to roughly where

40
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.950
they should be by specifying initial the initial file name right here.

41
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.390
So I've left at the demo part,

42
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.050
and I'm gonna allow us to pick the demo folder.

43
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.680
But it's going to take us to see uses our desktop.

44
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.150
Obviously you will change this to suit your own needs,

45
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.790
but that's going to take us there.

46
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.140
So then we come to an if test if dot show equals minus one that just says,

47
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.310
Has the council being pressed on here?

48
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.050
This stuff here,

49
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.370
I just had this in for books.

50
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.870
Test him.

51
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.750
Obviously you can put whatever you want into books.

52
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.490
Test eso Basically,

53
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.070
that's it.

54
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.660
It will open the folder the the MSO file Dialog folder picker,

55
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.720
and it will allow us to pick folder on Read that path to the variable folder name.

56
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.460
So let's just step through that code.

57
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.810
Andi,

58
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.830
here we go.

59
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.440
So he can see we have please select the folder containing the phones you want to import.

60
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.850
Select this folder.

61
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.120
So we're going to click demo and begin a click Select this fall.

62
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.640
That and then when they hit f eight hover over,

63
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.920
fold the name you can see that we now have the full path.

64
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.770
See users Alain de stock desktop demo.

65
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.520
Okay,

66
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.950
in the next lecture began.

67
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.900
Have a look at modifying that loop where we opened and closed the folders to make it even

68
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.640
more useful.

69
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.170
Okay,

70
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.750
I'll see you in the next lecture.
