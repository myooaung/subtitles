1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:02,970
guys.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,440
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,930
Now,

5
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,220
this is kind of a bonus like chap.

6
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,490
No,

7
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,560
it's not actually about variables,

8
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,440
but we've done a lot of calling toward the subroutines to demonstrate the variables in the

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,620
last few lectures.

10
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,030
Now,

11
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,690
what this bonus Lakes was actually about is how do you call code that you've written in a

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,230
completely different workbook that is calling code that lives in a workbook aside from the

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,810
one that you want to use it in.

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,230
So what I've done is I've added another tab.

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,800
He had the bonus subs from another workbook because the conflict ended in longer than that

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,150
in there.

17
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,160
And you'll find this code in the variables download.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,400
Now,

19
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,980
what I've done is I also have a cleverly created where rich gone.

20
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,030
Another workbook that I've opened.

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,040
There's nothing in this.

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,130
It's just literally another workbook called my other workbook.

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,400
So what we're gonna do,

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
you're just gonna write a bitter code very quickly.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,140
So I'm coming over to the visual basic editor which is here and in the subroutine in the

26
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,020
project area for the my off the workbook I'm gonna insert and modules are going to come up

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,330
to insert Go to module and they go.

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,590
It's just a regular module and I'm going to say Ah,

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,260
sub Rome me lips.

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,100
I've got my caps.

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,360
Look on.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Let me try that again.

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,910
So So,

34
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,890
actually put that right.

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,170
Sobe run me and I'm going to say something simple.

36
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,050
Range A Actually,

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,040
we don't wanna write it.

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,960
They say range a 12.

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,150
Just making this up as you go along.

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,750
Range a 12.

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,310
Don't Value equals.

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,660
I ran.

43
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:54,310
I can't type until this from elsewhere.

44
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,690
Okey dokey.

45
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,580
So there's our code,

46
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,610
and it is in a sub called Run Me In the Workbook.

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,290
My other word books.

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,550
Now let me just flip back Teoh to the variables workbook so we can steal that code.

49
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,710
And this is the only bit we're actually looking for this bit just here.

50
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,470
So I'm just going to copy that and come back up to here and I'm gonna insert amount module

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,590
in the variables workbook in a set.

52
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:21,800
Now,

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,130
I can't upload a file with modules in it,

54
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,340
so you're gonna have to add this in yourself,

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,050
but here we go.

56
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,550
So sub on and my test will call this.

57
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,190
So my test bump and paste that code in there.

58
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,200
So what we have is application dot Run.

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,010
Now notice The use of the apostrophe is here because we have spaces in the name of our

60
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,790
workbook.

61
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,550
We need to have an apostrophe at the front of the name on apostrophe at the end of the name

62
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,690
after the file extension,

63
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,290
but before the module.

64
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,630
So what we're doing is we're pointing to application dot Run open brackets,

65
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,400
quotes apostrophe because we have the space is mild.

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,580
The workbook on that's oops,

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,890
Sorry.

68
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,690
That's this one over here.

69
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,460
I keep getting the windows.

70
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,850
Things slide in driving me mad.

71
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,180
Eso were pointing to mile the workbook dot XLs m.

72
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,850
It's actually excellent sex.

73
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,640
This I think it is Excellent sex,

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,520
Andi.

75
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:33,350
I am pointing to module one so my other workbook docked x l s x apostrophe module one

76
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,450
because that's where that code lives dot Run me because that was the name of our subroutine

77
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:39,450
.

78
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,610
So let me just,

79
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,010
uh,

80
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,850
just click on here and let us run that coz I'm just gonna hit old an F eight to step

81
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,790
through the code and then it's gonna immediately jump to the other workbook module one that

82
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,480
subroutine his F eight and they go Ram,

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,830
This which turns that really goes well.

84
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,260
I run this from elsewhere.

85
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,700
Then we're gonna hit every it f eight.

86
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,380
And there you go.

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,280
That's how you call a subroutine in a module that lives in a completely different workbook

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,280
.

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,870
OK,

90
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,410
I'll see you in the next lecture.
