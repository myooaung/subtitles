1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Okay,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:02,590
guys.

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,740
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:03,920
Now,

5
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,310
we're gonna have a look at a butchered version of that open all files in folder.

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,800
Now,

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,570
you'll remember that the code looked pretty much like this.

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,200
Originally,

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,860
we had a hard coded path to the folder which we're now going to use folder picker for to

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,500
get the folder name so we can do that dynamically.

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:30,020
But here on had added on my criteria before we just add Thea wildcard character and dot

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,540
Excel.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,610
But there were actually going to build a string.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,400
So theory Jinling code looked like this,

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,580
so that's gonna be option to if you want to load all of the Excel files.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,690
But if we look at this here,

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,700
what we may want to say is we just want to pull any file or open and act on any file that

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,740
begins the 2016 12.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,080
Or we may just want to do be completely oblivious to the year in the month and just do

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,780
anything from the south or the East or whatever combination it is that you want.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,670
So what we have here just at the beginning is this option one Now again,

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,110
I have a publicly declared my criteria on variable right at the top of the screen on what

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,760
we have is my criterion equals input box and we've used in pop boxes before.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,290
Please enter the unique string of the fouls you want to open.

25
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,220
So we could enter 2016 12.

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,640
Just get the 2016 12 files or Southern and just get all of the Southern files.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,600
Or whenever we wanted to do Onda open the files containing the word that's gonna be our

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,210
title.

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,480
Then we're just gonna have a logical test that says,

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,330
if my criterion is blank,

31
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,050
that is nothing has been entered.

32
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,440
Just end the subroutine right there.

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,750
Now we come down onto this Now here we had this hard coded we said,

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,350
full name equals directory.

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,850
Fold the name Andi.

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,780
Wildcard dot Excel World card wildcard.

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,620
All we've done here is we've said file name equals directory.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,440
Fold name?

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,250
Andi.

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,680
Ah,

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,860
wildcard Onda.

42
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,550
Whatever the criterion is,

43
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,880
we've just entered in our input books.

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,310
Onda Wild card again.

45
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,400
Now we have wild card at the beginning and the end because we don't know where the

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,160
particular string that we were gonna enter into my criteria is going to appear if its way

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,650
out front or way at the back we need or somewhere in the middle we need to cover all

48
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,650
eventualities.

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,660
So we have a world card of start.

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,250
We have a wild card at the end.

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,500
Andi,

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,630
we're only looking in Excel files.

53
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,310
So again,

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,750
enclosed in quotes dot Excel,

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,030
question mark Question marks that's going to capture any XLs ends in the Excel accesses any

56
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,990
version of an Excel file that will capture as long as it has my criteria on that,

57
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,100
we've just entered somewhere in the file name,

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,480
and then we get back onto the normal stuff.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,120
Do while the file name doesn't equal blank.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,360
Then we're gonna loop through,

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,620
do some clever code here.

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,920
Then we're going to close the file.

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,640
And here is where it moves through the next file that matches this criteria.

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,530
So what we're gonna do here,

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,080
we're gonna add a sub to another thing on.

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
We're gonna work on the data,

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,980
gather at where we're actually gonna open the file and then do something useful with it.

68
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,470
Okay,

69
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,790
I'll see you in the next lecture
