00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
Okay,

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.360
guys.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.060
And welcome to this section.

4
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.630
Now you'll find a downloadable file from this lecture,

5
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.010
and it's called folder Creation.

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.760
A gizmo dot x l s X.

7
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.120
Just download that folder and you will find all the code to its in here.

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.350
Get your code here.

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.240
Now,

10
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.660
just to give you an idea what this is gonna do If you ever need to come to create a

11
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.450
complete directory structure,

12
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.980
you'll know how painstaking that come because you're literally you'll come to a folder.

13
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.430
You're right.

14
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.700
Click.

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.530
You'll add a new folder whenever new folders you and then you're safe,

16
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260
older than your renamed the folder.

17
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.800
And perhaps you're gonna want folders inside of folders,

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.250
and it can take an absolute age.

19
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.360
Wouldn't it be an awful on easier if you just said I need folders named Project 123456 All

20
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.570
the way through to 15 you press the button on all of a sudden over here,

21
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.980
all of your folders magically created and named exactly as they appear in this list.

22
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.080
Not only that,

23
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.510
what if you had a hyperlink that when you clicked it it would open up the folder to project

24
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.550
one or it would open the folder to project date.

25
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.620
No more having to navigate around windows to find your folders.

26
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.250
So far,

27
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.850
so good.

28
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.970
So let me just delete all of those on.

29
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.260
Let me delete all of those.

30
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.800
But what if Ben me Just one second I do ever files to save me.

31
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Typing insulin again?

32
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.060
Coffee here we get.

33
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.480
What if we had a similar task,

34
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.210
But this time,

35
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.490
rather than create a single level folder structure what we wanted to do for coming the ABC

36
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.880
all the way through age.

37
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.120
We also want tohave inside that new folder.

38
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.680
Another folder called Invoices one for purchase orders One crane know someone for all this

39
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.970
stuff Or wouldn't it be great if we could just click a button?

40
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270
Do that on magically.

41
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.180
All of those folders are created when you go into company eight.

42
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.200
You have credit notion voices of the suspects orders in coming to company C do the same or

43
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.090
hit your high plane.

44
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.160
Go to company G.

45
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.820
Whenever we are.

46
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.400
There you go.

47
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.250
A wound that save you an awful lot of time.

48
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.080
Okay,

49
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.610
The code is very simple.

50
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.600
We're going to go through it.

51
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.350
It's a fast and furious pace.

52
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.770
Because by this point in this course,

53
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.320
there's going to be nothing in there that you haven't seen before.

54
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.160
And you're gonna be able to follow it really easily.

55
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.040
Okay,

56
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400
Enjoy this section on.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.950
