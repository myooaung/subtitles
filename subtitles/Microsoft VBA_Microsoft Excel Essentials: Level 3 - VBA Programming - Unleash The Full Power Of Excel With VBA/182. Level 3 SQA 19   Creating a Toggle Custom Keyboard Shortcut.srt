1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,200
Okay guys and welcome
back to another student.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,195
Questions answered lecture.

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,730
Now this question is
from Danish, Ahmed.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,575
I'm a Danish asks is,

5
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,645
Is it possible to create

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:16,875
a custom shortcuts such as
using Control shift in G,

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,245
where all the grid
lines should be hidden.

8
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,825
But if we hit
control shift in G,

9
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:24,210
again, they should
all be returned.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,360
So basically it's
an Excel shortcut,

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,955
the toggle something on or off.

12
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:32,205
Now it's really
straightforward to do.

13
00:00:32,205 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm going to walk you through
it here in this lecture.

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,350
Now, all we need to
do is record both of

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,885
the options for so we're
gonna go to developer,

16
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:41,785
we're going to hit Record Macro.

17
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:44,870
Then what I'm gonna do is
put control, hold down,

18
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,689
Shift and press G because
they're the shortcuts.

19
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,715
That's the shortcut
that we want to use.

20
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,755
I'm going to press Okay, now,

21
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:54,620
I just want to get the
bones of the code for now.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm just going to
select all the cells

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,965
by clicking this little,

24
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:00,410
this little box up
the corner here.

25
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,720
I want to come to view.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,370
And I'm going to
click grid lines

27
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,855
now I'm just going to click off.

28
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,610
Then I'm going to click
the little box up

29
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,980
the corner to select
all the cells again.

30
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,750
And I'm going to
click grid lines

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,985
back on and then I'm
just going to click off.

32
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:15,950
And that's basically
all we need to

33
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,170
do to get the bones of the code.

34
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,210
So now I'm going to
press Stop recording.

35
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,715
And I'm going to go to
the Visual Basic and

36
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,115
have a look at the code
that we've just generated.

37
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:26,585
So here it is,

38
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,210
the keyboard, shortcut,
Control Shift and g,

39
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,270
and we have self-select active
window display grid lines

40
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,530
equals false.

41
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,530
Then self-select active
window display grid lines

42
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,715
equals true.

43
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,360
And then we've got a random
range, E Eight select.

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,410
So I'm just going to change
that back to A1, one Vega.

45
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,555
So all we need to do here is

46
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:49,850
just introduce a logical test.

47
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,880
So what we're going to do is
we're gonna say, here we go.

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,990
Let's say the chances are that
they're gonna be visible.

49
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,400
The grid lines will
be visible the

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,260
first time we open Excel anyway.

51
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,180
So I'm going to say if,

52
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,160
say active window ductus,

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,885
my grid lines equals true,

54
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:08,780
then and here's
our logical test.

55
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,390
So if it does share a true one,

56
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,500
I'm going to do is leave

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,340
that cell select and active
window grid lines false.

58
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,395
So if the grid
lines are visible,

59
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,480
make them not visible.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,190
Else.

61
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,559
Select the cells.

62
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,885
And if they aren't visible,

63
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:30,545
that is the displayed with
lines true equals false.

64
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,390
Then select the
cells and make them

65
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,165
true and make them visible.

66
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:38,045
And then just end if,

67
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:40,985
and then just range
A1 at the end,

68
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,460
select nowhere will
run this code,

69
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,140
but let's just take a
look at that in action.

70
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,370
So here's Excel.

71
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,665
I'm going to hit
Control Shift and G.

72
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:49,415
There you go.

73
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,110
All the grid lines
of disappeared.

74
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,540
Now I'm going to hit
Control Shift and G again,

75
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,910
and now they're all
back. So there you go.

76
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,380
We have one macro with

77
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,240
the keyboard shortcut
assigned to it,

78
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,795
the toggles, a particular
feature on or off.

79
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:04,820
I'll run that code for
you and I'll make it

80
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,085
downloadable as a resource
from this lecture.

81
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,230
One more thing
before we go, guys,

82
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,575
I've just run the code and
I've dropped it in here.

83
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,810
But the one thing that
I had forgotten to

84
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,555
mention is if you copied
the code and paste it in,

85
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:20,165
it loses its shortcuts.

86
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,130
So I'm just going to quickly
talk you through that.

87
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,455
So I've come to the
Get your code here,

88
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,390
Control and C to copy it,

89
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,195
go to Developer and go to

90
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:33,515
Visual Basic, insert
regular module.

91
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:35,825
And I'm just going to
drop the code in there.

92
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:38,885
Just like we do with
all the other curves.

93
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,300
Now, if I just flip
back to Excel for a

94
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,695
second and try the control
shift in G. You can,

95
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:47,825
you can see that
that is what we get.

96
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,630
That is definitely not the
code we were looking for.

97
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,130
So what we're gonna do is go

98
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,735
to fund the developer ribbon.

99
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,610
We're gonna go to Macros.

100
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,035
We're going to click the macro,

101
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,115
which is macro one,

102
00:03:58,115 --> 00:03:59,975
and we're going to say options.

103
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:01,970
Then we get this
little box back.

104
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,530
So I'm gonna hold down shift
and G and then click Okay.

105
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,195
And then cancel.

106
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:13,430
Now if I hold Control Shift
and g, it toggles off,

107
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,065
control shift in G,

108
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:19,340
toggles on, off, on, off.

109
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,995
And that's how you get your
shortcut keys back in.

110
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,315
Obviously, once
you've done that,

111
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:26,525
then save the workbook
as an XLS m macro,

112
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,660
Macro Enabled Workbook and
everything will be fine.

113
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,335
That's it.

114
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,090
Have a great day.
And if you have

115
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,755
any questions, do let me know.

116
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,180
I'll see you in
the next lecture.
