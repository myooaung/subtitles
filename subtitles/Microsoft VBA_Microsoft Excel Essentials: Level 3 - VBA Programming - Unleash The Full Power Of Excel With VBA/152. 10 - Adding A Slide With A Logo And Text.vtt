00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.600
guys.

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.530
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.270
I've just realized it didn't actually type dim off there.

5
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.220
So that's not gonna work.

6
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.250
It'll so and then we have dim prez name as strings.

7
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.230
Let's just test that code running through and make sure that that works.

8
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.190
In fact,

9
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.950
we'll just run it.

10
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.550
So I'm moderately sure that that will work.

11
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.790
Please enter the presents.

12
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.360
A name here.

13
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.550
So it's a it's me,

14
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.650
Ellen.

15
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.940
John,

16
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.880
this boom it center.

17
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.870
And there we go.

18
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.580
There is our power point presentation already for to us toe add our first light.

19
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.840
So fantastic.

20
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.090
So,

21
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.340
man,

22
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.310
let's have a look at how we can add the slide.

23
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.060
So the first thing I'm gonna do is add Slide one,

24
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.410
which is gonna be the name by subroutine to are running order.

25
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.220
And here I'm going to say private.

26
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.780
So Oops.

27
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.690
Private sub slide one,

28
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.600
OK,

29
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.220
and they were going to do the Lego coding will come down to here on what we actually want

30
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.400
is a title on subtitles.

31
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.490
That's going to be layout one.

32
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.810
So I'm just gonna copy that code that I want a whizz back up.

33
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.820
Sit up on in here.

34
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:15.430
I'm going to say that I'm going to say Lay out one eso that is out slide and slide title

35
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.650
and subtitle.

36
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.090
Okay,

37
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.430
Now,

38
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.820
in our presentation,

39
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.640
it could be that we want the company logo to appear somewhere on the sheet.

40
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.210
So the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna add a company logo.

41
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.980
So here in the base code,

42
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.710
uh,

43
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.190
that,

44
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.600
sir saved image.

45
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.700
That's this code right here.

46
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.100
Obviously,

47
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.530
you will change your path.

48
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.850
Here.

49
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
A copy with all the way back up.

50
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.220
Sit up and we're on slide one where?

51
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.050
Slide one.

52
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.510
Their slogan on this is where we're working.

53
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.690
I'm gonna add our image,

54
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.040
so add a saved image.

55
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.850
Changes destination path pursuit.

56
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.540
Absolutely.

57
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.850
So here we have PP appetites active presentation that slide,

58
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.540
slide one.

59
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.540
And we are on slayed.

60
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.570
One add shapes.

61
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.860
And this is the path to my particular picture.

62
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.930
So I'm just gonna unr em.

63
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.150
That and here is our code.

64
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.580
So what we're gonna do is wrong that code up to there and make sure that that works or PCI

65
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.580
.

66
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.330
So here,

67
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.460
I'm gonna run this entire thing.

68
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.660
So create PP.

69
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.250
Press slide one and then destroyed the valuables.

70
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.970
So let's have a Look at that.

71
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.950
Alan Jervis.

72
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.570
Andi,

73
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.610
Enter on And there we go.

74
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.430
So here's our first slide.

75
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.940
We have our click to add title on our subtitle on We have our image here,

76
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.600
so let's just get back to that code for a second.

77
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.370
Let me just flip back to excel.

78
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.820
Where are we?

79
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.370
So here we go.

80
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.970
We have the save with document mso.

81
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.280
True.

82
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.970
That means when we say the presentation,

83
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.640
the image will stay on there Now.

84
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.610
At the moment we have left 100 top 100 with 100 height 100.

85
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.640
And if I just moved that at the way,

86
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.650
you can see that that is positioning the image just there.

87
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.270
But what we actually want is the image to pay at Web.

88
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.350
He asked somewhere,

89
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.530
perhaps at the corner.

90
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.660
Say,

91
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.550
say about that.

92
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.670
Let's also say we don't want it to be that big,

93
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.900
So let me just don't do that.

94
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.540
And what I'm gonna do is hold down shift.

95
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.850
So it maintains the aspect ratio when I reduce it.

96
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.110
So let's say that's how we want it to look.

97
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.710
So we've manually positioned it on the PowerPoint presentation.

98
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.740
Now,

99
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.740
his clever thing.

100
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.340
What we're gonna do is right.

101
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.910
Click the image and choose format picture that's gonna open this little box up here on what

102
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.970
we're going to do is click on the size and properties on.

103
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.580
We're going to do this size fair.

104
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.940
So what we're gonna do is have a look a size and we can see that the size is too 0.52

105
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.980
centimeters.

106
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.680
Okay,

107
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.800
let's remember that.

108
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.570
I'm just going to come bring this back up here now.

109
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:06.920
You'll remember that the this is expressed in points said the width of 100 is 100 points on

110
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.270
what we actually want to do is convert that to 2.52 centimeters.

111
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.260
So what we're gonna do at the top is create another to valuables.

112
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.000
So we're going to say dim and we're going to say C m centimeters as.

113
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.010
And it's going to be a single precision variable because it's just got three decimal places

114
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.010
,

115
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.780
so dim cm single andare looking a using.

116
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.820
But we really also use inch and we will dim inch as on interject because that's 72.

117
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.100
So it's whole numbers so dim inch as interject Jeff.

118
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.280
Okay,

119
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.520
And now what we can do in our creation routine is set those up here.

120
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.920
So what weaken do you say?

121
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:04.750
See em equals on day 28 0.346 on while we're here,

122
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.990
I'm not going to use inch.

123
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.140
But if your local if your local measuring system is imperial,

124
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.040
then maybe you'll want to and will say inch equals 72.

125
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.850
So now we have a really clever way of dealing with this.

126
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.900
So what we can say Because we know our height is 2.52 centimeters.

127
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.150
We can say our height is 2.52 times C M,

128
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.390
which will now have a value of 28.346 on weaken.

129
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.250
Do exactly the same with the with.

130
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.870
So we can say 2.52 multiplied by centimeters,

131
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.020
which is going to know from here on,

132
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.380
we can now also look in our position.

133
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.850
So if we come over here a bit,

134
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.850
where are we?

135
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.820
I need to move that little more at the way.

136
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.070
The position If I hit the down arrow there scroll.

137
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.670
Ah,

138
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.580
horizontal position here is 30.36 centimeters from the left.

139
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:16.940
So 30.36 left is going to say now 30.36 times centimeters.

140
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.950
And that just leaves us the top to deal with.

141
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.500
So where are we?

142
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.160
Vertical from the vertical position,

143
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:37.000
which is top is 0.68 So he asked the tough was going to say 0.68 times centimeters on that

144
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.240
code should give us this exactly as it appears here.

145
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.260
So let me just close that without saving Drink that back into shot at Let's just run that

146
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.750
Kurt again presents his name That's going to get annoyed.

147
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.240
Andi,

148
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.140
they dio.

149
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.140
And now we have our image.

150
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.550
They're perfectly OK.

151
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.970
So far,

152
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.450
so good.

153
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.560
Next thing we need to do is add a title.

154
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.910
So we're gonna come down here on we're gonna add In fact,

155
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.760
what are we going to use?

156
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.520
The title?

157
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.650
We'll use range A one a czar title.

158
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.630
So we're gonna come down to the base coat text at in Texas.

159
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.130
We're going to use the index number one,

160
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.390
sir.

161
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.650
It's gonna be the first image,

162
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.400
the title image.

163
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.700
When you say people slide and we'll use this one because Max is already says range a one so

164
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.900
copy up to here.

165
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.030
They go without it.

166
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.100
Our logo on there,

167
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.780
we're gonna add title title,

168
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.760
and then we're gonna add subtitles So and sub title on.

169
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.850
We're going to say almost the same thing.

170
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.140
So we can just copy that code,

171
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.900
their pace it underneath.

172
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.510
But this time is gonna be shaped,

173
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.210
too,

174
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.590
because it's the second box.

175
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.280
And what we're actually going to do is say that equals press name,

176
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.920
and that should work.

177
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.550
So let's room that code there.

178
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.550
Okay?

179
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.990
Hit.
