00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Okay,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.510
guys.

3
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.500
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.870
Never ontological test three c on.

5
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.540
This is a logical test.

6
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.470
Checking if one criteria is true.

7
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.210
Run one craters twice a term that if one criterium is true Andi,

8
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.050
the other iss false.

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.870
So we know what mostly code does.

10
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.420
So we're just gonna step through this all the way down to the test on.

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.180
Here we go,

12
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.330
so you'll notice.

13
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.740
The difference is if the active seldom value equals male.

14
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.450
Andi,

15
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.440
the active soldat offset zero comma,

16
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.490
three sets.

17
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.870
33 columns across value does not.

18
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.950
Rips does not equal brown.

19
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.460
Then do this,

20
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.830
if not moved down the self you concealed move the active cell offset down here.

21
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.490
Okay,

22
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.490
so here we go.

23
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.090
The active seldom value equals male and the active cell offset does equal brown on.

24
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.340
We're looking things that do not equal brown,

25
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.180
which is the less than and greater than characters.

26
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.120
So we're just gonna come down to the active cell offset live and again.

27
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.200
But this time it's happy because the active seldom value is male on the active cell offset

28
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.580
Three columns across is black,

29
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.930
which is not equal to brown.

30
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.300
So this line of code executed because one test was true on the other test was false,

31
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.250
which is exactly what we've tested for.

32
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.650
So I'm just gonna hit play.

33
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.330
So there you go.

34
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.780
There,

35
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.750
all of our answers already in there.

36
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.660
It is a man,

37
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.580
but he doesn't have brown hair.

38
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.580
And that will be true for all of those.

39
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.110
Run this code and test it if you don't believe me.

40
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.930
Okay,

41
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.570
let's have a quick,

42
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.900
sneaky peek out what we're going to come up to next.

43
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.490
Okay,

44
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.790
you have another program in project.

45
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.250
Should you choose to accept it?

46
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.240
Copy and paste the code immediately above in here on converted to using the cells.

47
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.010
So again,

48
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.840
we've used the active celled up value,

49
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.370
and we've been offsetting.

50
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.980
But convert that to use cells and you'll know,

51
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.030
use the for next loop with the X and you on the X increases by one.

52
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.910
Okay.

53
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.680
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look in it,

54
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.450
checking whether either of the criteria is true.

55
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.950
I'll see you in the next lecture.
