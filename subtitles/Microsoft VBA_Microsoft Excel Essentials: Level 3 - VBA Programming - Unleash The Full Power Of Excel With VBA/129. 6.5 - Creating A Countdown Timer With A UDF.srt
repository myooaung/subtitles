1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Okay,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,780
guys.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,810
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,010
Now,

5
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,430
let's have a look at another function.

6
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,030
But this time,

7
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,300
one with a few more moving parts.

8
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,720
Now,

9
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,980
what we're gonna do for this one,

10
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:17,450
as we're gonna say function and we're gonna call it be day can't down Andi,

11
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,350
We're gonna say we'll stick with my value.

12
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,350
My value as very it rips very,

13
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,120
aren't there?

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,650
Where are we?

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,810
My value as variant bump bump.

16
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,450
Okay,

17
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,350
so this is going to give us a countdown timer to our birthday or any date in the future.

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,240
So let's just get was back to excel.

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,730
Say 25th of 12 2016 that is.

20
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,100
Let me make that so you can actually see the 25th of 12 2016.

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,770
Let's imagine,

22
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,820
that's our birthday.

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,640
Now here.

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,030
What we could say is now on,

25
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,450
we can see that currently it's the second of October 2016 at 8 38 in the morning on we can

26
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:03,570
also say equals whips equals that minus that looks notes the other way around.

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,000
Alan's equals that minus now so we can see that we're currently as I recall,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,060
this 83 0.639 blah,

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,270
blah,

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,980
blah days away from Christmas.

31
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,450
Okay,

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,430
so what?

33
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,130
We have a few elements in there.

34
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,490
If we wanted to return,

35
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,540
he says that number,

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,340
we could literally just write this calculation here inside the dysfunction.

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,180
But what if we actually wanted it to say it's X amount of days and this many hours and this

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,040
many minutes and this many seconds?

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,360
Well,

40
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,160
that's what we're going to do in this lecture.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,150
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a few variables.

42
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,040
So here,

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,870
we're going to say,

44
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,670
Let's set up the very boss,

45
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,920
the very balls on,

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,220
Let's say dim,

47
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,450
let's call Count Day.

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,480
Let's capitalize that.

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,060
So it's easy to read Count Day,

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,700
and I'm gonna make them always variances variance because we're not actually execute as

51
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,390
variant.

52
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,030
We're not gonna We're not gonna be calculating or we're not gonna be writing a piece of

53
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,620
code that's gonna run over 20,000 loans of data.

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,900
We're actually gonna be writing a piece of code that works on one eso who?

55
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,390
So let's have can't anyone else do.

56
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,680
We have.

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,820
We have ours.

58
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,800
So let's have cames Allah.

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,970
Let's have count minutes.

60
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:26,320
Manute on counts Second Okay,

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,100
so there are four elements we want to return the day,

62
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,880
the number of days,

63
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,550
the number of hours,

64
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,540
the number of minutes and the number of seconds.

65
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,960
Ok,

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,810
fantastic.

67
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,340
Then we need to do a calculation to work out each of those four elements.

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,640
So what do you say?

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,260
Count day equals on.

70
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,500
What I want to do is I'm gonna build this in ST someone say it's my value.

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,970
Minus now open and close brackets on.

72
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,940
That's going to give us essentially this.

73
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,920
That's this formula just here,

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,120
written in plain old excels in written in VB a code.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,980
Now what we do need to do is actually return the interview.

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,950
So if we become too if you want to come to the formula here,

77
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,500
what we would actually say here is int over brackets to come to the end,

78
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,050
close rackets on that would tell us interject valleys,

79
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,760
everything before the decimal place.

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,440
So we have 83 days.

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,420
So we're going to do is I'm gonna shrink that down is going to come in from to this here

82
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,050
and we're also going to say int on this will be a number.

83
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,240
So now we're going to return 83 just like we did in Excel.

84
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,770
Just there.

85
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,470
So so far,

86
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,030
so good,

87
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,650
we've managed to return the interject the number of days.

88
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,840
But what we were actually want this to do is be a string.

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,170
So what we're gonna do is we're going to concoct innate this and tag on the word day.

90
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,240
So I'm gonna add on.

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,940
I'm gonna adding quote a space because I want a gap between the number on the word days

92
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,370
that I'm probably gonna want a comma because we're going to come on to do hours,

93
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,410
minutes and seconds.

94
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,290
And then I'm gonna close the quotes.

95
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,760
So now that will return 83 at this particular moment in time,

96
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
Space days.

97
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,790
Fantastic.

98
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,610
Now we also have can tell us,

99
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,410
Can't on that is gonna equal.

100
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,410
And I know I haven't finished.

101
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:19,730
Yes,

102
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,590
let's just stick zero in there.

103
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,750
What I'm gonna do is just copy all of that from bottom up pace of their But instead of

104
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,230
saying into what I'm going to say is there were's It's our is Nick.

105
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,150
It's our Okay,

106
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,370
So our my value Andi,

107
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,850
it was on gonna copy that.

108
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,270
There we go.

109
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,240
And now I'm gonna be onto.

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,750
Let me just tidy that up a little bit.

111
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,160
There we go.

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,720
So they were going to be on camp Minute Newt.

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,220
And this time we're going to say instead of our mute or I can type a Z,

114
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,780
Everyone who's watched any of my goals is Will know Min Utes Eso we should say that no

115
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,670
minutes minute.

116
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:15,120
There we will say minutes here so minutes and finally we want the seconds so crappy pace

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,740
underneath.

118
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,490
And this is Kent second,

119
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,390
second on.

120
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:28,400
We want Second Onda and we can no tied to this end.

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:37,480
Bit appear and say seconds exclamation point Lego We have no built using my value.

122
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,030
The input we're gonna work out.

123
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,200
What?

124
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,880
The day is Another word Days on the comment.

125
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,240
Then we're gonna work out the animals.

126
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,430
Then we're gonna work at the minutes,

127
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,450
and we're gonna build this string into the value be day countdown.

128
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,850
So what we're going to say is,

129
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,570
let me just copy.

130
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,480
It's actually that was safe.

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,980
Tell him in the entire thing in so being day came down,

132
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,020
got be,

133
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,140
Stick that in here.

134
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,790
And that is gonna equal there.

135
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,180
We're gonna build it all together.

136
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,450
We're gonna say Count Day,

137
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,940
game day and groups,

138
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,720
not times.

139
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,870
Andi can't our Andi times again.

140
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,160
Eso We have missed the and offer there.

141
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:26,590
So we have count Day Can't our helps minutes can It's second And then when I click off,

142
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,700
if they all capitalize,

143
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,460
I've got it right,

144
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,220
OK,

145
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,050
so now let's get rid of all of that.

146
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,060
In fact,

147
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:40,190
let's put that back in 2015 12 2016 On here I'm going to say equals B day and you can see

148
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,050
Here we go be day countdown open brackets.

149
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,500
I'm gonna point to the date that we're looking for closer brackets Hiss.

150
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,900
And that may go 83 days,

151
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,590
15 hours,

152
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,450
14 minutes and 59 seconds to Christmas.

153
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,990
No,

154
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,950
here's the thing.

155
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:02,160
What we actually have there is a formula that if we If if we hit f two and come back into

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,410
it,

157
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,020
you can see that it changes.

158
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,320
But if we hit F nine hit in f nine that you can't see that it does not re calculate.

159
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,820
So there is something that we can add into this code that's gonna make it re calculate.

160
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,550
So here What I'm gonna say is application dot volatile.

161
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,210
And when you say application dot volatile,

162
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,630
particularly you spell application correctly application dot Volatile.

163
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:36,850
This forces a recount on F nine or Cal Canal.

164
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,970
They so No.

165
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,620
Every time they hit f nine,

166
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,820
it's going to re calculate because it is volatile.

167
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,280
Now,

168
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,810
obviously,

169
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,920
we've gone through a long and complicated process to actually build that string.

170
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,630
What we could do,

171
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,850
instead of doing all of these steps,

172
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,660
is actually put in something that looks just like this of his one of prepared earlier.

173
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,200
So here we have exactly the same thing.

174
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,900
But we have used these individual calculations and built them into a string in just one

175
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,320
line.

176
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,240
So if you want to do it that way,

177
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,390
that's perfectly fine.

178
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,720
And then you could either just delete here and you could ram out all of this Or you could

179
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,840
delete it and literally just have that as your function.

180
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,690
Okay,

181
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,820
I'll see you in the next lecture,

182
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,940
where we're gonna have a look at a function where we have more than one argument.

183
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,360
OK,

184
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,700
I'll see you in the next lecture
