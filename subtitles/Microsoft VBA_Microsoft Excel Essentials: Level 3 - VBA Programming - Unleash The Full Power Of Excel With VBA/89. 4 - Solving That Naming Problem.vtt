00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
Okay,

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.710
guys.

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.720
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.880
Never gonna have a look at solving that naming problem.

5
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.250
You'll remember from the last example that when we created the chart,

6
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.030
the second time through it was called chart to,

7
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.680
but original recording macro called.

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.030
It's Chart one here and chart one here.

9
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.670
Now,

10
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.950
you would like to think that the name of an active chart restored in active chart dot name

11
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.950
.

12
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.920
Unfortunately,

13
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.950
that's just not the case s.

14
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.480
So what we're gonna do immediately after we've created it is in here.

15
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.130
This is where we want to change the name.

16
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.620
Now,

17
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.760
just to give you some idea of the amount of data that is incorporated into an active chart

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.760
,

19
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.110
I'm just going to create a watch on active chart and I'm just gonna execute echoed through

20
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.000
to that point.

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.990
So I'm just gonna come up to debug room to curse up,

22
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.160
run through the 1st 2 bits all the way down to here on active charts,

23
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.650
and you can see that we have a little plus in our watches.

24
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.920
Now it's prepare to be staggered.

25
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.800
These are all the different data points that are captured in an active chart on off each of

26
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.190
these.

27
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.260
We have an application with Mawr on Mawr on Mawr on there,

28
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.650
literally hundreds,

29
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.410
if not thousands of different properties to an active chart.

30
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.890
Okay,

31
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.260
so what I'm gonna do close that?

32
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.110
I think that's the point.

33
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.290
Made him delete what I've just done.

34
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.790
I'm going to save you an awful lot of time and tell you where the value actually lives and

35
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.600
it actually lives in active chart dot parent dot name.

36
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.770
So here,

37
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:54.670
I'm going to say active chart dot parent dot name equals I'm just gonna call it profit by

38
00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:05.870
day by day chart on that will get around our problem each time someone call it profit by

39
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.130
day.

40
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.540
Charter.

41
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.460
Need to put that into quotes because this is actually going to be the name off the charts

42
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.110
of copy number replace child one with profit by day on route place chart one.

43
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.380
Their with profit by day on DNO.

44
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.160
Let's execute that code of deleted the one that we ran a little bit earlier.

45
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.020
So I'm just gonna debug run all the way through to their room to cancer.

46
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.540
Fate a fate a fate all the way through on.

47
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.320
There you go.

48
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.910
No,

49
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.690
Our code works perfectly,

50
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.230
and that is our newly created charting.

51
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.010
If I click on it,

52
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.380
you can see that it's called profit by day.

53
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.880
Now we looked at in the code,

54
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.950
scaling wherever that scum where we go,

55
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.720
Here we go,

56
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.390
the scaling,

57
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.090
and I've even put a comment in there that scaling is very untidy.

58
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.490
The most definitely is.

59
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.120
But luckily,

60
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.850
I have a really clever way to get the scaling to be absolutely pixel perfect on.

61
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.680
We're going to cover that in the next like shop,

62
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.850
so I'll see you that.
