1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
OK,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:02,840
guys,

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,310
Now,

4
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,060
so far,

5
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,700
so good.

6
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,480
But what happens if we want to test form or than one criteria?

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,230
Well,

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,290
this piece of code here is going to do just that.

9
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,660
Now,

10
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,290
most of it we already understand.

11
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,560
So I'm just going to step through.

12
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,910
So we're gonna select she clear the contents like B two.

13
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,560
Do what?

14
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,170
This is a do loop again.

15
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,400
So here's the do you Here's the loop.

16
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,420
Do while the act itself doesn't equal blank right?

17
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,550
If the active cell don't now e equals mail.

18
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,570
Andi Lego.

19
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,580
That's how you test for more than one criteria.

20
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,390
Andi.

21
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,180
The active cell offset zero comma three.

22
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,410
No role rows three columns,

23
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,940
which is gonna put us into column e equals brown soups.

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,460
If column B saves mail and column e say's brown,

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,080
then do this.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,550
Okay,

27
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,020
so we're just gonna hit their fate that didn't evaluate to True.

28
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,270
So obviously active,

29
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:10,140
sold up value equals male and the active cell dot offset zero comer three equals brown.

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,420
So we know going to execute our true statements so that to sell up to offset zero comma

31
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,980
five,

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,150
which is over here,

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,250
is going to say it's a brown haired man.

34
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,650
So there you go.

35
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,170
Now we're going to move down because we're using the range method.

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,620
We're gonna have to move down.

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,450
So that's the end of the logical test loop.

38
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,710
And again,

39
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,900
so active,

40
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,270
sold up value consume Harvin over it and it say's male active cell offset Say's black.

41
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,750
So this particular person has black hair.

42
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,670
So when I hit F eight,

43
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,110
it's going to skip over all these these lines of code,

44
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,100
and it's going to go to its else.

45
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,640
And what's going to say is just moved down yourself.

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,470
Okay,

47
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,690
on down Onda again and again and I'm happy that that's gonna work.

48
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,950
So I'm just gonna hit play.

49
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,470
So there you go.

50
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,230
It's no gone down and said,

51
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,530
If the person is male on and they have brown hair,

52
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,470
then right,

53
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,950
it's a brown head man in here so you can see that that that's worked perfectly.

54
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,800
Okay,

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,250
now,

56
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,830
if you're on the ball,

57
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,710
you will have noticed that there is some inefficiency in this code.

58
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,990
What I've done is I said,

59
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,820
if the values equate to true,

60
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,250
do this on,

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,650
then moved down the cell.

62
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,890
I'm gonna leave this in here so you can modify and you'll understand what it does that if

63
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,370
these evaluated true.

64
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,310
Do this on,

65
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,600
then move down a cell.

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,250
If it doesn't just move down the cell,

67
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,340
the more efficient way of doing Max I have this line of code in here twice,

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,660
or a different way of doing it is to put it just before the loop.

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,340
These will only execute once,

70
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,450
whether it's true or false.

71
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,440
And it will only execute once here.

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,900
But it just saves having more code written.

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,760
Okay,

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,210
so in the next lecture,

75
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,490
we are going to open a challenge.

76
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,320
Sub logical.

77
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,350
Three B,

78
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,660
this is one for you to write.

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:03,840
Ah,

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,160
yeah.

81
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,600
Copy this code here.

82
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,960
Paste it in here on converted to cells because we've used the range objects here on want

83
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,320
you to change these two cells.

84
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,070
Okay,

85
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,010
That should keep you going for a few minutes.

86
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,030
And in the next lecture,

87
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,900
we're gonna have a look at test in.

88
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,410
Receive one criteria.

89
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,420
Is troop or wrong?

90
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,530
One criterion.

91
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,410
It is true on one is false.

92
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,910
Okay,

93
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,350
I'll see you in the next lecture.
