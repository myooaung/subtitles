1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,750
guys,

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:02,860
um,

4
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,710
welcome back.

5
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,360
Now,

6
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,230
in this one,

7
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,190
we're gonna have a look at the complete code again,

8
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,330
and we'll just go through it as it executes,

9
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,970
and I'll talk you through what it does.

10
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,420
But I want to draw your attention to this tab down here called sub folder.

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,980
Structure on what we have in here on the names of the four sub folders that we want to

12
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,330
create in the new folders that were creating for companies A through H.

13
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:34,500
So company A will have these four new folders inside its folder as well company B C all the

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,700
way through to H.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,650
So this is the code.

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,260
We have four variables we have my path on.

17
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,050
I'm just specified my pathway at the top here.

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,850
So that way,

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,570
if we ever have to change the path,

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,720
we just lying change this line of code and we're golden.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,020
So in this instance,

22
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,590
it see uses Alan,

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,520
desktop slash my folders backslash.

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,650
Remember,

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,580
for this code to run your computer,

26
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,030
unless your name is Alan,

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,170
you're gonna have to change that to your path.

28
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,610
Okay,

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:10,550
so that's our 1st 1 structure array struck array is an array that is going to hold the

30
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,200
names of all of our sub folders.

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,750
Okay,

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,100
We have fold account,

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,130
which coming back here is going to be the count of the number of folders which we need to

34
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,760
know so we can re dimension era ray toe hold exactly the right number of folders.

35
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,140
Notice way at the top.

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,620
By the way,

37
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,280
that this is option explicit,

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,550
which is sorry is option based one which forces air erase the beginner number one.

39
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,170
It's also option explicit,

40
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,410
so it forces valuable declaration.

41
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,370
So that's our folder count.

42
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,110
How many folders are we're going to need to create a sub folder loop?

43
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,280
Well,

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,590
that's just a loop toe loop through to create each onthe e sub folder.

45
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,900
So let's just have f eight through there.

46
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:01,100
So this sheet here as a VB name of S h f l D stroked dot select were already selected fold

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,530
account.

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,420
We're going to use that range range a 12 a one end excelled down.

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,840
Doc can't and we can see that that is full.

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,660
Now we know that we have four folders or four sub folders.

51
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,840
We're going to re dimension are array to match that number Fall account F eight Solar array

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,970
is now set up with four elements,

53
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,390
one each for each of these four things.

54
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,630
Now we're just gonna loop through the sub folders from one to fold account and we're gonna

55
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,360
lewd into on the first interational.

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,380
Some folder,

57
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,310
loop one,

58
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,990
the cells,

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,060
some folder loop,

60
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,690
one duck value,

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,370
which is 11 So it's going to be this cell.

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,950
And then when I looked through again,

63
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,980
it's gonna be to one,

64
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,440
cause it's road to now because of all the loop is now in its second iteration from Bom bom

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,090
bom bomp.

66
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,050
And there we have invoices in array Position one poet sorts into credit notes in three and

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,130
other stuff in four share Index,

68
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,440
Stop,

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,420
Select Back over to here,

70
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,120
B four,

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,730
Select.

72
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,310
This is all looking very familiar.

73
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:16,000
This code up to this point is identical to the code that we've just created other than the

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
fact that I now have my path on the active cell to the left.

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,360
So make directory my path.

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,350
I'll live through Alu three once,

77
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,250
and then we'll have locally in action.

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,280
So now we're going to go through the sub folder loop and this is an inner loop inside the

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,680
wider outer loop.

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,710
So we have a while when glued on the outside and inside.

81
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,030
Once you've created that folder,

82
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,920
we go through the same routine.

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,760
But we'll go through it four times because we have four folders.

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,150
So again,

85
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,360
we're going to use the same structure we're going to loop through when I hit F eight whips

86
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,470
when I hit F eight.

87
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,980
So some folder loop is going to be number one on the first pass through,

88
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,660
and that is gonna pull structure array Number one,

89
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,500
which holds the name of our first son folder,

90
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,730
said the path is exactly the same.

91
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,950
Still m k still the i r.

92
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,320
But it's no looking inside its parent folder,

93
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,580
which is company A on the second pass through that loop structure array will be worth two.

94
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,480
So it's going to return the second some folder 34 on,

95
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,690
then down to here and then loop through again on again.

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,830
Okay,

97
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,030
Now,

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,020
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop that.

99
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,150
I'm gonna expand this window.

100
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,030
I'm going to bring up that fold referred and find it for me.

101
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,810
Just one second.

102
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,790
My folders have deleted what we've already done.

103
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,990
And you still can't say it again the second year in a car seat.

104
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,070
So now I'm gonna delete these,

105
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,850
cause we're not particularly interested on these eye blinks again.

106
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,770
Delete shift cells left whichever.

107
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay,

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,010
so now we have companies A B C D.

109
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,200
Through to h with a subject,

110
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
a sub folder structure of invoice,

111
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,810
poachers,

112
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,640
criminals and other stuff that we want to appear in.

113
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,530
Each of these.

114
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,220
This is the directory we are looking at and let's just hit the button.

115
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,300
So there go all of our hyperlinks.

116
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,260
Here are all of our folders and I clicked.

117
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,260
Company A.

118
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,180
You said we have a fold of credit notes.

119
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,230
Invoices of the suffering purchase orders.

120
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,590
Obviously,

121
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,370
these are alphabetical company.

122
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,680
Be exactly the same thing on on and on and on on day.

123
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,490
There you go.

124
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,280
You've just created a complete directory structure,

125
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,310
including sub folders.

126
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,290
Okay,

127
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,650
I'll see you in the next life
