1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Okay,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,260
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,200
Never can have a look at manipulating the text that the uses entered in response one on

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,480
response to I'm just going to leave that from there by using some casing statements in V B

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:16,800
A.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,530
So this is exactly the same coaches before of no fully remarked it.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,970
So you'll be able to understand what it does and what I'm gonna do before I build my string

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:25,970
.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,520
It's going to give myself a few spaces.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,880
So what I want to do is step through this code and get a so far through,

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,530
so into your first name.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,590
And I'm going to say,

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,160
Alan,

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,380
but I'm going to state in lower case and hit.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,070
OK,

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,270
so now,

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,950
in response one,

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,290
I have Alan in lower case,

19
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,940
so before a execute line to because once I do,

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,280
it's gonna move straight down to here on.

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,830
I want something to happen in between times.

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,650
I'm going to say response one equals you case,

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:04,150
which stands for upper case response one.

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,310
So whatever value is in response one,

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,370
replace it with the upper case version of response one on.

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,930
Now I'm gonna hit F eight so I can get response to on this summer.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,460
I'm gonna type it all in uppercase.

28
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,920
So I'm gonna say Jarvis on hit.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,640
Okay.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,360
Now,

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,500
before we get past this line,

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,370
I know Want to say something very similar.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,700
I want to say response to equals.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,930
L case,

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,400
which is lower case response to.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,810
So no notice what happens when we execute over this?

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,750
Currently response one says Alan in lower case,

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,490
but we're about to change Response one to you.

39
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,810
Case response one.

40
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,890
So when they hit F eight response one becomes Allen in upper case because we've just

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,850
changed it here.

42
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,350
And similarly currently response to saves Jarvis in capital letters.

43
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,010
But we're going to change it to l case.

44
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,540
Jarvis in capital letters.

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,670
So when I press f eight were no gonna have Jarvis all in lower case,

46
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,610
and I'm just gonna play the rest of that code out on notice.

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,210
What it says.

48
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,250
Pleased to meet you.

49
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,920
Capital letters,

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,480
Alan.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,880
Lower case letters,

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,820
Jarvis.

53
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,210
Now,

54
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,630
it could be that we want a proper case.

55
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,270
Everything.

56
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,870
No upper case is you case.

57
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,760
Lower case is l case.

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,980
But to use a proper case,

59
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,620
that is,

60
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,110
have the first letter of each word capitalized.

61
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,190
We're gonna have to call on one of excels built in workbook functions because there is no

62
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,020
vb a equivalent,

63
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,590
so we're never going to build the string that does that.

64
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,370
But what we're gonna do is do it to my string.

65
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,780
That is the combined string here.

66
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:58,220
So what we're going to say is my string equals applicator whips can't type application,

67
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,350
don't worksheet function.

68
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,830
I could just click that now that would be quicker.

69
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,370
Application dot worksheet function dot proper open brackets.

70
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,490
And there you can see it's asking for argument.

71
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,220
Wanna string?

72
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,510
So what we're just going to say is my string and close brackets So they go,

73
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,360
my string is gonna equal application worksheet function dot proper my string.

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,770
So,

75
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,340
no,

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,150
I'm just gonna run through that code loan to Same and to your first name,

77
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,300
Alan.

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,610
Enter F eight into your second name,

79
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,870
Jarvis.

80
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,850
Okay,

81
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,310
that's going to convert it to all uppercase That's gonna vote it converted to a lower case

82
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,820
that is going to build their string,

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,290
which saves.

84
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,110
Pleased to meet you,

85
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,550
Alan.

86
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,490
In all capitals.

87
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,160
Jarvis,

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,860
low case.

89
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,790
And then we're gonna complete that string and converted all to proper case F eight and

90
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,190
naked.

91
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:58,070
See that my string has the first letter of each word capitalized because we used the

92
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,240
application worksheet function dot proper and no one I write it to that cell,

93
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,440
you can see that that's come out in proper case.

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,360
OK,

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,150
in the next lecture,

96
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,800
we're gonna have a look at the input box method,

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,490
which is slowly difference the input box function,

98
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,850
and you'll see the use for it.

99
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,650
When we get that,

100
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,890
I'll see you in the next life.
