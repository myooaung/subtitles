1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Okay,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,630
guys.

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,100
And welcome back now,

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,430
before we get into code in this project promptly.

5
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,170
One I want to do is talking through this code here.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,660
And this is called Private sub Simple.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,330
Send email original code.

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,250
And this is my e mailing routine.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,120
And I have used this literally hundreds and hundreds of times.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,730
Every time I create a project that requires emails to be sent,

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,680
this is the base code that I use.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,120
So there are a couple of things that you need to know when you control in external

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,320
applications within the office suite searches at local word is you have to die.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,270
Mention them as objects on the only do you after dimension the application.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,260
You also have to dimension the objects within the application.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,700
So the very first thing we have here is dim outlook as or outlook app.

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,550
And you can call that only thing you want ugly.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,700
Say so dim outlook app as object that creates an object for the outlook application.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,160
Now,

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,070
because we're gonna be sent in an email,

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,570
an email is an object within outlook.

22
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,890
So we also have to dim the outgoing email as an object to no my body text.

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,110
I normally take the data from the spreadsheet that I can build dynamically at runtime so I

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,700
can can Katyn eight different elements from different cells and that them all into a text

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,200
string here.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
And you can see here this is where this is built up.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,210
So okay,

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,730
we've got everything dimension.

29
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,610
There's objects.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,830
The next thing we need to do is set them and that means create them within our code.

31
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,990
So set outlook app,

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,440
which is the object we don't mentioned above equals create objects,

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,480
open brackets outlook dot application That creates an instance of outlook.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,730
And the next thing we need to do is to exactly the same thing for the outgoing email,

35
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,360
because that,

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,880
too,

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,940
is an object.

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,250
OK,

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,890
so we're going to set out,

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,220
look up and create the outlook application,

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,600
and then we're going to do exactly the same thing for the email.

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,490
Now here is the body text and we can add this dynamically at runtime or if you want to hard

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:14,970
code it,

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,750
we can literally just write words in here.

45
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,410
Obviously baby new line forces a new line and here we have high there on we could read the

46
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,470
person's name from the file.

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,460
Okay,

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,910
so obviously,

49
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,900
this is like one this line to this Line three.

50
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,500
This is lying for now.

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,160
Here we have turns off the error handling on.

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,640
If you don't do this,

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,650
what you're gonna happen when what's gonna happen when your code executes is you're going

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,790
to get a little poppet warning that says someone is trying to send an email from ever?

55
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,030
Look,

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,850
do you want to allow this yes or no?

57
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,450
Or words to that effect.

58
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:47,910
Now,

59
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,410
if we turn off the error handling here,

60
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,650
that won't happen.

61
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,160
So the emails were literally just be created.

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,410
Boom,

63
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:54,650
boom,

64
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,110
boom and sent.

65
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,740
Okay,

66
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,000
now,

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
here's the good stuff.

68
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,570
These are all the properties off the email,

69
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,340
and you will recognize and they are,

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,980
too,

71
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,210
which is who you're going to send it to.

72
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,670
If you are a hard code,

73
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,900
just one individual person just put the email address in here on,

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,690
That's who it will go to enclose it in quotes.

75
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,510
If you want to send it to two people separated with a semi colon just like out looked us on

76
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:19,510
.

77
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,150
Then again,

78
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,720
at the end,

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,330
closing quotes a riend out cc But obviously that's who you gonna carbon copy of Rammed ABC

80
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,870
say that.

81
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,520
So you're gonna blind carbon.

82
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,940
Copy.

83
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,690
The subject is obviously what's going to appear in the subject line.

84
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,750
And you can see the hard code that or you can build it dynamically at runtime.

85
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,770
Uh,

86
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,920
body is the text,

87
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,020
the actual message and you can see here.

88
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,550
We're just gonna populate that with my body text,

89
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,990
which we've done up here.

90
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,600
Now,

91
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,200
here we can solve the error trap that we did back up here.

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,190
So everything goes back to normal within the office suite.

93
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,660
Now,

94
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,600
the last thing you need to do is destroy the object variables in the reverse order in which

95
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,850
we declared them.

96
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,600
So the first thing we declared was the outlook app.

97
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,190
So that is the last thing we destroy.

98
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,570
And all we do is we say,

99
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,600
set the outlook.

100
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,000
App equals nothing on because we did the outgoing email the male itself as the 2nd 1 That

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,230
is the 1st 1 we do.

102
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,050
So we destroy them in the reverse order in which we created them.

103
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,720
Now there's a low debate on the Internet where you actually have to destroy objects after

104
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,610
you've created them,

105
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,890
some people suggests No,

106
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,370
because they're automatically destroyed at the end of the subroutine.

107
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,350
Andi,

108
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,040
some people suggest yes,

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
because you can get orphan objects.

110
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,710
I'm not entirely sure.

111
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,710
So up to be on the safe side.

112
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,680
I always destroy the objects.

113
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,430
Okay.

114
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,950
I'll see you in the next lecture where we'll have a look at how we're going to capture our

115
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,400
data to use in our email routine.

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,920
OK,

117
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,220
I'll see you in the next lecture.
