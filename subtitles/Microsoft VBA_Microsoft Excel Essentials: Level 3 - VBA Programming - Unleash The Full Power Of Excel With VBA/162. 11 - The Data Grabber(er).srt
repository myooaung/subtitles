1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110
Okay,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,600
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:03,750
Now,

4
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,810
this is a sober team.

5
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,010
We were just looking at This is the loot through all the files in the folder using the my

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,640
criteria and he at between the workbooks open on workbooks closed.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,350
I've put a call to a subroutine called Grab The Date at which we're gonna have a look at in

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,370
this lecture.

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,900
Now,

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,800
I'm just gonna was way up.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,530
So it's up here.

12
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,120
He can see all the publicly declared valuables folder,

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,370
name,

14
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:24,590
file,

15
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,140
name might try to which we've looked at in the last clue last couple of lectures.

16
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,090
And here we have a running order.

17
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,910
And this is a format that we've used in a lot of the projects you in this course.

18
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,360
So we have the get path to folder that gets us around.

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,300
That problem of having a hard coded path to a specific holder that we want to read files

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,750
from.

21
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,860
We have the loop through the files in a folder.

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,330
Now,

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,140
that is a subroutine we just looked at in which we have no placed a call to our new

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,890
subroutine.

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,230
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to step through this and get us to a new subroutine

26
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,250
which I've already written.

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,680
So my fault,

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,180
my fault files live in the demo folder.

29
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm gonna move through,

30
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,310
looked through files,

31
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,340
informed that this is what we just looked at.

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,080
So I'm gonna say 2016 12.

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,250
So any of the files that begin or have 2016 12 in them?

34
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,800
That is what I want to be looking at.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,870
So OK,

36
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,920
now I'm gonna hit Enter and or F ace F eight.

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,570
No,

38
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,370
that will be our folder name.

39
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,460
So it skipped all the 2012 11 files because they don't match my criteria.

40
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,730
So is our 1st 1 Alfa numerically 2016 12 Eastern region on While the file name doesn't

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:49,750
equal zero or blank workbooks open on that group's somewhere behind all of that will be the

42
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,920
eastern region,

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,300
so you'll notice the eastern region only has one shop in it.

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,750
Now,

45
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,140
I mentioned that for a specific reason and you'll see why,

46
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,420
as we go through this particular subroutine,

47
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,160
so basically we have region east date,

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,410
the date item,

49
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:05,920
quantity,

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,890
price and then sales and all the data down the bottom there,

51
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,500
so That is the fall that the File 2016 Eastern region now back to our code.

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,470
Never gonna call.

53
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,190
Grab the date at F eight.

54
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,110
And here it is,

55
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,110
grabbed the data.

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,590
Now there is There are there are a couple of not particularly complicated things.

57
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,950
Very useful things that we can learn in this.

58
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,050
Most of it is all basic stuff.

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,910
You can see that I have to locally declared variables called Start road and Stop row.

60
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,380
And as we get through the code and I show you where we populate these,

61
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,190
you'll see exactly why we have thumb.

62
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,810
So let's move through the code.

63
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,450
So again,

64
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,980
F eight this workbook activate.

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,440
So we are now activating the workbook where the code lives.

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,690
The mass data get Iraq workbook so F eight shirt.

67
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,110
Which sheets select again?

68
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,690
I'm gonna move this out the way a little bit.

69
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,220
You can see we have a couple of tubs and given them VB name.

70
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,010
So our data sheet as a VB name of shirt data on our which sheets sheet has a VB name of

71
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,760
ship which sheets.

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,380
So that way,

73
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,970
people can change the names on these on our code is still solid.

74
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,990
So back over here F eight a one select shop,

75
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,750
one so nowhere into a loop,

76
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,720
a basic error trap.

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,320
So if we find an error,

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,540
we looped down.

79
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,410
He Acto error Handler,

80
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,060
which is called Next Shop,

81
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,320
will get to that shortly.

82
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,330
So here,

83
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,920
the next thing we want to do is we want to take workbooks file name and you'll know that

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,000
that's the file name that we've just entered Criterion for.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,900
And it's the fault,

86
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,500
the file that we've just opened up work sheikhs,

87
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:57,330
active sound up Value Range a one current region which essentially it is they're on current

88
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,170
region being the equivalent of control and a so it's going to copy all of that day to that

89
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,170
.

90
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,580
Let me just come back here and come back here.

91
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,050
So what's going to do is copy that on.

92
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:15,070
We wanted to paste into this particular workbook Worksheets data range D one million

93
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:21,110
something or all the way down at the bottom of the column D go all the way up and moved

94
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,320
down one cell.

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,460
So what's going to do?

96
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,370
Essentially has come to column D.

97
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,140
It's going to start down here.

98
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,650
Technically,

99
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,950
it's going to start there with all the way back up and then move down one cell.

100
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:39,030
And that is where it's gonna pace its data from D Dem to wherever it goes now.

101
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,060
Because this says this workbook on We have worksheets data you'll notice of remnants out of

102
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,410
replace that with shirt date exits.

103
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,740
The VB name on that removes any chance of someone renaming the sheet on the code falling

104
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,160
over.

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,970
So we are on which sheets,

106
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,050
some coming back to which sheets I'm going to step through.

107
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,500
It is now looking at file name Eastern Region,

108
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,350
and this is going to a one off shop,

109
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,180
one active,

110
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,190
sold up value.

111
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,050
So that's the sheet name it's going.

112
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,180
Take the current region.

113
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,610
It's going to copy it to shirt data on whatever the first blank cell in column D's by going

114
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,210
to the but McCollum d going all the way back up to the top till it finds its first set of

115
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:22,750
data.

116
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,610
I'm moving down.

117
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,930
One someone hits have ain't bump.

118
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,250
And if I come back here,

119
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,410
there is all the data.

120
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,110
Now,

121
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,490
let's just have a quick look at this Start row,

122
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:40,710
Equal shirt data range a one million something or other all the way up and moved down one

123
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,570
on the stop.

124
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:49,950
Perot stop row is sure Data range D So where we just pace in our data all the way up.

125
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,410
Onda cross one.

126
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,290
So what we're gonna get here?

127
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,040
Is this cell row?

128
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,650
So we're going to get C or we're gonna get four because that's where we want to write our

129
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,780
shop name.

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm in the wrong thing all the way down to here.

131
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,650
Because here from four that troops from four down to 31 is where we want to say the name of

132
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,060
our shop and from be for them to be 31 is where we want to say the name of our region on

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,170
the period in a four through a 31.

134
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,200
So here I am just going to get those start and stop Rose bump,

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,720
bump.

136
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,260
So the start road is for on the stop.

137
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,570
Pro is 31.

138
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:41,070
Now we can build a string specifies this range explicitly using the correct start row

139
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,150
number on the correct stop row number.

140
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,670
So here,

141
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,770
basically what we're doing is this We're building a string that says range que 22 are to

142
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,560
value dot,

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,970
dot value.

144
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,280
He equals hello.

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,060
And essentially,

146
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,110
what that would do is write hello in every cell between K two and are too.

147
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,900
But what we're doing is we're building that dynamically,

148
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,870
using the start wrote in the Stop Pro.

149
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,820
So should data dot range underscored,

150
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,630
just breaks it the code down onto multiple lines,

151
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,170
open brackets and close brackets because we have toe have that when we specifying a range

152
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,190
on our star one is shirt data range.

153
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,130
See,

154
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,770
because we're gonna be populating column C as we are here.

155
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,350
So see,

156
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:32,370
here is the equivalent to the first K Aunt start row dot Address Andi on his are cool,

157
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:32,550
um,

158
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,530
Andi shirt data dot range,

159
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,890
see again and stop route.

160
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,950
And that's going to get a stand to 31.

161
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,980
So essentially,

162
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:51,910
what we said is C four to C 31 don't value equals whatever the active sold up value is

163
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,150
there.

164
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,540
So in this instance is going to say shop one.

165
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,750
And when I do that,

166
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,430
you'll see that shop one has been populated exactly in line with the data that we've just

167
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,400
written now.

168
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,990
Similarly,

169
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,990
when we get down tear.

170
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,840
Better be on the right sheet when we get down.

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,530
T we're doing exactly the same thing,

172
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,710
but for column B.

173
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,550
But this time we're looking at the workbooks file name.

174
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,190
That's the one we just opened the eastern region.

175
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,910
Worksheets active,

176
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,780
sold up value.

177
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,820
So it's got the right tab Shop one tab,

178
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,760
Range B one.

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,500
And if we have a quick local mayor range,

180
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,090
be one value on here.

181
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,240
So we're all tab shop.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,840
One be Wonder value equals east on just so we don't have to come back and have a look again

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,700
be to duck.

184
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,240
Value is the date.

185
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:42,120
So this is why it's looking on this sheet on shop one on B one and then be too so back to

186
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,510
here.

187
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,980
So we're doing the same thing from before to be whatever it was 31.

188
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,360
Write the name of the region on.

189
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,960
Then when we get there and here we're in column a four to a 31 right,

190
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,170
the value off the date.

191
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,080
So bump bump on error go to minus one now.

192
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,680
Previously,

193
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,750
we've always said go to zero.

194
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,450
There is It's a really technical difference between the go to minus one and go 20 on.

195
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,020
This guy at this link here explains it far better than I could.

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,900
So if you are interested in the technical differences,

197
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,690
go have a look at that because that's a marvelous explanation of it.

198
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,150
So,

199
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,050
f Let's just have a look at that day to know we've populated it.

200
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,700
So back to the data sheet.

201
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,670
So they go there.

202
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,570
We have the date,

203
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,580
the period in that the region,

204
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,600
the sharp and all the data that we want Shop one from that particular file.

205
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
So here we go.

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,660
Let's step through whips.

207
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,360
Make sure you're on the right sheet.

208
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,710
Allen,

209
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,690
They were gonna move down to shop to loop while the active cell doesn't equal blank.

210
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,120
So we do need to do that.

211
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,610
Here's our error trap.

212
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,730
Are next shop go through.

213
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,140
Here we go on,

214
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,950
we jump straight them toe ever trap because we're all looking for shop too.

215
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,030
But we only have shop one in the file.

216
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,880
So therefore it's arid,

217
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,420
so we're just gonna step through active cell and there were moving down to shop three loop

218
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,420
.

219
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,880
While it doesn't equal blank on their egos next,

220
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,530
now it's gonna be looking to shop three and it can't find that.

221
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,980
So that's going to air again.

222
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,520
It's gonna move down again.

223
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,020
No,

224
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,890
we're on a blank.

225
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,580
This will exit on and sub on.

226
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,710
What we want to do now is close a file with just opened f eight move to the next one.

227
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:31,050
So we're currently in Eastern when his F eight We're now going to be opening the northern

228
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,210
on when North opens.

229
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,670
Let me just show you the north ever go.

230
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,730
We have three shops.

231
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,950
We have shot one shop to on shop three in the north.

232
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,070
So then we can just call the grab data looped through all of this and you can pretty much

233
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,860
guess what's happening is Godel shot one has got all the shop to its looking for shop three

234
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:49,860
.

235
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,940
It will find shop three so it will build the data on.

236
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Then go all the way through.

237
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,770
Andi,

238
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,780
close the book And now we're onto the next one.

239
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:57,970
Bomb,

240
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,160
bomb,

241
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,330
bomb,

242
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,730
bomb bomb!

243
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,050
I'm just going to stop that there.

244
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,020
Close the sheet.

245
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,090
We've just opened because I think you get the picture on.

246
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,670
We can no see that our data is building So we have East shot one.

247
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,080
We know there's no other shops in the Easter.

248
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Then we move on to the fold the north.

249
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,330
But we have shop one shop to shop three on.

250
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,880
We're down to here now.

251
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,900
All we really need to do after this is clean this up because we have this region date and

252
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,690
item in there every time we copy the data over.

253
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,810
So let's just stop there And you'll know,

254
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,480
since the last thing in my running order is the clean up and this is very,

255
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
very simple.

256
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,830
Clean up is just going to come down to the sub clean up.

257
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,030
It's going to select shoot data.

258
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,460
So we're on the right sheet is gonna go to range D four,

259
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,710
which is Let's go here de full.

260
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,560
That one just there.

261
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,850
So it's gonna ghost deformed.

262
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,890
It's gonna test if it saves region,

263
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,530
then delete the entire Oh,

264
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,030
if it's safe date,

265
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,320
delete the entire oh,

266
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,900
or if it says item,

267
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,290
delete the entire road.

268
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,610
So that will delete everything that we know interested in and just leave the same data and

269
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,550
then we have an offset.

270
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,890
So if I just blank all of this out for a second and of Roma code through,

271
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,480
you'll see exactly what it does.

272
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,530
So from the beginning to end,

273
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,070
what we have is this.

274
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,590
I'll leave the screen updating on.

275
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,950
We'll say,

276
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,980
Look at that.

277
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,230
Look,

278
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,820
a turd.

279
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,580
The fold of my demo On this time,

280
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,010
we're just gonna be interested in Southern such a safe place to say,

281
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,630
s o You hit the enter bum bum bum bum bump and they go,

282
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:43,770
it's going to the South and it's retrieved Shop one on two for the first of the 11th 2016

283
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,740
and those we moved down the first of the 12 16 or equally,

284
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,450
we could just say,

285
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:48,920
You know what?

286
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,850
We're just interested in December.

287
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,750
So I already have that.

288
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,810
That that particular subroutine import data tied to this So I could say my demo selects

289
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,330
fall that I'm just interest in 2016.

290
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,540
December It's OK.

291
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,470
Bom bom bom bom bom On they go.

292
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,420
We only have data from 2016.

293
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,280
Okay,

294
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,310
and that's a you do it.

295
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,510
As always.

296
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,160
Any questions just dropped me a note,

297
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,350
and I'll be happy to help.

298
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,350
Have a great day
