00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Okay,

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.690
guys.

3
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.700
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.390
So as presentation starting to take shape,

5
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.570
we have three slide so far on our four slide.

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.620
Let me just close that what we want on our fourth slate is Thea.

7
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.430
Let's have a look.

8
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.060
We wanted this day to hear.

9
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.820
We want this.

10
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.770
We want this on.

11
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.300
We want there.

12
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.810
So we want this off the top.

13
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.290
Left this underneath.

14
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.330
And this is a nice big image on the right there.

15
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.970
We already have the code for adding chart.

16
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.210
Which was this one here.

17
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.100
So really,

18
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.630
all we need to do is change the name of this chart profit by day,

19
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.070
whatever that waas to the name off this which was pie chart.

20
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.550
So,

21
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.730
in true fashion,

22
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.700
just like we've done before,

23
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.760
we can never say a slight fall on day.

24
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.360
We're gonna copy alive,

25
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.430
slide through eight.

26
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.400
That was too fast.

27
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.080
Everything will be all the slide.

28
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.090
Three use code.

29
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.160
So from here,

30
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.120
use the arrow keys.

31
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.410
Alan,

32
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.380
that's gonna be much easier to control on.

33
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.890
Copy then.

34
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.850
Come up here.

35
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.090
It's a few lines on never gonna be working on this code again,

36
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.640
but we're gonna call this slide for we're gonna change the index number that same just

37
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190
having to remember everything again.

38
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.020
We're gonna use this exactly the same layout.

39
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.100
We'll delete the text box at the end.

40
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.780
Eso Let's just split this up So at the top were dealing with the title.

41
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.820
Eso No,

42
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.350
we actually want to say this is a key Performance.

43
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.680
Data isn't it's a rather saying that we're going to say this is the key performance Data

44
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.650
loops Capital.

45
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.450
So that's all Saints their title.

46
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.550
This is our bit map Now we did say that this is going to be a pie chart.

47
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.780
I think it was actually called pie chart,

48
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.160
wasn't it?

49
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.060
Let me just flip back to Excel Click that it's actually called pie chart.

50
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.050
I don't know if that makes a difference.

51
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.630
If it's not in the correct case,

52
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.830
I'll just correct the case.

53
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.660
So there we have most of what we need.

54
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.700
We have our title.

55
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.780
We have that image.

56
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.280
We're probably gonna have to play around with where it appears,

57
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.780
but we have our image.

58
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.810
So the next thing we want to do is we want to let me just shrink that down a little bit.

59
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.390
If Aiken graveled of V b e several it ever go.

60
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.480
Next thing we want to do is add these to pivot tables here.

61
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.200
But what we want to do is add them as an image.

62
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.160
And I'm sure in our base code,

63
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.600
we have a bit of code that does that.

64
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.910
So again,

65
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.390
I'm coming down to the banks.

66
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.500
Code down two images.

67
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.930
Here we go.

68
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.950
Pace arrange as a bit map.

69
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.990
So we're gonna copy that code on.

70
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.270
We're gonna wears way back up to the top.

71
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.770
Now what we're gonna do first,

72
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.220
it was just gonna drop them on there.

73
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.250
Then we're gonna position the manually so we we can get them exactly where we want.

74
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.530
And then we'll come back and modify the code to do that.

75
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.660
Programmatically So,

76
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.240
uh,

77
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.350
first,

78
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.380
uh,

79
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.460
what's That's a pivot table.

80
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.560
Is that at first pivot table Onda?

81
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.550
We can ram out that O ram that on ram That So here we have range a 23 to be 30 s o.

82
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.740
What?

83
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.850
We could actually do you say a 23 current region,

84
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.370
couldn't we?

85
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.750
So let's just say a 23 into a little that,

86
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.110
uh,

87
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.360
dot current region.

88
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.930
Obviously,

89
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.270
if you want to specify specifically,

90
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.780
You can say lips.

91
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.220
Okay,

92
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.450
Sure.

93
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.450
What you can say?

94
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.400
I have a space 12 minutes base in there.

95
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.990
What you can say if you do just want display a three through two fragments sake,

96
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.070
be level at least 27.

97
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.170
Just say a three to between seven.

98
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.780
But we're just going.

99
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.020
We want to capture the entire region there.

100
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.300
So that's our first pivot table range a 23 current region copy picture.

101
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.640
Bye bye.

102
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.800
Bye.

103
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.870
Bye bye on,

104
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.490
paste.

105
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.000
We may as well just copy that code directly.

106
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.810
Give ourselves a bit of room on pace.

107
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.680
Our second pivot.

108
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.090
So,

109
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.590
Pacer,

110
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.660
second of it on this is gonna be this one here.

111
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.230
So what are we?

112
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.250
And we are in D 23 So this is gonna be D 23 current regions.

113
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.260
Select on.

114
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.820
That's going to give us out pie chart there.

115
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.040
These are all gonna drop right on top of each other,

116
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.610
I imagine,

117
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.460
But we'll run it and then we'll modify the code.

118
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.270
So here we go into presentations and represents his name.

119
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.680
Can't even type my own name.

120
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.870
Bomb,

121
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.050
bomb,

122
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.210
bomb,

123
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.800
bomb bump.

124
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.730
So here we go.

125
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.090
Slide once like to slight three on slide for So there is our image,

126
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.990
and I'm guessing the other things yet the other things underneath it.

127
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.000
So let's just put these exactly where we want them to be.

128
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.850
So let's say line up with their that that looks okay on Let's have that.

129
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.590
Yeah,

130
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.840
I said that that Know that appear X terrible.

131
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.960
Put them wherever you think.

132
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.100
It looks good on this.

133
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.090
I'm going to resize that.

134
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.070
So it's just a little bit larger.

135
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.640
Say that big.

136
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.550
Okay,

137
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.120
so now we have this looking exactly what we want.

138
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.030
Eso.

139
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.620
Now what we need to do is learn where these things are positioned.

140
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.220
So what we're gonna do is right.

141
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.460
Click the pivot table,

142
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.610
come to format picture,

143
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.390
and that's gonna bring up this here.

144
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.280
We're going to come to this the size and properties.

145
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.030
We're not worried about size,

146
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.180
but we are worried about the position.

147
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.150
So let me just bring this back over here.

148
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.460
So here we go.

149
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.490
Now we can see the power point below it.

150
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.660
So we're working on the first pivot table.

151
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.180
We need to know how to position that.

152
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.990
So let's Let's was down here Andi,

153
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.300
find out that positioning images think images,

154
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.880
images,

155
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.890
indigenous pace,

156
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.500
pace banks,

157
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.610
re sizing,

158
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.860
positioning.

159
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.780
We're not using the century things.

160
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.990
We used that.

161
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.540
That's too a line.

162
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.650
And that's what we want to do.

163
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.530
This is the code here,

164
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.660
So a line and image using points and that is precisely what we want to do.

165
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.300
So is gonna copy that with all the way back up to Slade for which is here.

166
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.460
A slight force code.

167
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.790
Yep.

168
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.010
Slowed for on.

169
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.550
We're working on the first pivot.

170
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.250
Yeah.

171
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.670
So let's just pace that code in there.

172
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.100
I told you this was like Lego didn't s.

173
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.270
Oh,

174
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.760
here we go.

175
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.260
We are going to be a lining so I can run this.

176
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.130
I can unring,

177
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.710
miss,

178
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.470
because we've just literally pasted this.

179
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.960
It is the active window selection because we're already working on it on what we wants from

180
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.760
the top left corner.

181
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.450
That's the top left corner.

182
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:44.550
Want 2.33 So we're going to say 2.33 times 70 meters again.

183
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.350
Lips that certain?

184
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.630
Yeah.

185
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.290
2.3 times centimeters on the top.

186
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.710
The vertical position is 5.13 centimeters.

187
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.080
Ribs.

188
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.950
Let me just bring that back.

189
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:05.850
That's 5.13 multiplied by centimeters on that will position our first pivot table.

190
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.760
So that's how we've done the 1st 1 Now what we're gonna do,

191
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.360
just copy that code.

192
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.250
Come underneath the second pivots able on pace,

193
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.630
that code underneath.

194
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.040
This time we want to click here on.

195
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.720
We wanna have a look at the position.

196
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.290
That again,

197
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.600
that's horizontal 2.33 But it's 10.95 from the top.

198
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.340
So 2.33 can stay,

199
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:38.880
but never want to change that to 10.95 So 10 points 95 Fantastic.

200
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.860
Andi here.

201
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.140
We want to do the same thing.

202
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.310
I went to the same thing with that chart.

203
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.370
So on we re size the charts as well,

204
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.750
didn't me?

205
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.460
So let's let's resize first position second So hip.

206
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.800
We are looking at this particular object.

207
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.920
Uh,

208
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.680
and we have a shape range,

209
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.540
height.

210
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.900
Where are we?

211
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.750
We have a shape range height of 12.69 So here.

212
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.750
Ah,

213
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:18.980
12.69 We're not gonna center it using the method we use before.

214
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.150
We're going to copy this because we want to do it by points.

215
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.060
So there we go on.

216
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.150
And so here we can come to our position,

217
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.610
and it's 9.1.

218
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:41.320
So we'll change that there to 9.1 by centimeters on its 9.1 by 5.13 Okay.

219
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.060
Okay,

220
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.880
so I just closed PowerPoint down.

221
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.180
So let's let's run through that code and see if that is what we think it should do.

222
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.930
So there we go.

223
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:49.920
And to present his name.

224
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.260
Alan from Andi.

225
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.850
Here we go.

226
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.450
Let's have look.

227
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.310
Okay,

228
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.100
So there you go.

229
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.560
That that's the beginning of our slideshow.

230
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.530
We have the first life.

231
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.190
Sex lied.

232
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.430
Third slide four.

233
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.120
Slide on.

234
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.560
Leslie.

235
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.480
We want to do this.

236
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.320
Thank you.

237
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.290
Any questions slide that you always see at the end of PowerPoint presentations.

238
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.450
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
