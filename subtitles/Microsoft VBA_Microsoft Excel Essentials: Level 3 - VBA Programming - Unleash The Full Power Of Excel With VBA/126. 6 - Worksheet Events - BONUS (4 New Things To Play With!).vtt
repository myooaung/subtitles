00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Okay,

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.570
guys on Welcome back Now,

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.320
Technically,

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.300
this is student questions answered lecture.

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.190
But it fits so nicely into the worksheets and workbook events section.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.380
I've decided to drop it right in here.

7
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.350
Now the question comes from Daymo on.

8
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.220
It relates to drop down menu.

9
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.370
So says simple question when I click on the drop down menu is,

10
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.500
and I would like the curse that to move them to the next cell.

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.060
Now,

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.250
what happens when when you hit enter in a cell in Excel by default,

13
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.560
it will move down to the cell immediately below it.

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.860
But if you are selecting a value from a drop down list,

15
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.750
the cell with the drop down list remains selected.

16
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
The South beat the curse that does not move down to the next cell,

17
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.520
so that's the basis of the question.

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.900
So at what I did was,

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.480
I went to the Microsoft website this one here,

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.700
and you'll find a link to this certain this website in the code on bond on.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.260
This is a fantastic resource,

22
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.780
by the way.

23
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.740
If you just send to your question into Google,

24
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.230
chances are that Microsoft have already got a piece of code that you can adapt to make fit

25
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.150
your needs.

26
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.450
And this is the particular code here.

27
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.690
So I took this code,

28
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.800
and that's also in the spreadsheet,

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.160
which you'll see just here.

30
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.600
Now this sheets available is downloadable resource I've uploaded this morning and what

31
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.130
you'll see it's called worksheet events.

32
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.580
Bonus on.

33
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.970
We've got a few sheets on here.

34
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.850
We have a guide,

35
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.430
which is this sheet,

36
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.010
and this tells you where to get your code.

37
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.690
From on.

38
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.660
We have four working sheets.

39
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.240
Specific cell changes,

40
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.980
specific cell toe unlocked.

41
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.890
Use the cell change by criteria on value changes by formula on,

42
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.480
we have tubs,

43
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.640
one with all the code for sheet one to with all the code for sheet to three for three and

44
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.370
four for four.

45
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.550
So all I've done is I took this code here,

46
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.570
and I've pasted it into the sheet object in V B A.

47
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.350
So let's have a look.

48
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.520
So all the code from number one has been pasted into this sheet code for this sheet here.

49
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.840
So all the code for number one is there.

50
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.640
All the code from number two is pasted in here.

51
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.110
All the code for number three spaces in here and all the code for number four is pasted in

52
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.560
here.

53
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.590
So let's have a look at this code.

54
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.620
This is the original,

55
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.790
but this is the original code from Marks Off Website on There's the link to that.

56
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.430
And here's the adopted code.

57
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.720
So all I've done is I've rimmed out,

58
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.340
and if it's rammed on the far left hand side,

59
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.840
that's the original code from Microsoft.

60
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.520
On one of said is I've changed this part here and now I am only looking at Cell C one.

61
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.640
So that is the value cell I am looking to change.

62
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.520
So this cell changes,

63
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.060
then perform the rest of the code this straight from the Microsoft website,

64
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.990
and all I've done is,

65
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.780
I've just added a different instruction on what to do if that cell value changes.

66
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.250
So what I've said is range target dot address,

67
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.010
which is going to be C one offset one comma zero that is moved down one cell.

68
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.650
So let's have a look at that working now here.

69
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.740
I have a simple list of some of my friends at work,

70
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.810
and here I have a drop down list that is in B one.

71
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.420
So when I pick Brent from here.

72
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.230
Notice that the curse of stays in B one,

73
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.330
but here,

74
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.310
see one,

75
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.040
which is where the code is looking,

76
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.780
remember?

77
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.500
See one.

78
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.030
Just hear.

79
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.720
What we have is if I pick Sandeep,

80
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.240
notice what happens to the cursor.

81
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.660
It immediately moves down to the cell below so you can carry on.

82
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.970
Typing will have another drop down box.

83
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.510
So cool.

84
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.770
Piece of code number one Piece of code number two.

85
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.080
Now,

86
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.430
this is what what day most question actually relates to here.

87
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.900
I have a drop down on Dhere.

88
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.250
I have a locked cell.

89
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.530
Here is an unlocked cell.

90
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.890
Here is another locked cell.

91
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.400
And here is another unlocked cell.

92
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.010
So if you want to bounce people as soon as they've answered one drop down list to another

93
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.760
drop down list to another drop down list,

94
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.690
this is how we all do it on.

95
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.460
I've used the code that you'll find in sheet to here,

96
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.020
so let's just flip back to that and have a quick look at the code.

97
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.940
So here we go again.

98
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.970
I've adapted exactly that same code.

99
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.800
If it's rammed there,

100
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.880
right on the left.

101
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.450
That's the original mocha self code on Dhere.

102
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.000
We're looking at set key cells to rain.

103
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.290
See,

104
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.210
once I'm only looking at C one again.

105
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.080
This is just a standard mark stuff code.

106
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.410
But this time I'm saying range target address,

107
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.780
See?

108
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:59.820
One next dot Select Noticed that that differs from this code that says offset one dot

109
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.530
select.

110
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.000
Now,

111
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.600
if you use the offset one,

112
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.410
it will still select a locked cell.

113
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.180
So if you want to move,

114
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.650
if you want to move over a lot cell to the next clickable cell.

115
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.570
Use this code here range target dot address next dot select.

116
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.550
So that's going to have a look at that in action.

117
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.340
So here I have a drop down list.

118
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.400
And if I pick Becky,

119
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.530
notice what happens to the care,

120
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.890
so it's immediately drops down to the next unlocked cell.

121
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.670
Okay,

122
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.850
so piece of code number to their piece of code number three.

123
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.590
Let me just flip back,

124
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.640
Teoh said the code in windows and show you this number three use of cell changes by

125
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.640
criteria.

126
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.230
Again,

127
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.620
I've just butchered the normal Microsoft Code that I stole from their website.

128
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.290
But here we have a logical test that I've added in So we're looking at Selby three.

129
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.660
What we're going to say is if key cells value is greater than 10,000 display the message

130
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.110
box.

131
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.670
That's a lot of Mullah.

132
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.290
So let's come back here.

133
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.340
And we're just so we can type anything we want over here because we're only looking at

134
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.610
Selby three and nothing is gonna happen in the code.

135
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.430
So if I come up here at night,

136
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.190
type 499 hit,

137
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.630
enter,

138
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.860
nothing's gonna happen.

139
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.490
But if I breach that 10,000 rule,

140
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.910
this is what's gonna happen.

141
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.590
We'll get a little pop up books.

142
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.960
It says Mark stuff Excel.

143
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.690
That's a lot of moolah.

144
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay,

145
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.100
so you can actually check the value of a cell to trigger an event.

146
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.870
Now,

147
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.390
that's fine.

148
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.860
But look,

149
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.570
what happens if I do this equals the sum off.

150
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:56.340
Let's say that three cells below and he as I type 1000 and one or 10,000 won the code

151
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.430
didn't trigger because this is a formula on what we're actually looking for With this

152
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.400
particular piece of code is if we change the value manually,

153
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.330
trigger the code.

154
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.520
So piece of code number three piece code number four does exactly the same thing,

155
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.650
but it uses a formula.

156
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.040
So let's have a look.

157
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.950
A piece of code number four on this is quite simple,

158
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.020
but we use a different kind of event.

159
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.780
We use that worksheet calculate event,

160
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.090
which you'll find just up here.

161
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.720
Well,

162
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.840
we're going to say check be three to see if it breaches 10,000 on.

163
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.250
Remember,

164
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.320
this is a worksheet calculate.

165
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.960
So if B three is greater than 10,000 display the message box.

166
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.660
I am rich,

167
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.200
baby.

168
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.810
So let's have a look at this.

169
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.690
So this is just an imaginary bank account.

170
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.150
So let's say I had I had a new value in here.

171
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:56.240
Let's say it's the 16th of February on what do we want to reach 10,000 and hit?

172
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.780
Enter.

173
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.610
I am rich baby on There you go because this is now a calculated cell and no cell that we

174
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.410
type in it displays.

175
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.960
Our message now obviously can use this for any number of things you could have ah,

176
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.820
running balance.

177
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.840
Perhaps that would trigger an email if you drop below a certain and managed to send an

178
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.450
email to your finance director,

179
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:19.980
say Hey,

180
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.700
funds are running low or any kind of code like that which will come to later in the course

181
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:25.700
.

182
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.450
Okay,

183
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.120
as always.

184
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.060
Any questions?

185
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.100
Just let me know.

186
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.750
Have a great day and I'll see you in the next lecture.
