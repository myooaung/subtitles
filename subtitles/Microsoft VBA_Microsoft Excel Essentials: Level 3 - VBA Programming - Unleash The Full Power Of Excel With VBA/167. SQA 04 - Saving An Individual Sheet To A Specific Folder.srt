1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,210
Okay,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:02,540
guys.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,230
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,110
Questions answered on this one's from John.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,460
Now,

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,130
John,

7
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,770
watch the folder creation gizmo and set him thinking.

8
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:17,130
Now what John has is a workbook with about 50 of different sheets in it.

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,800
On this,

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,150
this master workbook is used to used to control territory managers on their budgets and

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,500
their actions on different sites.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,440
Never don't know what the data looks like.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,670
So this is essential here,

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,840
plank spreadsheet.

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,280
But my understanding is that we have different tabs,

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,930
so this won t m 01 would refer to territory manager one on this would control the budget

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,230
and then we'll have similar tabs for terrorism.

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,150
NGO one for site,

19
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,230
one site to then we have the budget for territory Manager three or something like that on

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,270
what we want to do.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,290
We want to actually,

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,400
every time we make amendment or changed,

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,770
any one of these tabs is automatically saved that single tab as an individual spreadsheet

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,130
on post it,

25
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,490
save it to the appropriate territory managers file so they can see it.

26
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,470
And we want to add a time stamp on there so they can see that that is the latest version

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,500
that they should be looking at so would have done is have also made in another tab in here

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,890
called safe paths.

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,500
Eso What I have is tm one tm to tm three,

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,030
which match the total managers along the bottom.

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,410
Here.

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,880
This is obviously a much cut down version from the version that John Jews and but here of

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,390
this is just a dynamic named range.

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,050
And I have the individual safe paths to each of the territory.

35
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,880
Manager So territory Manager one,

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,980
it's c uses our deaths up my temple That Rod Tim to Jane tm three Freddy Now these

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,470
obviously don't have to live in the same root directory.

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,690
They could be in totally different directories.

39
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,660
But long as you record them here,

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,850
we're going to be golden.

41
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,900
Okay,

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,170
so what we're going to do first is we're going to record a simple macro to give us our base

43
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,560
code.

44
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,720
Doesn't Mobile is going to be called someone's gonna hit record new macro.

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,330
They want to come down here,

46
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,670
right?

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,400
Click now,

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,680
because the resolution I'm using it slightly off screen.

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,500
But I'm just gonna choose the fourth option,

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,780
which is move or copy.

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,970
That's gonna bring this dialog box up.

52
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,530
Woman do is click create a copy on the come up to here and choose new book and click.

53
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,150
Ok,

54
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,470
so here's our new book book Seven On from Here.

55
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,170
What I'm gonna do,

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm gonna hit f 12.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,220
I am already here,

58
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,120
but navigate to the appropriate thing,

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,210
So we don t m 01 So that's Rod this conflict that for now,

60
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,110
I'm just can call this t m 01 space less space base,

61
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,900
which is exactly the same name as this tab.

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,410
Save that.

63
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm gonna close the file.

64
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,320
Okay.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,560
I know.

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,090
I'm gonna stop recording now.

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,540
Let's have a look at that code.

68
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,010
So here's the code for saving in any individual sheet as a separate workbook.

69
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,720
Now,

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,590
this is the base of the code.

71
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:06,990
Okay,

72
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,850
We're going to take that.

73
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,240
We're going to use that to build our code.

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,620
So we're going to say is sub lips saved me now.

75
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,170
Luckily,

76
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,710
his one I prepared earlier.

77
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,800
So we already have all of my my variables declared.

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,580
So just so you can see,

79
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,670
I have dim my t m.

80
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,350
That is where I'm in a capture.

81
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,540
Those 1st 4 coaches of the active sheet name,

82
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,050
which is going to give me my territory manager's name.

83
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,560
So btm a one or 02 or 03 at my save path,

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
which we're going to capture by using a V look up function,

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,280
using my tm and reading from that front sheet my file name,

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,790
which is what we're going to be building.

87
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,170
In fact,

88
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,100
we may not even use that my year.

89
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,570
My mom from my day just so we can have let me close this stuff now just so we can we can

90
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,730
build that time and date stamp.

91
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,250
So we've used this before,

92
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,570
so it's gonna pace that in there.

93
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,260
So we're going to say my year equals now yet now my month equals month now.

94
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,670
So for just step through that bump,

95
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:10,820
bump,

96
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,020
bump,

97
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,180
bump,

98
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,530
bump.

99
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,370
My years 2016 My month is 10.

100
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,080
My day is 26.

101
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,140
Fantastic.

102
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,250
Now the next thing we need to do is capture the safe path.

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,250
So again,

104
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,220
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna stop there will come back to excel where only there we go.

105
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,880
That's excel,

106
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,180
and you'll remember that this is a dynamic named range here and I can't recall Have called

107
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,300
it.

108
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,940
Call it tm safe path.

109
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,290
Okay.

110
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:43,120
Close Eso woman do is I'm just going to say a t m one that and then say equals V looking.

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,750
But be if I could type It's a little early in the morning for may be Look up that comma.

112
00:04:49,750 --> 00:05:00,230
And it was a t m safe path There it iss comma two comma false and enter right Norman

113
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,000
recorder macro to capture that.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,450
That that function there.

115
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,100
That formula.

116
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,870
So Okay,

117
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,370
hit.

118
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,180
Have to Hey,

119
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,710
center,

120
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,750
stop recording.

121
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,290
Now let's flip back to here on day.

122
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,930
Here it is.

123
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,150
This is the code.

124
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,190
So we have active cell dot formula one C one equals V.

125
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,160
Look at we're just going to take that copy,

126
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,650
and we're gonna butcher that over here.

127
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,270
Now,

128
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:30,730
one of the first things we need to do is we need to find out what the T M name is.

129
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:40,750
So we're going to say at my t m equals and we're going to say active sheet dot name.

130
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,110
Okay,

131
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,540
So before we get down to the formula,

132
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,710
I'm just gonna step through that and you can see that my name is safe paths.

133
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,050
That's a poor example.

134
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,660
We need to put another sheet here.

135
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,140
Let me just delete that.

136
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,860
So here we go.

137
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,730
So let's stop and step through that again.

138
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,590
So here I am on sheet tm one base.

139
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,740
So if I step through bum bum whips Bom bom bom bom bomp t m equals t m one space The space

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,300
based Now what I wanna wanna actually capture of the 1st 4 characters.

141
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,150
So I'm going to say left open brackets Wasel the waves The end.

142
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,970
I know.

143
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,820
I am finished Comma for Unclos Andi,

144
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,690
stop now!

145
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,430
When I stepped through Bom bom bom bom bump My t m is t m one.

146
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,760
And that will allow us to use this V.

147
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,730
Look up there.

148
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,880
We need to modify this a little bit.

149
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,450
So we're going to say my safe path.

150
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,550
He s a mine.

151
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,970
Safe path equals,

152
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,470
I mean to say,

153
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:48,320
application dot work sheet function adults,

154
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,850
they look up open brackets and then we're just gonna delete all of this here.

155
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,770
So,

156
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,200
RV,

157
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,610
look up.

158
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,490
Value.

159
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,540
This bitch is gonna be my t m,

160
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,010
which is what we just read now.

161
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,380
This part here because we using the named range we're going to say range open brackets,

162
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,500
open quotes.

163
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:17,140
That is our named range Close quotes close brackets come into com A false lips.

164
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,680
I've missed something yoke until it that bit off the end.

165
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,780
So now if I step through this code,

166
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,480
we can go bump,

167
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,700
bump,

168
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:24,910
bump,

169
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,250
bump,

170
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,080
bump.

171
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,620
My t m is t m 01 which is we're going to know you's in out be look up So my safe path will

172
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,610
be See users.

173
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,010
Alan,

174
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,400
desktop slash my team folder slash rod.

175
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,950
Okay.

176
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,530
So far,

177
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,420
so good.

178
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,290
No.

179
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:41,440
Well,

180
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,200
we need to do is add this bit of code here into a coat.

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,800
So let me come down the bottom bubble bubble bump.

182
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,050
Andi controlling V.

183
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,270
I'm not gonna delete that,

184
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,720
cause we don't need that anymore.

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,640
Andi,

186
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,950
I'm also gonna delete this bit down here because we don't need that anymore.

187
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,480
So we have sheets,

188
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,570
tomo one dot select No,

189
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,390
we don't actually have to select this.

190
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,150
Chris were already on the sheet,

191
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,670
and that's where we're going to call the code.

192
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,570
From now.

193
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,760
What we do need to do is copy,

194
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,310
but we were already on the active sheets.

195
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:21,980
Okun just delete all of this and say active sheets sheets dot copy.

196
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,070
So we have copied the sheet.

197
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,940
This is I was scrolling around with only that in there on this is the next important best,

198
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,190
the active workbook save as File main.

199
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,200
Now what we're gonna do is we're going to replace some of these elements with the variables

200
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,050
that have already captured from my tm my safe path,

201
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,760
my year,

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,720
my month and all that.

203
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,270
So we can see here the first part all the way up to there is the safe path.

204
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,720
So they say my safe path.

205
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,960
Andi,

206
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,090
Noah do need that bracket in there to make sure that all that slash in there So I'm gonna

207
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,580
add that in quotes.

208
00:08:59,580 --> 00:08:59,650
Oh,

209
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,410
my safe that Andi backslash Andi.

210
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:03,760
Now,

211
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,850
this is where we're gonna pull our dates times We're going to say my year and my month.

212
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,700
Andi,

213
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,750
my day.

214
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,660
Andi,

215
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,600
on here.

216
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,030
We're gonna have the name of the active sheet,

217
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:26,280
so we're going to say active groups I can't tape at every time the Wright active sheet dot

218
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,650
name and that will give us the name of the sheet.

219
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,910
Onda.

220
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:39,290
We just want that dot Excel s ex whips mr dot at the end on There we go.

221
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,930
So hopefully that will give us exactly what we won't see.

222
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,910
Okay,

223
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,250
before we run that I just realized that forgot to put the space stash space in there.

224
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,400
So we want my year,

225
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,870
my month,

226
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,480
my day.

227
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,590
Andi There we want space dash space and then theatric tive sheet.

228
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,290
Don't name So with any look,

229
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,090
let's certain Let's come back to excel We're on tm one base.

230
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,760
Let's run that code and hopefully they go Something's happened.

231
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:19,240
Let's have a look at the folder t m 01 they go 26 216 10 26 Tiempo one base.

232
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,260
So let's just test that out by going to another one s o That was t m 01 Let's pick tm to

233
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,650
Can't remember who Tomo to was,

234
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,760
but we'll let we'll run that code.

235
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,790
Probable bump room that we g o and let's have a look at the folder.

236
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:44,210
Tim 02 will be Rod Jane at a guess on they go to 2016 10 2060 m o to cite one.

237
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,840
Obviously,

238
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,690
if you want that to rumble blisteringly fast.

239
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,690
Just add your application.

240
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:59,340
Screen of dating application dot screen updating equals false Andi at the end.

241
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,690
10

242
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,350
On your screen,

243
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:06,780
a dating application dot screen of dating girls True,

244
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,160
Andi that should now be blisteringly fast.

245
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,060
So who have we not done?

246
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,810
We've not done number three eso.

247
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,780
Let's pick that.

248
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,690
It's come back here and let's run their code.

249
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,330
Obviously,

250
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,530
you can add a book known to each of these sheets.

251
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,490
So the second you made your your change just hit the button.

252
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,520
Then it should work.

253
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,500
So here we go.

254
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Let's just hit play but on that should have happened.

255
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,450
So it's going to have a look in here.

256
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,560
Ron,

257
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,260
Jane and Freddie was the last one,

258
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,410
and they go and that's how you do that.

259
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:34,990
Okay,

260
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,660
