00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
Okay,

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.650
goes welcome back Now,

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.080
the first workbook event that we're going to look at is the workbook sheet.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.910
Activate.

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.110
So from Excel,

6
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.350
I'm gonna hit Olsen F 11 And here in our Project Explorer,

7
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.910
we can see all the objects that are currently associated with the open workbook.

8
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.250
If you can't see your project Explorer,

9
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.580
just come up to view and choose projects Explorer here Now these are all the objects and

10
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.550
what we're going to be looking at in the first part of this section is this'll workbook.

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.970
So double click this workbook.

12
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.450
OK,

13
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.040
so you now have an empty coding window.

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.780
Now,

15
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.470
when we've written subroutines in normal modules up to this point,

16
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.250
they always follow a specific syntax.

17
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.480
We say sub or private sub,

18
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.400
we call them whatever we want obeying the naming rules on we hit.

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.090
Enter on.

20
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.550
The little brackets are automatically put in an end.

21
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.510
Sub is automatically put in now with workbook events on worksheet event serous a specific

22
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.900
syntax that we have to follow now.

23
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.280
Luckily,

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.920
we don't have to remember this because the visual basic editor is going to write it for us

25
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.910
automatically.

26
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.810
So the first thing we're going to do because we're looking at the work book events and

27
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.750
we're in this workbook.

28
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.110
We're going to come up to this area here,

29
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.160
and if I hover over,

30
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.670
you can see that it saves object on.

31
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.050
What we need to do here is select the object.

32
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.670
So I'm just conflict the little down arrow and you can see because we're in this workbook,

33
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.820
we only have the option to choose workbooks.

34
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.150
I'm just going to select workbook on what the VB is done automatically has written the

35
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.380
shell of our code and it is assumed we want a workbook opens.

36
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.580
That's probably the most common event will come to that one of that later on.

37
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.330
Okay,

38
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.900
now,

39
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.830
leaving that there,

40
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.700
otherwise we're gonna have to re select it.

41
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.100
I'm gonna guy due to this little drop down box here,

42
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.710
which is the procedure box.

43
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.630
And if we click in here,

44
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.280
we can see that we have absolutely loads of different events that we could trigger a code

45
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.890
upon.

46
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.320
So the one we're gonna look at here is thes sheet activate.

47
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.770
So I'm just gonna left click sheet,

48
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.030
activate and you can see that again.

49
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.580
The visual basic answer is written the shell of the code.

50
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.910
Don't worry about the specifics of all of this or we're going to do is write the code that

51
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.590
we want to run in between these lines.

52
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.420
So now I've added the sheet activate I can safely delete the workbook open.

53
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.220
Okay,

54
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.680
So here is where we're working.

55
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.960
And all we're gonna do is we're gonna display a simple message box on the message box is

56
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:49.380
going to say you just selected Onda space on board End quotes on DWhite.

57
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.790
Shall we say the active shoot don't may,

58
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.550
And that will do it.

59
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.040
Active sheet docked.

60
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.150
Rips dot name.

61
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.420
Oops.

62
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.010
There's that.

63
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.540
I haven't closer brackets active sheet that name.

64
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.880
So we build looking catenary string you just selected with space at the end on whatever the

65
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.170
active sheet name is.

66
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.910
Fantastic.

67
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.050
Now all we need to do flip back to excel and notice what happens because we're on the

68
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.300
workbook sheet.

69
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.560
Activate whenever we click on a different cheese.

70
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.340
There you go.

71
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.030
You get this little message box that pops up that says you just selected random day to set

72
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.030
.

73
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.650
Okay.

74
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.070
And if I click on here,

75
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.940
uh,

76
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.190
you just selected workbooks sheets activate.

77
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.370
And here's the code that we've just written on.

78
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.000
Similarly,

79
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.980
with any of these,

80
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830
you'll automatically get this little.

81
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.850
Okay,

82
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.610
you'll get this little message box pop up and tell you precisely which she you just

83
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.220
selected.

84
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.790
Now,

85
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.160
as we're going through this,

86
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.970
I'm gonna delete the code that we want.

87
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.530
Otherwise,

88
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.070
we will be getting workbook events triggered left,

89
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.810
right and centre,

90
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.450
and it's going to drive you mad.

91
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.380
Okay,

92
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.770
so we've just reading some really simple code displaying a simple message box in between

93
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.560
the private sub in the end sub.

94
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.400
But your code can be a sophisticated you want it to be.

95
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.300
So whatever code you want to execute,

96
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.900
you just add it in here.

97
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.630
OK?

98
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.020
I'll see you in the next lecture.
