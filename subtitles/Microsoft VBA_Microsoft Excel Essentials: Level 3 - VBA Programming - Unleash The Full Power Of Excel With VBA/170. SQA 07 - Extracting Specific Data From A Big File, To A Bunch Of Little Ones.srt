1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,860
guys.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,490
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,520
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,090
And this one's from Neil.

6
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,510
Now,

7
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,190
Neil has a huge file that he downloads from A s,

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,720
a P sap database.

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,720
What he wants to do is literally go down a massive data set on search for particular values

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,450
in column A,

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,220
which is coming,

12
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:22,960
and obviously,

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,810
in the real date set,

14
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,400
there'll be lots more values and there's lots more columns,

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,450
but basically what he wants to do,

16
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,590
we scroll down all of this and create a specific file for each of the companies in here.

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,520
So if the company just appears once,

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,890
he wants to have that line of data extracted to another file and say that with an

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,220
appropriate name a similarly,

20
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,550
for two or three once those two or three lines on that.

21
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,360
So here's the code.

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,130
This imagine is the master data setting.

23
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,240
You can download this file from this lecture.

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,820
There are three tab sheet.

25
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:00,300
One sheet to encode code is where you're going to find the code on she two.

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,480
Now,

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,360
this is where it is gonna be executing the code from on this particular macro here.

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,410
This subroutines attached to this but Miss Run May.

29
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,450
So here we have a list.

30
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,410
So we have done a ski vamps,

31
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,120
Bob's burgers,

32
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,610
McDonald's,

33
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,070
Burger King a one,

34
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,680
burgers,

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,510
burgers,

36
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,450
even on Ethel's Diner.

37
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,370
So what we're gonna do is go through this long to time.

38
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,220
We've got a few dump a few variable set up.

39
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,720
It's up.

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,800
My string is just going to capture the search string from sheet to remember it's being run

41
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,590
from Here s so we're gonna go application display.

42
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,250
Let's false because we're saving the file.

43
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,820
We don't want that little pop up coming up saying you sure you on the same eso We're

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,380
turning off the display alerts at the top right here.

45
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,200
We're going to turn them back on at the bottom down here,

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,100
so it's just step through this code sheets seat to select,

47
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,460
just to make sure we're on the right sheet.

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,850
There we will be if we're executing from here.

49
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,770
But I've left that in there for Just knows right in the code.

50
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,560
So let's go through.

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,240
So we've picked sheet to if we were in already on it,

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,100
we're gonna pick range a two,

53
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,510
which is where our first value that we're looking for lives,

54
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,060
then we're gonna step through.

55
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,500
But a sign Whatever value is in a two to the valuable my string.

56
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,030
So my string no Now holds the value Donner Dullness Keep tabs.

57
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,990
Very imaginative name.

58
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,540
Now,

59
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,230
the next thing we're going to do is use the application worksheet function count if we're

60
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,760
gonna look at sheet one in the whole of column May for the value my string because if the

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,390
value doesn't exist,

62
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,020
we don't need to do anything else.

63
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,360
We just need to loop down,

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,710
move onto the next one.

65
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,230
So dollars keep labs.

66
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,450
When we do that on,

67
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,450
we hover over X.

68
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,800
We can see that Donner ski Babs doesn't actually appear in that list.

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,020
So if X equals zero,

70
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,470
that is,

71
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,980
I have no match F eight moved down the cell on,

72
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,840
then moved down here to our next loop and come back up on.

73
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,490
We're just gonna keep looping until we get to the bottom of this.

74
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,450
Now blank souls reach So let's now override my shrink with the new cell value.

75
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,420
Bob's burgers.

76
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,000
So Bob's burgers on.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,240
We can see by hovering over the X that Bob's burgers appears three times,

78
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,150
So we've bypassed this zero Because we do have an entry.

79
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,200
Then what we're gonna do is open the template file.

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,600
Obviously,

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,680
you'll need to change the path in the file name.

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,470
But here we go.

83
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,920
That's off screen a little bit.

84
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,600
So let me just drag that over.

85
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,690
So here is a new open file,

86
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,970
and we're trying to do this.

87
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,160
You can actually see everything you should about seeing it from that.

88
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,500
OK,

89
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,200
so now we've just opened this file.

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,620
We're gonna come back and activate this workbook.

91
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,740
Booms are no.

92
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,560
We're back over here.

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,140
And they were going to get a sheet one,

94
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,540
because this is our master data set,

95
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,690
and we're going to go to the very start of the range.

96
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,550
Notice we have titles in row one,

97
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,810
so A to select.

98
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,430
And we are looking for my string Bob's burgers.

99
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,200
So we have Bob's burgers.

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,950
Just that.

101
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,390
So again,

102
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,760
we're gonna loop through until we get to the bottom of this data set on.

103
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,910
We're going to say if the active cell top value doesn't equal my string move down one.

104
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,210
So we're looking for Bob's burgers and active cell value is Bob's burgers.

105
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,510
So we're gonna jump straight to our else.

106
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,010
Now,

107
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,950
what we're gonna do is say with the active cell,

108
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,910
entire row dot copy.

109
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,850
So here,

110
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,670
we're going to copy the whole of line to let me just showing that down a bit so you can see

111
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,650
what happens here,

112
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,640
and c Fuck.

113
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,900
Um,

114
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,150
make that a little bit wider.

115
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,230
They go.

116
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,110
So back to here.

117
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,160
So the active cell,

118
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,980
entire road up.

119
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,530
Copy,

120
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,000
which is over here.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
This entire row on.

122
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,400
We're going to copy to the workbooks master template.

123
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,350
Which is this one?

124
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,710
Sheets One.

125
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,370
Just in case we had more than one sheets range a 10,000 which is way down at the bottom.

126
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,200
Then we're gonna go end,

127
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,300
excel up,

128
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,040
which is going to take us right up to sell a one,

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,100
and then we're gonna offset by one row.

130
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,440
So our first blank cell is Well,

131
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,970
we're going to copy that data to.

132
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,500
So when they hit F eight,

133
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,670
they go.

134
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,680
You can see Bob's burgers.

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,410
5000

136
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,270
It's just copied the entire road from here.

137
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,300
Then we're going to move down the cell,

138
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,420
and then we're gonna loop.

139
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,520
So we still haven't reached the blank self.

140
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,260
So my strings Bob's Burgers.

141
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,110
Active Sellers.

142
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,720
McDonnell's That's not right.

143
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,370
Move down.

144
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,980
One you can see expletive down one here.

145
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,310
We're just gonna look through.

146
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,250
So we get to Bob's burgers again.

147
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,450
There we go.

148
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,270
So now we're back over to here.

149
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,330
So now Bob's burgers,

150
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,080
his 100 copy the entire row from the active cell.

151
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,050
And copy two sheets,

152
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,660
one range,

153
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,730
8 10,000 excel up and down.

154
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,570
One cell that is here,

155
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,160
our first blank cell.

156
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,900
So we're going to move down and then we'll go all the way through until we get to the end.

157
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,170
For more,

158
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,330
more,

159
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:43,490
more.

160
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,590
Mom on day.

161
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,650
I think we've probably got that almosts now.

162
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,310
Okay,

163
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,830
so now we're going to select the master template,

164
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,290
which is this sheet here.

165
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,300
We're gonna auto size range A B.

166
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,970
So we're gonna make these that the appropriate column.

167
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,060
It's bump.

168
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,140
We can create a say file name the safe,

169
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,790
Full name.

170
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,100
I stole this from your care code,

171
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,570
by the way,

172
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,010
Neil,

173
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,900
but I've put the day so up front.

174
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,120
So we're gonna have year,

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,750
year,

176
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,120
month,

177
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,420
month,

178
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,670
date,

179
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,060
date,

180
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,930
space,

181
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,140
dash space,

182
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,350
my string,

183
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,520
which is Bob's burgers.

184
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,560
So you know which violist that XLs.

185
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,850
So we've built that string and there were going to do the same house.

186
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,020
No,

187
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,690
I'm saving it.

188
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,370
Teoh,

189
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:24,650
See,

190
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,440
uses our invest in my folder Say,

191
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,970
false on my save file name which is now going to be called two of 17 05 25 Bob's burgers.

192
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,730
And then I'm gonna close the active workbook,

193
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,330
which is this one I'm going to go back in select sheet to I'm gonna move down the cell,

194
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,390
and then we're gonna go back to the top of our loop on.

195
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,410
That's going to go all the way through and let me just I'm just gonna play that out now.

196
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,070
So it's going to go through each of those values in sheet to bring us back there.

197
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,560
Now,

198
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,250

Here we go.

203
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
In our saved file,

204
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,930
we now have today's date space,

205
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,590
that space and never felt a wound.

206
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:07,930

211
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,320
you can see that it's done just that.

212
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,010
