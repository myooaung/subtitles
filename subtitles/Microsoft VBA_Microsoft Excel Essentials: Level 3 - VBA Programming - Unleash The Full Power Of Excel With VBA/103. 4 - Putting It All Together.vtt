00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
Okay,

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:02.870
guys.

3
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.080
Um,

4
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.140
welcome back time for the moment of truth.

5
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.840
So far,

6
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.000
I've been building this in a macro enabled version of 2016.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.910
01 North s.

8
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.740
So I'm going to do now is copy all of this code going to come here on the hit control and

9
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.760
end to create a new sheet.

10
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.150
I'm gonna hit Olsen F 11 to get back to the visual basic editor.

11
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.470
I'm gonna go to view Projects Explorer.

12
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.970
Here's my new book,

13
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.810
Book one.

14
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.880
I'm gonna insert a module,

15
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.040
and I'm gonna pace all of that code straight into here.

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.670
So,

17
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.290
So far,

18
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.730
so good book one dot Excel s So what I'm gonna do here is change the name of the file on

19
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.950
Call it monthly reporting.

20
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.590
I'm gonna save it as an ex l s and I'm gonna hit save.

21
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.450
Okay.

22
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.780
And now I'm gonna close 2016.

23
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.730
01 north.

24
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.230
Okay,

25
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.020
so here's what we have left.

26
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.770
We have the new month reporting on all the code that we've just written,

27
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.650
and what I'm gonna do is open up the North file one more time.

28
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.520
Okay?

29
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.710
Now we do need to add one more thing.

30
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.120
We can see that if we're on the correct,

31
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.650
she sell a one say's regional sales report.

32
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830
So it's gonna copy that value in here.

33
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.060
And I'm gonna add another subroutine where the front I could have actually,

34
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.250
and it's in the run order.

35
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.230
In fact,

36
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.500
I'll add it into the run order.

37
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:44.760
What will say here is if range a one adult whips don't value does not equal open quotes,

38
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.960
Regional sales report then and now.

39
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.690
If we wanted to,

40
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.180
we could actually had a message box in there that says,

41
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.430
Hey,

42
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.400
you haven't picked the right sheet But now we know that we're going to be on the right

43
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.680
cheek.

44
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.230
So if I accidentally added a new sheet are always on the wrong sheet on,

45
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.260
they started execute in this code,

46
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.660
the code would not execute.

47
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.440
So delete.

48
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.050
Okay,

49
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.000
now we are on the right sheet.

50
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.100
So let's hit play and make sure that that works on.

51
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.770
Here we go.

52
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.690
If we zoom out and have a look at that,

53
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.420
we can see that that is exactly the same dates that we were working on before.

54
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.880
So that works perfectly.

55
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.680
I'm gonna say,

56
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.420
Do you want to save?

57
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.700
I'm going to say no.

58
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.050
I'm gonna open up south.

59
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.530
I'm gonna enable this.

60
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.120
I'm going to select the sheet.

61
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.820
I'm gonna hit.

62
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.490
Run again.

63
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.490
On There we go.

64
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.210
Hopefully we've never tested this data set before.

65
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.990
We can see that it forms perfectly within the boundaries.

66
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.560
Off that sheet on,

67
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.720
we have the month report.

68
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.130
General 2006 Southern region results sold for profit for General tooth as a 16 cells region

69
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.290
was 11242 If I expand that,

70
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.130
I was a little bit 11242 A top salesperson is Christine Faye and we could see that's true.

71
00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.880
2000

72
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.820
That looks good.

73
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.520
Top category game was closed in with a profit of 861 So South works perfectly Well.

74
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.240
Don't save.

75
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.110
Well,

76
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.270
let's try the east.

77
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.810
Did I double click that?

78
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.400
There we go east.

79
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.040
Okay,

80
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.610
we're definitely on the right sheet.

81
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.980
Hit,

82
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.400
run,

83
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.600
whips Run!

84
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.370
But Bob Allen,

85
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.950
zoom that out a little bit.

86
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.430
So this is the monthly sales report for General for the eastern region told Profit

87
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.180
generated has a 16 was 6164.33 Need to expand that so we can see it DoubleClick.

88
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.860
61463 Top salesperson asked Jenkins.

89
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.890
Most definitely.

90
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.750
1476 Most definitely clothing again,

91
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.470
but what was clothed into to get that right?

92
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.860
3436 43 642 So East works perfectly.

93
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.240
Well,

94
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.420
don't save on.

95
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.970
The last one we have to do is West.

96
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.650
So it's just open that code up.

97
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.090
Come here.

98
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.540
Hit!

99
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.990
Play!

100
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.420
Bum,

101
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.580
bum,

102
00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.760
bum,

103
00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.950
bum.

104
00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.660
Bump on.

105
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.830
Let's have a look at that fat Lexus.

106
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.960
Expand that out.

107
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.330
Okay,

108
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.070
so the Western region generally 2016.

109
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.410
7597

110
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.610
Absolutely.

111
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.440
Spot on on the top salesperson was Claire Smith.

112
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.750
Yes,

113
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.040
indeed.

114
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.860
It waas 1957 Yes,

115
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.030
it waas clothing yet again with 46 to 9.

116
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.150
Clothing it game with 46 to 9.

117
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.400
So there you go.

118
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.090
That is how you create a dynamic piece of code that will run all of your reporting for you

119
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.090
.

120
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.490
Now,

121
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.170
obviously,

122
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.500
when you write your own piece of code to your computer generated reports,

123
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.890
you'll meet a maneuver.

124
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.400
It's and change it a little bit to make it fit the data set that you have,

125
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.270
But using this section,

126
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.910
you'll be able to code absolutely anything.

127
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.510
Okay,

128
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.260
I'll see you in the next section.
