1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Okay,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,690
guys.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,860
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,220
This lecture is gonna be comparatively simple.

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,560
But what we can do now know we've done all this really complicated stuff.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,950
Bold in certain sections of the text is weaken.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,400
Delete the bulk of this because most of this code was all to do with find in this start

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,810
length,

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,010
finding out the length of the string and bold in it.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,310
So almost all of this Congar.

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:23,550
Oh,

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,680
so most of this And I think it was at the very end of that recorded macro here where we got

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,650
to a one not select where we did the formatting here.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,260
And we can see that what we have is range a one dot select with the selection dot fund.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,290
Change the color change the Tintin shade.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,520
We don't need to change the Tintin shade,

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,630
but what we do need to do is change the font size to bowl so we can see we already have

18
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,460
selection dot funds.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,640
So all we need is the dot size inside that end with,

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,950
So I'm just gonna pace that in there.

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,950
So I'm gonna delete this.

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,310
I'm gonna delete everything after the end with did we say,

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,840
Oh,

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,310
we did say bald as well.

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,920
Didn't they said,

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,210
Let's have bowled in there too.

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,300
So also the dot bold Because we're doing three things with that selection.

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,220
That's it.

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,890
That's better.

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,810
So we have fun size 16.

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,620
We have bold.

32
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,670
True on we have Colin minus one moment for 89280 obviously s.

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,530
So what I'm gonna do is just copy that,

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,810
like those lines of code.

35
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,170
Oops.

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,360
Don't delete the ends of balance on.

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,210
Let's come up to a a one where we're working.

38
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,700
Andi,

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,590
here we go.

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:40,760
No,

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,160
it's entirely up to you.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,940
But I prefer to keep everything grouped together.

43
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,260
So everything I'm doing on a one is going to sit in this little black of code on the night

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,630
group.

45
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,720
Everything I'm gonna be doing with a three into this little black occur and everything with

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,150
a foreign to this block a coat.

47
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,850
There is absolutely nothing stopping you,

48
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,730
creating all of your text and then a little later in the code doing all the formatting,

49
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,280
it's entirely your choice.

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,890
So this is the one we just ran.

51
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,690
So let's just hit.

52
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,240
Delete,

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,650
delete,

54
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,140
delete.

55
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,120
Let's choose here,

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,880
Andi,

57
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,590
Now we've deleted all the redundant code are moderately sure that that's going to work.

58
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,100
Famous last words.

59
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,750
So what women do is just select our run order hit play and let it run through.

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,440
And they go a perfectly formatted monthly reports a month report for Jerry 2016 in the

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,180
northern region.

62
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,260
All of the different things bold.

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,710
In fact,

64
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,800
let me make that a little bit bigger so you can see it.

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,720
We can no see that this charts is coming out a little too far,

66
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,230
Will correct that at the end on there we have all of this data on what we do want is a

67
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,300
lovely great pie chart in here to show us what the category split is.

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,940
OK,

69
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,660
And the next lecture,

70
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,700
we're gonna have a look at adding a nice pie charts.

71
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,690
I know nothing will be just about done.

72
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,280
Okay,

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,810
I'll see you.

74
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,150
That
