1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:02,680
guys.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,730
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,050
And here we're gonna have a look at the offset property.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,660
Now,

6
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,080
if you look at the remarks here that are included in the code,

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,000
it will give you an idea of how these work.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,820
Now what we have just to talk through this is we have an object which is going to be range

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,850
a five.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,950
We have a property,

11
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,510
Andi.

12
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,960
Then we have a method.

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,520
So we combine in all three.

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,800
We have object property method.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,640
So what this does is it is going to go to sell a five virtually is not were actually going

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,400
to select it,

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,990
because we have this offset command between the object and the method.

18
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:48,620
And it is gonna upset one road down and zero columns across a men's select.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,000
So I'm just going to hit their fate and step through that.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,130
Now,

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,730
remember,

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,660
a five is where we are beginning virtually.

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,510
And then we're gonna offset one row on zero column.

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,150
So when I hit f eight notice what happens over here?

25
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,650
So they go,

26
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,750
you can see that range a six is being selected because we've virtually went to a five,

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,130
and from there we moved down.

28
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,610
One column Andi Sorry,

29
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,660
one row and no columns,

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,680
so negative numbers move up.

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,550
So if we said minus one,

32
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,170
let me just hit stop on hit F Ace will virtually go to a a five.

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,700
Then we will move up one room so we would get to a four.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,700
And similarly if we we can't put a minus number in here because we're already in column A

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,710
and we can't go left from column A.

36
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,400
But if we were in column,

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,020
B minus one would take us to column A or a postive number would move us over to the right.

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,620
Now,

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,790
you don't have to specify when you use the offset,

40
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,140
a specific range to begin with.

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,030
What you can do is use the active cell.

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,390
So here we used the active cell,

43
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,660
which currently selected is a four.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,330
When they hit F eight,

45
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,020
you can see that we've moved no rose and one column across because the one is a positive

46
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,450
number.

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,420
We have moved over to the right.

48
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,450
Now we're going to use that.

49
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,940
We're going to incorporate it to something else we're going to see in just a short while.

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,590
Okay,

51
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,050
I'll see you in the next lecture
