1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
Okay,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:02,970
guys,

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,610
I'm welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,910
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,280
Now this question is from Theresa.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,420
It's regarding date date stamps.

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,180
When someone has made a change.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,030
What Theresa asks is,

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,270
I wanna have a current date inserted in a cell within columns.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,650
Ed.

11
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,290
Any time a date of the data in any cell is changed or added in columns,

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,440
beat a Y on column A.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,650
On At the moment,

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,820
she's completely lost on how to do this.

15
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,060
Now this is,

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,460
well,

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,310
first of their two ways to do this.

18
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,850
You could do this through trip track changes,

19
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,840
which I can't recall for the life of me if I've already covered in this course.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,660
But if not,

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,830
I will check an ad elect tactic over drag changes or,

22
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,590
alternatively,

23
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,580
we could use a worksheet event.

24
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,780
There's a whole section on worksheet events in level three.

25
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,030
Andi,

26
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,780
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the code from the very last lecture,

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,800
which is another student.

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,750
Questions answered.

29
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,680
Long adapted to show Teresa have to do this.

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,930
So here goes.

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,880
You'll find a downloadable resource from this like check.

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,920
Uh,

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,220
it's called level three sq.

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,620
A student Questions answered.

35
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,800
18 telling a date stamp.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,320
If a change has being made now,

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
you'll find two sheets in this downloadable file.

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,540
You have sheet one which is completely blank.

39
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,000
And you have your get your code here on dwelling them Do.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,950
So I'm just gonna scroll up to supper this select all control and see to copy.

41
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,110
I would come to developer open visual basic,

42
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:42,650
and I'm double gonna double click in sheet one because we're this is work sheet code now,

43
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,130
just like in the last lecture of the the section about workbook events.

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,250
This code was something I've butchered from Microsoft on.

45
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,290
The link to the original code is here at the very top of the code.

46
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,660
So I'm just gonna stroll down and here's the modified code.

47
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,100
Eso If it's rammed on the far left,

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,450
then it's the original Microsoft wording.

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,220
And if it's rammed here,

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,860
they're my remarks.

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,880
So basically,

52
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,000
what we have is a work sheet change event on.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,420
What we're gonna be doing is we're looking at the key cells range B Y comma,

54
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,000
a notice that the quotes go before the B and after the last a day.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,140
So we're looking for any changes that occur in columns.

56
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:39,230
Be to why or column A Now here's the villa code that's gonna look to see through has been a

57
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:39,740
change.

58
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,060
If not application does insect.

59
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,540
He sells range target dust Address is nothing.

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,280
Then,

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,450
if a change has been made,

62
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,430
execute this code.

63
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,850
If no changes being made,

64
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,800
this code isn't gonna run anyway,

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,550
or it's going to go straight to the ends up.

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,110
And so what I've done,

67
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:04,370
because Theresa wants to add a time stamped to range zed two columns said,

68
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,250
is the first thing we need to do is we need to find out which row has being changed.

69
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,570
And that way we can build our cell address for where we're going to write our time stamp.

70
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,340
So what we're going to do is say,

71
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,080
range zed because we know it's always going to be in columns set or see if you're in

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,520
America.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,030
Andi Target.

74
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,100
That's the cell that is being changed dot ro,

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,310
and that's going to get us the row number.

76
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,400
So said,

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,990
Plus,

78
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,100
the road number will give us the act.

79
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,180
The actual cell address no we're going to do is we're gonna change the DOT value to,

80
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,800
and I've also added this environment used name just so we can have a use and Hayman there

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,570
as well with a space onda a time stamp.

82
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,620
So let's just flip back to that word but can have look here that works now granted,

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,330
because there's nothing in the sheet,

84
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,860
it doesn't look terribly impressive,

85
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,790
but then we just type something in a And where's over?

86
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,880
Two column column boy,

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,350
isn't it?

88
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,090
And you can see that nothing was.

89
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,730
COLUMN Why so Must have to write down that alphabet for me.

90
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,160
Diego COLUMN Why nothing at all has happened in column way.

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:22,160
But if I had something in column B and hit enter and then come over to column white Ah,

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,990
you can see that we now have a timestamp.

93
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,600
Jarvie.

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,150
That's May 23 11 2018.

95
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,800
At 706 I start work early on 13 seconds.

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,610
That has a change has been made.

97
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,450
So there,

98
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:44,130
if I was back over here and delete that on with Mike over here they go.

99
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,500
You can see that another changes being made.

100
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,440
Now let me just delete that and make a change in here.

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,700
No,

102
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,640
because this isn't in our specified range.

103
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,800
Nothing's gonna happen on because a B isn't in our specified range.

104
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,260
Nothing is gonna happen,

105
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,950
but a is you never specified range when they hit Enter.

106
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,150
I automatically get a time stamp on the use of stamp that says Jarvie.

107
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,120
23 11th 18 2007 07 And also I think it went through toe.

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,850
Why didn't it see if I change something?

109
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:24,650
W bump Lego We got an updated timestamp Jarvie 2011 2018 at 77 on 13 seconds.

110
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,190
Hopefully that helps Ondas always.

111
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,490
If you have any questions,

112
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,330
do just let me know and I'll be happy to answer them for you.

113
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,970
Have a great day and I'll see you in the next lecture.
