1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Okay,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:02,610
guys.

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,620
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:03,850
Now,

5
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,030
before we get down to our email routine,

6
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,070
we're just going to run this code through so you can see what it does life.

7
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,200
Now,

8
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,060
what we're gonna do,

9
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,020
it's just hit f eight and step through the code one Linus sign.

10
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,430
So we've just loaded check out and those new sunscreens into our subject.

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,930
We've selected this sheet.

12
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,950
If it wasn't already selected,

13
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,730
we using the worksheet function can't if to find out how many people have blonde hair.

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,570
Andi,

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,190
there are 13 there.

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,670
We know there are 13 weaken resize,

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,560
weaken re dimension era ray tohave 13 by two elements.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,310
So ago.

19
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:46,270
My array is 13 by two and you can see down here I've added a watch to my array And for each

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,170
of these individual elements one through 13 I have two elements.

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,270
One for first name,

22
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,810
one for the email address.

23
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,620
So no,

24
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,900
Minister elect column E.

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,780
And I'm gonna find first instance of blond and select that cell.

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,590
So far,

27
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,840
so good Initialized the counter.

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,860
So it is no worth zero.

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,970
Now we're into our active cell.

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,760
If the active sold up value doesn't equal blank,

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,460
then do this check value of my counter crony zero against the Bluhm camp,

32
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,000
which is 13 on when this equals this jump to the section e mail section.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,950
Which is this label down here?

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,060
We're not there yet.

35
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,050
So what we're gonna do is come to biological test.

36
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,450
Is the actor cell equal blunt?

37
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:28,640
Well,

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,960
yes,

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,520
it does.

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,440
In which case,

41
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,750
my cancer equals my counter Zero equals zero plus one.

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,490
So my cantor is now worth one.

43
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,440
So my array warm my cancer one.

44
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:49,210
So this element here 11 is gonna equal the first name which were using by extracting the in

45
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,200
string to find out where the space is.

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,620
Subtracting one on extracting the left.

47
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,530
Most characters of column A.

48
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,350
So look what happens down here.

49
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,240
There we have Luca,

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,650
and then we're gonna have a look.

51
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,800
Two rows over or two columns over.

52
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,800
More to the point which want to capture the email address Excel essentials,

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,290
they go.

54
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,510
So now we're gonna move down a cell on,

55
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,910
we're going to keep moving down a cell,

56
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,760
and we're going to carry on all the way down.

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,190
In fact,

58
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm gonna run all the way down until we get to hear.

59
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,660
So debug rule.

60
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,360
Ticker sack.

61
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,650
Whoops,

62
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,280
A daisy.

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,550
Now I'm going to run and get to do poke on down to here.

64
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,570
So now when I expound all of these watches all the way down to 13 you can see that we have

65
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,650
all of our data.

66
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,160
OK,

67
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,840
now we know exactly what the first section does.

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,420
Never gonna close that.

69
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,930
Okay,

70
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,960
so now we're down to the section the loop to send the emails.

71
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,740
So for my can zap,

72
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,390
we don't need to re initialize,

73
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,390
because at the moment it's where 13.

74
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,560
But we're now going to say it's going to be worth from warm to the blown counts.

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,100
As soon as we execute this code,

76
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,270
my cancer is gonna equal one again.

77
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,730
So let me just clicking here.

78
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,570
It hit F eight and they were into that email route email routine bump.

79
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,550
And here we go.

80
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,170
So here we have exactly the same code that we looked at earlier,

81
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,400
but I've just made a couple of modifications.

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,450
This part so far is exactly the same.

83
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,020
I have changed the body of the text.

84
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,800
So said hi there on and my array 11 which is the first name.

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,740
So it's gonna say hi there on whatever the first person's name is.

86
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,780
Kama Andi New line,

87
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,480
New line.

88
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,890
Insert two gaps.

89
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,240
We just want to let you know about our on done.

90
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,800
And here's our message.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,550
This part changed and I'm gonna hit body text that's going to do that.

92
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,850
I'm gonna pick up that era.

93
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,040
I am sending it to my array one on the first pass through Element number two,

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,850
which is the e mail address.

95
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,750
Andi,

96
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,670
that's about it.

97
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,120
I don't think I made any other changes.

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
So let me just show you Outlook,

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,310
Bago,

100
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,030
our new e mails in outlook at all.

101
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,660
No dependent.

102
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:00,760
Oh,

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,090
fast.

104
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,490
My Internet connection is I'm just going to do that.

105
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:11,020
And hopefully if I come back to outlook any second now here we go with synchronize in the

106
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,150
in box,

107
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,300
there is our first message.

108
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,070
So there you go.

109
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,040
It's from Alan.

110
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,560
There's a second message and you can see over here in this window it says how they're Luca

111
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
because obviously the 1st 1 was Luca.

112
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,790
We just went to let you know about the new range of sunscreens.

113
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,090
This range is the best sunscreen there that.

114
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,950
And we'd love to send you a sample.

115
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,390
What?

116
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,520
Hope for this delivery in the next couple of days.

117
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,990
Those nice folks at Excel Essentials.

118
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,080
And they can see because we've actually used the same email address for everyone.

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,860
We have that one that went to Lily.

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,850
We have Sophie.

121
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,940
We have Isabelle.

122
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,120
We have mayor.

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,030
We have Abigail.

124
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,940
We have We have them all.

125
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,290
So we should have 13 e mails.

126
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,950
And if I can't want 23456789 10 11 12 13 e mails on.

127
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,720
That is how you run this email routine.

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,420
OK,

129
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,390
I hope you enjoy that.

130
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,050
And I'll see you in the next section.
