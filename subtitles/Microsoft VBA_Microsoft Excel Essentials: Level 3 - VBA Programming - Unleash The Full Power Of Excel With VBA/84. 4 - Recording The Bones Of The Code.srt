1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,710
guys on Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,960
All of the things that you're gonna learn in this section going to be completely adaptable

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,640
to whatever data set it is that you look at.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,380
But just as an illustration,

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,020
we're gonna work through this point by point.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,770
And what we're gonna do initially in this lecture is we're going to record a few simple Mac

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,190
Rose.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,950
They're going to give us the bones of what we're looking for.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,430
So the first thing I'm going to do because we need a new sheet to add our report onto its

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,830
own record a macro and we'll call it on new sheet hit.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,170
Enter.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm gonna hit.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,760
Plus,

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,260
now,

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,520
I want this to be import rate orientation.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,660
And I wanted to fit one page by one page,

18
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,080
so it just it controlled.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,570
And Peter,

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,760
bring up the print dialog box on.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,450
We change the orientation to landscape on the scaling slightly off screen there.

22
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,390
But I'm choosing fit sheet on one page on when I'm happy on that click back.

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,770
No,

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm gonna hit.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,090
Stop recording Macron number one.

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,910
I'm coming back to here and there were going to do macro number two.

27
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,190
What?

28
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,520
This is going to do is give us a chart that's going to show us the profit by day.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,150
So again,

30
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,590
I'm gonna start record.

31
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm going to call this profits by day.

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,120
Hey,

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,620
center,

34
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,150
I'm gonna choose here,

35
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,930
which is sell d six.

36
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,850
I'm gonna hold down,

37
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,340
shift control and down that gets us all the way down to the bottom of the state.

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,540
Arrange hold control again.

39
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,910
Choose profits,

40
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,150
shift control and down.

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,060
And then I'm gonna come to insert and I'm gonna choose recommended charts on I'm gonna

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,900
choose this one here That gives us the value down the left hand side,

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,790
across the bottom,

44
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,550
the dates.

45
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,370
So that's the Clustered column.

46
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,990
I'm gonna click,

47
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,640
OK?

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,230
And you can see that that's been added to this sheet.

49
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,850
And that's not where we want it.

50
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,460
So,

51
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,650
men,

52
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:55,910
right,

53
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,700
click and cut.

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,410
Come sheet one.

55
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm just gonna choose Sell a five right click and paste.

56
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,980
Andi,

57
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,950
I'm gonna scale detail it a little bit today.

58
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,180
Go.

59
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,610
OK,

60
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,350
so stop recording.

61
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,630
That is our first chart on next one is going to use all of this data sets because we want

62
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,150
to return how much profit to the sales person makes So and then a recorder macron Cool it.

63
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,940
Profit by sales bond on its.

64
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,650
OK,

65
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,270
now I'm gonna select a six hit control and a to select all of that region.

66
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,580
I'm gonna come to insert recommended pivot tables and you can see that this one gives us

67
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,910
Exactly what we want is a sum of profit by sales person,

68
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,510
which is exactly what we're after,

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,840
so OK,

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,660
but we can see that that's been added to sheet to.

71
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,310
We'll correct that a little bit later.

72
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,470
Hit.

73
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,950
Stop.

74
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,670
I'm gonna come back to here.

75
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,330
I already have this selective but won a record again.

76
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,750
So I'm gonna hit record and I'm gonna call this profit by category.

77
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,150
Hey,

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,680
center,

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,550
select this self hit control in a That's going to select all of the current region board by

80
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,430
spaces on the come up to insert owner Choose recommended pivot tables on this time This is

81
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,460
the chart that I want.

82
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,000
I want the sum of profit by CASS agree on hit O'Kane You can see that's been generated in a

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,850
different chart.

84
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,710
So far,

85
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,510
so good hit.

86
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,550
Stop on now What I want to do is I want to add some commentary to this sheet.

87
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,340
Okay,

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,010
Now we're just gonna record a macro toe at some commentary and hear someone called this at

89
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,550
Com and Terry.

90
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,860
Okay,

91
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,520
so they go.

92
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,870
That's what we wanted to say.

93
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,130
The month report for months.

94
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,150
And it's in upper case because this is going to be dynamic.

95
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,770
Remember,

96
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,550
year on the North ERN region North will be dynamic.

97
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,090
Luckily earned will take on through the end of north,

98
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,510
south,

99
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,310
east all west and still be the right word on.

100
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,940
We're going to say that total profit for the dynamic months dynamic here in the northern

101
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,890
region waas on whatever the Prophet Waas and you'll notice that those particular sections

102
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,740
that we want to draw the eye to have done in bold OK,

103
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,510
in the next section.

104
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,420
We're gonna have a look at deconstructing that code that just stop that recording on.

105
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,270
We'll see how we can make it dynamic.

106
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,850
OK,

107
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,260
I'll see you in the next lecture
