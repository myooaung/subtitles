00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Okay,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:02.710
guys.

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.530
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.400
Now I've added a little bit more codes populate a four and a five,

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.530
which are just here.

6
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.420
So we now have the top performing sales person Waas and we can see here it was Dustin G.

7
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.540
Now you may recall a little earlier on when we were doing these particular pivot tables,

8
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.860
I said,

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.350
it's going to come in very useful when we saw the data.

10
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:30.810
Now because we hard coded that we're pasting this table at 8 23 Once we perform the source

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.930
automatically,

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.100
the cell immediately below is going to give us our top performing sales guy,

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.190
which were then used by saying Range A 24 here.

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.620
It's always going to be in range a 24 and consequently,

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500
because we sorted the data,

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.170
the top profit is going to be on the cell immediately over so we can hard code B 24 on

17
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.930
similarly,

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.580
with this range for the category,

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.250
because we hard coded that we were going to paste a d 23.

20
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.410
Obviously,

21
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.620
no,

22
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.410
we've sorted it.

23
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.110
The best performing category is going to be one cell below.

24
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.620
So we've said d 24 on,

25
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.140
then the highest profit for that category is gonna live it e 24.

26
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.880
Now we have a boat load of more code below this.

27
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.420
But what we really want to do is find out what out of all of that is the actual key piece

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.040
of code that we need to make certain parts of this string bold.

29
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.030
So just to simplify it record new macro doesn't matter what's going to be called on notice

30
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.030
.

31
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.190
What's happening here?

32
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.580
I'm going to go over from the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th to the fifth character.

33
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.960
I'm gonna highlight the word total,

34
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.350
and I am gonna make it bold.

35
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.160
So there you go.

36
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.060
I'm gonna click off and I'm gonna stop recording on.

37
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.290
I am going to come here,

38
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.120
go to view on.

39
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.770
I'm going to get to Project Explorer and have a look at the code that's been generated.

40
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.730
So there you go.

41
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.630
Just for making the world total profit we've generated.

42
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.050
I don't know how many lines of code quite a lot.

43
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.170
So we knew that the first thing is active Cell Formula One.

44
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.570
The profit for January blab,

45
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.780
blab,

46
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.850
blab that's just filling in what the cell is going to say Now remember what we did.

47
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.230
We went over five cells on before five.

48
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.550
Sorry.

49
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.520
We went over five characters on 45 characters.

50
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.880
We changed the fund too bold.

51
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.690
So here we have an active cell.

52
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.010
Dark characters start one length of four phones equals regular.

53
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.250
All that means is we didn't change the 1st 4 characters that can go.

54
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.460
And here we get down to the interest in parts.

55
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.870
We have active cell dark characters Start position five,

56
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.740
Which is exactly what we didn't for a length of five characters change the fund to bold,

57
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.430
and that is exactly what we did on the rest of it.

58
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.190
From 10 through 2 60 which I'm gathering is the length of that string.

59
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.440
The phones is regular,

60
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.070
and then I clicked off.

61
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.210
So the key piece of code that we are looking for is this.

62
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.450
So let me just copy that,

63
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.030
come back to our original code,

64
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.090
and we're going to be playing with a three first.

65
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.950
So I'm just gonna give us a few lines of space here.

66
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.640
I'm gonna pace that in now,

67
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.360
as you'll remember with the with end withs.

68
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.450
There's a lot of redundant code in here.

69
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.970
What we actually did was we changed the funds style.

70
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.600
So I'm just gonna copy that.

71
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.190
I'm gonna come to the end and I'm gonna pay sitting here because what we actually want to

72
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.300
do delete all of that and delete all of X.

73
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.870
We didn't change anything else.

74
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.760
What we want to do with range A three.

75
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.180
We don't need to say active cell with range A three.

76
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.460
We want the characters to begin.

77
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.100
It won ever they start Point of this particular string is for a length of off.

78
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.750
Whatever this particular string is,

79
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.100
make the Funt property on the font style of that property to bold.

80
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.660
So there are two things that we need to know.

81
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.590
What is the start position of our text?

82
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.780
And if we have look at our example Text.

83
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.750
The 1st 1 was month.

84
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.830
So we need to know at what point in that string does the word month appear on.

85
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.080
We also need to know how long is the word month or year,

86
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.150
all this value.

87
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.140
And we're gonna do that by using a V,

88
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.180
be a function called in string.

89
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.960
And it's going to be much simpler if we explain this in isolation.

90
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.200
So in the next lecture,

91
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.110
we're going to cover the in string function of VB A.

92
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.680
Okay,

93
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
