1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,690
guys.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,700
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,040
Now,

5
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,050
from this lecture,

6
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,370
you're gonna find a few downloadable Resource is now the 1st 1 that you should be getting

7
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,750
Is this file just here?

8
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,720
It's called my macro book dot x l s x on.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,480
What going to do?

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,710
Since you've downloaded that,

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,500
you've opened it.

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,850
So you're looking at exactly what I'm looking at.

13
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,070
Come to either file and save as or just hit f 12.

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,360
Choose a directory.

15
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,090
We're going to keep it on change the save as type two a macro enabled workbook on.

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,320
Then just click save.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,720
So now this is a macro enabled workbook.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,210
Next thing we're going to do from Excel is hit Olsen F 11.

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,700
That's gonna bring the side visual.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,650
Basic editor on The next thing we're gonna do is come up to the insert menu and we're gonna

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,050
choose module.

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,400
And that is going to give us module one.

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,650
Now.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,830
I know in the last in the last section,

25
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,300
we created modules by recording macros.

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,470
No,

27
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,800
created automatically.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,300
But if you ever need to add one,

29
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,550
that's how you do it.

30
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,200
You go to insert and choose module.

31
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,180
So module one.

32
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,490
Now we're going to change the name of module one using the properties window down here.

33
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,200
If you don't see the properties window,

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,850
go to view and choose properties window here or you can see the keyboard shortcut is F four

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:23,850
.

36
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,360
So if this is invisible to you,

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,410
just her f four and it will pop up.

38
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,270
Now we're going to come to the name and we're going to call this whips deleted the day

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,170
we're gonna call this mod 01 underscore the basics.

40
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,030
Okay,

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,650
so they can see a module.

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,250
Name has changed that.

43
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,330
The next file that you need to download is the mud.

44
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:52,700
01 Underscore the basics text file on when you open that this is exactly what you're going

45
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,100
to see.

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,970
And this is what we're going to be going through in this section.

47
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,330
There's an awful lot of code,

48
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,010
but don't worry.

49
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,670
We'll go through it line by line and you'll understand it perfectly by the end.

50
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,210
So with this file,

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,530
open hit control in a hit control and see to copy it.

52
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,080
You can close it then on with mud.

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,690
01 The basic selected Clicking the colon window on hit control on V and that will paste all

54
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,850
of the code in my own personal my macro book into your personal my macro book.

55
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,570
Okay,

56
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,170
now we have a few more to go through,

57
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,710
so I'm just gonna come to here again.

58
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,850
I'm gonna hit module,

59
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,930
and again,

60
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,470
I'm gonna click.

61
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,350
Module 11 has just been added.

62
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,220
And here on the change,

63
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,230
the name of this one to copy on day trips.

64
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,890
No spaces.

65
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,220
Alan,

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,110
copy Andi Paste.

67
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,260
And now I'm going to double click that module.

68
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,360
So this is this window is associate ID.

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,680
With this module,

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,250
they're going to come to the mod copy and paste text file and he can see the code that's in

71
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,250
.

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,820
That's going to hit control and I control and see,

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,060
So I've copied it'll.

74
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,910
I'm gonna come back to this window.

75
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,380
I'm gonna paste in here.

76
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,700
Now I'm going to continue to do that for the other modules and I'll be back with you in

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,590
just a second.

78
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,570
Okay,

79
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:11,950
guys.

80
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,390
And welcome back now,

81
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,290
at the point of which I recorded this,

82
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,900
there are four downloadable text files.

83
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,530
They are called mud a one.

84
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,240
The basics mud copy and paste model looping on modern text and you can see that I've added

85
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,120
modules and rename them over here in the project Explorer on a side double click each one.

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,850
You can see the code associated with it,

87
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,980
and all of this code lives in those text files.

88
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,320
Now,

89
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,500
as the course develops,

90
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,900
they may well add MAWR text files here.

91
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,400
So if there's Mawr than the four text files that I've just mentioned,

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,160
don't worry about it.

93
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,820
Just download them and import them into a module that has the same name as the text file.

94
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,550
Okay,

95
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,950
now here's the thing.

96
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,680
Now we've imported all of that.

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,900
You should be looking exactly what I have.

98
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,160
You have a my second sheet that says she to she one that says sales nater she to that say's

99
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,550
looping in bracket sheet.

100
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,850
Three.

101
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,350
Let's hip say's scratch on this workbook and then these four modules with all the code in

102
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,670
that we've just described.

103
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,020
Now here's a thing.

104
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,740
If you are in V B.

105
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,200
A,

106
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,710
you can hit save,

107
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,810
and that will save your workbook.

108
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,630
If you're not in V B A.

109
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,120
And you just click save on Excel.

110
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,410
It will also save your workbook so you can save in either the V,

111
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,400
b E or Excel.

112
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,440
And it saves both of often seen people save him.

113
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,280
One immediately flipped to excel and press save again.

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,620
It does exactly the same thing.

115
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,280
Okay,

116
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,350
now what we're gonna do,

117
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,860
we're going to come to the scratch sheet just here.

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,050
We're gonna hit developer on.

119
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,720
So far,

120
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,460
we've looked at how to run code using the using the macro section up here or using the

121
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,780
whatever else they are.

122
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,720
But what we're going to do for a new,

123
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,320
awful lot of the section is we're going to run the code from a button.

124
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,000
So from the developer ribbon,

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,690
we're going to come to hear the insert on.

126
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,510
We're going to see form controls and Activex controls.

127
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,760
What we're gonna do is choose form controls.

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,950
Button on.

129
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,710
That's the 1st 1 at the top left.

130
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,450
So I'm just gonna left click on.

131
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,650
I'm just going to drag a button here.

132
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,600
It doesn't matter how big it is,

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,850
So there you go.

134
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,390
Now,

135
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,820
what we're going to be clicking here is the basics.

136
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,070
Testing this.

137
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,110
I should have made the rest of these private,

138
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,750
But what we're gonna do is double click basics testing this on.

139
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,060
I'm just gonna rename that by editing the text on the same Osho.

140
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,310
Say,

141
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,430
run my code groups on Don't hit.

142
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,540
Enter on,

143
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:48,720
then.

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,870
Just click off on.

145
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,390
Now when we come back to here,

146
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,840
Whenever we look at all these bits of code that we're about to look at in this section,

147
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,170
what we do is we're just going to copy of the elements.

148
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,890
So this particular bit here on we're gonna paste into here,

149
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,120
and that is the code that we're going to execute.

150
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,100
Okay,

151
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,570
I'm going to see you in the next lecture.

152
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,150
We're gonna have a look at customizing the visual basic register a little bit,

153
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,320
and then we'll crack on.

154
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,020
Okay,

155
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,440
I'll see you in the next lecture.
