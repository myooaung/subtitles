00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.650
guys,

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.530
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.770
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.590
Now this one is again from Neil on what Neil has is a colossal great data set with the

6
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.550
unique 13 digit reference mostly living in column.

7
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.590
May occasionally bleeds over two column B or column C,

8
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.090
but I think he said D in the here in the question.

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.300
But I've just coded this for a B and C,

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.340
but when you see the code,

11
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.690
you'll know you can see how easy this to modify.

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.480
So this is completely mocked.

13
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.850
Update of what we have is 4016 lines on.

14
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.270
We have some unique M pan numbers.

15
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.610
This is for the power industry,

16
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.240
so they're all 13 digit numbers.

17
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.810
Again,

18
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.070
this is just completely randomly created.

19
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.150
Data on what we should have in this colossal file is 365 entries for each unique impound,

20
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.570
and you can see that we have half Everly meter readings again,

21
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.490
totally made up,

22
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.030
just using a ram between all the Web column,

23
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.670
a wife.

24
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.360
So it's a fairly big data set,

25
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.850
and the aim of the exercise is to go through this and create something like this,

26
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.540
and this is a book,

27
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.600
a new workbook that has all of the particular impound radiance for each unique entry,

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.310
all the way down to 365 was probably quickly.

29
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.840
By doing that,

30
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.140
they would get 365 with each one having a tab off its own,

31
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.510
and they're all in there.

32
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.010
So let me close that on.

33
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.670
Let's talk through the logic of this,

34
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.300
so the first thing that we need to do is create a unique list of 13 digit codes out of

35
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.320
columns A,

36
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.850
B and C.

37
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.510
Then,

38
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.320
using that unique list,

39
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.150
what we need to do is create a new workbook and add sheet for each of those unique entries

40
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.150
.

41
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.300
Then what we need to do is go through each of those unique entries in turn,

42
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.600
loop through this entire data set,

43
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.830
hopefully capturing all of the entries from Column A.

44
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.570
But if not bouncing over two column B and repeating,

45
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.420
there's no two column,

46
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.290
see him repeating until we've course all 365 entries and as we capture each one,

47
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.270
what we want to do is write it to the new workbook to the appropriate sheets and then at

48
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.680
the end.

49
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.470
We wanna have add Header,

50
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.220
which is always the same from here.

51
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.350
So let's have a look in that we create that code and this is it just here.

52
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.130
So we have a few variables.

53
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.340
We have excess injury,

54
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.390
which is just going to count the number of rows wires in Georgia,

55
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.420
which is going to count each time we do a copy and paste.

56
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.810
Each time we found a match,

57
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.860
my limit is going to count how many times this M pan appears in columns A,

58
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.840
B and C,

59
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.570
and then we can check why against my limits.

60
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.530
So if we happen to filled all 365 interest by the end of column A or somewhere Down column

61
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.720
A,

62
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.980
we're not gonna have to carry on down column A and then B and then see,

63
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.750
we can just exit that loop.

64
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.440
My tempest is going to hold the unique impound number on my new book.

65
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.960
We're just going to use that to capture the name of the new workbook as it's created.

66
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.140
So my keep holds a little dodgy.

67
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.730
Today it's a wireless keyboard,

68
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.490
so this is the third time I've tried to record this lecture I'm hoping it's not going to

69
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.030
get stuck,

70
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.070
so firstly,

71
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.520
make sure we're on the right sheet.

72
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.270
Cheats Cheat one Select.

73
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.690
Obviously it's not called sheet one.

74
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.660
Change the name.

75
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.620
Now here.

76
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.460
We're going to capture the number of rows in this complete data set.

77
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.740
So we're just gonna map it to where the variable why we're going to say range A one dot

78
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.170
current region which you'll remember picks the whole region dot round rose,

79
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.770
doc counts or when we have fate over that X is now worth 4000 and 16 They were going to do

80
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.370
something that I frequently do.

81
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.800
When I'm doing work like this,

82
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.340
I add a new sheet temporarily.

83
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.740
So I'm going to use sheets.

84
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.310
Add after sheets.

85
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.850
11 is the index number.

86
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.470
So this is going to appear at position two and then I'm gonna rename that sheet to scratch

87
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.470
.

88
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.660
And I always called my sheets scratch,

89
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.390
and then at the end,

90
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.470
we're going to delete their snow.

91
00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.330
The next thing we need to do is get all of column A from a one to a X,

92
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.060
which will remember,

93
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.930
is how many rows of data we have.

94
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.460
So copy everything from sheet.

95
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.580
One range a one to a for a 16 And copy that to sheet scratch at position A one.

96
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.700
So when they hit F eight,

97
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.450
you can see that we've got a boatload of data all the way down here on.

98
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.690
Then what we're gonna do is do the same for column B and then column C.

99
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.900
So this time I'm gonna get sheets.

100
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.450
One range.

101
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.440
Be want to be X,

102
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.430
which is for a 16 And copy this two sheets.

103
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:36.930
Scratch the sheet range A 1,048,575 which is almost the very bottom go end.

104
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.020
Excel up,

105
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.160
which is going to get us to the bottom of this newly pasted date set on Offset one.

106
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.550
And that's going to get us our first blank row.

107
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.020
So that's done.

108
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.580
A.

109
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.630
So that's done A less than be And they were going to do the same.

110
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.620
We see notice that were coming from the bottom up and then offsetting one.

111
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.440
Know what we're going to do issues the remove duplicates and you can find this in the data

112
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.820
menu and this is just butchered from a quick recorded macro.

113
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.050
So I'm just going to do the whole of column a remove duplicates and hit F eight.

114
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.720
No,

115
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.320
I have all of the unique interests.

116
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.870
Now I'm gonna make sure start of the range by selecting a one.

117
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.170
And here's our first loop loop to test for length of characters of 13.

118
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.140
So do it's a do loop.

119
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.780
So we're gonna do while the active cell doesn't equal blank.

120
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.980
What we're going to say is,

121
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.090
if the length of the active cell doesn't equal 13 then delete the entire row if it does

122
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.440
equal 13 moved down on loop.

123
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.350
So we're just going to go through that Well,

124
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.940
step through.

125
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.320
So here are unique entries.

126
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.530
No,

127
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.870
it's going to start deleting,

128
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.900
so we've got a boatload to do.

129
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.000
So I'm just gonna debug and run to cursor on that here,

130
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.920
what we're going to do and this is again budget from recording macro down here from a one

131
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.030
to a 11 we're gonna paste accounted formula.

132
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:04.050
So I'm gonna say range be want to be range A for 1,000,400 whatever this 1000 end excel up

133
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.100
row on,

134
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.850
that's going to give me the row number of the last data entry.

135
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.620
So effectively,

136
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.670
this says B one to B 11 paced in account if formula there for just click on this formula.

137
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.560
He just see it's the sheets,

138
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:26.330
columns a through C on looking here So you can see that we have 365 different entries for

139
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.850
for this particular M pan across the whole of a B and C.

140
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.560
Okay,

141
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.950
so never gonna other new workbook boom.

142
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.710
And then we're gonna capture the name of that new workbook on we can see hovering over its

143
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.970
book.

144
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.680
For then,

145
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.950
we're gonna activate this workbook again.

146
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.240
Again,

147
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.920
We're just gonna pick column A And here we come to our first loop.

148
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.800
So do,

149
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.160
while the act itself doesn't equal blank.

150
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.180
So my temp is going to be the active cell values.

151
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.850
And there we have the impound number,

152
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.020
and then we're gonna add a sheet to the new work books or workbooks.

153
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.860
My new workbook,

154
00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.510
Duck cheats,

155
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.040
ad after workbooks.

156
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.510
My new workbook dot sheets open brackets,

157
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.450
workbooks.

158
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.760
My new workbook dot sheets.

159
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.470
Duck cams.

160
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.910
No,

161
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.850
it's important that you add this exactly as it appears in here.

162
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.950
Otherwise,

163
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.050
it will only count the number of sheets in the active workbook,

164
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.790
Not the new workbook you've just added.

165
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.750
So we're just gonna loop through.

166
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.790
And this is now going through all of these and add in a tub to that new workbook for each

167
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.950
of these particular impound numbers.

168
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.650
And then I'm just gonna come down to the bottom now.

169
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.170
20 bug and run that out.

170
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.470
Room two curses.

171
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.510
Let's just have a quick look at that of the sheet.

172
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.760
If something drank that into shut.

173
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.250
Sir Vega know we have a unique sheet for each of those 11 entries or 10 entries whenever it

174
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.560
waas.

175
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.250
So alternate 11.

176
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.130
If that.

177
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.980
Let's bring the other sheet back up so we can watch what's happening.

178
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.390
So there.

179
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.190
Okay,

180
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.930
so now we're gonna go back to the start of a one.

181
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.550
So we're now back at the top,

182
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.090
and there we have the big loop that's going to write the data.

183
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.550
So we're going to select a one again,

184
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.450
which will need to later on,

185
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.820
we're going to get the name off the first M pants on my temp equals that my limit is going

186
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.750
to read from here.

187
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.380
So my limit is 365.

188
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.710
No,

189
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.820
I know what I'm looking for.

190
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.150
And now I know how many entries I'm expected to find.

191
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.220
Sheets,

192
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.670
sheet one select,

193
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.390
go back to the data set.

194
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.690
And here is the A loop.

195
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.870
This is what we're going to do.

196
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.090
We're going to go through all of the A's first.

197
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.610
So a one select.

198
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.910
And it's a do loop while the active cells as an equal blank.

199
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:44.200
So if the actor cell doesn't equal my temp 3099 what we're gonna do is move down one on

200
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.650
loop,

201
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.750
and now we'll find that that does equal that.

202
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:54.100
And then what we're going to do is win a copy of the entire Roto workbooks,

203
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.430
my new workbook sheets,

204
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.400
my temps,

205
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.190
and we know we're going to get the right sheet again.

206
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.400
We're going to go range 81 million and armed.

207
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.870
Go up and offset by one.

208
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.160
So if the sheet is blank,

209
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.400
that's going to paste it.

210
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.350
A two.

211
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.390
I'm just going to scroll through.

212
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.910
I'm gonna move down the cell here and I'm gonna increase.

213
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.310
Why by one.

214
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.430
So why equals y plus one?

215
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.110
So why is now worth one?

216
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.650
Because we have copied and pasted once are limited.

217
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.230
365

218
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.220
So why doesn't equal 365?

219
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.500
So we're just going to go through?

220
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.070
I am.

221
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.370
We're gonna loop all the way until we get to my limit.

222
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.650
So I'm just going to debug and step into that run together any second.

223
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.790
Now,

224
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.690
this runs much quicker than the application screen update and some,

225
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.170
by the way.

226
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.440
Andi,

227
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.320
There you go.

228
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:49.900
So my limit no equals 365 and we have copied and pasted 365 times said that what we're

229
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.870
going to do is copy.

230
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.740
The headings were going to say range a one here,

231
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.020
the entire road,

232
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.410
Doc.

233
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.870
Copy to Workbooks.

234
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.070
My new workbook Again.

235
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.530
Sheets.

236
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.280
My temp,

237
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.990
which is the name of this impound range a one and that's going to put the head in straight

238
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.750
across the top.

239
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.380
Go to the next out of loop that is going to skip the B loop,

240
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.010
and that is going to skip the sea loop and it's gonna come down to hear this label next out

241
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.450
of loop,

242
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.670
we're going to reset.

243
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.340
Why?

244
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.360
So why is back to zero?

245
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.430
We're going to go back to the scratch sheet and we're going to delete the entire row.

246
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.720
So now when we loop a one is the next MPA.

247
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.840
I'm just gonna run that all the way through until we get to.

248
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.450
I think there's a be somewhere s so I'm just gonna run that through until we get to hear so

249
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:37.560
well,

250
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.650
that's going to do is run through the whole of column A and it's going to constantly count

251
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.460
every time we copy and paste until the number of times you copied and pasted matches the

252
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.110
number of entries in that thing.

253
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.400
Now,

254
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.930
I'm just gonna pause the recording for a second since what we get here.

255
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.720
Because without the screen updating on,

256
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.050
this is going to take quite a while to run so bad me just one second.

257
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.850
Okay,

258
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.810
and welcome back.

259
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.160
So now we if we look here,

260
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.990
we can see that my limited 365 for my temp whatever that says.

261
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.980
1614 something or other.

262
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.410
But why is only 364?

263
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:16.950
Therefore we haven't found all 365 entries in column A.

264
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:22.300
So now what column Bees is an exact copy of the A loop.

265
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.780
But instead of sand and a one it starts and be one simple Is that so?

266
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.600
Are we going to do is loop through this.

267
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.450
That doesn't appear to be moving down the big room to Carisa.

268
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.280
It is moving them,

269
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.150
but for some reason,

270
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.890
it's not showing on the screen.

271
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.450
Not sure why,

272
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:40.850
that is,

273
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.980
anyway.

274
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.190
So then we go to the next day of solute,

275
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.510
Chris.

276
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.350
Now my limited 365 and 165.

277
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.330
And then we're just going to run that up until we get down to here again.

278
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.730
I'm just gonna portia second,

279
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.380
because with screen updating turned on,

280
00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.220
this is gonna take a while to run through.

281
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.260
So bad me a second.

282
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.830
Okay,

283
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.480
here we go.

284
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.200
And we're back.

285
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.650
So we've run through columns A,

286
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.600
B and C,

287
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.350
if appropriate.

288
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:13.650
Until we found all 365 matches were temporarily going to turn off the display alerts.

289
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.050
Looks here we go.

290
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.880
Display alerts were going to delete the scratchy because we don't need to any more.

291
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.460
We're gonna turn the alerts back on.

292
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.080
Begin a select sheet one,

293
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.860
and we're gonna get to range a one on the file we have created in a limit.

294
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.630
Just and so far we have created looks like groups.

295
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.180
Looks like this.

296
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:38.940
And this is the newly created file and you can see if I expand it that we have a tab for

297
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.900
each of those unique numbers now with the application screen of data and turned on this

298
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.980
room's through in about 2030 seconds.

299
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.870
Something like that.

300
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.630
But that's how you do it.

301
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.480
As always,

302
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.290
the coach is available to download.

303
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.450
Let me just close that Save the code is available today and load in this violence all in

304
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:56.900
here,

305
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.650
and there's always if you have any questions,

306
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.830
just let me know,

307
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.510
OK,

308
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.530
thanks for her much,

309
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.370
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
