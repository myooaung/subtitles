00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.630
guys,

3
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.350
welcome back.

4
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.520
We're gonna have a look at our first type of loop,

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.450
which is called a do loop.

6
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.950
So I'm just gonna type a new cell phone.

7
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.210
Call it loop.

8
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.950
Court liver can't have spaces,

9
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.860
do Lou and hit.

10
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.400
Enter on and subs are automatically in there.

11
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.840
Now.

12
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
The first thing that we need to do good practice Tell VB a where we're going to start.

13
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.080
We want to begin in range a one dot selling So they go.

14
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.620
We know what always going to be starting in the same thing.

15
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.970
So select start off range they go.

16
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.900
That's a nicely remnant piece of code,

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.200
so we'll always know what that does.

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.330
Now whenever you write a loop,

19
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.120
just as with logical tests in which we're going to come onto shortly,

20
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.820
you should always start your loop on a do loop begins with do hit,

21
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.720
enter a few times and then close your loop.

22
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.270
It's much easier to do that way,

23
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.950
and it's a good practice because if you start right,

24
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.670
do and then you end up writing 300 lines of code.

25
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.970
You may forget to close the loop and then when you come back to it's going to be difficult

26
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.550
to remember where you close the loop.

27
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.040
So when every type of loop of any kind type the name of the loop,

28
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.200
his hands for a few times closed the loop and that is the structure of this co just here.

29
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.830
So do enter a few times.

30
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.450
Loop.

31
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.940
Andi,

32
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.870
let's just tell it to do something for now.

33
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.710
So active cell dot offset 0.1 Open brackets one moved down one road.

34
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.650
No columns don't select.

35
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.450
So all this is going to do is loop around and move down one cell each time.

36
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.590
So I'm just gonna press f eight and you can see in the left hand window in Excel that we're

37
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.790
moving down one cell each time.

38
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.950
I'm just gonna keep my finger on their fate there.

39
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380
Andi,

40
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.170
we're going to continue.

41
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.900
Continue,

42
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.490
Continue.

43
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.710
Are now.

44
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.670
You can probably start to see the problem with a do loop that a do loop will execute

45
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.460
forever when we just press,

46
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.230
stop there and execute will do forever until it reaches line 1,048,576.

47
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.660
Which means it's looping of an awful lot of times when perhaps you don't want it toe loop

48
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.750
in infinitely.

49
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.130
So what we need to do is introduce a test to say,

50
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.960
When do I stop looping?

51
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:39.620
So what we're gonna do in here is we're gonna say while the active cell doesn't equal,

52
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.950
that's less than and greater than in computer speak.

53
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.760
While the active cell doesn't equal blank,

54
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.410
in fact,

55
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.040
just is good code In practice,

56
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.480
we don't need to type value because Thebes default value of an active cell is value.

57
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.130
But I'm gonna price type it in just for good practice.

58
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.000
So now our loop is going to say do while the active cell does not equal blank and then

59
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.770
moved on the cell.

60
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.520
So let's just step through that we can see that we're happily progressing through the code

61
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.170
there were down into the forties,

62
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.340
were down into the fifties sixties seventies eighties and was slow down here on the active

63
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.160
cell value.

64
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.340
If I hover over it,

65
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.100
we can see is 100.

66
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.980
We're going to loop.

67
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.450
We're going to go back up.

68
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.150
The actors sell value equals 100 moved down one cell loot back up.

69
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.390
The active self duck value equals empty and note notice what happens in the code here.

70
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.100
It's gonna skip this line a move immediately to end sub because we have satisfied this

71
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.370
criteria and now we're just gonna move to end sub Andi finish.

72
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.200
OK,

73
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.730
so that's one way of doing it.

74
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.250
Find loop until the active cell doesn't equal blank.

75
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.090
But we could say,

76
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.540
Let's give it a mathematical test.

77
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.610
We could say,

78
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.150
While the active cell is less than 36 or 38 let's say Okay,

79
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.630
so let's have a look about that code.

80
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.910
So we're going to select a one.

81
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.610
We're going to go down the wrong line.

82
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.730
10 20 We're getting down very,

83
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.500
very quickly.

84
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.670
25 26 27 28 29 30 33 35 Actor sell value.

85
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.640
We can hover over it.

86
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.250
So what the current value is so 35 is less than 38.

87
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.250
That's good loop.

88
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.030
It's No.

89
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.000
36

90
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.680
That's good.

91
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.180
Let's loop.

92
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.310
It's 37 let's loop!

93
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.710
And now the actor sell value is 38 which is not less than 38 so immediately.

94
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.040
We're going to go to end sub,

95
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.420
so if you use a do loop,

96
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.400
you must give it a condition to meet in orderto exit.

97
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.450
Otherwise it will loop through 1,048,000.

98
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.760
Whatever it is that the number of lines in excel Okay,

99
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.720
so that's a do loop.

100
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.250
Next,

101
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.760
we're gonna have look the four next loop,

102
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.360
which is probably about the oldest sleep you can get.

103
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.800
I'll see you in the next lecture.
