1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,680
guys.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,760
So this is really starting to take shape?

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,290
No,

5
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,160
because we have re populated the data on ear automatically.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,630
Weather chart has automatically updated so we can see that we have.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,590
This is obviously gonna be London down the bottom on.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,930
If I click on here on the line whips,

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,070
I can't select for some reason,

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,800
not intelectual.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,590
What's going on here?

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,160
If I click on the line,

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,560
you can see which data sets being selected.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,910
So clicking on here shows us that we're in London.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,670
Clicking on the are in shows us that we're in Rome and clicking on the Golden one shows

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,710
that we are in Cancun so clearly Cancun is doing better on the weather.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,170
Anyway,

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:44,890
outside,

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,850
let's go back and have a look at that code that we've just generated.

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,710
I'm still recording.

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,780
Let me stop recording.

22
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,480
Okay,

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,520
So the Kurd that we just generated most of that is gonna be me flicking around all over the

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,870
place,

25
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,660
which is going to be complete nonsense.

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,980
So I am just gonna delete everything all the way up to this bit.

27
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,460
Just here where I started screwing around.

28
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:05,880
Okay,

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,300
so this is what the code looks like we want to simplify this somewhat.

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,940
So I'm gonna copy.

31
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,310
It'll delete,

32
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,160
and I'm just going to paste it in here.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,660
So,

34
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,220
paste,

35
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,390
this is our redo formulas.

36
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,740
I'm just gonna delete everything from below it.

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,380
OK?

38
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,670
No.

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,820
Here we can see that we have ranged a six top select with the active cell.

40
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,780
Formula one always see you want right,

41
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,680
the formula immediately.

42
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,430
We know we don't need to do the select in the active cell weaken Just hit,

43
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,040
delete and say that.

44
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,420
So I'm just gonna do that for all of these.

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm just gonna bringing them up,

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,610
get rid of the select,

47
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,100
and that's gonna literally have the light,

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,910
the amount of code that we're gonna have to execute.

49
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,400
So this may be boring to watch,

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,010
but it's You're gonna have to do yourselves eventually.

51
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,220
Okay,

52
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,880
so on d J six almost there and then we'll do a quick sanity check on.

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,430
We'll say s so we have a B c d e f g h i and J.

54
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,980
That's absolutely correct.

55
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,660
OK,

56
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,170
so the next thing we need to have a look at is tied in up this thing over here.

57
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,620
What?

58
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:17,860
We actually want to say is range a six to J six and then do this auto sort thing over here

59
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:17,860
.

60
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,020
This auto fell.

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,600
So this was just one of selecting a six.

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,480
And this is where I went over to get to the end of the data range.

63
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:25,840
Now,

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,140
because we know the data range is from a six through J six weaken,

65
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,970
Just hard code that directly in here so rather saying selection What we can say his range

66
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,110
open quotes a 62 j six close quotes,

67
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,980
close brackets,

68
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,990
auto fill on that is going to fill that day to down perfectly.

69
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,630
I don't think I need to select it on what I'm probably gonna do.

70
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:53,950
Wait.

71
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,060
The end is select a warm to go back to the start and we are almost done.

72
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,240
So what I'm gonna do,

73
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,850
I'm gonna pause for a second while I run that entire section of code on.

74
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,450
Let's just make sure it works,

75
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,570
so I'll be back with you in just a second.

76
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,210
Okay,

77
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,680
guys,

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,690
And welcome back.

79
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,580
And there is the brand new brand new populated data,

80
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,050
which it's just pulled all the data from the Web site.

81
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,520
It took about 40 seconds or something to run,

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,750
but they go.

83
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,930
That's how you retrieve data from the website on Format it up.

84
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,850
So it looks perfectly nice in the table with a beautiful charts underneath.

85
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,160
Now one of the really neat tricks,

86
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,250
particularly when you have code that's going to take a minute or two to run or really

87
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,610
anything.

88
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,650
Love in about five seconds to run is toe have that meet little notification in the bottom

89
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,650
left hand corner,

90
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,820
then explains to the user exactly what is going on,

91
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,350
because the amount of times I've seen people executed macro that's going take site.

92
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,200
If it's a colossal macro state takes about 40 seconds to run,

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,560
people will say that this has crashed when in actual fact,

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,010
just that little bit of information to give them feedback on what's currently going on in

95
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,470
the code can save them complaining.

96
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,200
Okay,

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,270
in the next lecture,

98
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,790
we're gonna have a look at exactly how you do that.

99
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,360
Okay,

100
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,470
I'll see you in the next life
