1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Okay,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,880
guys.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,810
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,060
Questions answered.

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,550
Lecture.

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:12,130
Now this question is from Marine or Rennie or N a r e and E.

7
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,670
I'm not entirely sure how you pronounce that on Green or Rennes.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,900
Question is,

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,580
how do you use the application?

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:26,420
Worksheet functions specifically the V look up to write a bunch of look up formulas to a

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,580
range of cells all at once without actually using the range dot Formula are one C one

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,590
equals and then actually right in the formula.

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,880
So what we want to do is get the output from the formula,

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,280
but use the formula in code,

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,050
which is much faster than using a formula in excel.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,460
So just to make sure that I have covered absolutely every aspect of this question,

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,020
I'm going to show you every possible permutation that there is release everyone that I

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,680
could think of.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,850
Now you'll find us a downloadable resource from this lecture,

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,000
a file called V lookups.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
In code,

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,810
they can access eat in the Excel window.

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,080
But this is it V lookups in code another three sheets through a sheet one,

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,710
which is where we're gonna do our look,

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,860
hoping there is sheet to where our data set lies.

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,790
This is what we're looking up from on.

27
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,940
There's also going to be a get your code here sheet and when I finish this later,

28
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,650
I'll post the code in there.

29
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,440
So all you need to do is download it.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,910
Copy all of the code in the get your code here and paste it into a regular module.

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,790
So here we go.

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,050
Permutation one.

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:37,630
We're firstly gonna look at hard coded ranges using this sheet name that is the tub name

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,680
that's down here.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,540
So this subs call hard coded V lookups single cell.

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,510
So what we're going to do is say range be $1 value here equals application work.

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,200
She function dot v Look up range a $1 value.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,650
So we're looking here.

39
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,140
She eats she too,

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,010
which is the name of this sheet just here.

41
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,350
Let me just move back.

42
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:10,460
We're going to say dot range a B because I want to look at all of this range he Xidan

43
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,810
around many entries on may end up having,

44
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,310
and I'm gonna say common to come a false because I want to return the second value.

45
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,810
So I'm just going to hit old.

46
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,150
Actually,

47
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm just going to run that and you'll see what happens.

48
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,110
So they go never get the value one in a So that's how to do a hard coded V look up on a

49
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,450
single cell.

50
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,750
So next up,

51
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,270
we have hard coded V lookups over a range.

52
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,950
Now what we're going to do here,

53
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,370
let me just delete that D Actually,

54
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,050
I'll leave the dean.

55
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,790
This is gonna be the same thing,

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,690
but over a range.

57
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,700
So what we have is range B one to B three,

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,900
which is here equals application dot worksheet function dot v.

59
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,570
Look up and we're going to say range a one toe a three,

60
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,600
which is here comma sheets sheet to again range A B.

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,720
So we're looking in all of columns A and B comma to come a false and I'm just going to run

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,250
that and see what happens.

63
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,320
They go.

64
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,420
So began out 123 Which is V looked up from sheet to just here.

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,650
So I say you do it over a range.

66
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,380
If it's hard coded now there are other permutations.

67
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,660
So what?

68
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,640
You may want to do issues and named range so here in sheet to have actually called this

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,710
unnamed range off my data and you can see there that that's the name range called my data.

70
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,250
So let's come back to here.

71
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,360
Let's clear those out.

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,640
Hit Delete.

73
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,660
So here we go.

74
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,300
So this is hard coded V lookups single cell with the named range.

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,960
So what we have is range B one they sell just here equals application dot worksheet

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,740
function dovey.

77
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,230
Look up.

78
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,680
Range a one dot value again.

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,130
Range my data.

80
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,480
No.

81
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,020
Notice that we have range open brackets,

82
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:09,800
open quotes the name of the named range close quotes closed brackets comma two come a false

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,060
name.

84
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,370
This is case insensitive.

85
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,510
So the actual named range is capital M Capital D.

86
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,470
But it will actually work out what this is,

87
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,910
so that should work perfectly.

88
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,540
So it's just run that and they go,

89
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,490
we get the answer of one in cell B one so similarly,

90
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,230
we can do exactly the same thing with the named range.

91
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,850
So this time we're gonna say range B one to b three dot value,

92
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,150
which is going to be the three cells.

93
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,990
Hair equals application dot worksheet function.

94
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,860
Don't be look up and again We're going to say range A Want a three So we're hard code in

95
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,750
this dot value combat range.

96
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,800
My data might named May named range comma to come falls.

97
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,050
So when over in this sub Diego yet 12 and three down there.

98
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,450
So that's how you do that with named Ranges.

99
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,470
And there is another permutation.

100
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,590
Let me just scroll up a bit eso again.

101
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,430
We're going to use a hard coded range and we'll start with a single cell.

102
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,430
But this time we're gonna use those sheets VB name.

103
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,350
Now if I just If I just go to view from go to Project Explorer,

104
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,570
you'll see that she too here is actually got vb name of shirt,

105
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,120
my sheet So we're going to be calling it bites VB name So again,

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,090
what we're gonna do say range B one doc value equals application that worksheet function

107
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,550
Davi,

108
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:44,460
look up range a one don't value again Shirt my sheet which is thievy be name of sheet to

109
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,250
dot range a be coming to come a false And when we hit play,

110
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,170
you know,

111
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,230
we get one returned in here.

112
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,910
So again let me just delete that and similarly conduce this over a range of cell.

113
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,800
So this time we're going to say hard coded B one to B three.

114
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,550
That's the cells Just here.

115
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,370
Come again,

116
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,390
say dot Value equals application.

117
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,100
Would she function dot v Look up.

118
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,830
Range a one to a $3 value shirt,

119
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:16,800
my sheet dot range A and B comma to come a false And then when we run that they go,

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,550
we get 12 on three down there now.

121
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,870
So far,

122
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,550
so good.

123
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,520
But we have hard coded where we are looking and where we are writing to.

124
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,950
But what if we want to make this dynamic?

125
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,980
Well,

126
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,550
here we go.

127
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,560
We've covered this in the course one just going to go have a quick run through it here.

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,740
Dynamic named ranges.

129
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,000
Now,

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,420
this sub is gonna this this always basically to recap on have you capture arrange

131
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,250
dynamically.

132
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,810
So this is what we actually want to select.

133
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,150
We want to say range a one to a force.

134
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,500
If I run that sub,

135
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,160
they go.

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,320
That's the range that's bean selected.

137
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,370
But what we want to do is capture that dynamically because if we had,

138
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,950
if we had say f at the end and then we run that sub.

139
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:10,580
You can see that we're gonna completely miss f out because it's hard coded and not dynamic

140
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:10,580
.

141
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,950
So what we need to do is build this string dynamically.

142
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,460
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna say range open rackets,

143
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,560
open quotes,

144
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,290
a one we need to hard code start of the range to a and close quotes.

145
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,130
Now,

146
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,720
what we want to do is add something to it.

147
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,740
So we're going to say andi range a one groups a misfire,

148
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
quotes range,

149
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:45,030
a one close quotes close brackets dot end and open the brackets,

150
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,810
and we want to go excel down there.

151
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,920
We could start at lane 65,000 or a 1,000,000 go up,

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,450
but I'm just going to go down first on a range a one.

153
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,550
So I'm going to say,

154
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,410
excelled down double click close brackets and I want to get the row number there.

155
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,030
Close brackets dot select Now I want to use Sam.

156
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,230
I want to use the road number cause I've already said I want Teoh A So all I'm looking for

157
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,140
is the number of that last row.

158
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,250
So Now let me just realm that bitter code out.

159
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,240
Now,

160
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,990
when I run this,

161
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,680
we should get all of the cells highlighted,

162
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,290
all the ones with values.

163
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,150
And similarly,

164
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,580
if we if we just had three and there we could delete that and run the code and then we're

165
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,970
just going to get 123 So they go.

166
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,650
That's how you do that Dynamically.

167
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,830
Now what we need to do this is where we're gonna be.

168
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,910
This is where the look up value is gonna live in our dynamic name range.

169
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,930
But what we actually want to do is we want to write the first argument where we are writing

170
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,550
the result to in column B.

171
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,450
So what we're going to do here,

172
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,350
I'm just gonna inaction was just going to copy that for a second,

173
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,500
uh,

174
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,940
copy,

175
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,500
and then you can see it in action.

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,380
So what we're gonna do here before we go to select one do say dot offset.

177
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,780
And I don't want to move any rose,

178
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,280
but I do want to move one column over because that is where we're going to write the

179
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,030
results of our application worksheet function dot v.

180
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,530
Look up and again.

181
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm just gonna do select so you can see what that off sent to the sun.

182
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,600
Just a step through this code.

183
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:32,290
So there's that range selected the A They were going to go to a but this time we're gonna

184
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,960
offset.

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,230
So when they hit F eight b is selected,

186
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,010
but it's selected on rose 12 and three.

187
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,880
And let me just run that through if we had d actually,

188
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,790
these don't need to be in any order in particular,

189
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,250
so I'm just gonna step through that again.

190
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,820
So they go on.

191
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,590
There you go.

192
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,210
So that's how you build the dynamic range.

193
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,970
So again,

194
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,550
I'm just gonna wish through those three permutations.

195
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,560
So this time we're going to use this sheik name,

196
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
which is the tub name,

197
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,180
which is sheet,

198
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,550
too.

199
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,360
So we're going to do what we did in the first instance,

200
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,210
Or rather in the second instance,

201
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:12,650
because we're writing our values to column be so we're gonna say range a one to a from a

202
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,260
one end,

203
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,250
moving down all the way down here till we get to our last cell and capture the row number.

204
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,460
So at the moment,

205
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,560
this is going to be a one to a five.

206
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,980
We're gonna offset one No rose one column which is going to give us this range here that's

207
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,230
currently selected and the game we're gonna say application,

208
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,660
which you function dot v.

209
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,010
Look up on this time we are going to read Column A So we're going to say range a one toe a

210
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,630
a one moved down and get me the road number.

211
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:53,880
So a one to a five comma sheets she to range a B comma to come a force close brackets.

212
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,550
So then when we run that code Boom,

213
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,060
there you go.

214
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,330
We get out results of half of the lookups.

215
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,760
Now,

216
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,550
I'm just gonna really through these last couple really quickly.

217
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,150
This is exactly the same.

218
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,080
Was true done before.

219
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,350
But this time it's using the named range.

220
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,170
So again,

221
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,170
we're going to use that same dynamic way of capturing where all of our V look up values

222
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,040
start and offset one to get US column B on.

223
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,020
We're going to use the application worksheet function dot v Look up.

224
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:26,670
But this time we're going to say range my data because it's a dynamic because it's unnamed

225
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,820
range just mixes up.

226
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm gonna put a in there again.

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,480
They go just keep you excited on.

228
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,550
Now I'm going to run that.

229
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,880
So they go,

230
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,160
There's off re lookups in action on finally using the sheets will be name.

231
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,310
It's exactly the same,

232
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,790
but here we have sure,

233
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,400
my sheet dot range a b.

234
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,850
So let's just go backwards.

235
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,640
F G h A B.

236
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,260
That's s assistant.

237
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,530
Even in there is it lets a day and let's just run the last one on they go.

238
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,020
Obviously,

239
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,090
we didn't have an agent.

240
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:06,450
Now let's say C you will most certainly had to say So Let me just from that There you go.

241
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,020
And that is every permutation I could think of on how to use the application worksheet

242
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,320
functions in code.

243
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
I hope that helped,

244
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,990
and it's always any questions.

245
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,790
Just let me know.

246
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,750
Have a great day
