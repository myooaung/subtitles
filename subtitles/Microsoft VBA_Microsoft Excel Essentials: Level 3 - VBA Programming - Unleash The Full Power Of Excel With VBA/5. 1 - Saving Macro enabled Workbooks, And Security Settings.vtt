00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Okay,

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.750
guys,

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm welcome back.

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.340
Now,

5
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.620
this is going to be a reasonably short lech and what we're going to do now we have some

6
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.030
code behind our normal spreadsheet weaken.

7
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.070
See if we just have a look at my file Explorer just here.

8
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.580
That the phone we're working on his excel three Sales day set out X L s X,

9
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.550
That is is a normal excel worksheet.

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.990
Now,

11
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.530
because we've now recorded a macro which if I can find it,

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.550
we can have a look at now we have recorded a macro.

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.360
What we need to do this save it is a different file type.

14
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.960
It's still gonna be excel.

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.490
But it's no gonna be an X l s m,

16
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.610
which is a macro en abled workbook.

17
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.120
And all that means is there is some code attached to this file.

18
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.490
So what we're gonna do is if we just hit save now we should get in there.

19
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.260
A message on the air message is going to say,

20
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.700
Hey,

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.390
the following features cannot be saved in macro free workbooks,

22
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.800
BB projects,

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.690
which is where our code lives.

24
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.170
So if you want to continue to save as a macro free workbook that is you will lose all of

25
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.970
your code.

26
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.680
Click?

27
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.220
Yes,

28
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.990
but if you want to save it as a macro enabled workbook,

29
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.950
which we do,

30
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.950
we're going to click.

31
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.500
No.

32
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.290
So we'll click.

33
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.670
No,

34
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.640
we'll get our save hours Dialog box.

35
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.050
This is where I'm currently store in this file,

36
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.120
they can see original file and you can see here we have saved as type X l s x I'm just

37
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.600
gonna hit the little down arrow on going to choose the next option down,

38
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.250
which is Excel Macro,

39
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.100
an abled workbook which is an ex l s m and I'm gonna hit safe.

40
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.280
And now,

41
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.640
if I drag over my file browser,

42
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.210
you can no see that we have two copies that have exactly the same name.

43
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.350
One is the normal x l s X,

44
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.290
which is on Microsoft Excel worksheet on the other One has the same name but as an

45
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.350
extension of X l s m,

46
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.220
which means it is a macro en abled worksheet.

47
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.480
Now what I'm gonna do ISS let me just line them up so you can see it nicely.

48
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.750
What I'm gonna do is close the file now,

49
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.450
So when I'm know going to do is open up the macro enabled file,

50
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.570
the one we've just done.

51
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.900
So when I double click,

52
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.770
you'll see you get this security war warning.

53
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.260
Depending on which version of Excel you got,

54
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.580
you may have a little pop up box in the middle of the screen,

55
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.480
but the security warning says Mac Rose,

56
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.910
have bean disabled,

57
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.100
and that's a normal security set in because some macros and malicious not the ones that

58
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.200
were going to write because there were going to be friendly and happy Macron's.

59
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.740
But some are malicious.

60
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.110
So if you trust the source,

61
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.460
which we do because we've already written this code just hit,

62
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.680
enable content.

63
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.490
And I'm just gonna close the thing about updating Excel.

64
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.220
And there you go.

65
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.590
So now we have our Excel file open.

66
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.380
We can result in F 11 and we're back into our code.

67
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.210
Okay,

68
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.650
I'll see you in the next lecture
