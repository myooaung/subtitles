00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Okay,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:02.730
guys.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.660
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.840
So I've already added the title into a one just here.

5
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.050
But if we have a look at the data that we've entered or the strings that we've entered into

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.850
a three a four and a five,

7
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.200
we can see some of them actually rely on data that we're gonna be populated with tables and

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000
charts that we already have.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.600
So,

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.200
to that end,

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.050
what I'm going to do is build a string to populate a three in here.

12
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.380
But immediately,

13
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.510
I'm gonna add this to a running order.

14
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.440
So that way we have the charts available to us when we come to write that next bit of code

15
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.440
.

16
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.910
So I'm just going to copy the name the subroutine pace into here.

17
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.890
I'm just gonna make sure I select the sore state sheet.

18
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.500
I'm gonna hit debug and run to cursor to get us down to this ad common tree,

19
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.790
and you can see here.

20
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.240
Now we have the data tables that we need to return that profit.

21
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.550
So f eight and I'm coming back down to here F eight f eight.

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.890
So now we're gonna add some co two range a three.

23
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.790
So I'll be back with you in just a second.

24
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.790
Okay,

25
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.150
guys.

26
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.810
And here it is.

27
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.990
One of donors have built it.

28
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.970
It built Achon.

29
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.600
Katyn ated string for range A three duck value saying the total profit four on we use in

30
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.770
the variable my month space my year,

31
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.970
Andi space in the space.

32
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.160
My region earn region waas And here are put range B 23 which is this cell here on.

33
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.110
We know it's always gonna be in beef 23 because we started paste in this table into a 23.

34
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.450
So we know that solid.

35
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.210
If we do change this,

36
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.340
so three paces a day,

37
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.900
24 will need to amend this.

38
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.610
So range B 23 dot end dot excel down dot value,

39
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.850
which is going to start here on go to the end of this range and therefore bring us our

40
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.450
profit.

41
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.280
So let's just test that out and I'm gonna go back inside the source sheet.

42
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.980
I'm going to run the code through all the way to their So where's I run?

43
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.940
Order something and debug room to Cassa.

44
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.460
Bubble,

45
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.710
bubble,

46
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.010
bubble on.

47
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.880
I'm gonna f eight and I'm going to run down to this here.

48
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.830
Andi whips.

49
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.580
It's this,

50
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.750
although scrolls that's up.

51
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.090
There's our title on there it is.

52
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.050
So the total profit for January 2016 in the northern region waas 8 to 12.28 Now it's know

53
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.950
exactly how we wanted to appear.

54
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.840
What we actually wanted to say is exactly that,

55
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.130
but we want tohave it formatted as currency on.

56
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.530
Luckily,

57
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.170
that's fairly straightforward to do.

58
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.660
So let me just hit stop on.

59
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.810
I'm just gonna add an underscore and bump that downturn of the line.

60
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.460
So this is the particular part of code that we're looking at its most definitely returned

61
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.550
in the right value.

62
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.210
It's just not returned in the correct format.

63
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.870
So are we going to do is have the word formats in front of it.

64
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.380
You see,

65
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.750
here's the expression.

66
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.650
So I'm going to come all the way over to the end,

67
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.520
and whatever your local currencies is perfectly fine.

68
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.750
I'm going to use pounds,

69
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.110
so I'm going to say panel,

70
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.360
sign in,

71
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.590
say,

72
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.480
0.0 and whips and close the quotes and then close the brackets.

73
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.680
So I'm just gonna delete the one that we've just created D book or delete in on a select

74
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.850
the source data sheet.

75
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.270
There we go.

76
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.550
And then let's room through that.

77
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.730
Make sure that that works.

78
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.070
So back up to here debug Run to cursor that gets us down to here.

79
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.430
F eight step all the way through there goes out title on There goes our first line of code

80
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.430
.

81
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.710
The total profit for generally 2016 in the northern region was pound sign £8212.

82
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.350
28 pence.

83
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.820
Okay,

84
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.720
I'm gonna build the strings for a four and a five,

85
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.150
and then we'll come back and we'll have a look at how we make those particular areas bold.

86
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.670
Okay,

87
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.100
I'll see you in the next lecture.
