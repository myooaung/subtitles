00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Okay,

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.500
guys.

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.900
And welcome to the The last lecture in the logical test in section on this one is

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.110
particularly useful.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.470
We can work out if a value is true.

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.320
If multiple values are true,

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.610
if either value is true or any combination of true's or false is using ands and ors and if

8
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.900
then on else.

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.520
But generally we only have two choices there.

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.150
It either is all the criterion.

11
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.820
Evaluate,

12
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.730
true or false wherever testing full.

13
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.440
In which case do think number one off the ways Do thing number two,

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.850
but one if you have more than two things that you want doing well,

15
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.880
that is where the Select case method comes in.

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.800
And we're going to step through this step at the time where you know what,

17
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.860
most of the stuff does we use in a four next loop again,

18
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.920
Just gonna hit her face like sheikhly.

19
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.160
The contents range A to select notice,

20
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.170
though selecting a to hear of use this very neat trick to find out what Lionel last row is

21
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.170
.

22
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.550
So the code is completely dynamic.

23
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.730
I'm just gonna stroll up here so we can see the four and the next.

24
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.490
I'm just gonna Indem that a little bit.

25
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.600
Okay,

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.070
so,

27
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.370
select case.

28
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.380
Firstly,

29
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.640
we need to read into a variable my age,

30
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.750
which I've declared way out That up,

31
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.520
I think of declared it.

32
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.720
Well,

33
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.080
that's up.

34
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.760
Haven't even declared it way up this up.

35
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.850
Let's have a look.

36
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.080
Where have I declared it?

37
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.120
Hopefully locally.

38
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.120
Then I beg your pardon.

39
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.580
We set up the variable here,

40
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.710
so I've declared its locally so it can only be used in this sub dim my age as interject

41
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.930
because we're going to be looking at column D.

42
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.590
But I've purposely selected column A just to show that you can be in any column and still

43
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.690
test data in a different column.

44
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.430
So a to select Find out what my last row is on loop until we have reached my last row.

45
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:06.540
So my variable currently zero because we haven't executed this line of code equals active

46
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.850
cell offset.

47
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.170
No rows.

48
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.200
Three columns.

49
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.630
Remember,

50
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:20.950
we are in a so 0123 It is looking a column D Even though we are going down.

51
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.210
Kahlan A so f eight f ace,

52
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.950
my age equals 20.

53
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.450
Now,

54
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.530
this is the format of a select case.

55
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.820
Select case space the name of the variable that you wish to evaluate.

56
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.010
So in this instance,

57
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.530
it's my age.

58
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.940
So we've just read that from here,

59
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.450
so my age equals 20 and then we can perform as many operations as we want to.

60
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.490
So here we've said Case is less than 20.

61
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.810
If case,

62
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.610
which is now my age,

63
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.800
is less than 20 execute this line of code.

64
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.480
If it is less than 30 execute this line of code.

65
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.410
If it is less than 40 this line.

66
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.250
If it's less than 50 this'll line it is greater than 50 or equal to 50.

67
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.830
This line Now you don't have to just evaluate numbers.

68
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.730
If you were checking for names,

69
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.550
you could say Case is open,

70
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.450
quotes Connor Phillips close quotes and then have some code that excuse for Connor Phillips

71
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.560
or you could be vetting.

72
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.510
Let me have a look.

73
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.690
You could be vetting column B and say,

74
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.470
if case is male,

75
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.650
do this one thing.

76
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.390
If the case is female,

77
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.650
do something else or you could be checking date of birth.

78
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.040
You could be ST for anyone that's nearing retirement.

79
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.990
Whatever year that works out to be,

80
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.720
do this for those people that are not nearing retirement do something completely different

81
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.720
.

82
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.840
So this one just checks the age.

83
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.600
So let's sir,

84
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.440
step through it.

85
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.840
F eight Casey is less than 20.

86
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.550
Let's just hover over my age.

87
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.030
Well,

88
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.770
it actually is 20.

89
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.220
So I'm gonna hit their face and it skipped over that skipped over that on day it says 20

90
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.160
something that 20 is not below 20.

91
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.890
So it didn't say teenager,

92
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.290
but it is below 30.

93
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.820
So I am writing 20 something six columns across,

94
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.300
which is obviously in Jay and select.

95
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.720
That's how you finish a select case argument it begin.

96
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.780
Select case.

97
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.650
The name of the variable you want to test and they just this case is what you're evaluating

98
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.880
on what you wanted to do.

99
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.240
What you're evaluating,

100
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.320
what you wanted to do,

101
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.630
what you're evaluating,

102
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.170
what you wanted to do as many times as you want.

103
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.050
So f eight moved down a cell because we use in the range method Next,

104
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.770
loop up.

105
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.220
Get my next cells age,

106
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.090
which is 22 select case my age testing against all of these on.

107
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.830
There you go.

108
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.810
20 something another 20.

109
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.260
Something stepped through my age.

110
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.990
My age is now 24.

111
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.410
This is gonna be the same thing.

112
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.630
Uh,

113
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.060
badly arranged data.

114
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.360
Oh,

115
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.580
we go my age 53.

116
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.520
So it's going to skip.

117
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.990
This is going to skip that.

118
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.090
It's going to skip that greater than sorry.

119
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.750
Greater less than 50.

120
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.590
Still that we are,

121
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:29.420
she's gonna We were 53 so over 50 no comment on moved on again on 30 something.

122
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.850
I'm just gonna hold this now,

123
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.390
there,

124
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.820
coming there,

125
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.840
coming through something.

126
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.950
Something like just beginning on hit play until we get to the end.

127
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.030
So there you go.

128
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.500
That is absolutely everything you'll ever need to know about logical testing.

129
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.820
You have a few programming projects in there.

130
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.250
You'll see them in in the fall when you download it.

131
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.490
I highly suggest you do at least the 1st 1 or two just so you can get you used to change in

132
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.280
the criteria that you're evaluating or converting.

133
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.790
Arrange piece of code to cells because cells is more efficient.

134
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.840
As I say,

135
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.670
I normally right using cell references so I can watch what's happening in Excel,

136
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.330
but sells code runs faster.

137
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.170
Okay,

138
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.750
I'll see you in the next lecture
