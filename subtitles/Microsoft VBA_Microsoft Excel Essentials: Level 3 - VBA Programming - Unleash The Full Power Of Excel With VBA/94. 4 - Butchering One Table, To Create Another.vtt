00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Okay,

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.300
guys.

3
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.400
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.630
And then we're gonna have a look at butchering this code,

5
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.780
which is now complete for the profit by sales bod using all of the shell of this code to do

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.350
the profit by category.

7
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.700
So I'm going to do.

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.890
First off is I'm going to copy all of this code and paste it above the code that we have in

9
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.340
that one.

10
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.380
So I'm just gonna hit control and seat coming here his centre a few times.

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.130
And there we have the outs,

12
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.500
the pivot table,

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.250
which is this block of code just here.

14
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.680
So let me just delete a second so we can see that in the same window.

15
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.150
Now,

16
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.240
the only difference we need to make here.

17
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.410
We had sheet three R three c one,

18
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350
but in this modified code,

19
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.000
we pasted to the active sheet because we've newly created Sheen said range a 23.

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.830
Now what I want to do is pay salad d 23 so it lines up still online 23.

21
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.260
It's gonna be a column D on the pivot table 11 Doesn't particularly matter,

22
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.480
Cus,

23
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.270
we're going to rename it here anyway,

24
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.550
so that get rid of that block off code.

25
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.370
Now you'll remember that the only difference other than where we're paste in the sheet was

26
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.180
this word here on this word here.

27
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.580
So what I'm gonna do is copy category and paste it over this word here so that essentially

28
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.430
now replaces this block of code on this adds the values.

29
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.250
Was this thing just here?

30
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.980
Now we can see that we call this profit by sales,

31
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.200
but we always in need to change that because we want to call it profit by category.

32
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.050
So this block of code we can delete.

33
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.350
Okay,

34
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.110
so now we're gonna call this profit by will call it proft by cat because that's more or

35
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.990
less descriptive.

36
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.840
So profit by cat there.

37
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.410
We just need to replace all the references of proft by sales bond to profit by cat.

38
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.230
That's not going to select the category.

39
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.850
So that's good.

40
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.750
So this is gonna be profit by cats.

41
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.030
We'll find out if I missed any when we actually run through the code and executed.

42
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.900
So replace that replace.

43
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.480
That's Andi.

44
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.350
Replace that.

45
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.190
So what I'm gonna do,

46
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.670
shrink that down a little bit on?

47
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.700
Hopefully we'll be able to see that working in here?

48
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.930
I'm gonna delete cheat for yes,

49
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.390
indeed.

50
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.270
So we will select the source sheet,

51
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.880
which is this one?

52
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.380
Just here.

53
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.200
Come ride the way up to the top two hour run order lips I forgot to add in the name of the

54
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.890
subroutine profit by cells,

55
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.950
but profit by categories.

56
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.880
Some coffee and Matt.

57
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.380
That's why I run order Way up,

58
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.910
That's up.

59
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.390
We know everything up to this point work.

60
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.620
So I'm just going to click on here,

61
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.150
hit debug and hit runs A curse that boom,

62
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.360
boom,

63
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.600
boom,

64
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.580
boom Boom on.

65
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.630
That's where we're up to.

66
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.620
So I'm gonna come back here f eight.

67
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.130
And now we're gonna add another one using the same data source,

68
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.100
but pace into the active sheet range D 23.

69
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.150
There is a code.

70
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.910
So we're now going to do the category thing.

71
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.630
So there goes our castle,

72
00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.810
wrist,

73
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.480
clothing,

74
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.040
groceries and household.

75
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.260
We're going to do that.

76
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.610
Which is gonna add in the values we are now going to change the road ahead that we don't We

77
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.810
met.

78
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.660
Save sales person One.

79
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.560
That's a category category on when we click off weaken F eight.

80
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.970
No,

81
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.010
it's called category.

82
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.230
We're going to do the range E 24 not be 24.

83
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.860
So e 24 that's the beauty in executing code one line at a time.

84
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.590
You can actually study what it's doing and pick up any errors that you've made.

85
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.440
So there's the converted to currency and here we go.

86
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.740
They should know source.

87
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.180
So clothing should commit to top.

88
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.440
Hair sold should be second,

89
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.870
and grocery should be sad.

90
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.890
Okay,

91
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.860
so that didn't work because I missed one.

92
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.320
I forgot to change the category here with sales person,

93
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.370
which was here,

94
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.200
so let's just stop.

95
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.170
I'm gonna delete that.

96
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.970
We're just going to run it through away again.

97
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.740
So delete.

98
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.610
Okay,

99
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.530
select source data sheet.

100
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.300
Right The way up to the top and a moderately sure that's gonna work.

101
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300
So I'm just gonna hit play,

102
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.010
but mumble mumble on.

103
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.690
There you go.

104
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.060
No,

105
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.250
that works perfectly.

106
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.620
So that's the beauty of using f a two.

107
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.660
Step through your code.

108
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.670
You can spot where something is going to go wrong.

109
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.800
So our report is coming together.

110
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.290
Next,

111
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.070
we're gonna have a look at what will be on next.

112
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.060
I think we were on I think we're on the ad commentary were on the ad commentary,

113
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.240
which is her colossal piece of code.

114
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.010
Okay,

115
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.910
I'll see you in the next.

116
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.550
Like to where we'll look at tidying that up in streamlining it.

117
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.340
That Okay,

118
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.100
I'll see you there.
