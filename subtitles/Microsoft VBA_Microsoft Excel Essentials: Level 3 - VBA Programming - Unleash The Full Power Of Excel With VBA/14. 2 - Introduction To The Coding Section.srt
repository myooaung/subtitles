1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Okay,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,190
guys,

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm welcome to this section where this section is so important it warrants an introduction

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,740
all of its own.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,790
So this is probably the most important section off the entire course there.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,410
At the moment,

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,500
we've looked at recording macros on We've seen that we can only go so far just by recording

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,330
macros and coding or programming.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,740
Both.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,590
Both words are interchangeable.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,010
Coding or programming is so much more than just recording a macro because there are some

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,670
things that cannot be done by just recording a macro on.

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,830
To do those things you need to learn how to code now,

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,860
just like any other language.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,400
VB,

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,030
a visual basic for applications,

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,750
is also a language.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,390
And like all languages,

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,020
it has words.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,120
Some of those words are reserved and have specific meaning In code on we've already seen

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,940
some of those We've seen the words sub We've seen the the phrase end sub we've seen with an

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,160
end with we've seen range we've seen private on the protected words.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,150
The reserved words always capitalize on are always in blue.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,420
Now a good coding practice which we've already looked at,

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,340
It's always type your code in lower case.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,180
That way,

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,960
when you hit,

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,990
enter or you click off the line.

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,340
Any reserved words will automatically be capitalized on automatically turn blue.

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,280
So if for argument's sake,

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,240
you think you've typed end with correctly,

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,810
but you've typed end W I t T h.

33
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,510
When you click off the with with the T T H will not be capitalized on.

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,580
That's a clear indication that you've made an error.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,810
So always type in lower case until we come to variables.

36
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,290
What will come to that in this section?

37
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,310
So don't worry about it,

38
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,410
but always type in lower case.

39
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,230
And that way,

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,300
anything that's a protected word.

41
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,860
A reserved word will automatically capitalize on turn blue for you Now,

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,200
while we're talking about V.

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,390
B.

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,520
A is the language.

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,250
It also has just like any other language,

46
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,720
a grammatical structure,

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,770
and it has syntax.

48
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,230
Noah's You work through your programming career as you.

49
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,310
As you develop,

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,350
you're gonna learn key phrases on the correct syntax to use now,

51
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,580
rather than learned them through repetition.

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,510
Learn them.

53
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,130
Once,

54
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,900
remarked them well,

55
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,420
that is.

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,380
Add an apostrophe on that green rice in just before the line of code,

57
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,350
and that way you will always know what it does,

58
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,770
and it also makes debugging your code and awful lot simpler.

59
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,500
You are also not only going to develop phrases,

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,360
you're also developed little snippets of code.

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,610
They're going to be completely adaptable for future programming projects.

62
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,460
Just as an example,

63
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,500
I have an emailing routine that I wrote.

64
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,750
I don't even know how many years ago,

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,180
and I never bothered to rewrite it again.

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,400
Every time I have ah program in project that requires e mails to be sent or e mails to be

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,780
read,

68
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,430
I just pull up my email in routine on wrapped the rest of the code around that.

69
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,250
Okay,

70
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,790
now what you're going to develop here in your macro book is going to be your bread and

71
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,260
butter.

72
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,840
So rather than develop a brilliant piece of code with loads of things that you've learned

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,680
as you develop and keep it in a specific workbook two years later,

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,050
you may not remember which workbook that particular piece of code is in.

75
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,940
So always stall these pieces of code in your macro workbook.

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,760
Don't re meant the wheel.

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,190
If you write a piece of code that works,

78
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,570
keep it on always keep it in your macro book.

79
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,870
Then we already saw a little earlier when we were recording a macro that there is a

80
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,390
personal macro workbook.

81
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,880
Now I know a few coders that actually use the personal macro workbook,

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,550
and that's perfectly fine if you're working at home on your computer.

83
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,700
But the thing to remember and the reason I never use one is that the personal macro

84
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,210
workbook is stored locally on your computer.

85
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,320
So if your computer is stolen or your hard drive fails,

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,830
you have lost everything.

87
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,350
So the thing I always do is I keep a macro book,

88
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,790
and this is an Excel file and XLs m file,

89
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,550
just like any other file so I can copy it in my hard drive.

90
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,210
I can copy it to a pen drive.

91
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,080
I can email it to myself if I'm working on a particular contract and I need access to all

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,760
of my code.

93
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,700
So I always keep it on a separate file.

94
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,650
And personally,

95
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,100
I do not use the personal macro workbook.

96
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,630
It's entirely up to you.

97
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,670
You make your decision,

98
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:57,510
but if you do decide to do that and you have thousands of lines of useful code on your hard

99
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,520
drive fails,

100
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,750
your work will be lost entirely.

101
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,520
Your decision.

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,230
Okay,

103
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,380
Now your macro book is going to become your phrasebook your dictionary,

104
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,440
and it will have all the essential pieces of code.

105
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,250
And by the time we finish this section,

106
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,230
we're gonna have more or less everything that you could ever need for any project that

107
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,100
you're ever going to create.

108
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,920
And you are limited only by your imagination.

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,650
If you can describe it,

110
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,610
there is every chance that you can automated with a bit of programming behind it.

111
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,510
Okay,

112
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,000
Without any further delay,

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,740
let's move on to the next lecture.
