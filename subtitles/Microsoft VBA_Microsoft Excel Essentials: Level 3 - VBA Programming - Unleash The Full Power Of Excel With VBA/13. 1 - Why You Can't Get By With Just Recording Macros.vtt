00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
Okay,

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.010
guys,

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.590
we're moving along nicely.

4
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.180
So far,

5
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.860
we've built a couple of Mac Rose.

6
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.240
We have gone through them step by step,

7
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.500
use in the F eight of observing what they do in the worksheet.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.040
We've deleted the redundant code,

9
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.620
the code that didn't do anything on.

10
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.250
We've streamlined the code that's remained.

11
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.530
We've also learned how to use the private statement in front of a subroutine so they can't

12
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.560
be called from the macro window on.

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.900
We've also learned how to call Mac Rose sequentially.

14
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.450
So in execute different modules of code in the order that we want to use them,

15
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.730
they're so far,

16
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.440
so good.

17
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.880
And you may well be thinking,

18
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.440
Wow,

19
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.120
I can get away without learning to do any program in.

20
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.820
All I need to use is the built in translator Golden rial number 12.

21
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.410
Andi,

22
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.720
just record a macro,

23
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.930
and that's gonna give me everything I want.

24
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.640
Well,

25
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480
we're going to record another macro here on.

26
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.100
We're gonna learn exactly why that isn't the case and where you do need to learn how to

27
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.580
program properly.

28
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.310
Okay,

29
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.330
so let's just record a simple macro.

30
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:19.010
Let's imagine than on our totals just here What we want to do is we're gonna record a macro

31
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.010
.

32
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.290
So we're going to select from here to hear on.

33
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130
We're gonna apply a double overline.

34
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.210
So which I think isn't accounting practice if I think back two years ago when I stood

35
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.930
against and see,

36
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.390
So I'm just going to start a macro recording s so I'm gonna hit the little button down here

37
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.390
.

38
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.700
So there you go.

39
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.020
I'm going to call it a double over lane because I can't think of a better name,

40
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.890
but that really does describe what it does.

41
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.260
I'm not assign a keyboard shortcut.

42
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.780
Keep Andi,

43
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.340
I'm gonna hit.

44
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.900
OK,

45
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.590
now I am recording,

46
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.190
So I want to select here through here.

47
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.630
This is what I want to do.

48
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.950
I want to go to Borders.

49
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.240
I want to go to Mawr.

50
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.010
Borders.

51
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.100
I want the double over Lane on.

52
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.330
I wanted at the top,

53
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.100
and I want to click.

54
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.930
OK,

55
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.470
now the mess.

56
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.080
Select a one at the end,

57
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.140
and that does that perfectly.

58
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

59
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.430
Okay,

60
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.330
so I am no gonna hit the stop recording.

61
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.000
Andi,

62
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.060
I am gonna undo what I just did because I did this in excel.

63
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.970
I still have the undue options.

64
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.520
So they go were back to normal.

65
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.120
So Ultimate 11 let's have a look at the code we are now in module three on.

66
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.470
That is the code that we have just recorded.

67
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.950
So let's copy that code.

68
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.580
Let's dump it in.

69
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.570
Module one will put it at the end.

70
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.950
So I'm just gonna go to the bottom.

71
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.830
You can put a top if you want or in between subs wherever you want to put it.

72
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.150
So I'm just going to come down the bottom it control on P and paste it in.

73
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550
So there we go.

74
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.350
We have our double overline sub.

75
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.670
I'm gonna delete the remarks out there and just say add one myself.

76
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:14.970
This adds a double over lying to two towels on a smiley face because I'm feeling

77
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.850
particularly happy.

78
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.760
Okay,

79
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.990
So if we have look what it does,

80
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.870
it says range.

81
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.780
Bm like be 16 to m 16 but you're free.

82
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.760
Flip back also left 11 toggles between the two is from B 16 through em 16.

83
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.750
I think you're right.

84
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.680
Be 16 m 16.

85
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.140
Selection dot borders,

86
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.960
excel,

87
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.640
diagonal,

88
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.010
down line style equals known.

89
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.290
I probably think we don't need that.

90
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.650
So I'm going to rent that out until we contest it.

91
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.500
I am going to remedy Max.

92
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.700
That says that,

93
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.370
um I have a select and I have with selection,

94
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.060
so I can probably streamline.

95
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.780
That occurred a little bit on.

96
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.600
I do have dot borders,

97
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.890
Exel edge top,

98
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.650
which sounds pretty much like it's going to put something in the top edge Excel line,

99
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.380
Excel double.

100
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.620
That certainly sounds true.

101
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.540
I wouldn't We didn't do anything with color,

102
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.600
so I'm gonna leave the color remnant out Tintin shade.

103
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.770
Just like before is zero on.

104
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.990
I'm gonna ram that out on Gothic.

105
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:27.390
Maybe something that I do need S o I can't recall what these things did.

106
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.790
No,

107
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.210
no,

108
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.610
no,

109
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.060
no.

110
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.030
I'm gonna assume they are not needed.

111
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.260
Onda the end there.

112
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.270
I selected arrange a want to e one.

113
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.230
I'm just going to change that one just to see what happens.

114
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.480
Even though submerge sound,

115
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.450
we'll see what happens.

116
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.730
So let us split that so we can see the two windows.

117
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.990
That should be enough,

118
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.690
to be honest with you.

119
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.880
So from here,

120
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.430
we're going to go f eight bump on.

121
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.950
We're going to go two range B m.

122
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.690
Sorry.

123
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.060
Be 16 to M 16.

124
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.630
Select.

125
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.420
Absolutely.

126
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.040
That's good.

127
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.040
Immediately was skipped all of this long.

128
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.640
We've gone from the select with the selection Borders,

129
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.750
Excel top sounding like it's about right line Style equals X l double.

130
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.680
And we can already see that that has come a little deeper.

131
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.270
They're lying.

132
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.900
16 just increased.

133
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.710
Which seems to suggest that excited lines I'm gonna hit f eight again thick end with and go

134
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.390
back to one.

135
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.090
And yet that did absolutely everything that we wanted it today.

136
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:42.030
Now we started with 123456789 10 11 12 13 lines of code on.

137
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:49.780
We managed to weed it down to the 123456 lines of code that we actually wanted.

138
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.150
So what I'm gonna do is delete the stuff we don't want.

139
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.730
Andi.

140
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.350
Okay,

141
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.420
on delete that because we don't want that.

142
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.690
And I'm gonna delete those because I don't think we want those.

143
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.010
Just line those up go clips on that looks nice and pretty.

144
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.090
So they go much shorter code,

145
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.220
which should execute a lot quicker.

146
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:22.200
Now you'll notice because we did this in vb a and not in excel we could hit Undo on Excel

147
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.030
which is just gonna put back what we just did in the V b a window eso head on due on the V

148
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.290
b a window and does what we did in the V b a window.

149
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.990
But if we come to excel,

150
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.880
we do not have an undo function.

151
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:47.780
Now you'll remember from the 15 golden rules of coding number one work on a backup.

152
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.540
There is no undue on.

153
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.290
That is a demonstration of this.

154
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.400
We've just done exactly what we did when we recorded the macro.

155
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.360
But because we were in excel,

156
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.940
we have the on the option.

157
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.870
But now we're not in excel.

158
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.550
We cannot undo.

159
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:11.580
So all I'm gonna have to do here is literally choose that format copy and paste it over to

160
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.850
get back to where we were.

161
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.040
Okay,

162
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.970
so this is our code.

163
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.060
We can happily run it.

164
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.150
I'm just gonna hit play.

165
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:27.150
I've deleted too much and do a few times a go with selection borders,

166
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.460
so it knows what we're doing.

167
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.240
So we are selecting.

168
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.590
We are working with that selection.

169
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.630
We are working with the borders property off selection.

170
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.280
We are working on the Exel edge.

171
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.680
Top on we are with those using the line Stein,

172
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.050
Excel,

173
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.510
Double await,

174
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.090
Excel thick and we're ending the with going back there.

175
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.570
So hopefully that should work.

176
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.500
Boom,

177
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.060
they go.

178
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.290
That works perfectly.

179
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.970
So there's our first bear code.

180
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.050
Works beautifully,

181
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.380
so that's north.

182
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.130
Let's go to South and do exactly the same thing.

183
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.490
They will run out.

184
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.570
Join these together so we can get the highlights.

185
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.700
Working boom.

186
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.190
And there that goes on.

187
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.140
Let's come down to double overline and click that Fantastic.

188
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.570
This is working beautifully,

189
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.460
so we've done north with Down South.

190
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.940
Let's go to East F 11.

191
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.920
Do the formatting thing.

192
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.720
Play fantastic.

193
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.080
Do the double over line play.

194
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.040
No,

195
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.150
that didn't do exactly what we wanted it to do.

196
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.900
Because if we look back at North,

197
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.600
we have a double overline.

198
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.660
If you look at South,

199
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.180
we had a double overline,

200
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.270
but you'll also notice the totals are online.

201
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.490
16 in the northern region,

202
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.810
their online 16 in the southern region.

203
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.680
On in the eastern region.

204
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.590
We have one less shop,

205
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.370
so they are on line 15.

206
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.990
If we look at the code,

207
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.370
it did exactly what we asked it to do.

208
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.840
It selected be 16 to m 16 on,

209
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.450
then performed these functions on that selected range.

210
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.220
Unfortunately,

211
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.500
that selected range is not where the totals live in the eastern region.

212
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.750
So just a complete let's Have a look at West West is also online.

213
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.290
15

214
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.510
So West is not gonna work on the annual sales.

215
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.650
That's totally different.

216
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.540
The annual sales are online.

217
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.180
10

218
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:32.110
So the first few macros who did work beautifully because it used a built in function of

219
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:38.330
finding the formulas that resulted in a number that worked fantastic but the last macro

220
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.450
recorded worked great on North and South.

221
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:47.750
But that was purely coincidental because the totals both happened to live on row 16.

222
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:54.840
So what we need to do now is apply some logic to be able to work out how to find which road

223
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.510
to perform these actions in Now.

224
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.900
So far,

225
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.980
we have recorded a few Macron's on.

226
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.350
We have a few useful phrases,

227
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.190
but we're gonna need a few more before we can start a playing logic on writing code

228
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.790
properly.

229
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.660
So in the next section,

230
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.750
what we're gonna do is we're going to start building a macro workbook.

231
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.230
Now,

232
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.210
I have one that have already completed,

233
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.850
and I'm just gonna add things into this one so you can download it and you'll have them too

234
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:21.850
.

235
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.800
But we'll have a quick whizz through each of the functions.

236
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.390
There are gonna be the basic bread and butter things.

237
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.420
And they were gonna look at playing some logic and looping,

238
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.200
which is when you get into code and properly the thing to be worried about.

239
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.820
We'll go through it,

240
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.740
step by step,

241
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.710
and I guarantee you,

242
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.860
by the end of this course,

243
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.100
you'll be doing this with your eyes closed.

244
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.970
So we'll come back to this project once we have a few more phrases in our phrasebook on.

245
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.370
We will code this properly.

246
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.070
Okay,

247
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.650
I'll see you in the next section.
