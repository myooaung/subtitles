1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,710
guys,

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,870
um,

4
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,920
welcome back.

5
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,450
So let's have a look at this word routine,

6
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,240
and it's very,

7
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,230
very simple.

8
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,330
Maybe gonna butcher this a little later on only slightly after we captured all the data so

9
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,400
we can create our document.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,880
Now,

11
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,520
you'll remember from the Outlook section in the last section that whenever you're calling

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,220
another Microsoft application,

13
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,610
you have to dimension it as a object.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,250
So our first line of code dim word app as object sets up the word application all sets up

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,100
the variable toe hold word as an object.

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,510
Now,

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,250
obviously,

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,840
a document is an object with them word.

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,710
So the next thing we have to do is dimension object,

20
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,300
new dock as objects.

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,940
Obviously these Commie called whatever you want them to bay.

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,410
So our next line of code set word up,

23
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,450
which was declared above equals,

24
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:01,600
create object word dot application on that is going to create a new instance of word for us

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,520
to control.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,250
Now our next thing to do is to create a new document within that word up.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:07,980
I'm here.

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,350
We have set object equals word up,

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,650
which we've declared a puff.

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,810
Don't documents dot ad,

31
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,230
and that gives us our new documents.

32
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,660
Now,

33
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,890
here's where most people make a mistake.

34
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,300
With word you do not make it active as you do with workbooks,

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,750
you make it visible.

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,660
So our next instruction is word app dot visible equals true.

37
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,390
Okay.

38
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,440
And then finally,

39
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,600
almost finally,

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,240
we're gonna add some text.

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,370
No,

42
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,280
we're going to say is world amp dot selection,

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,800
doc type,

44
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,380
text,

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,220
text,

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,830
colon equals.

47
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,420
And then whatever text we want in this simple example,

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,210
it just says hello world.

49
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,190
And you'll remember also from the outlook section that whenever you create object variables

50
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,190
,

51
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,090
it is better to destroy them,

52
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,260
and you must destroy them in the reverse order.

53
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,800
So the very first thing we declared was the word app itself.

54
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,630
So word up is the last thing we destroy.

55
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,020
And the second thing we created was the new dock object.

56
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,380
And that is going to be the 1st 1 we destroyed.

57
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,140
Okay,

58
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,290
I'll see you in the next lecture,

59
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,720
where we're gonna have a look at that code where we gather all the data.

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,190
OK,

61
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,580
I'll see you in the next lecture.
