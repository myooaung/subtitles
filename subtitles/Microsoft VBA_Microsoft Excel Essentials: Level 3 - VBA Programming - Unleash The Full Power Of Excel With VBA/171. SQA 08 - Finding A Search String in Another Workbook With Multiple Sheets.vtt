00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.910
guys.

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.730
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.990
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.580
And this one's from Pascal.

6
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.080
Now,

7
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.320
what Pascal wants is he was the have a workbook like this one,

8
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.120
just here with a button.

9
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.280
And when you hit the button,

10
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.360
a little input box will pop up and the user will type something to search for now when they

11
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.570
hit.

12
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.250
Okay,

13
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.550
What we want to do is go to another sheet that could have multiple tamps.

14
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.950
And here we have butchers,

15
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.770
bakers and candlestick makers.

16
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.770
But you can have as many times as you want on search for the value that the user just

17
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.420
entered.

18
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.490
So let's have a look at the code.

19
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.300
How you do that?

20
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.670
Sorry.

21
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.470
Before I move on,

22
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.750
there are two files to download from this lecture.

23
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.980
Sq a Pascal data set.

24
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.550
And that's this.

25
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.680
Butchers make his candlestick makers file on this one.

26
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.750
The pascal run me from here near find sheet one and also the code in here.

27
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.930
So just paste that into a regular module and you'll be able to see this An operation for

28
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.460
yourself.

29
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.880
Okay,

30
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.370
so it's gonna minimize that and reject these little bits so we can see everything in Here

31
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.790
we go.

32
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.340
Right.

33
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.200
This is the code.

34
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.170
It's called sub.

35
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.130
Find me.

36
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.910
Now.

37
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.320
What I've done is I've set up a couple of variables.

38
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.660
It's up.

39
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.350
My search is just going to hold the value from the uses inputs of the input box.

40
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580
An ex is a simple cancer that we're gonna come to down here.

41
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.000
So let's step through this.

42
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.350
So f eight most search equals input box,

43
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.810
please.

44
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450
And a value be bellow.

45
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.420
So let's pick Terek for tear ary enter.

46
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.350
So no,

47
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.440
we're gonna activate sq a Paschal data set.

48
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.290
That's this file over here.

49
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.850
So f eight that's activated range a one select possibly not necessary.

50
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.140
But I always like to start from NJ one.

51
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.670
Now,

52
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.950
this is where our loop comes in.

53
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.730
What we're gonna do is we're gonna loop from one to the number of sheets in this workbook.

54
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.820
So it doesn't matter if we have 1000 sheets in this workbook.

55
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.050
This will get a rate through them all.

56
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.220
So his are for and here's our next.

57
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.740
No,

58
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.500
because if we can't find a value a match on the first sheet,

59
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.330
we're going together.

60
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110
An era that would cause our cult code to stop.

61
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.580
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna force continuation by saying a nera resume next.

62
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.220
Don't worry.

63
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.650
We have a way to check to see if we found a match a little later on,

64
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.570
so an era resume.

65
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.100
Next.

66
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.700
Select the sheet bites in next number.

67
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.100
So as we rely first passed through this Loop X is one.

68
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.700
So therefore,

69
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.770
on the first situation,

70
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.170
we're looking at the first sheet butchers.

71
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.850
Now this is just copied straight out of a control and f find recorded macro.

72
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.780
The only difference is I've replaced the value that would have been in here with my search

73
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.780
,

74
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.570
which is a string we just captured.

75
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.060
So f eight,

76
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.800
step through and you can see there that we have found Terek on the first sheet.

77
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.670
Now here's that test I was talking about.

78
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.410
What we're gonna do is we're going to use an in string function to see if the value of my

79
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.130
search Tareq Isse found within the active cell values of the in string search for that

80
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.450
value inside of that value.

81
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.550
So it doesn't have to be a complete match.

82
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.660
It just needs to find whatever is in here somewhere in the active cell value.

83
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.390
Phoebe text compare means its case insensitive.

84
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.670
So if I have found a match,

85
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.960
then end F eight and and we're done.

86
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.710
Okay,

87
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.700
so that's how it works.

88
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.760
If it finds a match on the first sheet,

89
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.130
I actually know that things from the other sheep.

90
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.820
So let's step through that on.

91
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.760
Let's say covenant and trust me,

92
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.940
this is going to work,

93
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.810
So I'm just going to step through now.

94
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.900
We're on sheet one.

95
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.910
Are we going to find it here?

96
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.210
We're not going to find it.

97
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.430
So we're going to move down to our next X loop through,

98
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.020
and then we're going to go to our next iteration,

99
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.190
which is number two bakers.

100
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.020
Can we find in Baker's?

101
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.270
No,

102
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.610
we can't loop through Make sex Candlestick makers.

103
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.080
And from there we confined Covent Garden Candle Company.

104
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.660
I have found a match,

105
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.330
therefore end now that works perfectly as long as the matches found somewhere in there.

106
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.100
But what we need to do is do something.

107
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.250
If it gets past this point and it hasn't found a match,

108
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.900
and that's going to be straightforward.

109
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.180
It's just a message box.

110
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.710
Sorry,

111
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.490
my search.

112
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.330
That's the value of my search was not found in any shape.

113
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.700
Phoebe.

114
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.030
Okay,

115
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.360
only no match.

116
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.580
So let's just run that.

117
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.150
The search for something that's not in there.

118
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.990
Let's search for Jarvis.

119
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.090
On they go.

120
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.480
It went through butchers,

121
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.900
bakers,

122
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.070
candlestick makers.

123
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.450
And it could not find a Mac,

124
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.480
so no match.

125
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.920
Sorry.

126
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.400
Jarvis was not found in any sheet.

127
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.480
Okay?

128
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.920
And then the code finishes.

129
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.580
Okay.

130
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.590
I hope that helps,

131
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.370
as always,

132
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.480
if you have any questions.

133
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.750
Just dropped me a note and they'll be happy to help.

134
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.600
Have a great day.

135
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.650
Thanks very much.
