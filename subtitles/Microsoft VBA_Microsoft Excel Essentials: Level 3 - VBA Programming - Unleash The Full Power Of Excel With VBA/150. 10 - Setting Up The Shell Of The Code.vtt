00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Okay,

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:02.660
guys,

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome back.

4
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.580
Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the base code,

5
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.130
put it into another module so we can just keep stealing from it.

6
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.240
So woman do is come up to where I'm coming up to view two projects.

7
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.990
Explorer,

8
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.110
I'm going to go to insert insert new module.

9
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.710
I'm going to go to view on properties window.

10
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.000
Track that thin little bit.

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.490
Eso Margit one.

12
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm gonna call this Mod PP.

13
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.560
Presentation one,

14
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.180
they go.

15
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.490
So here's our base coat.

16
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.080
Copy all of that.

17
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.920
Copy on paste it into here.

18
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.500
Now,

19
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.240
what we're gonna do is move that down a little bit on.

20
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.210
We're gonna steal the code from Mayor on,

21
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.830
be able to use it in actual code.

22
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.100
So the first thing that we want to do now we've we've copied all the code over.

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.880
Just closed the say conceit a little better.

24
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.420
Okay,

25
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.610
the first thing we're gonna do is ram out these particular lines of code.

26
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.180
So I'm reminiscent beginning bit on.

27
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.460
I am running out the end part as we're going to create this in separate subroutines.

28
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.470
Woman do is declare all three of these right at the top.

29
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.120
So they're going to be module level valuables.

30
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.310
So here to say,

31
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.850
declare module level variables.

32
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.950
So that way we'll be able to use these modules in all of our difference of routines.

33
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.270
And then the first thing I want to do is create a subroutine that creates the new Power

34
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.410
Point presentation.

35
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.010
So I'm just going to take that code and I would create a new private surveillance call.

36
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.930
It groups privates can't type private sub on What should we call it?

37
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.720
Let's call it create PP presentation,

38
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.170
great PP president create PP press held it and I'm just gonna paste that code in there.

39
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.510
So this particular with the code is going to create the instance of pale points that the

40
00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.010
next thing I want to do is destroy the variables that will be the end of the coast.

41
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.890
I'm gonna have another private sub private sub destroy very ah,

42
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.460
balls on what I need to do for that one has come down to the bottom and steal this code.

43
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.040
So copy backups it up to here on drips paste that in.

44
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.350
So there we go and I can unring that.

45
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.350
So then we have two bits of code the one that creates the instance of power point on the

46
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.390
one that destroys the valuables in reverse order at the end.

47
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.440
So the next thing we need to do is add a run older.

48
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.950
So what we can say is private sub.

49
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.100
So the wrong border seeking Call this whenever you want.

50
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.820
And in here,

51
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.350
the first thing we're gonna do is create the people the create the Power Point presentation

52
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.350
.

53
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.590
That's gonna be the first thing we call.

54
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.960
And the last thing we're going to call is the bit where we destroy the variables case.

55
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.750
And then we have create the Power point presentation on Destroy the variables.

56
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.240
Okay,

57
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.740
so far,

58
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.310
so good.

59
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.760
Now,

60
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.660
in the next lecture,

61
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.990
we're gonna have a look at one more thing that we're going to need to do before we add our

62
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.770
first slide.

63
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.650
So I'll see you in the next lecture
