00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Okay,

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.720
guys.

3
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.420
And welcome to this section.

4
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.670
Now,

5
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.380
technically,

6
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.630
this is a student.

7
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.120
Questions answered.

8
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.370
John has a particular issue that he needs to solve.

9
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.450
What he has is literally dozens and dozens and dozens of computer generated files,

10
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.540
all Excel files and in particular folder on.

11
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.680
What he needs to do is he wants to build a master data set.

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.220
And obviously,

13
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.580
each week or each month,

14
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.500
new files are added to this particular folder and he just wants toe add them all to the

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.900
bottom of his existing data set.

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.490
Now,

17
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.020
to be honest,

18
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.010
if you have one or two files with one or two tabs,

19
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.760
you could probably do this manually in a couple of minutes.

20
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.890
But if you literally have no say five or six files,

21
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.430
but they have 50 or 60 tubs or maybe you have 100 files on the each have 50 tabs.

22
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.940
This could take you weeks,

23
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.650
and that's exactly what this particular piece of code does.

24
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.880
So what we're gonna do is this is basically the file.

25
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.340
You can download a zoo,

26
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.520
always get your code.

27
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.480
Here is the code that we go through a particularly slow computer today.

28
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.370
This is the code that we go through in this particular section on this is the file.

29
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.950
The mass data get Iraq.

30
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.410
What we can do is hit the get data before I actually click,

31
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.420
get data and cancel that for a second.

32
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.250
Cancel.

33
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.540
Okay,

34
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.440
there the header traps.

35
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.910
They work.

36
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.360
Anyway,

37
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.850
you can also download all of these files.

38
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.090
No,

39
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.540
basically,

40
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.660
it's just made up data.

41
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.640
We've got eight files,

42
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.890
2016 11 Eastern northern,

43
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.970
sudden in Western on the same for 2012.

44
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.370
And each of these files has a specific data set in there.

45
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.950
So it may have just shop one it may have shop to on three.

46
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
Or it may have shot 12 and three or any variation.

47
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.230
That's just completely random data.

48
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.280
And this is the data that we want to pull.

49
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
Now,

50
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.330
what we could do is loop through every single file in this folder and extract all the data

51
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.180
named in the tubs that we specify in which sheets.

52
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.560
So it could be the judge.

53
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.640
You actually just want to grab all the data for shop to,

54
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.150
in which case you would just center shop to in here and it will ignore all the others.

55
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
Or it could be that you just want to say I just want to pull all the files that have the

56
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.860
word west or Western in there,

57
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.250
or Southern or 2016 11 whatever it is.

58
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.700
So let's just run the code and you can see what it does.

59
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.190
So you will get this customized folder pick as saying,

60
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.820
Please select the folder containing the files you want to import and then we're going to

61
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.470
click Demo,

62
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.720
which is where those files live.

63
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.960
Hit.

64
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.750
Select folder.

65
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.310
Please enter the unique string of the fouls you want to open.

66
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.970
So open files containing the word on.

67
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.050
What do we want to say?

68
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.980
We want to say,

69
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.920
Let's have a look at a seven Look at 2016.

70
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.810
12 we hit Okay,

71
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.200
but number,

72
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.750
number dump and they go.

73
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.960
It's just opened every file that said 2016 12 in its title and has extracted all the data

74
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.650
for any sheet named Shop one Shop two or Shop three and just dropped them all in here.

75
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.660
So obviously,

76
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.250
when we get 2017 January or we need to do is hit the button again on then tie 2017.

77
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.210
01 And all of that data will be pasted underneath.

78
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.750
And that's what we're gonna have a look at in this little section here.

79
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.320
OK,

80
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.340
so enjoy.

81
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.900
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
