1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
Okay,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:02,720
guys.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,700
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:03,990
Now,

5
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,700
there is a slight modification to the recorded macro here because what we want to do is get

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,220
the highest value to appear at the top.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,600
So what I'm gonna do is stop the code.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,350
I'm gonna come over to here.

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm gonna say bombing going on record a macro.

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,820
It's okay.

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm gonna hit J one hit control in a to select everything.

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,450
I'm gonna come to filter and sort and say sort largest to smallest on.

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,900
That is why we put the value in front of the name just so we can use a very simple filter.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,550
So here,

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,730
I'm going to stop the macro record and flip back to the visual Basic editor hit control and

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,020
are to bring up the projects,

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,490
Flora.

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,750
And now Meghan steal that code.

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,200
So that's the code that we just generated back to here.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,430
I can close that now.

21
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,890
Andi.

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,150
Yeah.

23
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,200
Let's pace underneath.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,690
Okay,

25
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,380
so here is the recorded macro code.

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,950
Now,

27
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,390
we don't need to say range.

28
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,350
J T j want k one dot select because it is already mentioned down here.

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,710
We are going to stick with J one.

30
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,190
However,

31
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,950
so I'm just gonna delete that code.

32
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,780
So now that's brought it down by one line.

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,450
Now what?

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,120
We also don't need to say,

35
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,930
because we literally just built this and we know we have no filters.

36
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,420
Applied is weaken.

37
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,550
Just clear the first line of code.

38
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,160
Okay,

39
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,120
so it's coming down now.

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,040
We can safely delete the Excel header because we're going to deal with this sales personal

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,650
it later,

42
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,840
so that can come out.

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,630
We don't care about match case because we're actually sorting by a number.

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,380
So we don't need match case.

45
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,760
We do need orientation.

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,160
We're not dealing in opinion.

47
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,650
This is just a salt method.

48
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,620
Eso Essentially these are the three lines of code that we need in our with end with the set

49
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,800
range orientation on the apply.

50
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,710
Everything else is the same.

51
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,040
Now here we have set range range J want to K seven on.

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,120
I have replaced that with range J one dot current region notice.

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,380
There is nothing after the current region.

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,050
It just simply say's range j one duck current region.

55
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,250
And that is going to be enough to make that code work.

56
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,210
So let's hit Delete on.

57
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,180
Let's have a look remember,

58
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,430
this has to be empty when the code runs.

59
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,710
So let's just run straight up to that point and I'm gonna come right the way down to here.

60
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,750
So I'm gonna hit debug,

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,580
Say,

62
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,470
run to cursor.

63
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,370
I am in this line,

64
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,470
so we're gonna get all the way through on.

65
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,980
There you go.

66
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,340
There's our unique list.

67
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,210
There are formulas written correctly on we now have Sarah Bond way at the top with

68
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,760
£1613.58 p.

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,570
Okay.

70
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,730
I'll see you in the next lecture.

71
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,320
Will finish this off by having a look at building the body text on.

72
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,140
Then we're done.

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,690
Okay.

74
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,380
I'll see you in the next lecture.
