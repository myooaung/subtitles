1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Okay,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,570
guys.

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,480
And welcome back.

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,810
Now,

5
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,170
I strongly recommend whenever you're doing any recording or any code in that involves pivot

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,180
charts or pivot tables that you just did the basic outline first in one recorded macro

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,150
because they can generate enormous amounts of code.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,760
Which is why we're doing this.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,670
Changing the title in here as a separate recorded macro,

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,040
because essentially or we're gonna be looking for is one or two lines of code.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,500
But if you do everything you do that the chart exactly as you want it in one recorded macro

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,500
,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,950
you will be generating pages and pages of pages of code on That makes it a little more

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,000
tricky to decipher.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,390
So do the outline.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,330
First we said exactly what we've done and then just do your little modifications.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,770
A separate recorded macros.

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,380
It will be easy to pick out the bits to code that you want and then just drop him into your

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,970
macro.

20
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,540
Okay,

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,660
so let's have a look at this.

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,310
What we're gonna do,

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,750
you gonna start recording Macro,

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,060
macro on.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,110
Don't care what's called.

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,700
I'm just going to steal the code from it.

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm gonna right click on the chart and hit edit text.

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,190
So I'm just going to call this profit by day.

29
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,360
And I'm just going to click off anywhere in Excel.

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,640
And that set that title where it stop recording alternate 11 Because I've saved and closed

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:18,830
this.

32
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,730
I'm now on a different module and you can see for just changing the title.

33
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,660
This is the amount of code that's been generated s so we can see we have inactivate.

34
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,660
We have a select That is the thing that we are looking for.

35
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,250
So I'm just going to copy that.

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,090
Come to our module one.

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,390
I'm gonna come to our profit by day underneath here after we've sized it,

38
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,000
and I'm just gonna pace that code in there on We know that it's the active sharp because

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,390
profit by day is where we add the charts.

40
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,100
So its active all the way through this on that is the only line of code that we need.

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,510
So changes the title,

42
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,120
so I'm just gonna come up to enclose that now I'm just gonna come up to our run order off

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,510
here.

44
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,020
Here we go.

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,770
So I'm just gonna drag out across Britain,

46
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,990
will test that out.

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,910
So she 15 I'm gonna delete.

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,720
I know.

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,970
Olsen F 11 back to our code.

50
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,190
Hit the data capture.

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,370
Make sure we're on the right.

52
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,180
Cheat on hit that on hit play.

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,720
And they go There's our brand new sheet unsheathed for with profit by day in it.

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Okay,

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,280
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're going to get down to looking at the profit by

56
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,040
sales body,

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,610
which is a pivot table rather than perfect chart.

58
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,050
Okay,

59
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,450
I'll see you in the next lecture.
