00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
Okay,

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.150
guys are welcome back.

3
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.620
And now for a finishing touch,

4
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.750
we're gonna add a beautiful pie chart.

5
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.250
Just about here.

6
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.770
Now,

7
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.970
what we're gonna do The reason we didn't recall this in the first place is because we

8
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.340
actually want to create the pie chart off of one of the pivot tables here.

9
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.090
And that's this one just here.

10
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.080
So woman do its record.

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.010
New macro doesn't my white skin because women bush you in a minute.

12
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.480
Anyway,

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.670
select all of that data to come up to insert just like we did before.

14
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.490
Recommended charts on I'm gonna choose pie.

15
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.980
Andi,

16
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.560
this one on the hit,

17
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.250
okay,

18
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.950
And that's gonna pace that somewhere where we don't want it.

19
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.130
Now,

20
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.060
the easiest way to position these things is to hit,

21
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.150
cut and then paste the way you want them to go.

22
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.050
So actually wanted to be here,

23
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.250
so it's in line with these pivot tables.

24
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.910
It's gonna be too large.

25
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.070
We know that's going to go over the borders,

26
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.730
but we can sort that out without clever little columns with thing on Rose height thing.

27
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.280
Okay,

28
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.620
for now,

29
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.070
what I'm gonna do is just stop recording and then we'll go and have a look at the code that

30
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.200
we've just generated.

31
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.990
So nice and simple.

32
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.790
This is a range D 23 to e 27 dot select.

33
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.410
Now we know that we don't need that part because it specified here.

34
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.920
But what we do need to do is do a current region and select the data that way.

35
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.940
So for now,

36
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.620
what I'm doing,

37
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.650
just call this pie chart and I'm gonna copy all of that code.

38
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.390
Copy.

39
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.510
I'm gonna come back.

40
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.880
Teoh,

41
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.240
He have you Project Explorer module one on Pace it under here.

42
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.360
So I'm also gonna add pie chart toe run order so I don't forget it.

43
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.730
So way off the top at commentary pie charts,

44
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.280
they go.

45
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.120
So there,

46
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.340
that's going to run as the last thing that we do.

47
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.610
So back down into this code,

48
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.590
what we have is range D 23 to e 27 dot select.

49
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.820
We do not need that.

50
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.450
I want to delete the comments as well.

51
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.010
Let me just bring that up a little bit s So what we do have is add the new pie chart.

52
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.370
We definitely want to be doing that.

53
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:11.540
So that adds chart What we need to do is specify this data range now because we're actually

54
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.310
in the sheet.

55
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.440
We don't have to say she 20 to weaken.

56
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.790
Just simply say,

57
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.450
here,

58
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.440
range open brackets.

59
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.680
What this starts of our range is gonna be.

60
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:33.200
So it's going to be D 23 in this particular instance dot current region current region dot

61
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.910
uh,

62
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.840
dress on.

63
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.390
That should give us the data range that we're looking for.

64
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.020
That's where I scrolled.

65
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.020
We most definitely don't need that part.

66
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.620
Here's where we could on we pasted a g 23.

67
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.840
No,

68
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.090
we definitely still want to do that because it is by far the easiest way to position it.

69
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.710
And here we have active window scroll down,

70
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.410
and that's where I was scrolling around.

71
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.050
We certainly don't want that in that.

72
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.060
But what we do want is that neat trick that we use a little earlier on this table to be

73
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.570
able to size it precisely.

74
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.690
So let's just scroll up a bit.

75
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.020
So we find that really clever,

76
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.680
better code.

77
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.910
Where was it?

78
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.020
It was in not profit by day.

79
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.510
It wasn't profit by day,

80
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.750
and here it is a problem I can change the comment on that as well.

81
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.610
So it's convinced the button on,

82
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.780
Well,

83
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.770
pace that underneath just here.

84
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.870
So there we go.

85
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.950
So we will call this sizing,

86
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.910
sizing the charge and delete the rest of it.

87
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.350
OK,

88
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.600
now the other thing we need to do is rename its immediately after we've created X Wouldn't

89
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.200
see here.

90
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.290
This is calling for the charts called Profit by Day chart.

91
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.780
And that is not what we want we actually wants is the name of this charts,

92
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.710
and you'll remember it has a weird naming convention is active child apparent dot name.

93
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.940
So I'm gonna copy that bit of code,

94
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.050
come down to the bottom here,

95
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.250
sort of mean about reusing your code.

96
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.560
So in between here,

97
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.210
we can add ever every name bit eso the newly created child,

98
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.060
which is gonna be this one.

99
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.750
We're going to call it.

100
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.790
We'll just call it by charge because that's nice and easy play charts.

101
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.940
And then we'll change the references of here two pie charts and here two pie charts Bubble

102
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.050
bubble on.

103
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:27.100
Let's have a look at the range We actually wanted to go from a column g two column L So

104
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.430
here.

105
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.950
We're going to say t to help,

106
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.520
and that is going to cover A with On a range is going to be from Where is it?

107
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.650
It's going to be from Road 23 to row 33.

108
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.020
23 to 33 23 2 33 Now,

109
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.670
it doesn't matter that we we have specified a here instead of G because the column height

110
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.840
at a is exactly same as the column height at G.

111
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.950
So what I'm gonna do is just delete now.

112
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.110
Yes,

113
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.770
I know I'm gonna select the source states sheet,

114
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.300
but then I'm gonna come right up to our running order and I am gonna run all way through to

115
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.950
pay chart,

116
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.540
debug,

117
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.970
run to cursor that there's our data so far.

118
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.410
Just gonna move that out the way so we can see what's going on back here.

119
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.540
It's a great there's our chart.

120
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.480
There it is.

121
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.150
Could paste it.

122
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.380
RG three resize on resize on.

123
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.430
Let's have a look at that.

124
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.270
They go that fits perfectly within our boundaries.

125
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.610
I never did change the size of this one,

126
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.970
did I?

127
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.750
So let's just go and do that now.

128
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.630
That was on profit by day and wasn't it?

129
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.980
So profit by and a profit by day on,

130
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.880
we don't want to go to.

131
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.850
And we wanted to go over to help.

132
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.750
Okay,

133
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.140
so in the next lecture,

134
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.430
what we're gonna do is pretty this up a little bit.

135
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.360
We're gonna record three individual macros extract the better code we want and tag it onto

136
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.270
what we've just done.

137
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.820
OK,

138
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
