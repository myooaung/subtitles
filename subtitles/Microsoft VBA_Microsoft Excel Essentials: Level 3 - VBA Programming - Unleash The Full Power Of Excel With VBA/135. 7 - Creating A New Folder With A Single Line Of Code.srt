1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,390
Okay,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:02,800
guys.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,880
And welcome back,

4
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,500
right?

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,450
The core piece of code to add a new folder.

6
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:16,250
Toe windows is just one single line of code on that is this line of cold code here It's M k

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,730
d I R make directory.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,850
Then we have a space,

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,400
then enclosed in quotes at the beginning.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,110
At the end,

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,800
we have the path to the folder,

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,740
which is this first part just hear a backslash and then the name of the folder that we want

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,400
to create It is simple as that.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,640
So here is the folder my folders on my desktop.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,250
And if I just run this code by hitting play,

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,740
you'll notice that I know get a folder called my new folder in that very path.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,110
OK,

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,580
we're gonna take that single line of code and we're going to turn into something more

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,120
useful.

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,780
Okay,

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,350
I'll see you in the next lecture.
