00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
OK,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.790
guys,

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.090
Now we're gonna have look at another property and that is the end property.

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.470
Now,

5
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.780
this is gonna prove really useful to you as you develop your programming skills because

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.080
your data sets convey vary.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.050
So it could be that your data set of the moment goes from a five to see 10.

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.370
But what happens if it expands?

9
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.760
Well,

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.980
you don't have to keep going into your code and modifying the range a fire to see 10.

11
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.680
What you want to be able to do is capture it dynamically.

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.170
So,

13
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.640
Master,

14
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.610
in the end,

15
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.640
property is the first step to that.

16
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.030
Now the end property effectively does.

17
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.950
If I select in a five and hit control on my right arrow,

18
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.150
we would flip straight over to the end there.

19
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.190
I don't know if I hit control and down Arrow,

20
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.900
I will go to the bottom of the range Control and left Arrow is going to take me up and

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.850
control an up arrow is going to take me back to here now.

22
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.610
I'm not gonna go through all of these cuts.

23
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.190
Essentially,

24
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.840
we have moving,

25
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.780
writes moving left,

26
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.050
moving up and moving down so you can play with them all to your heart's content.

27
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.910
But here's the thing.

28
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.750
If you recorded a macro what you would actually get from that first action where I selected

29
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.990
range A five,

30
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.470
it would select range a 51 line of code.

31
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.680
And with that selection it would go to the property end,

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.870
excel to right,

33
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.550
which is this part here,

34
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.290
and then apply the select method,

35
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.320
which basically means he would move from here to here.

36
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.910
Now that is the recorded macro version.

37
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.040
Now we already know because of what we looked at in the last section that we confer the

38
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.350
streamline this rather than specifying a selection and then acting on that selection weaken

39
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.350
,

40
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.550
Just replace the words selection with the object itself.

41
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.890
So run same range a five select selection dot end.

42
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.940
We can just say range a five dot end excel to write dot Select on.

43
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.460
That is gonna wish you're away over there to the right.

44
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.040
Okay,

45
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.550
Now,

46
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.040
also,

47
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.570
we don't necessarily need to state categorically that we're going to start on a five if we

48
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.340
view some of the code to get to the cell that we actually want or if we want to let the

49
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.140
user select which sell to begin from.

50
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.650
We can use the active cell and use the Excel end to right.

51
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.760
So for now,

52
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.860
I'm just going to hit their fate.

53
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.800
And I'm just concept through this that's taken served to their click back here.

54
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.320
Also never.

55
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.870
11

56
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.790
Press F eight on.

57
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.360
We can just go through all of these and you'll find that these worked perfectly well.

58
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.430
So d five,

59
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.630
we're moving to the left and they go,

60
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.730
we move over to the left and on and on and on.

61
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.850
I'm not going to get through them all.

62
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.240
You can have a play with them to your heart's content.

63
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.950
Okay,

64
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.570
I'll see you in the next like
