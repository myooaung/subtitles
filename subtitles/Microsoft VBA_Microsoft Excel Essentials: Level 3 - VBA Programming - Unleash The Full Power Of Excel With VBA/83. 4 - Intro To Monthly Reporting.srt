1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Okay,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,600
guys.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,100
And welcome to this section.

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,430
And now in this section,

5
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,600
what we're going to look at is automating all of your monthly reporting or weekly reporting

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,600
.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,490
Whatever reporting it is that you need to do now,

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,660
mostly computer generated reports very,

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,850
very rarely change.

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,850
So therefore,

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,850
if you write a piece of code providing that you code dynamically,

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,440
you can write the code ones and you can automate your reporting forever.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,840
Now there are five downloadable files.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,740
Faith Downloadable Resource is from this particular lecture.

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,250
They are called 2016 01 north,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,290
south,

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,010
east and West.

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,400
And these are the four data sets that we're going to be working on.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,470
You will also find a file called month reporting dot XLs x on.

20
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,730
That's the sheet that we're looking at just here.

21
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,590
So when you download the sheet,

22
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,390
if you want to get to the finish code,

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,500
just select sheet one hit control and A and control and see to copy its alternate 11 come

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,590
to insert him on John and paste the code in there.

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,260
On there,

26
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,780
you'll find all of the code that we're going to go through in this section,

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,910
completely rammed and completely dynamic.

28
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,220
Now,

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,330
just to give you quick demo what this is going to do?

30
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,430
What I'm gonna do is just move this out of the way.

31
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,300
Temporarily.

32
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm gonna open up one of the files East.

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,590
Ondo,

34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,970
let me just right there into shot.

35
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,930
Here is a monthly report data,

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,050
and I am just going to play the macro on create the report.

37
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,260
So there,

38
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,950
when I close that you'll see Let me just assume it's a little bit on the front data set

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,070
completely dynamically.

40
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:46,390
We have created this month report that scale perfectly in a landscape orientation.

41
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,440
It captures the eastern region name dynamically at runtime.

42
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,010
It adds the commentary,

43
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,480
including all the specific areas,

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,610
like which monthly?

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,420
In which year,

46
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,910
which region we're looking at.

47
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,800
The total profit who the top salesperson was,

48
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,780
creates although charts and lays it all out perfectly for every one of the files.

49
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,240
Now,

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,430
I know that your data may be slightly different,

51
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,550
but we cover absolutely everything you're gonna need for month reporting automation in this

52
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,170
section.

53
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,170
So do this section and then adapt it to your own data sets and you'll be good to go.

54
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,940
Okay,

55
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,190
let's crack on and learn how we do this.

56
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,650
I'll see you in the next lecture
