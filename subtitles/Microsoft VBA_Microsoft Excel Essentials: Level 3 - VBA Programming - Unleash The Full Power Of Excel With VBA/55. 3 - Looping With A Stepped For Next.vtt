00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Okay,

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.850
guys.

3
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.130
And welcome back there.

4
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.280
The next thing we're gonna have look at is a four next loop with a step.

5
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.410
Now,

6
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.310
we could just modify that code copy,

7
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.010
but I'm just gonna come down here,

8
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.700
enter a few times and pace it underneath.

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.870
But this time I'm going to call it loop for next.

10
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.720
Stepped just so you can see the difference when you when you download the file.

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.150
Okay,

12
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.950
The code is almost exactly the same.

13
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.940
But what we're going to do instead of movement through one through 10 you'll remember.

14
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.520
Here it went.

15
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.250
123456789 10.

16
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.370
We may want it to go up in steps off to so all we do after the 1 to 1 ever argument.

17
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.580
Is that the word step and then tell us how many steps to move my.

18
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.430
So now we're going to step through this and notice my counter currently is zero.

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.540
Because we have another the value to it.

20
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.060
And when I hit,

21
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.080
enter one.

22
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.220
This is our first it oration.

23
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.320
But notice what happens on the nest.

24
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.720
Next passed through.

25
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.350
We moved down a cell.

26
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.340
We come up to here and it's now worth three because we are moving up in steps off,

27
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.830
too.

28
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.430
So I'm just going to step through.

29
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.090
Now.

30
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.170
It's worth five.

31
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.730
No,

32
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.710
it's worth seven.

33
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.380
Now it's worth nine.

34
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.700
Andi End.

35
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.890
So if you ever need to step through in increments,

36
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.870
add step after your range argument there.

37
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.140
So for Mike enter,

38
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.650
he calls 1 to 10 in step to.

39
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.950
And that could be 345 27 418 or whatever number you need it to pay.

40
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.790
Okay,

41
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.470
so that's how you use a stepped for next loop on the next one we're gonna have a look at

42
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.540
and probably the last one will ever need is going to be the while Wend loop.

43
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.510
And as long as you have these three or four in your toolbox,

44
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.850
you'll be able to do anything that ever comes up in your programming career.

45
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.680
Okay,

46
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.750
I'll see you in the 2nd 1 will go through the wild wend loop
