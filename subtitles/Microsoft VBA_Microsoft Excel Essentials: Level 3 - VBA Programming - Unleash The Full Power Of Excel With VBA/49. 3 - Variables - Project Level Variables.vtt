00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Okay,

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.970
guys.

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.720
And welcome back to the last lecture.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.580
Except for the summary in the variable section.

5
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.340
Now we've looked at locally declared variables.

6
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.510
We've looked at module level variables and the final one is the project level variable on

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.810
the project level variable is available to all the projects that you can see in here the V

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.150
b A project window.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.170
So you'll recall from here when we called from into sub three,

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.920
which lived in a different module,

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.680
variable value wasn't passed.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.570
Now here I've changed these to A B and C We're gonna call subsea,

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.090
which lives in a different module.

14
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.550
Okay,

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.380
so let's step through this code and have a look at what it does.

16
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.770
Firstly,

17
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.260
I'm just going to delete that watch because we're no interested in that anymore.

18
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.000
Andi,

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910
I am going to you add.

20
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.350
I watch to that.

21
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.010
I haven't had enough coffee this morning,

22
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.480
I guess.

23
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.750
And then we had to have a watch.

24
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.350
So let's step through this code.

25
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.220
Call the correct sheet name.

26
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.500
You can see it's been selectively arrange a one or you selected clear the contents from CC

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.500
.

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.190
Load the value from a one into this here on you can notice what happens down here.

29
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.150
I think this is my data.

30
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.000
Fantastic.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.610
Right it to see you want that worked beautifully.

32
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.180
So be in the same module hovering over.

33
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.130
You can see the values being returned.

34
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.960
We're going to write that to see three.

35
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.100
Fantastic that works well.

36
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.770
And now notice what happens when a cool sub sea which lives in a different module.

37
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.900
You can see that that's being selected but hovering over.

38
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.290
You can see that this is my data.

39
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.610
It has retained its value.

40
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.490
So now when they attempt to write to C five,

41
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.180
it's perfectly happy on notice what happens down here when he attends and sub out of

42
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.000
context.

43
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.440
So just looking at the comments off here,

44
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.750
project level variables are declared in the general declarations area above.

45
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.590
The first sub can be used by all the subs alive Subs in the current projects.

46
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.040
Actually,

47
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.270
this eso project,

48
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.850
that's what you get for copy and pasting it is declared using the public statement.

49
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.670
Now we've used them up to know.

50
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.090
But using public str monitoring three as string means that it is now publicly available to

51
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.200
all the modules within the project available to all subs in the project.

52
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.950
Absolutely so on it is destroyed n sub in the and I need to type telling us up on it is

53
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:49.580
destroyed at an insult in the module in which it was declared or capitalized.

54
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.820
That so when you download it,

55
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.980
it would be nice in uniforms.

56
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.850
OK,

57
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.560
in the next six,

58
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.580
we're just gonna have a quick summary of the characteristics of variables and then we'll

59
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.100
move on.

60
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.680
I'll see you in the next lecture.
