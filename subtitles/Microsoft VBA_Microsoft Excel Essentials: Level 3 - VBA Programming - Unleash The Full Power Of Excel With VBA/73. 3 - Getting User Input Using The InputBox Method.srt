1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Okay,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,350
guys.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,360
And welcome back.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,770
Now,

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,570
in this lecture,

6
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,710
we're gonna have a look at using the input box method which differ slightly from the input

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,670
box function,

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,000
which is what we've just looked at now.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,450
One particularly use for this is to allow the user to click on a cell in Excel.

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,350
And so you can read that cell address.

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,060
So you may want to mask the user in which road your titles like and have them click it and

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,930
then you'll be able to use that in your code further on.

13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,130
Or you could say,

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,080
Where does your data range begin?

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,690
Have them click that cell and then you would know the beginning cell address for your data

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,850
range manipulation.

17
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,970
But to do it,

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,720
we need to use an input box method,

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,160
which is slightly different.

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,350
So we're still gonna use valuable response one.

21
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,220
But rather than Dimmitt as a string,

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,140
we gonna dimension it as an object.

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,440
And that object is range.

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't worry too much about the technicalities of this,

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,880
but we're going to say response one is going to hold a range object.

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,810
So we have dimension response one as range because this is an object Arrange.

27
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,110
What we have to do is set Use the word set before the response one equals input box.

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,340
So we will say set response one equals.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,280
So this part of it's the same response one equals,

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,180
But we've used the word set up front and there because we're using the input box method.

31
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:39,090
What we have to say his application dot input box and it should start to auto complete.

32
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,010
Just double click there.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,670
So I know I've spelt it correctly.

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,270
So application does input box This parts the same prompt to string.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,580
So click a cell chips sound that I can't talk Click,

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,330
click a sound Close quotes Comma title is the same.

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,680
So select cell,

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,730
right?

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,740
Whatever you want in here.

40
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,250
Obviously,

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,650
Andi,

42
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,010
just so we can read this,

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,600
Okay,

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,230
I'm just gonna hit space.

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,600
Underscore and enter.

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,390
So now hopefully will be out.

47
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,610
See,

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,570
all in one line.

49
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,950
I'm gonna need to tidy that up.

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,020
And here is the final bit.

51
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,260
This is where the magic happens when you use an input box method.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:31,310
There are different types which we access by typing type colon equals and to get a cell

53
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,260
address into that range response one as range.

54
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,240
We need to use a type eight close brackets on end the lips of miss something there.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,160
Obviously at the Kama.

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,400
In fact,

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,550
let me just delete that.

58
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,970
Bring it all opponents of one line on make it so we can proceed along one line.

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,660
So I'm just gonna hit an underscore and bom bom Lego.

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,420
Now we can see all of online so we have dimension response wonders arrange,

61
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,580
which means we have to use the set command.

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,720
Then we have response one equals application input box clicker cell.

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,000
That's going to be the prompt Select cell is gonna be the title and this is type eight.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Okay,

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,810
so it's just step through that.

66
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,720
Let's see what happened.

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,570
Sweeps.

68
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:16,930
Well,

69
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,190
we input,

70
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,260
but I think this is a escape.

71
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,450
I think this is number three.

72
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:21,650
Now.

73
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,240
I've already got number two above eso 123 Here we go.

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,330
Response A And there we get this select cell clicker cell.

75
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,320
I'm gonna click over here and you can see I've clicked Selby four.

76
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,240
And now I'm pointing at the screen again.

77
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,960
On now.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,740
In the input box,

79
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,450
you can see we have absolute B absolute for Okay,

80
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:49,530
but if I hover over this response one you can't actually see that it says be for in there.

81
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,010
So what I'm gonna do is at a watch,

82
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,850
and we're gonna have a look at what that's actually captured down here in the watches

83
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,480
window on prepare to be staggered.

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,900
It has captured absolutely every tiny detail of that cell.

85
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,720
Literally.

86
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,950
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of properties that that has captured.

87
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,960
But actually,

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,820
all we want to get is the cell address.

89
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,930
I'm just gonna hit Stop on.

90
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,700
What I want to do is say my address.

91
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,880
So I'm gonna need another variable.

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,750
Appear so dim my dress as string because that is what we actually want to get my address.

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:39,140
So my address equals response one dot deter.

94
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,890
So now,

95
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,800
out of all of those values that have been returned,

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,990
all of those different properties from the range response one that we just saw in here.

97
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,600
I just want to extract the address because that's the thing I'm interested in.

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,650
So I'm just gonna f eight through this clicker cell look like that one this time.

99
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,570
Absolute.

100
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,770
A four again.

101
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,470
You can see we've captured millions and millions and millions of bits of data about this.

102
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,670
But what we actually want to know is the address someone I press f eight.

103
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,790
My address equals absolute.

104
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,760
A absolute four on that is really useful if you ever want the use.

105
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,530
If you ever want to ask the user,

106
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,680
where does your data begin or in which row are your titles?

107
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,350
That is a little bit of code that will help you do that.

108
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:32,140
There's a very useful Microsoft article on all the different types of input box methods on

109
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,260
gun.

110
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,470
Oppose that in this lecture just here.

111
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,930
I'll also put it at the bottom of the code as a remnant statement.

112
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,240
So as usual,

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,770
you can download this file,

114
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,350
which is called input boxes.

115
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,730
Start Excel s.

116
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,150
All of your code will be in a sheet called Get Your Code Here,

117
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,370
just paste it into a module and you'll be able to follow along.

118
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:50,960
Okay,

119
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,450
I'll see you in the next lecture
