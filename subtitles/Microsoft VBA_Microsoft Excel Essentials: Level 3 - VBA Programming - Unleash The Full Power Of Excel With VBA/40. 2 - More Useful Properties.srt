1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
again guys on Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,860
And then we're gonna have a look at some more even useful properties that from time to time

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,860
you're gonna need to know how to use.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,640
So the 1st 1 is particularly important if you ever want to create a user log.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,710
We look at how to do that a little later on.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,930
So the 1st 1 is going to say my user name,

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,990
just a randomly made up variable name.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,720
Don't forget recovering variables in the next section is environment String open brackets

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
quote user name,

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,600
close quote,

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,450
close brackets.

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,910
So when I hit F eight through this on hover over,

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,540
you can see that my user name is Allen.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,910
And that's how you retrieved the user name of the person who's access in the book.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,470
Then the next one we have up is my active book name,

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,870
which is the active book dot name.

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,390
That is not the workbook that the code resides in,

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,710
but whichever workbook is currently active.

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,510
So here Book one is active.

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,140
So when they hit their fate,

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,330
you can see that book one dot Excel S X is the active workbook name.

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,760
Now,

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,450
similarly,

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,880
this is going to the same fall.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,050
This workbook,

26
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,050
this workbook being the coat that the workbook where the code resides.

27
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,990
So in this particular instance,

28
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,920
it's my macro book dot XLs m.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,020
Now let me just scroll these up a bit so you can see them get the past to the active

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,620
workbook.

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,250
That's the active workbook.

32
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,680
Not necessarily the workbook where the codus remember the Distinction f eight and you can

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,350
see that this particular file the active workbook installed on C users Alan Desktop

34
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,250
Fantastic.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,050
Now the next ones is exactly the same thing for the this workbook where the code resides

36
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,830
and I think that path is going to be too long to even see it.

37
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,060
But they go if you need to retrieve the path of the work but that you're in,

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,270
that's how you do it.

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,040
Okay,

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,970
get the full path,

41
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,080
Onda the name at the end of it.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,350
So that's going to give us the full name on the path.

43
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,970
So here,

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,390
when I hit F eight on hover over it,

45
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,130
you can see that the full string is going to be C users.

46
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:15,800
Alan Desktop Book one Docks XLs X because that is the active workbook Now,

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,760
that's a particularly useful thing if you ever need to capture the location of a fall that

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,540
you're looking at,

49
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,850
but you're gonna be using that one.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,620
Now,

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,050
of course,

52
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,610
this my full name again.

53
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,350
So we call this my full name too.

54
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,390
Okay.

55
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,130
So my full name to does precisely the same thing.

56
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,190
But with this workbook by the code resigns.

57
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,710
And if I have Rover it well,

58
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,500
it was too long to see the path when it was just the path.

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,640
But I assure you,

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,400
at the end of that is the name of my macro book.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,850
My sheet name is the active sheet Don't name.

62
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,960
So when I hover over that,

63
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,600
I can find out that I am currently looking at sheet one on my cell equals active cell.

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,090
That address.

65
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,120
We've looked at that before,

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,110
and we know precisely what that does.

67
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,840
Okay,

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,710
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're just gonna have a look.

69
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,320
Some more obscure things that you never know may come in use one day.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
I'll see you in the next lecture.
