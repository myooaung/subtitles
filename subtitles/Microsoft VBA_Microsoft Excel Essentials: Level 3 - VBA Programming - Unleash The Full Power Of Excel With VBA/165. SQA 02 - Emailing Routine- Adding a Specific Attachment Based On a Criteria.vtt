00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Okay,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.630
guys.

3
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.070
And welcome to another student question.

4
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.560
Now,

5
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.380
the question that came in was,

6
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.700
can we add a specific word attachment to the email routine,

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.510
depending on a criteria that we satisfy within the data?

8
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.910
Now,

9
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.850
the specific question related to having a column in here that stated which language that

10
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.890
the particular recipient was spoke on then,

11
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.950
obviously sending a word document in that particular language there just to use the base

12
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.890
code that we've got.

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.490
I've already answered this in the Q and A,

14
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.280
but it may be a lot simpler if actually demonstrated.

15
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.290
So we don't have languages in here.

16
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.550
But what we do have is this column that states whether someone is male or female.

17
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.170
So what we're gonna do is go to the code on what we're gonna need in our sunscreen Male is

18
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.800
to increase the size of my array to three elements.

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.550
So now we have an extra element where we can add in a path to the file name.

20
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.550
So here's the particular part of the code that checks whether someone is blonde here.

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.940
So,

22
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.290
in fact,

23
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.800
it's held up.

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.170
Value equals blonde,

25
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.810
and we're in column E.

26
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.380
Yet we're in column E.

27
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.150
So after my counter,

28
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.350
it can happen anywhere near after my cantor.

29
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.440
I'm just gonna paste in the code that that I added in the Q and A section.

30
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.230
So what this does is it gives us to logical tests.

31
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.530
It says If the person is male,

32
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.080
add the past to the mail file name.

33
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.070
Now I have a folder on my desktop called New Folder and inside that I have to files both

34
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.090
just empty text files once called Male Doc txt one's called female dot txt.

35
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.720
So what we're gonna say remember,

36
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.270
we're in column me if the active cell offset zero minus three.

37
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.850
So we're in column e.

38
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.780
So it's gonna be looking not there,

39
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.530
not there.

40
00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.050
But here it's gonna look in the column where we have our sex declared its gun safety at two

41
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.050
.

42
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.480
Active cell to offset minus three value equals male.

43
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.620
Then Mireille,

44
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.450
my counter three.

45
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.980
That's our new third element equals on the past to the mail file.

46
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.390
Then it's going to say,

47
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.950
actually,

48
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.460
if it equals female,

49
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.250
then add to my array my count at three.

50
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.400
The path to the female file and now all for all that remains for us to do is just copy that

51
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.810
there,

52
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.100
so control and see copy.

53
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.500
Come down to our e mailing routine.

54
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.730
And here we have this attachment stocks ad which we've rammed out in the past.

55
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110
So I'm just gonna under Ramit on delete all of this code here,

56
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.020
and I'm just gonna paste in that My array.

57
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.370
My counter three.

58
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.180
So let's come back to here.

59
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.580
Hit play,

60
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.090
and I'll be back with you in a second when those emails have come through.

61
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.240
Okay,

62
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.770
there we go.

63
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.380
So the emails are there through,

64
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.720
so we have Annabelle who has a female attachment.

65
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.830
Looks like we got loads of females that something must be a man in here somewhere.

66
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.980
Oh,

67
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.490
here we go,

68
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.970
Adam.

69
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.820
So high there,

70
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.900
Adam and Adam gets the mail text,

71
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.750
so let me just close that.

72
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.470
Okay,

73
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.380
so they go that say that Obviously,

74
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.770
you can have as many logical tests as you want.

75
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.540
So if you are testing for five different languages,

76
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.830
then just have five logical tests on assigned the appropriate file here in the path name.

77
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.330
OK,

78
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.950
I hope that helps on dial.

79
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.220
See,

80
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.360
when the next student question Have a great day.

81
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.050
Thank you.
