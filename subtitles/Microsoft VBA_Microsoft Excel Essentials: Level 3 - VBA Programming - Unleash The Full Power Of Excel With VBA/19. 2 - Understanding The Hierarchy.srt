1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Okay,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,300
guys,

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,190
some welcome back.

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,010
And in this lecture,

5
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,960
we're gonna have a look at the hierarchy.

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,910
They just make this a little easier to see.

7
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,680
I'm just gonna close the project window,

8
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,470
and I'm going to zoom over here to excel.

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,690
If I can drag this,

10
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,810
they go,

11
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,250
OK,

12
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,410
so we should be good for now.

13
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,000
OK,

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,220
so let's have a look at the hierarchy now.

15
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,020
One of the most important things that you need to remember with your coding is golden Rule

16
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:32,000
number five Be explicit because vb a cannot guess.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,430
So just to illustrate that point here,

18
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,830
what I'm gonna do is execute this code,

19
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,950
which I've just dragged from here.

20
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,180
So when I step through this by pressing F eight,

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,320
notice what happens over here in Excel they go.

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,740
So range a five.

23
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,850
We have applied the method dot Select on range.

24
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,630
A five has been selected.

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,170
Okay,

26
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,750
so far,

27
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,320
so good.

28
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,090
Now,

29
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,880
if I would come to this sheet,

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,540
come back to this code and run this code again,

31
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,690
just sit in the play button.

32
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,530
Noticed that range a five has been selected again on That's because whenever you run code

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,360
like this,

34
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,850
whatever she you are looking at is exactly where that code is going to be executed unless

35
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,770
you specify explicitly Golden Rule number five.

36
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,000
Unless you specify explicitly the hierarchy.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,690
Okay,

38
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,850
so let's have a quick look.

39
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,140
A hierarchy.

40
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,270
Now the hierarchy looks something like this at the very top of the hierarchy.

41
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,140
We have the application itself.

42
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,850
Analyses excel,

43
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,820
No,

44
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,580
underneath excel in the hierarchy.

45
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,010
We have the work book on there,

46
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:50,910
the files that you say they're the XLs exes and the XLs ends on that is the next level of

47
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,060
the hierarchy.

48
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,570
And then underneath the workbook in the hierarchy,

49
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,450
we have the work sheets,

50
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,700
and they're all the different sheets and taps that you can see along the bottom of your

51
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,540
spreadsheet.

52
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,040
And then finally,

53
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,160
the last level of the hierarchy are the cells.

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,190
So let's have a look at a quick video so we can understand what that looks like.

55
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,050
Okay,

56
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,670
the first thing we have is the cell that is the very end of the hierarchy on that could be

57
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,740
represented by something like Range a five now,

58
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,280
immediately above that,

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,920
What we have If you want to know which sheet we are working in,

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,790
we need to specify the worksheet and in this example that could be sheets,

61
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,310
sheet one dots and then range a five.

62
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,720
So we have sheets one on that,

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,830
specifying which worksheet we're working with.

64
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,020
And then we have the bottom end of the hierarchy and we are saying Range a five.

65
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,590
Now,

66
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,370
if we have multiple workbooks on our coat,

67
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,350
can work across multiple workbooks.

68
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,130
We need to move one level of the hierarchy again.

69
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,610
And this time we will specify the workbook.

70
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,040
So for argument's sake,

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,540
if we're in my macro book,

72
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,430
But we wanted to write some code that acted on range A five in sheet one off workbook one.

73
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,010
We would specify workbooks.

74
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,000
Book one does Excel s ex dot Remember,

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,210
they're separated by dots sheet one dot range a five.

76
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,050
And now whatever we wanted to do with that after that.

77
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,980
Okay,

78
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,290
so that's the hierarchy were going to come.

79
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,850
Too many examples of this is we work through our code,

80
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,730
but for now,

81
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,300
I'm going to see you in the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at this first

82
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,380
blocker Coaches here,

83
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,970
we'll explore what it does.

84
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,440
Okay.

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,810
I'll see you in the next lecture.
