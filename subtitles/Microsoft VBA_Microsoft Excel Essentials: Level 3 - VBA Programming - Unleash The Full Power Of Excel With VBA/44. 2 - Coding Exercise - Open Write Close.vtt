00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Okay,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.410
guys on Welcome back for another coding exercise.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.470
This this one is a little more complicated.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.130
It's gonna draw on several of the things that we've already looked at so far in this

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.880
section.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.190
So there are 10 steps.

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.880
Now you'll find this file which is called open right close dot XLs X as a downloadable

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.590
resource from this lecture.

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.390
And this gives the the instructions on what to do.

10
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.010
So I'm just gonna whiz through them.

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.230
No,

12
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.840
for you.

13
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.810
Step one,

14
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.950
creating new workbook.

15
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.710
Call it book one dot XLs x and save it to your desktop.

16
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.250
Okay,

17
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.760
No.

18
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.150
Make sure that it has three worksheets,

19
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.580
depending on which version of excel you have.

20
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.240
It may just have one by default.

21
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.490
So if it only has one,

22
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.780
add another two.

23
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.430
So you have cheap one sheet to and sheet three in your tab.

24
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.090
Names at the bottom With that done save and close the workbook.

25
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.780
Ok,

26
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.180
now,

27
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.500
from this workbook open right close,

28
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.850
I went to insert a new module.

29
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.680
No need to add a subroutine called open right close a gay.

30
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.010
The first task is to write a line of code that is going to go and open book one dot x L s X

31
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.520
No.

32
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.740
Be sure when you write the code that you specify the path to your desktop in the solution

33
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.340
file that will have the past to my desktop.

34
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.860
So when you look at the solution at the end obviously,

35
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.480
once you've already programmed this,

36
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.060
you'll have to replace the path to my desktop with the path to your desktop.

37
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.830
Okay.

38
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.030
Now,

39
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.750
if you don't remember how to do that,

40
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.010
go back and have a look at the lecture opening another workbook programmatically and you

41
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.440
can see that you have all of the hints here as to which electric covers this specific

42
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.010
element.

43
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.450
OK,

44
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.930
so you've written a line echoed that is gonna open Book one next step right alone line of

45
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.780
code to activate Book one.

46
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.450
Remember,

47
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.980
you must activate a book before you can select right,

48
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.980
So number seven right.

49
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.150
Two lines of code toe.

50
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.150
Add some text to arrange a one in sheet one,

51
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.550
so just give you a hint.

52
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.910
Your first line will be to select sheet one.

53
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.780
Your second line will be to add some text to range a one,

54
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.700
and you know how to do that because we did it in the last exercise.

55
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.080
Number eight,

56
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.750
Slightly more challenging.

57
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.450
What right?

58
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.840
One line of code toe.

59
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.860
Add some text to range a one in sheet to without selecting it,

60
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.180
and he gonna have to observe the hierarchy.

61
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.830
And again,

62
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.640
if you get stuck,

63
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.190
go back and have a look at the lecture that's mentioned here in the hand.

64
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.500
Your ninth line of code is exactly same as number eight,

65
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.080
but this time you're right in some text to sheet three again a single line of code without

66
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.540
selecting sheet.

67
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.950
Three first,

68
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.860
and the final step is to close on.

69
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.930
Save your workbook.

70
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.420
Now,

71
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.040
When that's done,

72
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.430
I want to test your code.

73
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.180
So obviously going after Open Book one and delete all the text that you just added to range

74
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.790
is a one in sheets 12 and three and close the workbook so you'll start with a blank book,

75
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.500
one workbook,

76
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.840
then run your code and hopefully you should have some text in range.

77
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.140
A one on sheets 12 and three.

78
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.110
Good look,

79
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.750
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
