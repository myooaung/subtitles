00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
the fishing industry has always been an industry that has been labeled as corrupt and

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.150
industry that follows unsustainable practices and is involved in human rights.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.790
Coalitions or fishing has incited as a medical picked by you in for the plating marrying

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.580
resources,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.820
which is going to impact us in the longer as a fact check.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.440
The illegal fishing industry is worth tens of billions of dollars.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.050
Are you which industry comes to mind when you think of slavery or forced labor,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.410
maybe diamond mining in Africa or forced labour employed in agricultural fields?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.650
In developing countries,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.150
we can bet fishing might not have come even close when you thought the forced labor.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.820
But in reality it is one of the biggest industries that employ forced labor and still

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.280
practices.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.420
Slavery slaves are generally made to work for long us sometimes a pretty to our shifts for

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.150
years at the sea without proper wages and food.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.740
Further,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.270
this industry also suffers from the issue of illegal fishing.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.350
The officials are caught outside the legal boundaries off a specific country or estate.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.000
It has been estimated that around 20 do 30% of the fish is sold in the U.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.260
S.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.450
I caught illegally.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.440
And all of this happens because of the huge demand for fish,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.020
the hoping 2.6 billion people dependent on fish as an important part of the date Onda

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.570
bloated blocks can be great to put our from this industry and do a more sustainable he co

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.150
friendly and humanist.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.550
Let us understand it's working.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.270
Could you?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.500
Enough.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.520
It's taking bloating along with Al if I.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.690
D Tex and you're cold can be used to collect and track the information about the journey

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.120
that it una fish has taken from the bait.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.350
Deliberate is the plate.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.960
As soon as it unites court,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.020
it's tracking will stop once the court fish is bordered on the ship are using the AL if I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.950
detect will be attached to it.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.530
I If I did,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.250
either devices will be installed on the vessel at the port and in the processing plant.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.450
These devices will automatically lead information from this modified it day,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.530
and we'll upload the corresponding information on the block.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.030
After the fish has been processed.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.400
I highly text will be removed and it will be replaced by people queue accords which will be

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340
attached to the packaging or the fish,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.020
its unique you at court,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.920
we believed to the information captured on the block to against that particular fish,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.260
and it's corresponding at if I did this.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.000
Got court can then be used whether consumer to track the completely new the fish right from

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.250
bait to his plate,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.780
blocked in technology holds the potential to make fish catches more to aspirate and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.400
principle,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.050
allowing consumers to refuse to buy a literally court fish or fish court using slave labor

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.050
.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.950
Bloating on its own won't prevent illegal fishy,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.030
but it will make a big elections discoverable and actionable for monetary and very fine

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.390
that there is no human trafficking involved.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.930
The local trusted and existed and use can be partnered.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.490
With this,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.230
Anjos can capture and applaud the conditions off these fishermen on the block.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.290
Another very critical challenge faced by seafood industry is the formal and food labelling

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.290
.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.750
According to a report published by Marin's having organization,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.780
one in every three seafood products sold in the U.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.270
S.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.750
Was incorrectly labeled.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.170
So the question is,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.050
how can you be sure that the expensive Atlantic salmon sold under while coat you had for

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.630
dinner last night was no,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.500
doesn T farm grown salmon,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.850
or perhaps not even salmon at all.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.470
In case off fish float,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.650
that deeper fish label has more expensive fish to attain more profits.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.080
But to book a consumer contract,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.060
the complete jenny of the fish and can ensure that the fish or any other seafood his by is

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.150
actually the same that the labor states.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.950
Additionally,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.950
since fish is a perishable food,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.380
it can become unfit for consumption.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.780
If Captain Temperature above the desired range has accepted pledges,

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.650
it can become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.450
The sensors attached to the fish,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.040
such as temperature senses,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.930
can low this additional details,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.710
such as temperature of the fish during its storage and transportation,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.950
on the share legend and through bloke.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.810
In the end,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.170
consumer can scan the unique.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.100
You are put on the fish package E and can very fight that the fishies by had well kept at

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.250
the specified temperature and conditions throughout Britain.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.050
Apart from this,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.220
by asking also check important leaders about the fish like it species size,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.000
weight,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.470
location of harvest,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.080
diamond,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.120
date of harvest,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.450
that entity of the producers and the way in which the seafood was handled.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.260
But for this.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.790
These data points need to be captured and stored on the blocking at every point in the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.380
supply chain.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.000
That's it won't be long to see that blocked Incan descent the fishing industry and can make

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.080
it more sustainable,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.950
transparent and eco friendly.
