00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
before diving into the use cases for Blockchain technology.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.530
Let's first understand then,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.550
should you use block take for your business.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.770
There are certain criterias that you should keep in mind in order to decide whether it

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.510
makes sense to start the project.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.550
With this technology,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.450
the first criteria is number of intermediaries.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.020
If your business is subjected to high coasts and drug deal is because of the involvement

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.850
off middle men or intermediaries,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.950
then bloated is a good fit for your business.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.650
It will cut down the high coasts off the middle meant,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.450
and we further expedite Divock with the implementation of blocked in,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.950
these issues can be resolved as it will remove these intermediaries.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.630
For instance,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.860
in case of entertainment industry,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.700
Block Tin can really prove to be a game changer in the entertainment industry.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.910
There is a long term off intermediaries involved in between the creative artist and the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.850
final consumers off his creation.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.830
With the implementation of blocked in,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.600
the artist order creator will have the absolute control over his content and he can be paid

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.310
directly instead of going through a tail off intermediaries for sharing his creative

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.250
talented over.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.060
Additionally,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.340
you need to assess If you need a database in your business that is fundamentally secure and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.050
tamper proof,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.220
the next thing you should consider is the level and scale of stakeholders coordination

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.750
required in your business.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.950
If your business requires coordination between a large number of stakeholders,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.350
Blokhin can be a great solution to be implemented in your business.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.170
In case your business request data exchange among several parties,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.990
then the centralization is a good approach to our data manipulation and exchange of data in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.550
real time.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.380
For instance,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.280
in a business related to supply tin management,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.570
there are multiple stakeholders involved at various stages of the process,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.250
and it also lacks transparency and real time updates about the consign.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.850
For such a scenario,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.050
Blokhin can be perfect solution in a blocked in this system.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.320
Stakeholders involved in the supply T will record the information about the consignment on

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.450
the Blockchain platform once they received the consignment.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.420
This in turn,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.420
will make it visible to get real time updates and information about the consignment and the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.000
location off.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.550
A consignment will be clearly visible toe all the stakeholders involved cloud attorney.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.940
Another important point to consider is that suspect in a centralised system malicious and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.360
productions can be performed easy.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.450
The information stored in a cent less system can lead to a single point of failure and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.090
moral.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.450
A centralized database is prone to healthy activities as well.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.830
But with the implementation of blocky,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.520
the issue of single point of failure can be avoided due to its distributor.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.980
Native.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.440
Further implementation of this technology can even make a business data and transactions on

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.680
10 people and MUTV in our example of supply it in business.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.940
Implementation of Blockchain technology will make it nearly impossible for any party

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.220
involved in the process.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.750
To force the documents off the consignment,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.240
Oh introduced a products into the supply.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.310
One of the other very crucial criteria you look upon while considering doctrine is the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.750
level of collaborations required in your business.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.430
The concept of creating smart contracts can help in automatic collaborations between

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.200
companies.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.290
A traditional contract defines only the terms off a business lesson.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.080
But digitize smart contract also define conditions.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.800
Under Vista,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.350
contract will be executed,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.180
for instance,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.970
defining the criteria under which the payment shall be made and once those conditions are

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:05.550
fulfilled,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.650
automatic release off the payment.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.370
Thus,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.780
smart contracts can eliminate the human intervention for payments and play an important

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.310
role in autumn ity.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.190
Close company collaborations
