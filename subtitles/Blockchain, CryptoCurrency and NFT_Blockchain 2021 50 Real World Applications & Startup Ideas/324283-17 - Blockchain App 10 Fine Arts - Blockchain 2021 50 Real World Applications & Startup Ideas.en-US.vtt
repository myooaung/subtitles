00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
they hear 2016 is considered as a hero,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.360
feet because off the complex's courtyard scandals.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.050
That happening that you.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.750
In the 2014 report,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.160
the Finest Export Institute in Geneva stated that over 50% of the artworks it had examined

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.350
where he de forged or not attributed to the correct artist.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.140
There is an estimated three Children dollars built on,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.240
located to art off it approximately $65 million traded annually through auction houses and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.250
art dealers.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.250
One of the biggest challenges that finance market face to do is the lack of transparency.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.160
This lack of transparency is because off the last number of players involved,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.020
which includes galleries who managed buying and selling as well,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.650
is releasing new artwork.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.930
The private collectors entities Onda museums that all the artwork and make it available to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.650
the public.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.510
Next comes the Ark.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.800
Eyes and foundations degenerate on result artistic knowledge and manage historical memory

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.770
off the artist who have passed a fee auction houses organized and manage our deals and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.840
handle transactions.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.810
Taking place between the parties curate is and exports take care of all the dealings

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.690
related to artwork acts indicates other people who are interested in purchasing and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.580
investing in art the S and bag Lando's and insurance companies who accept high price pieces

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.390
off art and collectibles.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.900
S cultural and last but not the least,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.980
the most important players in this industry under artist who created out all of the players

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.390
and dependent on one and Nadeau in order to verify the Providence ownership history.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.150
I know authenticity often art masterpiece.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.650
Many thoughts,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.350
does out the money tree gins,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.350
take undue advantage of the opaqueness in the art industry and introduce fake artwork in

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.150
the market.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.010
Therefore,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.470
knowing the providence off a piece off art is very pollution in combating the counterfeit

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.560
out who Obviously,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.750
no one would wish to spend us money to buy a state piece off art.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.630
No,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.720
I Province is also important.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.350
Don't know the exact the NewCo masterpiece.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.810
The information about provenance and authenticity often not Group has a lot of loopholes

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.950
and additionally involves a lot of paperwork.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.400
In the current scenario.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.180
Proving the Providence off the art book involves a lot of steps that include a lot is not

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.350
get re sipped on get listed good on the artwork.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:01.010
Let us newspapers are medicines mentioning or illustrating the vocal fart written statement

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.570
from artists claiming his work Photograph off artist with artwork so difficult off

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.350
authenticity from an export really Sonus and transactions off the art group.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.050
This procedure of proving provenance and authenticity off a notebook can easily be

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.650
exploited by forces.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.650
The certificate on return statements can be easily forged,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.110
even for progress can be easily manipulated through image editing.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.950
Softwares is readily available in the market.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.340
The second challenge is that at industry has been dominated by auction houses,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.650
art galleries and private dealers for almost a century.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.260
Undoubtedly into me,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.550
duties are required for the market as they drive the momentum off moving art intention.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.980
However,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.990
the problem is that our distress objective of these intermediaries these entities,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.470
actors,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.250
middle men,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.990
tragic,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.950
exorbitant fees off up to 40%.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.500
Therefore,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.290
there isn't need to reduce the intermediaries that will allow artists.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.430
The Easter creators of the artwork don't feel more involved and more connected to those

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.550
interested in the world.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.460
Only sales,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.230
which has drawn by 12% as compared to last year,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.850
have also it even demand for these masterpieces of art.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.710
But the biases wrists as there is often discussed city off exports to evaluate the artwork

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.750
bought online and verify its provenance and authenticity.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.250
Blunting offers a solution to prove the providence off an artwork by storing all their

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.820
reliving deter in a lot.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.980
Inmates system.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.990
The artists will upload proof of ownership off their creations on Block two for proving its

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.820
authenticity.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.720
And providence This authentication stored on the block tin can neither be manipulated no

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.350
interest.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.530
For,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.500
though multiple authorities,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.440
like art exports on galleries are required to review,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.750
verify and a test of veracity of this data before and get short in the bloc team.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.800
If you'll start deflect.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.370
Very sad are creating distributed ledger for Fine arts that allows artists to upload the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.350
certificate off authenticity off the art book,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.050
and they are broke.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.210
Created is provided a unique I D tag the about this unique I.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.760
D.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.750
And I just can track the location on the owner of that artwork at any point of time.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.480
Simultaneously,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.720
the bias can verify the providence of the art book and didn't even really did the

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.150
authenticity of the artwork before buying.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.650
This will introduce a great level of transparency and trust in the sector.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.860
Even my banking hard work on Lee.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.640
The Biocon validate authenticity off the artwork by scanning the unique I D present on the

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.350
art book.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.420
In the current scenario,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.650
you investing in art book is beyond the reach of normal people.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.040
Only someone in vast hills can buy and collect expensive art group but blocked in

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.140
technology can democratize the access to fine art and can facility it.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:31.160
Fractional ownership of the art book by a large number off investors SE and I focus.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.790
Price did $10 million through blocked in technology,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.690
It can have thousands of investors who won affection off the peace and can trade art book

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.450
over time.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.310
The bidding off our cook can Professor Lee did it by Smart Country.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.210
When the auction process finishes,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:55.420
the Smart contract will analyze all the birds to determine the finest year place on the

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.850
amount of shoes Eats and Cecil in Mr Ends up chasing in the finance.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:07.650
For though a blocked in best art marketplace can enable the artist the Selden on Derrick Ng

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.650
.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.700
In such a system,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.350
I just can sit and control the prices dim since,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.990
additionally,

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.660
this system would considerably increase the profits for artists as high commissions chance

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.950
by third parties will be significantly reduced.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:30.750
Nothing can also help the artist to get a fair shoe for the vocal fart.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.380
Currently in our this makes profit only ones.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.550
Then he initially says this artwork.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.310
On the other hand,

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:45.250
auction houses detainee driver prices to increase their own profits from bag broke apart,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.650
but that this doesn't see any of that shoe,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.250
for instance,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:57.140
and not this soldiers on this little piece of artwork for $3 million in 2000 and five years

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.850
later it was sold again for $10 million.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.120
Now get.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:08.850
In 2015 the outlook was auctioned on was sold at the price off $12 million.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.580
In this scenario,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.250
the artist doesn't make any profit during re selling off his art book,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.680
but very district unblocking.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.310
I just don't have the ability to track their art book and can potentially take a percentage

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.380
of profit off each future,

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:33.750
sell off the art book that's a block to He can have all information on the auction prices

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.310
off his art book and can get fear compensation through these Elroy,

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.850
please
