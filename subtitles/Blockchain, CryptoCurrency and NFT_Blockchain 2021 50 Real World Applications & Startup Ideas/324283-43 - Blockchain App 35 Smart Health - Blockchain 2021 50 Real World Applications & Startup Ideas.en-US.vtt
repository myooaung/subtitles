00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
health care is an essential part of place,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.650
and technology is disappearing this space day in and day out.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.790
The current technology in health care and general practice of medicine can get enhanced

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.550
with the use off I OD systems.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.840
Let's understand how these I open systems and smart devices can and has the healthcare

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.350
services and create a positive impact on our health.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.280
I open health devices have the potential to collect real time information of the patient

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.850
and report this to the physician remotely.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.490
The Iot devices can collect information like blood pressure,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.460
heart rate,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.830
blood glucose level,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.850
etcetera off a patient and started on the club.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.750
And then this information can be shared with the authorized position.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.660
This technology can say,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.990
unless a strict medical visits can allow healthcare providers to provide better care to

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.050
their patients and can even facilitate it remote consultation.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.130
Essentially,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.010
these devices can improve access to health care resources while reducing strain on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.050
healthcare systems,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.750
and can give people back their control over their own health at all times.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.790
Another important and one ditch off I obi devices is that emergency situations like Hard

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.330
Back s Tima can be analysed by the healthcare professionals.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.010
The Marquis.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.450
The health care providers can even get access to that patients profiles before the arrival

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.050
because of which they can believe essential cape of the patients on time.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.800
In this way,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.050
associated losses are reduced and emergency healthcare is improved.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.650
But there are certain challenges that I ordered us his face,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.650
and we will now see how blocking can help in overcoming these challenges.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.820
I only smiled devices,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.350
capture data in real time and stored this data on the club.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.590
The biggest challenge of storing data on a centralised and cloud system is its security and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.620
privacy patients.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.990
In such a scenario,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.550
this is the people who Hechi,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.350
which can compromise this personal health information.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.550
The patient's data can then be used to create fake ID's to buy jerks and can even be used

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.550
to file fraudulent insurance claims.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.850
Look,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.890
Tin can provide the required solution to solve security issues faced by Iot devices,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
as the data stored in location will be resistant to Hetty and temporary.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.850
In case multiple Iot devices have to be indicated,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.850
it becomes a challenge because different devices have defended a communication protocols

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.450
and different processing power,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.490
which slows down the whole process that's reducing the scope off.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.750
I would be in health care block till or for the solution for this.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.580
But because of the limited processing power off I ordered us.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.410
Is these cargo directly connected without looking as high computing power is required for

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.560
communicating with doctors,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.350
There needs to be intermediary,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.480
which can connect this.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.980
I open smart devices to block,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.250
too.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.600
This intermediate system can be a cloud system which is high computational power and kill

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.740
collected data from sensors and transfer it to the block in this blocked unpowered system.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.100
Ah,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.500
person,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.380
you get a unique i.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.950
D map with the Blockchain.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.480
He gives specify who can see his information collected from spot devices in case of

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.980
multiple out three devices.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.470
He can also choose the Iot devices whose data should be shared with the health care

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.390
provider I owe.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.910
This might help the rivers like Fitbits health banks,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.890
watches,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.440
blood glucose meter,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.980
the corner,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.820
daily data and activities of a user like galleries,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.900
step counts,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.650
miles,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.620
high trade,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.870
quality of sleep,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.980
blood pressure,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.950
blood glucose level except with blocks and technology.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.440
All this daily data from a user smart health devices can be club with users.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.850
Electronic health records.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.150
These devices collect the real time data off a user.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.420
And because of which Dr Kinsey Patient's condition in real time,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.680
as did Isaac quite continuously,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.850
there is no need to conduct all the tests.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.140
Well,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.450
patient visits the hospital.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.200
This will reduce the costs off connecting basic tests,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.650
and we'll save valuable time for both doctor and the patient.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.050
This could really be a boon for emergency cases were providing family treatment is the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.050
biggest challenge.
