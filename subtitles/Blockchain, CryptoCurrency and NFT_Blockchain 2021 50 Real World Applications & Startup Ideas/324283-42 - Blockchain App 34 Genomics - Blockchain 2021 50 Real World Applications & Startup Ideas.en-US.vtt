00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
Human D,

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.640
and it contains a lot of information like in case of computers there today stood in zero

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.700
and one by intraday digits in human d n A.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.920
The code of life is stupid in four letters a day agency the total amount of DNA found in us

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.970
in his effort to is you know this sequence single decisional can become full in enormous

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.500
lease.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.670
For example,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.850
it can help in designing post less medicines for individuals.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.890
It can be useful in treating the genetic diseases and even can be used for designing post

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.850
list I plan for individuals.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.940
In the recent years,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.850
the cost onto norm sequencing has come down significantly,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.550
which has led to advancements in the genetics industry.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.330
And the cost is for the expected Don't drop to as little this $100 within the next few

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.950
years.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.400
Today,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.980
you know,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.150
sequencing is so efficient that it can simples significant amounts of DNA in Balan.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.580
But there is challenge off managing,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.890
storing on transmission of this huge amount of information included in the deal.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.250
Me.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.380
Another breaking point for the researchers is security and reliability of destiny

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.090
information that this student public databases no,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.590
take a no for a solution and can handle soldiers and companies in transmission and storing

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.750
this health data obtained from Deanna sequencing with high security.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.170
For though the user blocked two can make this information to the scent of fraud or

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.050
fabrication.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.060
Another matter of concern is the preservation off the privacy on the individual who

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.500
contributes a genetic material and another very important question to be answered here.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.450
His whole controls this data.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.990
Ideally,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.590
the individuals should be able to control his data directly.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.150
Auto trusted parties such as doctors always sorts groups with necessary permissions.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.720
But in the current scenario,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.900
an individual's genetic information is Soto,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.240
other research companies,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.610
the Doubters knowledge by selling disenchanted data companies are only huge profits.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.410
And that,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.710
too,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.750
without permission of the individuals so blocked in technology.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.770
Hell individual bitter owner office,

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.460
D N A.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.680
On genetic information and even decide who can access is genetic information.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.050
And for your corpus,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.270
the user will have the option to share the genetic data anonymously.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.150
But the data buyer needs to be transparent and felt very coy to reveal his identity on the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.810
blocked in it.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.650
The currencies for sequencing of Gino is around $1000.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.930
These you know,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.240
sequencing companies generally store the state of intense is and sell them genetically

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.660
tough individuals to other farmer on biotech companies for the purpose of research and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.550
development.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.710
But with the implementation of LA team than that,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.450
often individual will be stored securely on the block to network.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.630
The data bias,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.090
including researchers,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.530
drug design companies and healthcare organizations who are in the need of this genetic data

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.680
for their research,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.250
can directly obtain an individual's genetic data from him.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.250
The individual will get paid by the deter buys for sharing his deter,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.640
thus reducing the overall cost of getting Deanna sequenced and also enhancing the security

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.300
off the genomic deter many companies like Nebula Genomics,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.150
of working in this direction.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.980
For this,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.650
the smart contracts will be executed as soon as did ABIs received the genetic information.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.350
The data illness will automatically be Pete.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.060
In the current scenario,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.650
the availability of genomic data is low because very few people have the genome sequenced.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.950
This room is a major or block for researchers pharma on by two companies,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.970
as they required if you want a volume of genetic data for conducting their research on

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.150
genetic diseases.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.810
The researchers are usually not interested in gender,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.910
um,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.750
deposits,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.200
but instead this seat to acquire genomic data from individuals.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.940
The specific fellow types,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.260
such as particular medical conditions.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.960
Because genome data without finance depict later is not particularly useful.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.020
Another challenge that defeats is regarding the quality of the data quality of collected

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.930
data is often uncertain because it is typically collected through middle men.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.910
Personal genomics companies,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.890
which is Lyon,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.460
says reported data then they don't board from different sources is often included in

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.650
different Former's.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.950
This makes it time consuming for data buyers to convert it into a consumable form it.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.510
But to block to the data has been can,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.750
tactically connected to individuals.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.810
They're so it would be easy for them to acquire few no typical information along and,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.980
you know,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.740
typically information from the individuals on the block to the genomic daredevil bestowed

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.830
in standard form.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.190
It's that will save time and money off,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.050
researchers
