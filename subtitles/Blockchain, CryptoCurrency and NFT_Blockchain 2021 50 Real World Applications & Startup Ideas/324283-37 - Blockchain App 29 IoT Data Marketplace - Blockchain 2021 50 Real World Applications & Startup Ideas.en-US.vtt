00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.210
today,

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.240
I only devices are generating a massive on Jupiter simultaneously.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.600
Artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions are getting integrated everywhere

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.350
around us,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.890
making services and products more smarter and personalized.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.850
And one thing that is dying these technologies is data.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.020
On one hand,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
I only device companies don't know how to effectively manage.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.750
That future could be regenerated while on the other hand,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.160
the animal based companies are looking for the source that can provide them with a more

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.550
diverse set of training data so as to produce better solutions.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.510
I only device manufacturers are using cloud based solutions for the humongous data storage

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.350
requirements.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.540
They're even implementing business intelligence tools and services on the book.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.790
This data could be right business insights to ride the rail future potential ideas but for

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.350
successful future businesses,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.370
implementation of predictive,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700
prescriptive and left solutions.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.650
This in turn requires an additional step of data processing to extract the real actionable

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.950
insights from the collected pool of Peter.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.790
This data processing skills said,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.350
is currently not possessed by these Iot demon effect is another corn Really.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.400
There are many A and M A startups were adapted this,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.150
but like the required data set and try to be like insights from the minister later sex that

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.150
they can get their hands.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.710
Apparently,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
there is a need for a transparent and neutral platform that can benefit both of these

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.410
groups.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.050
I only device manufacturers and the A M L startups.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.410
The solution for this is a restless,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.090
secure and reliable Blockchain platform where the data can be traded seamlessly in a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.450
blocked,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.010
in based,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.850
decentralized data marketplace.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.050
There are usually two benefits.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.250
The first benefit.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.550
This continuously available data stow with the IOC device manufacturers,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.580
and the second is a data marketplace with a diverse set of searchable data with a enamel

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.350
startups.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.790
In such a marketplace they collected from the Iot,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.450
devices will be trailing and consumer different parties.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.400
For instance,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.500
in the given figure,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.250
there are treats My Do Aces,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.300
the wireless speaker system,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.850
Smartwatch and Smart coffeemaker.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.650
Their device manufactures off these devices.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.680
We'll list that they delicate but these devices on the bloated marketplace if they use this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.150
formation.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.450
This data is parties by A M and companies from the data marketplace.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.790
This data is then processed by these companies using their specialized algorithms to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.250
produce useful insights.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.460
For instance,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.620
data from smart coffee makers can be used to get insights on people's choice of the coffee

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.350
Brent and preference for strength off the coffee in a specific region.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.250
These insights can then be sold to various companies,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.780
like coffee houses,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.450
who caters Index Pacific region that they can before this old various coffee manufactures,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.950
who can now better understand the taste preference of the people and canned,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.950
then introduce new products into the market.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.570
Similarly,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.190
data from the wireless speaker systems can be used to get insights on people's taste of

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.950
music living in a specific region.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.790
These insights about the music taste of that locality can we sold to even companies and in

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.240
done,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.680
these event companies can increase their revenue while giving customize experience to the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.450
customs.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.070
The inside syndicated from SMARTWATCHES can be sold to various local was pigeons who can

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.670
use this to launch various health plans and diagnostic tests.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.770
Who back the health of the patients insure this marketplace can create a positive feedback

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.350
loop from the later generally,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.820
thus creating of women situation where all the stakeholders involved and uses the benefits

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.310
will be in that they may be provided with Iot devices at a much lower coast in exchange off

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.480
their consent to store and share their data on the market.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.100
Please that data that we be sure in the marketplace people determined by the consent of the

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.190
user and the legal framework applicable in their geographical location.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.930
The money that customers will have to pay for these devices will depend on the consent

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.350
level that they give to these manufactures on the leader collection and Children.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.320
Generally,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.450
when you think off any system that collects processes or shares that uses data,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.450
a sense of skepticism creeps in your mind about the data privacy.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.950
You become doubtful about the misuse or abuse of the data ship,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.250
but in this transparent and reliable system,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.950
every data point shell on the marketplaces consented and know that I shared without the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.120
consent of the user.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.560
Unlike in the current scenario,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.290
this secure data marketplace is bound to bring data democratisation by means of access to

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.650
the consented uses data.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.610
Best stoeckley,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.380
but not the critical problem be two days that ecosystem,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.640
where most of our data is held by tech giants like Google and Facebook,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.650
and they shared with third parties without our knowledge or consent the marketplace

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.850
primarily will have two forms of data.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.400
First form would be raw data collected by the devices and the second form with a process

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.450
data generated by A and M L companies by using various algorithms,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.260
therefore,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.350
a decent place and a transparent marketplace for drilling off data dilated from these outer

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.150
devices is bound to have a positive impact on the adoption of Iot devices.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.880
Such a marketplace will have the potential to improve the service quality and when I do,

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.150
for things at the same thing,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.240
thus proving to be a real boon for the end customers as well.
