00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
There are many upcoming streams that are changing technology,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.350
landscape and robotics is one off them,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.390
but a vortex has been even their foot.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.550
Who is the next technological revolution by many of the industry exports?

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.790
Robotics is going to be a multi 1,000,000,000 global industry and is going to have a

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.750
tremendous impact over many other industries in the coming years,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.430
then everything off the boards.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.830
We're hardwired to imagine a single,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.780
sophisticated rowboat having go jerking movements and a thick voice that we have experience

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.250
in various scifi moon's.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.750
Not necessarily.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.600
There is a branch of robotics known as form robotics.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.750
Back in was a large number off simple robots.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.220
The field off swarm robotics is inspired from the nature creators,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.500
like social insects,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.190
fishes,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.940
birds.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.150
These exhibits form behavior.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.980
These forms range from a few individuals living in their small natural habitats To millions

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.250
of individuals living in highly organized colonies.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.680
The individuals in these forms show very poor abilities.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.570
But when combined with the intelligence of the whole group,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.550
these forms exhibit great flexibility and robustness in completing complex activities such

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.530
as part planning,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.450
task allocation and various other complex collective behaviors.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.650
The searchers have established effect that this intelligent collective behavior emerges

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.420
from local communication and information transmission among these individuals with poor

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.730
capabilities based on this very concept off collective intelligence off individuals with

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.900
poor capabilities,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.020
Swarm robotics came in Toby Small Robotics is a branch of robotics in which last number off

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.450
simple robots are coordinated in a distributed and decentralized way.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.590
It operates on the principle of local communication and information transmission.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.150
Between these simple awards,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.740
these life number of simple robots can perform complex tasks in a much more efficient

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.160
manner than a single robot.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.320
He advantage of these robotics forms is there scalability and robustness to failure,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.320
and both of these qualities.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.650
Or is Nate from the simple and distributed nature of coordination.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.270
The number of use cases for robotics forms are increasing with their decreasing cost of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.650
these robotic platforms.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.890
Some of the applications include targeted material delivery.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.550
Were groups of smaller boards are used for carrying big and heavy objects.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.310
Chris isn't far me where this about farmers in their agricultural activities and even

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.610
entertainment industry,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.050
where groups off these some robots come together to form interactive displays.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.750
However,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.150
there are still many grey areas which are proving to be challenged in their widespread

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.750
adoption.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.650
Some of these challenges include a lack of safety measures,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.990
the scent less control on lack of security protocols for these about existence and the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.250
bloating blocks and can provide a solution to the telling this face by these robotic sports

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.250
.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.030
The implementation of Blokhin with these form robotic systems can lead to a fight.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.870
Adoption of these systems across various industries bloated and make them more secure,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.800
reliable,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.840
autonomous and profitable,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.280
which can lead to a Maskell acceptance off.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.620
These about X poems inside the system for aborts will actors notes and the information flow

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.550
between them will be recorded as transactions on the block.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.840
No,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.980
let's have an in depth look at the tell in this face West form robotic systems,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.510
and how does the implementation of Blokhin can help to tackle them?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.610
Security is the first and the foremost challenge for deployment off these systems in last a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.850
commercial projects.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.920
This is very crucial for the systems as the inclusion off any defective or malicious for

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.070
member can compromise the security of the small or can put a list with the completion of

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.530
the intended goal by the small security for robotics forms for now,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.320
mentally into the integrity they confidentiality data origin,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.100
authentication and be authentication blocks in technology can be solution.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.210
Toe the security challenges face past form robotic systems Has it not only provides a

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.510
private and reliable peer to peer communication network or small agents,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.150
but also has provisions toe overcome potential texts when let abilities and attacks

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.450
bloating with its robust and clips and mechanism,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.810
including public,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.220
e and digital signature cryptography can provide a security off transactions happening

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.650
through unsafe and shared communication channels.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.280
Further,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.710
this technology can also prove the identity of a specific agent trying to communicate with

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.650
other agents.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.250
This bringing trust and transparency in the system.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.490
The implementation includes generation off.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.000
A pair of private and public is for agent off the small but blinky,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.330
as the name suggests,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.430
will be publicly available in the block to network and provides addressed Owen agents male

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.650
accessible information.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.120
For the sake of simplicity,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.350
a public E can mutated as a special account number for the agent.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.920
Conversely,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.410
a private he can be compared to a passport,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.640
neck,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.520
traditional system and oils and agent schoolwork.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.130
Information priorities are used for validating the identity often agent and the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.850
transactions that it makes it.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.230
If public key cryptography,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.250
the words can share the public keys with other rowboats who want to communicate with them.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.960
With the availability of these public keys.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.780
And you know what,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.160
contend information toe any specific report in the network with the assurance that only the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.750
robot possessing the matching clarity can access that information.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.680
Since public is don't have the ability to decrypt messages,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.770
the security doesn't get compromised,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.150
even if it falls into the wrong hands.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.470
Besides,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.220
this mechanism also prevents information description by third by billboards,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.440
even if they share the same channel of communication I recently under the signature

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.250
cryptography,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.650
these awards can use their own gravity to encrypt their messages.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.360
In this cryptography,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.810
other words can decrypt the information or the message using the public e off the center

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.250
boat.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.080
This ability is available to everyone on the block.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.170
Therefore,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.580
the message won't be secret,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.150
Percy,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.750
but it can be used to prove the authorship of that message or information,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.450
because the message is encrypted by particular aboards,

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.480
private key and therefore it can't be sent by someone else,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.150
hence establishing authorship of the message.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.840
Both of these cryptographic techniques can be used to take other security Lupus prevalent

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.250
in the small robotic system.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.310
But blue key cryptography on one hand and shows that only specific rowboat having a

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.570
specific address can access the content off a message and caps elated in a transaction

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.150
based on ropes and technology.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.370
Digital signature cryptography,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.360
on the other hand and shows,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.140
data origin,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.150
authentication and entity authentication between robots were tied by the agents.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.350
The practical applications off these blocked,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.860
insecure robotics homes and killed the military were trustworthy and reliable.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.430
Systems are very much required and medical projects where team off reports helping the

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.700
transportacion off medicines and medical records of the patients.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.100
As in these cases,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.750
data confidentiality is the most crucial factor.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:50.370
The individual tents or awards in this room are required to reach a global agreement

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.380
regarding the cool.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.400
For example,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.650
path to be taken off steak us to be avoided shape to be formed etcetera.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.750
Therefore,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.830
for these forms to work,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.310
efficiently distributed decision making protocols are required that can actually guarantee

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.550
convergence towards a common outcome.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.040
Currently,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.800
this is still at open problem,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.880
and there is no foolproof distributed.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.250
This isn't making protocol that can handle a large number of storm agents efficiently.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.680
Block is a perfect match,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.950
but this requirement off the robotics moves,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.990
it has the required capability to ensure that the participating agents in a decentralized

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.570
network always reach a global agreement.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.650
Regarding the end good,

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.140
for example,

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.570
the Broken has a prohibition off distributed warning systems that can be used by these form

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.050
robotic systems whenever they have to reach a global accident.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:46.250
Let's understand how this distributed warning systems work for these fools.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:52.420
Whenever institution arises where one agent off the spoon needs to get agreement from other

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.380
agents off the soul,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.240
a special transaction can be issued on the block.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.350
To net this transaction,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.350
we create separate addresses for the possible options that this form has to vote on.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.350
For instance,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.550
in the the one scenario,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.400
these agents need to decide which path they should take out of the three parts as visible

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.150
on the sign book.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.970
In this case,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.570
the three possible options that part one Part two and part three,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.350
respectively.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.560
Now,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.640
one of the agents,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.750
we create three different addresses for these three options.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.470
That's for members can then vote.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.850
As for their understanding off the situation on these addresses,

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.850
as this information is publicly available on the next book,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.510
Have you know what can monitor the results off the voting process?

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.650
And actor Cody,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.490
in this case,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.170
has all of them can see that truth to go.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.550
The maximum worlds that award some will accept it as the group this season,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:56.090
and they all will take you to Has Blocked in provides a very good protocol for distributor

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.090
.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.630
This isn't making where agreements can be opened.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:05.040
Suplee and in a secure and auditable V sensing ever service isn't upcoming business in the

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.750
Iot defeat that can lead is this marriage of robotics homes with blocks in technology

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:16.400
incensing other service buyers by or subscribed with sensex service provided by these

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.950
phones,

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.350
This I Office for mortal may be helpful for a range of industries and organizations,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.690
for example,

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.680
can manufactures may subscribe to a sensing service that relates information about the

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.850
conditions of roads during the Baghdad.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.050
Oh,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:37.190
the common fixtures can then use this data to back and optimize the vehicles and therefore

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.450
market them in the back of it.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.580
Even farmers can use the services provided by these homes to get accurate by the focused

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.550
and then plan the activities accordingly.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.470
The services of these robotics forms,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.250
along with the respective places,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.180
can be listed on a marketplace which can then be a bill by individuals.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.150
For companies,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.980
there are various robotics forms that have been programmed to find various natural

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.200
resources or objects over,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.360
and a critical part of the activity is to establish the ownership and exploitation rights

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.110
on a found object or resource on behalf of their owner or ability.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.280
For instance,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.700
a special robotics form program to do gave explorations finds a hidden treasure in one of

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.310
the kids.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:25.850
The small issues are discovery document on the block in claiming the ownership of that

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.750
pleasure on behalf off their owner.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.950
The transaction may include the discovered objects.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.690
Relevant reports coordinate of the place of discovery images,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.550
a physical ah hashes inflated along with the time stamp for this document.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:45.350
This that gassed included into transactions on the Blockchain has approve of discovery.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.250
In this way,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:52.630
Broken can provide the required framework for ensuring that robotic storms operate under a

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.180
specific legal regulation,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:00.230
has become mainstream and get integrated into the human society that it can be said that

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.380
blocked in technology could be a game changer for the mass adoption off the storm.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.490
Robotic systems The um,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.830
allegation of these two upcoming technologies can open doors for new technological

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.650
advancements,

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.650
even new business models that we can't even imagine today.
