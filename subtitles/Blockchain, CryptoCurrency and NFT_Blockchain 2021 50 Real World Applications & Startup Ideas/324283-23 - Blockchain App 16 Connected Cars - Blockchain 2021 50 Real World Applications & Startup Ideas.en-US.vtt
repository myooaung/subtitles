00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
the future belongs to connected cars.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.580
Connected cars can communicate.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.690
Why are two devices on can enable vehicle to vehicle communication throughout the devices?

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.750
These cars can connect to traffic that the location on travel conditions.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.150
But there is still time.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Then these connected cars will be available for mass adoption,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.800
as there are still many critical issues that need to be addressed before making them

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.250
available for Masses,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.550
One of the biggest challenge that bothers thes connected cars is security.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.050
The more they're connected to our two devices,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.040
the more they become susceptible to cyber attacks and a blocking blocked in.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.730
Has the ability to save got the information exchange through Iot devices This,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.060
making them resistant against any attack where shorts,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.920
shoes Let's see how block to work for connected cars in a connected cars.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.520
There's Martins is that can signal I wanted about damaged roads,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.550
damaged bridges and even about the breakdown of the vehicle in such scenarios.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.840
Didn't seem from senses.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.450
Need to be secured at all the times because any hacking activity on this data can even cost

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.150
lives.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.770
Therefore,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.050
integrating data derived from my auntie devices reflection is very critical for making it

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.680
secure and resistant to hacking vehicle to vehicle connectivity,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.150
as the name suggests,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.960
allows connected vehicles to communicate with each other on the route by sharing data about

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.550
speed road conditions etcetera.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.920
This technology provides great promise in reducing vehicle accidents on traffic conditions

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.750
on the roads.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.050
But if the device is responsible for vehicle to vehicle connectivity get hugged.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.650
The consequences can be quite tires.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.250
To avoid any such mishaps,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.250
blocking can provide the required safety and security to the data so that hackers cannot

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.150
view alter the data collected by these devices.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.570
Similarly,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.980
for driverless cars,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.920
data hacking can be disastrous in driverless cars is been blocked in to provide the much

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.710
needed safety net to make,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.920
it said a secure vehicle infotainment system provided or do we do experience for the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.850
cartridges?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.050
God on a nature subscribe to these infotainment services provided by various providers

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.540
blocking and provided great application In this scenario,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.960
s well block tin can enable vehicle owners to do in car payments for infotainment services

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.030
like movies,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.490
APS and other services based on pre defined contracts.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.250
Imagine a scene at you.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.860
You have to pay for your car insurance based on how much you actually use your car rather

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.750
than on a set of pre defined insurance policy conditions.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.350
Blockchain technology can help insurance companies to create post next vehicle insurance

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.350
contracts based on actual driver behaviour.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.260
Connecticut can capture information on driver location,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.650
DR Duration,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.650
mileage of the vehicle vehicle speed on other information like accident history of the car

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.820
on Blockchain provides a foolproof means for collecting this data on delivering it in a

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.850
secure on unalterable manner to the insurance companies.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.350
This will make the cost of insurance premiums more fear,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.950
and you will pay as you drive or how you drive.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.660
Additionally,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.040
through smart contracts,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.450
automatic payment of insurance premiums can be directly executed.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.320
Another interesting thing that blocked in and I are taken to is automatic order placing for

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.670
repairing any part of the car and then releasing automatic payment for the services

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.570
rendered in such a system.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.850
Senses in the car would first detect the need for repairs off a particular part.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.900
After this David Comtech nearby supplies for replacement parts fallen by fixing an

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.620
appointment with the technician for service interviews and verse.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.760
Repairing is done.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.210
Smart contracts will get executed,

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.050
which will automatically presents the respective payment for the services rendered.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.160
Smile Parking is in other radio that can be targeted.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.590
Toe the integration off,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.750
blocked in an i t.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.730
In this system,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.550
I distances will first located vacant space in the parking lot and once the car is part de

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.760
Ville,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.750
even calculate the duration for which the card remains Parkdale.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.620
Additionally,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290
during the payment phase,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.050
Smart contract will get executed and automated payouts will be done on the basis of the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.650
parking time calculated by the senses.
