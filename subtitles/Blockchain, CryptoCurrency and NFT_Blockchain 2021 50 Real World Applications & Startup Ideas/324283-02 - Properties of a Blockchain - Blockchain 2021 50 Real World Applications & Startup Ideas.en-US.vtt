00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
we as individuals and businesses in direct with a lot of other businesses and service

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.050
providers online and offline on a daily basis.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.650
We buy clothes only the import medicines from other parts of the world.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.670
We usually more financial and banking services in such a scenario,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.460
where everything is available at your fingertips except the trust for the other party.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.850
How do you validate authenticity off the clothes that you go online?

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.450
Or how do you know that the medicines you imported are real and not some cheap counterfeit

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.450
?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.090
And how will you know that your financial and personal later is safe and is not getting

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.550
hacked by some hacker sitting in some part of the vote?

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.650
There has always been in dire need of a system that can assure us that whatever we're

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.900
buying is authentic.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.750
What our data were sharing is safe and secure.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.880
There has always been a need of a system that is reliable and robust,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.630
such that trust is no longer a barrier for businesses and individuals for getting things

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.000
done.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.150
The solution to all of these pain points lies in the Blockchain technology.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.450
You might have heard about various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin eater people etcetera.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.850
And all of these great preferences are powered by broke in.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.860
Let's first discuss where exactly is a blocked in?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.550
And how can it solve all the issues that we discussed some time back?

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.450
Blocked in is a temper proof distributed digital ledger.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.040
This digital ledger is safe,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.850
secure,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.460
transparent and decentralised with simply means that it is not controlled by a single

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.150
authority.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.050
Bloating has gained a lot of popularity recently.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.030
It has been cleared to be a game changer and has been even referred to as the Internet of

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.150
value by many of the industry exports.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.970
The invention of blocked in technology can be compared to the invention off Will Moto and

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.950
Internet that changed the world.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.750
It has been predicted that blocked in technology will rule the next decade.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.360
One of the oldest and most successful applications are blocked in his Bitcoin,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.850
and many of us might even confuse built Quinn as equal it with a Blockchain.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.260
But the truth is blocked.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.150
It is the technology that powers Bitcoin has many more applications beyond Bitcoin before

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
jumping to its real world applications.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.440
It is very crucial to first understand how a blocked in books for the ease of understanding

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.070
like us.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.270
Understand it through example of an excessive.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.070
We have taken example of exercise it with the basic assumption that most off you would have

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.300
worked with an exercise it either in your school projects,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.850
company projects or personal projects.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.600
So in our example,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.800
the excess it can be assumed to be approaching this exercise.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.150
It is initiated over a large network of computers,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.950
these computers having a copy of the exercise it or blocked in our effort to his notes.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.550
Every node on the network has access to the same sheet or blocked whenever a transition

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.420
gets executed over the network,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.840
the exception gets updated automatically on every computer on the network.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.140
These transactions get a really separate shifts in the access it or separate blocks in the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.890
bloating blow,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.730
totally secure pro cryptography,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.530
thus making it nearly impossible for hackers to hack it and tempered with the data inside

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.850
it.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.790
Now let us look at the features and properties of bloating that makes it to table for such

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.050
a wide area of industries.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.050
The centralization is one of the most critical component of Blockchain.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.060
It has been even viewed as a revolutionary technology that will be centralized over the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.560
centralization simply means story valuable assets like your data money documents in a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.750
network that can then be easily exist from anywhere in the world over dented through this

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.010
decentralized technology I use,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.320
it has direct control over his asset.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.670
Why his private keep I use?

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.400
It can also easily transferees as sit toe anyone at any point of time from anywhere in the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.750
world.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.200
This feature of decentralization eliminates the need to rely on any third party on

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.750
Mittleman.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.790
Put these transactions this cutting down the high transaction fees charged by these tired

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.050
by the service providers.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.230
The mean,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.520
rational behind this concept is took place your trust in the network rather than in a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.650
single cent less body like a bank for the government.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.500
Now let's look at the benefits off a decentralised system are decently system.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.920
Shift the power back to the users as the other ones controlling all of their data and

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.340
transactions are decently.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.650
System is very difficult to hack and is also not prone to failure.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.900
As there is no central point in such a system,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.000
it can better survive the malicious cyber attack and accidental failures as the data

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.630
doesn't recite with 1/3 party.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.350
This eliminates the possibility off data temporary and misuse of the data.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.900
Further,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.000
the moving these third back this from the equation lowers the transaction costs

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.220
significantly in a decent lead system,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.850
the processing time for transactions is reduced to minutes.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.360
Additionally,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.600
these transactions can be processed at any point of time at any day of the U irrespective

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.290
off any festival holiday,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.950
etcetera.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.280
The deal is made in a public.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.850
Blockchain are visible to all the parties on the network dust,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.850
making them transfer.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.540
Distributed Ledger is the second critical feature that makes a bloke in so powerful and

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.150
effective.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.300
The word distributed ledger is composed of two tons distributed and legend.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.750
Ledger,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.030
as the name suggests,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.230
is the record of all transactions and distributed means that the letter is shared with

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.750
every person on the same network.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.210
The distributed ledger contains record of each and every transaction that took place over

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.990
the network,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.380
and every north of the network has access to a copy of this updated letter.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.680
Any updates or changes in the ledger.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.140
I reflected in almost real time in all the copies of the legend across the neck.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.730
Now let's discuss some of the key advantages off such a distributed system for the

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:45.040
stakeholders involved are distributed system makes it easier to track the movement of goods

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.040
,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.750
as the same letter is shared across all the users on the network.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.440
This is one of the main reasons why many big companies have started integrating blocks in

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.120
technology in their supply chain.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.720
All the transactions are recorded on one single letter,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.170
which makes it easier to manage,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.850
view,

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.250
prayerful and verify the transactions.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.080
In simple terms,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.850
it produces the complexity involved in managing multiple edges.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.030
Once the data has been recorded inside,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.550
a bloke in it becomes nearly impossible to change it,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.620
thus making it that proof and immutable to back understand the concept of mutability.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.750
Let us take the example of an enemy.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.320
Once you share a document on an email with a group of your friends,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.650
you can't take it back.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.880
The only way to do this is to us all of your friends who believe that email,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.250
which is quite difficult.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.800
This is exactly how in mutability works in the block.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.090
Tonight.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:50.760
A new book is created after every transaction that contains all the relevant information

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.750
off that Pantex.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.290
The bloke is then sent to each note,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.340
which verifies the block and verse.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.640
The verification is done.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.460
The blow gets added to the broken.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:06.750
This verification and validation of bloops by these participating notes his court consensus

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:06.750
.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.330
We have dedicated a separate lecture for discussing the off the most famous consensus

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.720
mechanism used today,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.040
namely proof of work and proof of state before understanding how blocked in sold the

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.320
problem of double spending.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.050
Let us first understand where the bus spending actually means.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:30.250
It is simply there is that a user will spend the same currency units place.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.750
Number spending is a potential Lupul specifically applicable.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.950
It'll digital currencies,

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.590
unlike physical currencies,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.280
are digital.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.770
Currency consists off digital information,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.960
which can be reproduced or replicated easily in case of digital currency.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.190
A currency holder can make a copy of the digital token.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.150
He will now have two copies of the same token.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.950
He can send one token to emergent while keeping the Internet open with himself.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.900
This was one of the very serious concerns,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.950
a bit quite initially,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:08.350
because there was no central authority to verify that it broke and he spent only ones to

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.690
understand this better Like a steak.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.750
A real life scenario.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.550
Suppose you went on a trip with your friend and click this for the human body.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.540
He asked you to share his photo with him towards that You shared this photo on his demand.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.590
But now there are two copies of the same photo.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.550
When is with him and one is with you.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:33.660
This is a classical example for understanding the issue off double spending in traditional

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.820
online transactions.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.850
Banks are the centralized authorities that and show that there is no double spending

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:45.360
blocked in being decentralised formed a solution for double spending through the consensus

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.950
mechanism.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:53.160
Consensus mechanism requires users cavorting value transactions and only then these

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.420
transactions get appended.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.090
Totally display.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.350
Let us understand it to an example.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.740
There are three persons free,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:06.770
lighter and meant Laura has one big con widow Lina sense that we're going to feet

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.200
simultaneously.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.250
Let us another transaction and send the same record to match as well.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.760
The second transaction will be rejected by the participating notes.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.530
Let us understand how every transaction before getting committed to the Blockchain is

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.450
verified against the letter records by the notes.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.830
So in the first case.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.750
When Laura sends money to fill,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.740
the transaction will be validated against the ledger,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.800
which we show that Lila has one between with her.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.890
That means that she can transfer her one bit Quinto Phil.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.150
That's making it a valid transaction.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.250
But in the second transaction,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.890
which ladder does to met when the transaction is validated against the ledger,

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:54.640
it gets rejected as there is no become left with lighter so she can't make any transaction

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.210
toe met.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.150
Thus Metacritic the problem of double spending.
