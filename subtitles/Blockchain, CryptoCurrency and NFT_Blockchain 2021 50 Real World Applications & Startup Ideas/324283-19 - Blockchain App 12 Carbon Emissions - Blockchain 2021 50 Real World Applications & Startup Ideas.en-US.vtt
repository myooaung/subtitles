00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
carbon emissions need to change in the environment,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.650
which results in serious health consequences for us.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.620
According to the U S Environmental Protection Agency,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.890
carbon emissions in the form of carbon dioxide make up more than 80% of the emitted

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.250
greenhouse gases.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.160
These carbon emissions raise global temperature by trapping solar energy in the atmosphere

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.160
.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.770
This internal alters weather patterns and what is the place for the changes?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.630
A growing season for food drops and traders.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.250
Coastal communities as chances off floods increase with rising sea level,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.790
rising sea levels can also cause saltwater to infiltrate some fresh water systems.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.450
That's increasing the need for desalination on more vigorous drinking water treatment.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.420
In summary,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.810
it is very important to fight against global mommy and reduce these carbon emissions for

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.450
better and healthier tomorrow.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.710
Sustainability initiatives are gaining momentum as organizations are becoming increasingly

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.250
interested in monitoring their business practices,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.350
and many companies have even started recognizing that sustainability is beneficial for all

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.350
.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.150
Sustainability initiatives are not only good for the planet,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.480
but they're also greatly toe boost the brand image as these initiators are getting noticed

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.950
and appreciated by both consumers and investors.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.830
The search shows that supply chains are often responsible for last year off a company's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.580
overall greenhouse gas emissions with transport,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.150
are shipping being the major culprit?

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.560
In fact,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.880
the greenhouse gas emissions through supply chain is four times higher than the company's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.150
director operations.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.020
Let's understand how carbon emissions are calculated in the current scenario,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.660
but these businesses and organizations organizations first need to identify all the carbon

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.890
emission sources like transportation emissions from electricity consumption xvc emissions

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.250
on from other business operations.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.750
Then they're quite to calculate the emissions from these sources.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.780
This is calculated by first noting down the energy consumption but every individual process

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.650
off the company.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.630
Then this reading is multiplied by the standing conversion factor to calculate the carbon

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.550
footprints.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.240
For example,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.050
electricity grid provides the emission factor.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.180
Take a standard amount of carbon dioxide that would be released.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.550
Venue Hugh's one unit off the energy.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.950
This value would be different for defense grids.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.880
Similarly,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.250
every fuel has its own emission factor,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.580
as you can use this value to calculate the carbon emissions from different modes of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.450
transport business operations etcetera.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.040
For example,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.760
there six conversion factors for calculating emissions from one digit off patrol or using

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.550
one litre of diesel as a few.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.500
After calculating the emissions from all the sources,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.250
they're all added up to find out the total emissions.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.660
But the problems that companies phase in calculating the carbon emissions took these

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.150
methods may be,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.490
since the calculation of carbon footprints is a manual process and request human

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.350
intervention chances off errors increase.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.060
Besides this,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.080
it is a time consuming process more ago.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.550
It is an approximate method as the real time carbon emissions are not calculated,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.470
but they're calculated on the basis off fuel,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.240
electricity etcetera consumed,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.350
using the standard conversion factor for each different fuel or electricity used.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.010
Now let's understand how block shin on Dowty senses can solve this problem off.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.470
Calculating carbon emissions security There will be two types of five D senses to calculate

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.650
carbon emissions.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.030
First,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.550
I just not me taken.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.950
Measure power consumption by the companies.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.400
This really is the pain of companies.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.960
Mann Pablo to take readings manually,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.250
which can be prone to menu letters.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.570
Second,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.860
i D Sensor can directly extent information with environment and capture carbon emissions.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.880
He did my company's operations,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.150
or during the transportation etcetera.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.030
Then they collected from my senses will be stored on the Blockchain as soon as a platform

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.420
will receive the data.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.420
Smart contracts,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.560
we get executed and we can call it the carbon footprints based on factors including type of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.570
electricity generator on energy sources like diesel or coal meters Efficiency Conversion

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.360
factor Cos Total fuel consumption,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.150
etcetera.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.870
Thus,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.180
smile contracts will help to create a reliable and authenticated carbon footprint report

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.050
for a company.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.940
The company's carbon footprint report will be stored on Block two in the Temple.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.390
Ruth Mandel for the blotting can enable the companies to prepare their carbon footprint

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.600
report with more accuracy on back to in reduced time.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.050
Three.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.990
In fact,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.840
carbon trading approach has been initiated.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.160
True.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.720
Blocked in video inundation to control pollution level by providing incentives to the

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.450
company's achieving emission reductions.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.230
In this case,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.250
a carbon credit will be given to all organizations that grants of business to emit a

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.350
certain amount of carbon emissions.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.980
All of these carbon credits would be maintained on a block to these carbon credits on the

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.950
block tin can even be traded between two companies.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.100
In such a system,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.500
any transaction off carbon credits between the companies will be recorded on the digital

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.460
ledger in a transparent and immutable mando for joke.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.280
Then carbon credits will be transferred from one company's account to another.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.320
Automatic payment will be done toe that company in return for these carbon credits using

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.450
smart contracts.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.640
Say,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.610
for example,

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.680
there are two companies Envy,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.050
which have their own carbon bullets.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.210
His company is under its carbon cap and company be his older,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.080
its carbon cap the company can sell.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.750
It's hopeless carbon credits to Company B.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.650
Who says additional carbon credits for the carbon emissions?

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.320
This can be a vato incentivize companies that low carbon emissions on it can become a

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.250
second revenue stream For these companies,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:05.200
this seconded wanted of carbon treating is that it will and grace the organizations to

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.550
adopt carbon friendly energy practices that can reduce their carbon footprint.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.960
In fact,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.740
I'll distances can be attached vehicles that can track the real time carbon emissions from

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.710
these vehicles,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.090
and this information can then be stored on the block tune.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.750
Do he sure better and saving my route.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.610
If carbon emissions exceed the stipulated limit,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.450
the smart contracts will get executed and the Lord will be sent to the respective person or

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.470
department in every country.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.850
Carbon emission norms are regulated by the respective pollution control regulatory body.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:48.570
Vehicles are checked for the emissions and if emissions are within a specified limit,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.650
our certificate this issue to the vehicle been generally comes with an expiry do't.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.300
However,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.600
this system has its own loopholes.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.450
The system only takes for the admissions on the date of the test.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.060
Also the emissions from vehicles.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.050
My change based on the age and condition of the vehicle,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.670
other sectors,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:15.920
like adulteration off you etcetera might increase the pollution temporarily to an

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.250
unacceptable level.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.170
Therefore,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:25.030
if I take carbon senses are attached to the vehicles and information about carbon emissions

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.770
is stored on the shared ledger.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:33.050
It will help regulatory bodies to keep a better track of carbon emissions by vehicles.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:38.120
The regulatory body can even issued warnings to vehicle owners.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.650
Host carbon emissions exceeded the stipulated limits.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.280
In this way,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.590
a strict pollution check regime can be implemented on the concrete steps can be taken to

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.150
towards a healthier environment
