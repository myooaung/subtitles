00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
Blokhin is poised,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.750
retained the state of school off the entertainment industry.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.050
The first challenge that artists in this industry face is the label problem.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.140
In the current scenario,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.150
it is very difficult for an artist to put out this music without a big label behind him.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.760
He has to rely on these big Labor's to record,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.150
distribute and monetize his music.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.650
The same is true for movies.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.950
It is nearly impossible for artists,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.510
but distribute a movie or a TV show without production.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.050
Companies are movie studios.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.860
Would every have platforms like YouTube,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.820
Spotify,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.070
Netflix put distribute videos,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.710
music,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.930
movies and TV shows,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.650
respectively?

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.690
These platforms actors,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.350
mediators and are responsible for collecting advertising and subscription revenues and then

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.410
shared these revenues with the artists.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.640
But even with these platforms,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.350
the content providers are not fairly compensated for the content.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.040
They're always looking out for a more transparent system that can fairly compensate them

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.050
for the heart book.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.330
Blockchain technology has the potential to address this issue and bring about a more

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.450
transparent system toe back to compensate these artists.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210
Once implemented,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.730
the artists can stolen Digitize co pays off the music on the block,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.890
then they can directly sell their music to the end customers without the need off these big

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.250
labels and publishers,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.680
they can rightfully control the pricing off their creation,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.060
which is not physical.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.220
In today's scenario there from pricing till distribution,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.350
everything is decided by the parent labels or these mediator platforms.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.950
The other advantage of Blockchain is that it can make my copayments visible.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.260
Imagine buying a single track off music for 80 cents,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.330
nor dust that you could even by a fraction of the track you like.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.560
For example,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.990
if you want a 10 seconds,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.860
keep off a particular music track for your advertisement,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.900
then there is no need to buy the whole tech with the traditional payment systems.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.830
This is not physical because he's off.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.300
Using credit card for these transactions will be much more than the height of the clip

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.650
itself.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.950
But with blocks in technology,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.550
it is possible to buy affection of the check.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.390
Why?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.050
To pay money for the complete wreck when you can buy affection off it.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.720
Another challenge with only content his lack of clarity off the intellectual and digital

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.050
rights for that contract.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.080
In many cases,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.950
it is nearly impossible to know about the creators of a digital content.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.110
And you do.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.730
This isn't only sport.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.150
If I had to pay a fact fine in order to settle a lawsuit over unpaid royalties last year.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.370
Even after practicing a particular content,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.380
say a song,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.780
it is north here.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.150
If that content can be modified to be used in a personal or commercial work,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.790
simply put,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.960
there is no way to ascertain,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.690
the uses writes.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.440
For that country Blocked in technology can provide the solution to protect the intellectual

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.710
rights.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.550
Often artist.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.620
Any transaction related to a digital creation,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.480
including the creation itself,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.950
will be recorded on the Blockchain.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.250
What these off understanding?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.710
Let's take the example off a piece of music as the content.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.550
In our case,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.450
the music will protect with a unique digital i d man.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.700
It is stored on the Blockchain,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.350
and whenever a buyer consumes that piece of music,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.480
he can know about its creator and other element details using that unique i d.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.540
Even an artist can also track the consumers who have bought his creation and that 11 right

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.450
for deck music in case any dispute raises.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.610
Because of this transparency in the system,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.950
the sharing off royalty payments to the creators will be much more efficient.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.380
Additionally,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.530
smart contracts can be used to automatically divide the share of the revenue among the very

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.830
side holders of the music,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.800
like composer,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.480
singer,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.060
producer,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.580
director,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.250
ex cetera,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.260
viruses.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.250
Another big problem.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.050
That this industry faces.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.090
Pirated music movies,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.980
etcetera at a big tennis put these artists as their decrease the value of their work and

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.150
nullifies the heart book.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.250
Because of these bayous related issues,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.420
this industry suffers massive losses with the you know,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.550
billions of dollars.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.750
Besides,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.550
it be motivates the artists as well as they don't get a fair share for the heart book and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.200
creation as a possible solution.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.110
These creations can be tagged with unique ID's.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.090
The customer can then scan the I D and can validate the authenticity of the artwork sold to

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.280
him.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.290
Through the Blockchain Grammy winner Emergent Heat,

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.050
a prominent musician has embraced looking.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.980
She tied up with a company named Joe,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.800
who leaves her song on the Italian looking with the implementation of blocks in the artist

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.200
or the Creator has the absolute control over his content,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.580
and he can be paid directly instead of going to attain off intermediaries for sharing his

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.820
creative talented doubled
