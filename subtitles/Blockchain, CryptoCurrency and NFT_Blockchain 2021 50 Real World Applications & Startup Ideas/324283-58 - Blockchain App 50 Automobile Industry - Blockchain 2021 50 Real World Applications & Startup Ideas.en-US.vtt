00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
the automotive industry is a complex ecosystem,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.130
with multiple parties involved in the design,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.100
production,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.300
distribution,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.230
marketing,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.140
selling,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.330
finance and servicing off vehicles in the automotive sector.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.810
There several key E.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.960
R.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.230
P and man fiction systems that ingrate vehicle data on control them.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.650
Infection process.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.940
These systems must communicate with hundreds off systems downstream,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.550
which rely on data feeds to perform their functions.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.480
The implementation off election There would be a greater transparency in the flow of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.850
information between the different parties and systems involved.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.420
There is a huge problem.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.460
Authentic looking but inferior fate parts entering in the market because off the complex

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.150
supply chain and ending up in the less service centers,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.840
these face feel parts would fail quickly after being installed in cars,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.980
causing reputational damage to the auto Miko and risking lives off the customers as these

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.150
fake butts under before causing accidents,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.630
for example,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.280
demanding a scenario.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850
Their brakes and airbags are feet,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.750
but with the implementation of locked in,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.650
this issue can be tackled.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.450
Each vehicle part,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.190
including the spare parts,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.850
will have its own unique I d and it will be registered on the block tune.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490
Therefore,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.700
it will be possible for the car Manufacturers Car Service Center and custom to verify the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.860
authenticity.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.500
Entries.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.710
The original supplier on my infection date off the spare parts through the block to an

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.290
automobile manufacturing plant must coordinate effectively with third party logistics and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.630
transportation companies to ensure time to live free off orders to different suppliers

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.650
around the world.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.340
Blocking connected with coyote senses and smart devices can provide accurate and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.090
transparent enter and view off the order,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.900
location,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.050
status and other useful information to all the stakeholders involving the supply tea.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.090
As a result,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.190
the oil implant will be ableto planets production schedule more accurately and improve the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.950
traceability off parts that it delivers to its customers.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.520
Smart contracts can really be a boom for vehicle owners for processing off payments,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.050
for instance,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.720
at the tollbooths or after fueling your carpet patroon.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.210
The smart contracts can get executed and automatically payments can be released.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.710
Do the respective authority or organisation Similarly venal electric vehicle Oh no charges

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.520
his vehicle at the third party starting station Smart contract can be executed and payment

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.950
can return versus the charging system.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.790
For though I distances can sense the parts that need to be repaired.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.480
Appoint authenticated technician for repeating and after that smart contract can get

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.350
executed on the payment can be automatically processed toe The technician.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.680
Blocking can enable you to pay car insurance based on how much you actually use your car

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.220
rather than on a set of define insurance policy conditions on driver profile,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.650
including my discovered by vehicle.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.320
Economical usage of vehicle on accidental history is securely stored on the block.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.170
Tune Locked in provides a foolproof means of collection off the strata and deliver it in a

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.310
secure and unalterable man.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.250
No to the insurance companies.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.050
This can reduce the cost of insurance premiums,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.120
and you will pay as you drive or how you drink.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.820
For though in case of any accident,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.090
I'm distances will record and take images off the accident.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.980
Will says the damage parts I store all this information on the block to on with this

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.820
immutable record available on the block in It would be much easier for the insurers to

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.900
assess the damage and release the insurance clean.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.100
Such a transparent and fear system will be beneficial for both and shorter and the customer

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.280
they're times then.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.970
Automobile manufacturers need to recall their vehicles if any problem is detected in

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.250
delivered vehicles,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.450
which could affect the vote on travel safety of the customers.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.230
However,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.500
because most manufacturers are not able to uniquely identify every part in every vehicle

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.090
salt,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.710
they need to issue the recall for a specific model and modern you,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.450
which can include several tens off thousands of vehicles.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.550
Even if the defective parts are installed only in a few cars,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.550
this process is a loss off money to the manufacture.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.510
Moreover,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.550
it results in disturbing thousands of customers.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.340
There is also a concern that sometimes recall notification does not reach the owners,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.830
and in case the car has been resold by the original buyer,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.650
it becomes a daunting task to reach the second or third own off the car.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.650
But with the implementation of block to this issue can be sorted out.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.560
Blocking will enable the karma infectious that uniquely identify every single part on that

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.200
will save a huge amount of time and money.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.150
In the even off of vehicle recall,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.120
the manufacturer will know exactly which specific vehicles are having the defective parts

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.290
fitted into them,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.330
and health they will be able to issue specifically calls for individual V.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.450
I n numbers.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.190
Also try blockage in it will be feasible for them to track the recall staters off the

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.510
affected vehicles.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.500
For instance,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.730
how many vehicles a received for repairing and how many vehicles a repaired on different is

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.350
their task off regulated reporting required to be done to the government?

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.730
My Lady is one of the most significant perimeters while assessing the condition off a pre

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.450
owned car.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.310
No mileage equals higher price and high mileage equals lower price.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.300
That's how it works my list.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.450
George is very common by selling pre owned vehicles,

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:39.350
or the Mito is generally tempered by the colonias by selling their vehicles to conceal high

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.150
mileage.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.200
To combat this automative short,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.800
there will be a car connected device that will record the mileage off the car,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.170
and we'll start this Information on the digital led to in such a scenario before Bangor

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.540
Secondhand vehicle,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.440
you can verify the displayed mileage Vitor information recorded on the Blockchain.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.950
This blocking and solve is a source to verify the veracity off a car's mileage.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.430
Besides,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.340
via buying a second hand car,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.790
you will always be able to check every information about the car.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.580
Like its previous owners,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.310
its provenance repair history or any of the deter that can help you toward the wrong,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.050
which is.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.350
Most of the car owners drive their cars alone to vote,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:35.560
thus putting an extra burden on the pocket under environment blocking enable vehicle owners

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.110
to monetize their trips.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.650
As for the defined smart contracts,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:46.990
users and car sharing providers very adjusted on a Blockchain platform until identities

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.950
will be verified on the block genital.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.370
The black phone can be used to securely exchange stater,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.310
including the location of the vehicle on demand.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.940
It is cause for my and payment.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.970
It is for the user.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:06.160
The deal senses in the car Villacorta initial coordinates off the boarding point,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.020
and we'll also capture the dropping point coordinates after completion off the trip Smile

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.250
contract would be executed and payment will be automatically deducted from the user's

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.680
account on the basis off the distance.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.810
Traveled blocking will also enable the easy renting or leasing off the cars.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.030
In this case,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.930
smart contracts will be executed and payment will be done.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.430
Verse.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.150
The vehicle has been returned
