Some of the biggest challenges that the little advertising industry face includes fraud,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.750
lack of transparency and outdated payment processes.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
Advertisers are constantly worried about the usage off their money.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.860
Buy the ad agencies as their digital advertising space is completely open.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.870
They have no clarity over the flow off their money.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.600
And they don't know whether the money spent on these advertisements is giving them any

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.870
meaningful benefits on even the X.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.450
That of Ute doesn't guarantee that,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.900
actually,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.750
user sold them.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.290
There are many businesses which try on providing kicks and views.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.250
Toe de Zet.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.590
They have boats which are programmed to behave like actual users so as to increase the ad

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.450
impressions.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.150
So all in all,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.790
advertisers are desperately looking for a solution that can connect them with their

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.880
potential customers in the transparent and much more efficient manner for back

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.570
understanding.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.630
Off the solution proposed It is very crucial to first understand how the traditional

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.430
digital advertising industry works the advertiser,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
or simply put the brand that wants to reach its customers,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330
hire digital ad agency,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.050
look after its at Campi.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.690
The brand has a specific target or goal that it wants to achieve through this ad campaign.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.860
The brand pays the ad agency for both creating and distributing that little add content to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.050
its target customers.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.300
The money spent on creating the ad content is referred to as known.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.400
Working spent Why the money spent on distributing the add content to the specified target

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.350
audience is known as working spent in their digital advertising industry.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.380
The ad agency,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.490
then piers that add content and takes approval of the brand on the content was the content

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.260
is approved.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.340
The identity buys expresses for at in countries to post additional content,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.660
whether desire to other customers consume the content now,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.080
while buying expenses and evidence.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.050
He has two options directly by experts from the publisher.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.740
In this agreement,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.200
the identity by the specific fixed location.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.450
When a publisher site,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.470
a publisher site,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.980
can be a little magazine and even people site for any of the website,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.940
they're the target audience comes or they can my expenses through an exchange platforms and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.300
Eric.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.690
Since platform lists a number of publishers and in one tree that is then bored by these

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.650
agencies,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.430
these eggs,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.990
spaces or in country listed by at exchange platforms are generally allocated on the basis

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.550
of really embody by these ad agencies.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.390
This really temporally toe by these expenses is also known as programmatic buying.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.450
In technical terms,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.240
there is a long chain off intermediaries in this process,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.030
especially in the case of programmatic actor pledging the supply till,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.910
in our case,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.700
includes an agency,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.870
the trading desk,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.100
the mind side platform and exchange supplies.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.770
That platform publisher and finally the audience do this land this apply it in information

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.970
becomes inaccessible on the branch.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.290
Money spent on the edge defect towards in the team have hidden fees there are fraught and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.850
there is no clarity on the authenticity off the traffic.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.120
According to an internal industry report,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.080
55% of the money spent on programmatic ad platform goes to the intermediaries and the tech

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.600
platform,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.150
while the publisher only gets the remaining 45%.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.250
Simply put,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.040
the real value that the brand gets is only 45% off what they spent on the problematic at

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.550
platform.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.240
Further,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.150
many of these publishers are for teachers who are involved in selling fake impressions,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.350
the partner with businesses who have programmed boards to create fake clicks and traffic in

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:07.710
order to do the event in the US alone in 2070 their digital advertising industry lost $6.5

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.310
billion.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.190
Put these fraudulent activities.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.760
Therefore,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.050
the need of the hour is a transparent system.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.750
This transparent system will empower the brand who validate that the ad agency is working

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.650
with a publisher that has genuine Duffy.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.950
And that is why cloaked in and based on advertising is a match made in heaven.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.080
Here is how blow Tin can bring in the require transparency in the system.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.400
A bloke in this marketplace will be created for the publishers and brands who wanted under

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.950
campy.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.340
On this,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.350
the brand or the higher agency will put their digital ad content.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.360
This content can be in the form of a banner,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.650
video or text.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.860
The brand can also specify the audience group.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.660
They want to talk it like their interests,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.640
region language.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.760
And they can all set a budget as well that they want to invest in that campaign.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.750
Not publishers will use this platform who discovered these vans and call their content.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.650
And when the publishers site is visited by a user,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.570
are relevant.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.530
Advil were displayed to him based on his interest,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.450
language and other preferences.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.350
In such a scenario,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.420
ah brand will reach the desired customer,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.520
and at the same time a customer will see a more relevant advertisement because of black

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.840
family.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.150
Based on the shared ledger,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.850
the brand can easily track entries every click and view on his act posted on the publishers

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.350
site.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.750
The brand can even verify the placement of the ad impressions exactly using this platform.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.330
The information is decentralized on transparent,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.730
so there is no possibility of data manipulation and the brand can ensure that it's funny is

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.450
getting spent on the actual ISSERS.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:56.110
Lack of transparency in the expenditure has always been a cause of concern for the

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.550
advertisers or brains,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.220
but with blocked in,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.180
this lack of clarity can be eliminated and they can clearly know they're there.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.450
But it is getting spent.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.550
And where exactly is their content getting advertised?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.890
A bloke in based supply platform can be created through Packer the challenge of lack of

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.550
transparency in the adamantly buying poses,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.610
as discussed earlier,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.780
the brand doesn't have clear visibility on the money spent on each intermediary.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.060
The Blockchain based platform.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.190
We provide the brand with a complete bill off how the money spent on the is distributed

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.610
among the various players involved.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.580
There will be transparent crosses with money taken by each party.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.600
We've been known to everybody involved in that block connector.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.850
By implementation off such a transparent and immutable system,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:50.470
brands can ensure that they are being fear and accurate chances after implementation of the

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.750
decent less platform.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.950
Every intermediary in the exit plated network will receive his portion of the expend.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.220
And there won't be any way to impose evident fee,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.750
as in today's our big System,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.630
this vessel.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.340
The problem of digital media spent disappearing in the media supply team rather than on the

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.580
actual content data is the new oil.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.260
It plays a critical role for companies to make informed decisions that can affect their

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.050
profitability.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.880
Currently,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.050
this data is captured from the behavior patterns of customers both online and offline.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.350
This data is then consumed to create relevant advertisements to your these customers.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.750
But many time these eggs field to entice the customs.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.740
But with location,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.850
this is going to change and the ads are going to be more effective with Blockchain,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.260
consumers can share their data and get compensated for it.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.050
At the same time,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.490
with a liability off direct data companies can create much more targeted and effective

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.420
advertisements,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.850
which in turn can create a positive impact on their bottom line.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.380
Let's see how this users that that can be collected in a safe,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.730
secure and reliable manner using bloating the data will be kept it from various sources

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.910
like social media,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.080
smart variables.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.950
I only devices installed in homes and other gadgets.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.850
This uses data we re posted on a Blockchain power data marketplace.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:21.910
Everybody of data will be hosted on this marketplace after they users consent and for every

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.990
bit of data shared,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.620
the consumer will be compensated,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:30.750
according this makes it a fair about him for the users and further incentivizes them to

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.550
share more off their data in order to get more compensation.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:39.250
This helping companies to create more relevant and targeted a good business.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.490
This would even lead to the creation off more data by consumers.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.530
For instance,

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:50.430
a person who loves taken will post more pictures on Facebook instagram about camping and

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.450
trekking in the hope of selling this data.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.970
This increase,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.070
shearing off data,

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.270
will fill in the missing gaps to give a complete picture of the use of behavior with this

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.020
ocean of data collected on this block to marketplace,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.320
the black form will really be a game changer for these marketers as they can create better

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.350
advertisements to suit the needs of their potential customs.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.230
These better targeted ads believed to a basket and regionally and brand affinity for these

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.450
events and thus an increase Band Equity and Bottomley.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.330
Many regulations,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:23.990
like GDP,

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.150
have been introduced across various industries and sectors.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.250
Fix focuses on privacy and security off the user's data.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.030
In such a scenario,

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.240
blocked in technology provides the perfect solution there.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.050
Volumes of consumer data can be securely stored using this technology.
